game\nUm\nI feel like breezes under appreciated it you know you just look at those numbers in ... and you forget you know that\nTo be great for that high you for that amount of time to be you raise the bar or you you set the bar and that's pretty incredible what he's been able to do I would probably go Peyton Manning if I had him for his entire career ...\nForty two thousand nine eastern ... he was sixty percent passer forty two hundred yards thirty three touchdowns in seven interceptions is one of the top three seasons of fires courage forty\nNow but the rules have changed you know ... ... you know when ... first started out when he took over for ... you know the the game was different back then far more physical get away with a lot more on defense we've changed everything about the events now ... ... would you check the number of\nHelmet infractions that we've had so far this season Terry McCauley who is a former NFL official he now works for NBC's there are rules analyst he's going to join is coming up but this was supposed to be beam being rule this was the big change lowering your helmet\nAnd I don't think we've had more than a handful we gotta make lower for yeah for penalties for long your helmet through four we met in ... there were four roughing the pastor penalties in one game last week\nAnd here we are we're looking at that helmet rule and they missed one on Kareem Hunt on Monday Night\nBut that was supposed to be the big rule here we got to keep an eye on that here's another thing that I don't know if you've noticed this I I've been obsessed with it I don't know why but I'm Michael ... the Seattle line backer he uh of course is going to jail for insider trading\nUh he was found guilty while he was still a member of the Cleveland Browns the browns released him Seattle picked him up and he's been starting he's been playing playing well\nNow I and I wondered how does the NFL allow him to play you got a guy who is he he's convicted he admitted to insider trading and\nI thought well can you put him on the commissioners exempt list and then I heard from the NFL home office said no that's for violent crimes\nOkay can you suspend him know next thing I Know Michael Kendrick is going to be suspended by the NFL so what happened here yeah for the\nNew shouldn't have this done this immediately what what would be the holdup is there some kind of legal reason why they couldn't immediately say you're a you're not playing I Would\nThink if you're a convicted criminal and you're going to prison I may not want you out there on the football field\nOr did they have the right can't the NFL PA say he's currently out of prison he's eligible to play in your support the team should have the right to sign I'm like the sea hawks did why would you take away his livelihood before he goes to prison when he was president ...\nAnd I don't I I don't know if there's any rule that says if you're a convicted criminal or you're going to prison that you can't put on a football uniform I so then I didn't understand why now you can spend it like what happened here in the last two weeks I'm confused yeah France\nWouldn't that be an unwritten rule that if you're a convicted felon regardless of what you did that you shouldn't be able to continue playing in your sport to watch any other job I don't think they'd welcome you're back to the counting from while you're about to go to jail\nWell have you guys seen any I I just saw where he's being suspended I didn't see an explanation by the NFL has\nTo be a written rule that's the point where ... ... it's an unwritten rule if you know if there's there's families that are non violent and this is one of them and if anyone should if they're out should be allowed to play the team wants to employ them okay then how are you suspending\nHim now I don't know yeah see I mean I think that that's a big part of it like Paul just said that there's non violent crimes that that shouldn't be separated from the others you know there's a difference between violent nonviolent crime in in terms of severity and I for the life and they don't understand why he's not allowed to play\nYeah but now you suspend him that's what I was like okay you're not going to suspend him fun you know okay until he has to go to prison fine but now you suspend him this is this is why it's it\nI was baffled by because memory Jimmy has them browns owner no investigation no discipline\nWith what he was accused of and I think he had to pay in like Ninety million dollar fine dizzying you will for a civil judgment against him he's the Vikings owner he was guilty of fraud no investigation no discipline by the NFL said two owners\nKnow disciplined no investigation and then here we have Michael Ken Driggs guilty pled guilty and then he's being suspended by the home office yeah France who\nDoesn't like allowing them to play somehow condoned the behavior is not that big a deal you didn't do it it's not a violent crime you know I don't think it can ... the behavior continue to let them play money is going to lose it in and then did it too it's not like well it's a trial balloon innocent till proven guilty he admitted that he did this and then he's going to just put on it and if that's what the NFL wants but this guy wearing ...\nI don't think they're condoning it I think that's way too strong line there\nThere's probably twenty five teams that don't condone it and inside them yes see I didn't want world that you're not allowed to work anymore because you're waiting\nTo go to jail I don't know I mean I I don't know I ...\nIf you want to let him play fine but my concern was my issue was\nThen you're going to suspend him now like what happened now\nYou're not working at Lehman Brothers he's he's town people yeah like if I'm not sure on Wall street he couldn't work right now he probably there's probably some felony I'm a little more sense yeah if you're a charge Alan I'm guessing you can't trade with the SEC right now but this he's knocking people central yeah I didn't get it I didn't get an answer\nOn that tried to ... you know I'm looking at articles I'm like okay why she suspended\n\nAnd I got to believe the NFL players association is going to go a wait a minute here you allowed him to play now you're not alone in Idaho or confused I'm not sure what changed at a Terry McAuliffe the NFL rules official will join us coming up\nBecause I Do think that you know from what I learned yesterday still trying to piece it altogether that the what we're doing with roughing the ... and you know how do you how do you kind of ease off that a little bit how do you not because I I think these officials just said All right you want to call this rule we're going to call it all the time now\nThis was what you want All right we're going to throw a flag all the time and they've thrown to flag to many flags so Terry will join is coming up we'll check in with a former pitching great

Seventeen lost a Wisconsin most of the players they gave them a break mentally and physically\nMajor a forcible punishing hits and by the way I think ... does fall into that and I'll and the reason is\nHe lowers his head and he actually accelerates\nEnd of the defender and ... and it is it is exactly what they want called for a foul however I Will tell you officials you know as the seasons going on there getting messages there are from from the office as these players are evaluated\nThroughout the course of the season and what I think they're hearing is is that we would like this call but we're not going to downgrade joined it because it's a very difficult call will find during the week\nBut until the officials are evaluate are on these plays that okay this is going to affect\nMy post season if I don't call this I don't think you're going to see very many of these uh they put the words and bracing for contact for runners now and I think I think that's kind of a dog whistle do officials that\nThey ought to run or you can always bail out and not make a call by saying I felt in real time he was bracing for contact clearly not what happened on this flight\nWhat are we looking at the officials with these rubbing the pastor calls it feels like they've been told to call it enforce it and you don't want to get downgraded so it feels like the officials went above and beyond the call of duty or am I reading too much into it\nNo I think that was that was absolutely true in the first three weeks but if if I'm not mistaken there were only four in wait\nWait for it and I think three of them were in one game and only one of the four I Believe was body weight a which was a clear and obvious foul and in the San Francisco charges game uh so\nI I you know it's tough to say after one week whether you know it's because players of adjusted although I Do think that is the case I see a lot of adjustment on defenses players as they hit the quarterbacks now or or or if the referees have have indeed backed off somewhat\nAnd and and they have a little more discretion or a combination there or\nAre you told you know explicitly it protect the quarterback is that\nYes there is no question that is the referees number one priority it has it was in Nineteen Ninety eight in two thousand and one when I became a referee and and it continues into this year there's no question that's their number one priority\nIs this for ratings\nWell I I think it's for you know in in the NFL is an entertainment business and the game is better with the starting quarterback Sam I mean you've got thirty two\nQuarterbacks that are extremely important most of them are the franchise player of the team\nAnd and that's who they want to stay in a gang some teams have really good backups as I think we're seeing with er CJ battered and in San Francisco has been pretty impressive but not every team does and fans want to see the fence they want to see the starting quarterback the guy that that it's really going to make their team exciting and\nThat's that's the way the NFL's operated\nIt feels like I and I know the quarterbacks you know Ben Roethlisberger Aaron Rodgers hey we don't like those ... here but Ben Ben acts like he was knocked down with a you know a ... minute a lightning bolt the other game when he got hit in the helmet\nAnd he goes I may have played that up a little bit feels like if I'm a quarterback\nI can publically say I don't want to be treated differently but if I if I'm trying to win a game I'm gonna work you guys work the ... the entire time so how do you differentiate between what is real and what's not\nWell ... you have to use your experience you know in real time do you see for civil contact do you see a clear violation of the spirit and the intent of the rule\nAnd ... and what the player does his reaction to that ... pretty got to dismiss it pretty much got dismissed that and and and not make a call on on you know duty fake it or or or did he fall or did he you know Hollywood it or or whatever and just deal with the action itself\nBy what what ... what the defender did to the quarterback and it's tough it is tough in real time because you do see players and it's not just the quarterback that the receivers and many times you've seen him throw their hands up\nHave any time that you know the defensive lineman throw his hands up because he thinks he's being held and and trying to buy it at ... every player does it and it's just the officials job to decide did it really happened or is he trying to buy one\nThe best acting quarterback that you ever dealt with um who ... who could really be put on a performance there that you weren't quite sure\n[noise] I I I Want to say Jay color might have been in that in that in that mode a film rivers\nUh might might might fall into that category [laughter] but but really all of them all of them do it I I mean I can I say all of them I I've seen as put this way I've seen everyone do it at least watch ah to be fair\nOr do rash want to do interviews after the game\nNo abs absolutely not [laughter] I mean that is that is one of the worst ideas I think I've ever heard and why why why you interviewed after the game I Wonder if it would make it wouldn't make for great\nGreat television no doubt uh to to you've been under the microscope and have people talking about you and complain about you for three hours and now we're going to further that by\nPutting you under the spotlight without having access to any video and all you're going to do is is is try to justify the fan what you you sane and what you saw in real time and and you may or may not be right so I I don't think it serves any purpose whatsoever ah from from uh being productive and explaining what's ... what's happening\nIn the area you mentioned the magic magic words it's great for TV oh there's we're ... we're in the entertainment business\nBut but the officials are a lot in there they're not supposed to be the ones that that that ... that are attacked and ... that have to have to make that make your story for you\nGood to visit with you save travels to Dallas and a great to catch up with the again Terry thank you for your time thanks for having me Dan Schiller Terry McCauley NBC rules analyst for Sunday Night Football so Notre Dame games I didn't know he's going to name names when it came to great actors they're\nJake Cutler great actor Philip Rivers I get but a J Cutler yeah for the\nBetter they play clock is just like a general number to kind of give you an idea to approximately when you need to snap the ...\nAnd you can't go crazy just because it happened in uh Denver no I understand but I Know my memory is when you heard him say it I saw you or your arms were in the air like oh we got into you know I just\nFound that tracking why bother having a clock if you don't have to adhere to me he even said it's not like an MBA players on why isn't it\nI didn't I don't know that we don't want to call you know the and it doesn't mean anything just let them get the playoff whatever I like it I don't know here's the NFL that is so anal about things that there are certain shoes socks or whatever you can't wear those things like there's so buttoned up with things\nPlay club hug who cares and want to ... not a big deal\nBecause we're almost had somebody out to eat out too but the one was close enough\nTo do that all you don't have to well make contact with any any rules ridiculous yeah but ... but this is the the NFL and that's a play clock\nIt just feels like ... ... it is right there in front of us we get to see it we don't get to see all the holding we don't get to see the pass interference we get to see the play clock we can watch that but\nIt's sort of arbitrary women on the phone when a quarter to\nA soccer decorated within like there's approximately another four or five minutes to an end to the end to the game they don't know when exactly it's going to end will just blow the whistle okay that's the end of the day that which is ridiculous anyway but I Can't believe that when that hit zero it doesn't matter when the ball\nYou would not be bishops said if it didn't happen to the brim you're absolutely right I Can't I Can't believe you said that it that's a general number\nOf by the way like who woke you up\nI I was when he said that that just kind of a ... a guideline to know approximately winter snap the ball and it's a clock goes they go like anything in sports it goes by the second loomed over orange\nHalftime yeah bowling but do you like to the NFL rats are a little loose with where they're not sitting there looking to bust a team every time that that goes to zero and ... and they just buy a a beat\nLet us know lettuce let us in on it this is the first time I answered the first time I ever heard that but let me in on it it's like lead clay Matthews in on what I'm allowed to do and not allowed to do a cream hunk and lower his helmet if a deep friendship player did that he would have been applying for\nQuarterbacks or separate position you've been told by the league protect them at all costs number one priority is what Terry shit\nBut the ... why have the play clock if it's like it's just loosely enforced I ... you know you can have a first down a marker is gonna be loosely enforced here like is it a penalty or not a penalty now I don't want flags ... thrown on every play\nAnd I I understand what he's saying does it really matter\nBut it didn't matter it didn't matter and the chiefs game\nWould that play clock violation it wasn't called robbing the pastor recalls week by week here so far week one Fifteen robbing the past circles week to six weeks three\nThirteen week for five\nAnd seemed to consistent yeah see so if you're following the trend there should be an abandoned me you're you're looking at it or not it doesn't yeah if I'm a quarterback I'm going to like this weekend 'cause I'm going to get some flags here\nWhy football is such a stupid game [laughter]\nAll right because there is one thing in the game that is it's not that is it a catcher isn't it a catch are they in are they out or they was it a ... it's time it's second it's definitive it never changes you know it's the one they have it it's the one thing in the game that easy for them that they're making unnecessarily difficult\nEverything else is open to interpretation now they're making the play clock open to interpretation why bowling\nAnd ... you know baseball umpires they based their whole careers on this if you're at home plate you're looking at where the tag is and where the runners foot is those are two different things that our feet away from each other if you're making your call first base you're looking at the bag\nAnd the Mets and you're using your ears as well like she said like if I look at you and your ... and there's a sign behind use has bono I could look at that\nAnd look at you put your hand up quickly as if it was a snap and tell you exactly when you thought\nYou did you did I got one I that's true\nYes for to arrest need a light and or a bus or sound like an NBA play clock even though ... Terri said it's not like the MBA you shouldn't compare the two if it's that difficult for that delay a game I Know we're playing the results if that was just there to yard gain or an incomplete pass and that we wouldn't care but because it led to a a touchdown then no world\nWhat if what if you have you know when your phones on vibrate you can feel it so I can watch the play I don't need to look at the clock I could look over and see that it's down to five and then if I get the buzz\nAnd then I just go oh that was my official was yes you why is this one play such a big deal but then they have the completion of office play the ... she had like\nNo but so my point is that they the ... and the NFL every game every week has blown calls has blown place but this is something that\nIs there an end you're not you're instructed to not call it\nOr be loose on it whereas everything else holding really was that holding really was that pass interference that's open to interpretation\nThat's what I think NFL fans are just saying okay I think ... fans I think fans of our show right now just learned we got behind the curtain with these officials and they're told really don't call it\nMilitary is going to get a call I Know well speaking of calls yeah but it it feels like this is the first time I've heard where they go you know we have it but we don't really enforce it\nReally is there any other rule that you have a you don't really enforced yeah but\nThere's one when the when there's twelve defensive defenders on the field if the ... that the twelfth defender as they are going to line up is printing off the field and is a foot away from the Audubon's line appears to be going out they won't automatically throw the ... the myth abolish snapped I've seen in the past before\nAnd you had a moment on Sunday night where I think Chris Collins worth was talking about that with the Steelers are they had twelve mental field Greg in Maine joy inches high Greg what do you have for me\nA long time caller six to two forty in\nQuestion I'm big\nProblem here with me it's just easy easy solution it's a shock color either for the officials neck or like a dog that's going on in the yard or arrest just a quick buck is just a little but like you said vibration that's you know keep your eyes on the ball\nOr ... I don't know if you're going to have a dog collar on them but it'd be good for TV\nYes Tom just imagine any other sport if you punched another fighter and just just right after the bell you know do we have to wait and see the knocked him out of how I heard he was and I was close enough to balance approximately when the round is over him don't worry about\nTodd that argument collapses on itself boxing after the bell punches happen every almost every single round and if they gave a penalty Dr point for every time right at the bell if there's physical contact afterwards there would be no Boxing Day it happened almost every round that is a contact after about\n[noise]\nGood hour yeah\nThat might be a record\nWhich I spoke to record when you are right and more heated 'cause that's when it gets Denver but I Would have been admitted hey Denver got away with something there and we worked\nIn the Bronx you wouldn't have been this fire to definitely not now you have to buy a more phone

I'm not going to argue with that um I Would say the greatest I ever saw was was Greg Maddox um and I know that\nThey have a lot of things in common or you know I don't know Clinton's going to get to three hundred and fifty wins but I I Will tell you a great story a couple of years ago believe it or not Sandy Koufax came into the booth when we were doing a game and I asked him if he would sit down with us and he sat down for a full\nInning and I pose the question and then I said Clinton gr show was pitching\nI said is it fair that people want to compare Clayton crucial career to to your career and he said Ricky said I just hope when Clinton's career is done they still want\nTo me it's a way that isn't that great yeah I mean in that\nMean it's just it's so humble it's away sand he's always been but\nI think he was being honest as far as that is is concerned as well and you know Clinton is able to continue to pitch through these back issues um his career probably will and a lot of ways they would probably be better numbers and what their world was Sandy you know what's missing though is that World Series wearing\nWhat is it about you know manage wasn't a great postseason pitcher glavine wasn't a great postseason pitcher I I don't know if it's just a coincidence bad luck a boat what is it about these great pitchers some some of the all time great pitchers who just weren't good enough to\nKnow your exactly right I I think it comes down to the strike out um I I think it\nComes down to you know the power pitching I'm your back and look at it that it it Jon Lester are and what he's done you look at ... or what he did last year um I think it it's come down to that and you know nowadays I mean if you don't throw Ninety seven I I mean your desk guy you know\nUm and those guys really weren't ... I think one thing to Dan that that\nThat doesn't get considered in it and it gets even more credit to guys like Lester and small to have gone on and done great things but you know ... is in its own two hundred and fifty innings every year\nUm you know you're not going to physically be at your best though I think some of that led to some of the things that went on but um you know there's there's a ... the post season is just a different thing you can go up during the regular season give up three in the first inning and not worry\nA lot of times you're going to especially in American League\nYou're going to pitch six or seven innings but you do that in the postseason or you know the next thing you know you're you're you know there's somebody up in the first inning to to come in and bail you out\nWhat kind of chances to give the Rockies against the brewers\n[noise] um I I've got the brewers go into the world series then hum I said that a couple of months ago I'm\nCraig council has done an amazing job um the additions they made in the winter with king and yell at say brought them in on the same day ah and then the versatility that he has with that line up I'm Craig was telling us a couple of months ago when they brought him was doctors and and they added some depth to the bullpen he goes I've got some bullets\nIt goes I've got you know if we've got we're down by running the ninth inning wait to see the three guys that I'm able to send up to it yet he also likes the back end of his book then he also likes a lot of the things that he has there to\nTo close down to win so I'm a couple of I mean I I mean literally ... everybody thought the Dodgers were the cubs are going to go to the world series I think it was about a month ago when I when I they're not the best team ... washing Milwaukee and in the line up and what king does there and you know all of a sudden yell at you become the MVP of course\nBut there's some link to that line up and there's some depth in quality to the back in the bullpen\nHave you done any practical jokes lately hold any pranks on your own celebrity front\nI'm I'm sure I have um you know I'm thinking of one really off the bat I can but I I you know that when I go back to my my favorite one of all thank you\nI mean we were there from art grace was first golf tournaments and you know they they bring Bill Murray up and Marie ... you know he he critiques when you really do it and then all of a sudden Gracie grabbed the Mike we started to auction off that trip to Randy ... fantasy camp and Gracie right off the bat

know taking an illness or being unable to play what they have to worry about is is a I Believe very specific intention of being traded\nBecause he announced a month in advance when he's going to come back yeah seven and eight or bad as ... right before the trade deadline yes absolutely\nSo I I think he's gonna want all the touches he can get and they'll probably be willing to load 'em up as everyone is extremely valuable uh but I think his plan is to try and be traded or this season\nUm and a on a five no real quick a I'm a sous chef here in North Carolina and would absolutely love to rock a meet friday pat a we have open kitchen or in April of cover up a shirt but I meet friday hat would be very very very\nCool I could take care of that but Joe what's a sous chef do\n[noise] um the number two and considering but you know considering the only two of us in the kitchen or on the bottom of the packing orders but sue is a very French Fancy way of saying uh\nThe assistant number two sometimes in a larger restaurant he can take over you know they just basically like a backup quarterback if necessary\nBut but are you wondering you got on it it's almost like you prepare the of the person to be operated on you do all the prep work and then you know the chef comes in to star comes in and you know but then he takes over is that sort of what happens here\n\nIt's a it's a really good point Dan I might have to have a conversation with my [laughter]\nI'll stay on hold Joe and uh all have today's er Mario send you a some a meet friday gear thank you but yes for it to\nSound like a chef clipboard hold the strain or what what are you like that got a ... what do you what went on the set up and put them back up [laughter]\n[noise] oh very dismissive of sushi a little bit oh my gosh so chefs are no joke do you like being in a restaurant where you see the kitchen working do you like that\n'cause they I I went to I went to dinner last week and I was they they position does we're seated at the bar area but you could see right into the kitchen\nAnd ah it's fascinating you know that they're you know everything that's going on yeah see people are working you know I like that yeah yeah\nYeah for it but they want to see the chaos or someone like kinda watch their nose for a split second or someone drops something that you could see something accidentally for split second in them like a big deal but now you're not hungry anymore\nWhat was the restaurant where the guy got arrested for spinning in somebody's food makers in New York Mets as long as that yeah yeah all feel all hell no he didn't he worked for the\nTigers yes it was a America park and they got the guy on video spin on a pizza or something like that in the corner if you're caught him the active doing that\nAnd I think he it is it a felony it I think he's going to go to jail over it does that sound right that seems harsh\nLike what are you in for the I spit on murder is armed robbery and got a spin on pizza I Am as paranoid and I the idea of people messing with my food is something that keeps me up at night but nobody needs to go to jail for ... milk\n[laughter] what do you have to be a jail chef\nLike he had to go on the weekends he added there if you want to eat the food that he's preparing its you know what he's done\nWell in prison I'm going to guess their justice system is a little different if they find out that you're doing something like that\nAnd get a guess yeah it's one thing for pitcher wants to put a little something on the wall and putting them that the concession stand we don't get\nA a Charlie ... going to join his Dodger broadcaster\nCharlie used to do the six o'clock eastern sports center when I did the eleven o'clock and Charlie was one of the easiest guys to laugh get to you know what you do if he started to cheat or just a little bit and he started to laugh on the air and all you had to do is just turn up the volume just a little bit on him and he lost\nIt can lately lost his bleep many times on the air yeah point\nAnd I think it was Carl Lewis messed up the national anthem entirely signers trying to bring it back and he couldn't he goes Francis Scott\nKey it couldn't do it and he just lost a good what a great night that he could not do it the\nYou know I did an interview with Carl Lewis for the uh they show the undeniable the interview show and I was talking to one of his brothers and I talked to him about the anthem and he says what is it about the anthem that you guys are so interested in I said well you know Karl was\nHaving a singing career with audio to sing and career and then when he got out there and it just didn't go well when he was at the nets game and he's from New\nJersey and I I don't know I just I thought that it was kind of interesting and he goes yeah current we never talk about that I said even as his brother you don't like poke fun at him and he goes no because I don't I don't know why you guys are infatuated with that and I go oh okay\nMaybe I shouldn't bring that up to Carl Lewis on the interview\nAnd I didn't I didn't\nMean I think because it's about your career and and you know this really had nothing to do with his career so the questions are about what you accomplished or didn't accomplish\nNow is the time and wherever you are is the place the citadel makes it easier\nTo earn your degree by offering master's degrees graduate certificates and undergraduate degree completion programs that are entirely online these programs are convenient for working professionals and those serving in the U.S military continuing the sitter does legacy of academic excellence classes are held to the same high standard consistently named the citadel\nThan king addiction while in Germany bully works with the top and Brian he now where the song heroes is imagine this week in Nineteen eighty three total eclipse of the heart Britain by Jim Steinman his number one in the U.S making Bonnie Tyler in the first Welsh singer to topped the charts and this\nAnd I'm remembering back to the days when I was doing the Yankees\nYou know that that was a room filled with egos that Joe Torre he could kind of leave alone and self police hum and he also had Don Zimmer there and most importantly had as this shop steward Derek Jeter here this was essentially a Dave Roberts operation\nAnd when they were going bad he hung in there in fact I think April twenty ninth or tenth games under five hundred or whatever it was said we're still the best team is going to win a they were and they did a so I think\nThis is his third year has gone to the postseason each of the three years I think this by far\nWas his most challenging and his best years of manager\nYeah I like you might use one of my favorite interviews he's interesting uh he's got perspective he'll give you an opinion and uh and I appreciate that in this business but you know I\nAnd maybe saying he was going to be fired there was certainly they were circling the vultures were certainly when your ten games under five hundred with that kind of payroll and I I think that you know there was a little bit of pressure there or at least it felt like there was pressure blood\nInto that ten game under five hundred thing uh again ... put it that that's the macro the micro was they miss Justin Turner probably their best everyday player for the first forty games of the year [noise] um and it really wasn't until about the middle of June\nWhen the team started to heat up and ... and Turner was back every day that broken hand wrists you naturally\nIt the last day of spring training is forty games that's when the Dodgers got off to the slow start but after his return not putting it all on one guy suddenly put maybe their best hitter right\nInto the middle of the line up where it didn't exist for the first two months uh that was a big difference\nAlso you know when you look at this team I don't know how much drama you have for what is considered drama because you used to do play by play for the Yankees were held like if there was a drama that draw what is your favorite story if you were going to and ...\nWhat it was all about when you were there broadcasting the Yankees what you saw what you heard do you have a favorite story\n[noise] you know [noise] it may have actually come before I did the play by play back in the Bronx New Year's a win win Greg metal said matter of factly about know Sparky while he's gone from site young scientists are\nA win win goose Kasich ahead see fit about George Steinbrenner taken upstairs to the fat man and you know you're there in the middle of all of this stuff and you say thank you God this is um\nThere's none of that anymore but it so it's you know that that's Broadway\nHere it's how they would uh so it's not quite as a manic and bizarre as it was thirty thirty five years ago\nIf you were doing the pecking order or the totem pole in Los Angeles for a sports teams\nWe're right now where are the Lakers ... where are the Dodgers in where Iran\nBecause it is October third eh we're heading into perhaps another world series [noise]\nGotta put the Dodgers first uh the rams are are moving up or down down the stretch they come\nAnd the Lakers with the arrival of liberal on a takes that too I think more of an entertainment level rather than a competitive level or the rams are the NFL\nUh but at the end of the day is the Dodgers and the Dodgers and they're in first place and they won the division sixth consecutive years and uh have is a good chance is anybody to go to the world series again\nWe were just showing live looking for people watching on TV when you were doing sports center when Carl Lewis saying the anthem and you you game is Francis Scott Key for ah for our Lewis and you you couldn't you were famous for not being able to hold it together Charlie\nAnd I\nKnow I I and I take it as one because how well so am I going to take it you know that at that point I was relatively new to television at that moment was just a ... or I totally lost it but in some way it was very liberating because if I laugh my ass off like that\nAnd still had a job the next day maybe I could actually\nMake it because when I came up from here where we were\nDownstairs to the studio then we went upstairs to that big old bullpen area room ... passes for a newsroom everybody's laughing\nAnd I thought well okay maybe I did survive this thing after all and I think you guys ran it at eleven o'clock that night two and a and every anniversary Carlin higher on television together and then the one hundredth anniversary of ESPN\nHe and I but despite being phosphorus will be dates\nHe doesn't get our fascination with it I did an interview with him in in his brother told me he was I I don't know why you still bring that up\nYou know I I I in many ways I Do feel badly about it because he was one of the great seminal athlete of the twentieth century\nAnd sadly as many people if not more remember his anthem which was certify a plea awful um and you know an eye on the side car on this uh this runaway motorcycle um\nThat that they remember him as much for that is all the great stuff that he did as an Olympics and so I I feel badly and some in some degree but you know it was live what are you going to do yeah I Know wasn't it wasn't that wasn't not funny\nAnd to see Derrick Coleman pulling his warm ups overall amount so we couldn't see I'm laughing\nOh you you know that morning the morning that we decided to run that I I was driving into work and I listen to WFAN and and they had like ten seconds of the ant and we used to have those morning meetings and we'd sit around and what stories ideas I said you know\nOr something on the radio the sporting a Carl Lewis did the app it wasn't really very good maybe we have a well God and the rest sadly as history it was hysterical\nOh man it just to study and I guess I ... I lost it probably twelve in June and we were looking for\nA car loan liberating funny it was funny\n[laughter] I Know we're supposed to be you know have decorum and we're supposed to be you know where we're going to we're going to keep our dignity or we're not going to show our emotions are and all of a sudden you just start laughing you were doing what we did behind the scenes off camera or we wanted to do and then finally you\nDid it and you're like it's okay it's all it was All right to say hey my bad or I made a mistake on his highlight or whatever it is if it was just you're right you you took off the horns device\nNot intentionally it just you know much like what we did back then we did stuff and all of a sudden like hey that works\nOr hey that didn't work goes I Do that anymore to suddenly I lose it\nAnd it's like it's okay\nWe're still on the air will be back tomorrow and then you know the Tonya Harding comes along and Mitch blood green and all these [noise] carry water all of these things that I found particularly humorous [laughter] I ... I was free to the shackles of trying to bite my lower lip\nDo you ever cross paths with Mike Tyson anyone\nYes we're okay um it was a time that we weren't I haven't seen him in the last year or two but one day said three came over to this is not going to end well it\nGives me a big hug at least for a nice to see you just said you you know in retrospect you you were always fair\nI'm at that time had a difficult to try to negotiate the path between what he perceived as friendship and what my job was to cover him so he always felt that I should be defending him and I said\nMm no it doesn't work that way and it took a long time for him to finally come to terms with it and realized\nCharlie have fun in the postseason always great to catch up with you and thanks for joining us\nAnytime and thank you that's Charlie Steiner Dodgers radio play by play voice yeah Charlie covered Tyson's rape trial\nAnd how big that was in Charlie was there on the front lines with that and I think that's what he's saying and ... and there are athletes who think that because you're friends with them that you will stand up for them I I've had that happened to me before and it doesn't end well when I tell them I still have to do my job\nEven though I thought the world adjacent jumping I still had to cover the story of him getting ... and mark Maguire the same way\nI I I couldn't show favoritism and you know I fell out of favor with John B and McGuire no sort of come back a little bit with Mark I'm in a in a little bit with Jimmy but look if that's the casualty then so be it but I I just\nThey couldn't believe that I was covering them and saying what I had to say about them certainly jumping I think he had a harder time with the last call per phone calls what we learn what's in store tomorrow maybe and understand the day right up to this [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "03"}
