Cordell Patterson or with the the New England patriots last week but I Do think he brings great value and I think you know with Nelson Aguilar and of course our Sean Jeffrey who is the big target on the outside but\nI get all our and ... will be a great combination yeah there are similar players in theory but I think Kate is more dangerous in space\nOr making plays happen with the ball in his hand after they catch that that's the one I'm most excited about also because I look at the eagles too is you know I don't think they played their best football yet this year and I think they're a team that's still a Super Bowl contender in my eyes and if they get in the playoffs I'd say watch out in the end up see\nIf I gave you the rams the field and the NFC\nYeah have you taken who I Would probably take the field but that would be really tough I mean it's a close one but I have so much respect for Sean\nPayton down in New Orleans and their style of football and what we've seen them do just here in the last few weeks\nYou know they're very team you know it doesn't matter anymore Drew Brees oh he's got to be in the dome when playoff games\nDrew Brees is phenomenal but they're a team that showed over the last two weeks they can win a number of different ways they really cannot off into line is special that defense alliance got three first round picks on it and\nSean Payton how tough as teams are and his ability the game plan\nI think is you know a factor in that and then the NFC is just so talented too and the other factor I throw into that with the against the field is the rammed his you know as you know are still a very young football team and learning that way so that's why I Would say the field but I still think the rams are the favorite\nBy gave me the patriots the field\nA good question I I think [noise]\nWho New England patriots or the field I Would go with the field this year I Would I don't think the patriots or slam dunk to come out of the AFC this year\nI still think that if Kansas City somehow got New England to come in to Kansas City in January that is going to be extremely tough on the New England patriots you know I look at the Houston Texans as a team that gets in the playoffs would that front if they can stay healthy and the Sean Watson and the way they're running the football they could be dangerous\nI think the chargers or dangerous or so you know again New England New England would be my pick is the best team in the city but I think I Would still take the field of the closest one they're\nThe best quote I knew how about your opinion I Want to hear yours\nI picked this change the chargers to play in the super bowl so\nWe were thinking of like you know I picked\nI picked the saints and the Steelers I had the chargers during the AFC Championship game but okay I I like it then you're the man\nGoes way beyond bill play for the Steelers this year\nYes he will play for the Steelers I I Do think that will happen um I you know they're not going to send his franchise tag or do something like that why so he can go down inside\nWith the Philadelphia Eagles and they can hear about it in their home state or he signs with the Baltimore Ravens and that gets in the playoffs so that's certainly not happening anything like that uh I Do think he'll play I don't think you're going to see a good levy on built for the very end of the season and he'll be and prime shape for the play offs\nBut you know hey James Garner is doing a great job there man I think Libya ... probably\n... probably every bit as excited as James Garner that he's doing that you know one of the big things about us want to come back uh it didn't want to come back because he didn't want to be beaten into the ground with four hundred and fifty touches this year to where it hurts his future value and he's being a business man but I think I'll be back there eventually\nTalking to Chris Sims from a pro football talk live co host with Mike ... bleach report NFL

be\nOh\nHe just won like ... well you know my thoughts on Aaron Rodgers I think he's the greatest of all time but I think that statistically what all said and done\nWho's the best quarterback Sunday\nYeah I got to go with Tom Brady there I just because of the you know the parts around them it's just too hard on Aaron Rodgers that's always having to do it all himself\nYou know you've heard me say many a times that often ... scheme and Green Bay is you know kindergarten math compared to what New England does an advanced algebra and\nAllow that to happen he he he got more power in there and that organization and Mike mccarthy does does any\nI I mean yes probably but you know again Rogers this is the environment he grew up and he you know I always say this to my ...\nHe doesn't know what he doesn't know right he's watching New England film and go on there and how old are you guys get them to do and what is this stuff and you know unfortunately Green Bay still running the same offense but far right in Nineteen Ninety seven and you know like you saw last week weighed\nPhillips I watched that film yesterday it was like he knew the players that were coming sometimes there was nobody open and it's just Rogers having to make magic too much\nYeah and I just I Know if the Packers don't make the playoffs and he said it's over it's over what do you go Mike mccarthy that\nIt has to it either\nI have to go or he has to bring in a new fresh off sense of mind that's outside of the realm of you know west coast guys you know I Know they brought Joe Philbin back but you know the free can do the job and was there before it's the same old crappy ideas\nHow would how would rate Rogers do in a New England system\nWell all I mean you know of course I think he would do phenomenal and I don't know Brady you know I saw a quote from in O'Connor\nOr a few weeks ago on Twitter that you know Brady told some defensive coordinator in the NFL that oh my gosh I'm Aaron Rodgers played here in New England Heathrow for seven thousand yards every year\nYou know yeah I mean you know again I'm not trying to knock Tom Brady people think I'm a ... and I just think he's absolutely phenomenal and he's an all ways I really do a\nBut Aaron Rodgers to me it was like ... and Michael Jordan that is Michael Jordan he's he is in another world I just go is the strongest storm ever the quickest released ever he's scantily he's one of the best scramble or is ever\nHey he's the quickest ah forty thousand yards and three touchdowns he's the greatest gunslinger we've ever seen\nAnd nobody protects the ball better interception to touchdown ratio than Aaron Rodgers second on that list is Brady at three to one\nAnd Rogers is that one that's just that's I think that speaks to the incredible talent and Aaron Rodgers has said I'm not trying to take anything away from Tom Brady Abbas in\nThe Boston mafia do come after me I still love Tom Brady yeah what are they trying to keep\nWhat do you think ... to go out and Halloween\nOh like king size everything you know king size and probably like\nSome New England but now you would like an autograph or something like that autographed picture and he ... he can't give out candy\n... always you're right and like all the very healthy or can I can\nSee how steamed vegetables [laughter]\nThat's it like a it's a organic grown or you know that's why I got to give the autographed picture um yeah he had to go there and like man that's Tom Brady this kid he stink so you've got to get a picture to go along with it but the signed autographs\nDid your dad feel extra pressure to give out better candy growing up\nBuild still does that still does dad is like he's built this or a man and he will have a line going up his driveway tonight\nAnd my sister is in charge and she's ten thousand dollars [laughter] on the ... and my dad gets great pride at a knowing he had the best of all we need to give her in and cycle lakes
