going to be honest with that but it's nice to be back sleep in my own bed and a little road weary after a two week trip but\nAh yeah we're moving right along if you need a reason to celebrate today in all seriousness I Know that sounds a little bit odd\nBut uh especially as we get older it's nice to or just if we are around older people I I shouldn't say that that is a stigma and I just fell into my own trap\nThat is a stigma stroke it's world stroke day and stroke and happen to anybody regardless of age uh ... regardless of health status or it can happen at any point on October twenty ninth observer world stroke day by learning fast\nIt's an acronym and it stands for facial weakness arm weakness speech difficulty and time time loss is brain life if you see somebody that you even might

indicator as the quicker the response the quicker that they can administer things to help a break up the caught and I'm a save that brain lots and so world stroke day is celebrated today\nAnd I've had people extremely close to me or that have suffered strokes and so it's just\nIt's one of those things I Know it's not pretty in glossy to shine about or just to talk about and not something to but it

some time to spend alone\nHow many of your alone or how many of you get more energy being alone and are you the type of person that gets more energy when you're around a crowd\nI kind of I I tend to lean more toward the alone side um it's time to step away from the hustle and bustle of your everyday life and retreat to some place quiet the word hermit comes from the Latin\nI uh air meta no ... yeah meaning\nOf the desert hermit as a person who lives to some degree and seclusion from society now I don't think complete isolation is the key um but yeah I definitely have a good mix of being around friends being around family\nThan than being by myself to do it today is national hermit they had to observe\nIt was pretty simple to celebrate national hermit they find a secluded place and

I get that that you didn't want to do that but but like a Saturday afternoon game or I don't know I I Would love to have that one to say\nYou know what I was struck me as I said to him that I maybe I just don't remember this happening or the it being this way I Know that two three two format for the world series but I don't remember doing three games back to back like that back to back to back that ... was it\nI didn't I didn't remember it being that way and and I was talking to somebody who said you know it's friday Saturday Sunday and I go\nWay that doesn't seem right yeah I mean that's usually the NBA is like a well didn't play Sunday and then Thursday [laughter] I don't play Sunday and then a Tuesday and then friday baseball's like a let's just get that just get this out of the way you know for ...\nAt least Eighteen any game was friday night I Know that would've been a nightmare like on a regular for all of us are going to work and I ran for getting up early the next day but as frustrating as it was you know like when ... threw it away to first base and it was to one Red Sox I looked like it was finally going to end and then it ended up being tied to and then they played a few more extra innings\nI was still isn't as often as I was I was still more excited about the fact that it was going on even longer to see how this was\nA new new how important that game was Boston have taken the first two and ... in Boston you knew that the Dodgers season was\nAt stake here now as it turned out you know it didn't matter but the fact that it was to one then you're up for nothing in the next game and you're thinking you know maybe it's\nDodgers are going to even so there was drama there I I didn't look at that and go oh went too long I mean there are games that go along because once again we baby these pitchers like\nWriting righty okay gotta I gotta bring you in got to bring the left hander in and it's just it never used to be that way used to be if you're a great pitcher you get anybody out that's not the case anymore me up on\nThe world series scheduled to three to has been since the early eighties I think eighty one they went to games in a row one day off three games in a row at the\nNext ballpark one day off to games in a row so basically ... but in Nineteen Seventy nine it was seven straight games on seven straight and that's how I was in the seventies there is no days off in the seventies on the world series none days off\nBut they were lucky back then I think you had the pirates in the Orioles right back then so the travel was in a big issue but yeah I didn't remember back\nTo back to back yet that feels like the first time I get maybe it is every time but I don't remember ever seeing those three games and three nights\nAnd also it affected you know you're pitching staff I mean there I thought it was fascinating what you know Alex corps did he did a wonderful job as a rookie manager wonderful\nUh Dave Roberts his managerial style is going to be in question for quite some time what he did what he didn't do a you know rich ... leave him in or do I take him out maybe he wants to come out maybe realizes hey I I don't want to you know put us in a position where I'm the one that's a liable here apple\nAnd congrats to you about a week and a half ago you said keep an eye and Steve Pearce has a sneaky MVP candidate congrats bus\nAnd I don't we don't have the audio just another one that uh you know the chalk it up here say yeah you\nKnow that Steve Pearce was on four different teams in the same season and twenty\nTwelve I Believe that's really hard to do he I never had five hundred it batch never but I can make Lebanon what'd you check was ... the most\nObscure MVPs in all the sports and winning a championship series NBA Finals Stanley Cup final all of those that most obscure MBP winners apple\nSo like the journeyman they can't have any all star parents is is that you can't be an obscure and be down in the uh the parish was never even started I mean he's most most that bats in the season was three Thirteen what does he thirty five thirty five he's making some do actually now [noise]\nNow did you guys so he's a descendent of fourteen presence in the United states Franklin Pierce too little known fact\nThat's an obscure fact about an obscure okay whose career would\nYou rather have the president\nOr would you rather have Steve Pearce of the red Sox so Franklin Pierce or Steve Pearce\nAway they're spelled differently I was making it up and I thought I could get away with it I Want to be clear and I believe when you make up [laughter] just ruined a damn good question [laughter] that's our poll today whose career now ever mine ... mine never mind will take that out of the rear\nAh by the way Sunday night

missing some I I Know they pitcher for Barnes I I I don't think there was any move made that that may jets and not available that would have been the big question that I had\nWhen it comes to dynasties it feels like it depends on the sport you know the Golden State warriors or a dynasty the patriots or a dynasty when it comes to baseball you know are the rich\nIt's a dynasty when you consider that you don't really have a common thread as far as manager or star player with what's happened to this franchise but when you think of dominating or a baseball you know why is that there are dominating franchise uses a dynasty\nYes yesterday without a doubt in my mind um you know it's kind of a New England thing and I mean when you think about it if they don't play in the world series and play in the super bowl and it's kind of been a a difficult year for\nThe [laughter] I'll tell you something\nThen that I learned the earlier last year from the president of the red Sox Sam Kennedy Sam talked about there being a difference between spending and investing\nAh when when you look at what they've done yeah they brought in a young manager and Alix ... who you can't say enough good things about him and I'm sure you have all year long but what did they do for Alex core they they they brought in Ron ...\nA guy who was a you know with the angels in two thousand two with my social he managed in Milwaukee I don't think there's a better bench coach third base coach and all of baseball they run ran a key so you don't bring in a rookie manager and not supporting when somebody that you know it was going to have is back in every situation\nI'm the one the one thing that stands out at me about Alex core of the first month the season was he in in a night the ending with one run lead he didn't put Jackie Brown a junior in center in and take JD Martinez out of the game\nAnd after the game it didn't have anything to do with the outcome they want but after the game the Boston media was like hey why didn't you make the move and then you know I mean but a lot of people out there might not know how they score said I didn't think of it\n[laughter] I like I think of it like you know what the media is ready to pounce on him an editor him\nSaying that you can't do that and I'll listen to this and Ronnie ... going to be mad at me but a month later I asked Ron ... I go hey I'm how come you guys didn't do that and he goes um I I go I Love what ... said that I didn't take it\nHe goes well set that's not exactly a truth I go with the truth he goes he kind of did that just to deflect the media he goes we talked about putting Jackie Bradley in there\nAnd he asked me what I Would do and I said I wouldn't do it because Judy Martinez the spot comes up for it then the bottom of the night if they tie it we're going to lose his bat and Alex goes okay leaving men or the\nSo ... you know it it's that personality its ability to communicate not only in the clubhouse but with the media or with the public\nUm we we know the one thing he did when he signed his contract he called Sam Kennedy or Time Warner and John Henry back he said I Need one more thing\nThey're going like okay you need to know the year and he's more money what's what what is it\nHe goes I Need a plane full of goods to go to my country and Puerto Rico want to be on that I Want to go down there and help help help help Puerto Rico and they just like lit up and the last thing I heard I make sense four or five planes down there to help so that that tells you a lot about the human being that the Boston Red Sox higher\nIs Rick Sutcliffe the ESPN baseball analyst joining us damned Patrick show more likely to being a Dodger uniform next season many ...\nPoker sure I'll be there um I don't think at this point in his career with all the back injuries that he's left um I I don't know that there is anybody out there that's going to pay him a more ... more years to the contract that he's already on\nUm you know no doubt in my mind any Machado that's a that's a different situation I I mean I'm you know a couple of the things that went on in the playoffs and a couple of things that were said\nAh I don't know if they're going to cost more money or not we've seen owners go crazy on contracts when you've got a chance to add a talent like him I like many Machado a lot but um you know with what he did by by going by there and and kicking the goals of what he did in the Milwaukee series some of that stuff is is is is you know when when\nAn ownership asked their key players do you want do you want to add that to your team or not I think there's going to be some guys that are a little hesitant about that so no doubt in my mind that ... and ... I I've been wrong anytime but they claim gr show will continue to end his career and a Dodger uniform\nScott ... Sunnyside topics says that he's already got an offer and it's already wrapped up even though it's not official with Bryce Harper or a do you believe that and be if you do where is Bryce Harper going to be next season\n[noise] um I I Would believe that he has an offer I I couldn't believe that it's wrapped up I mean ... you know he's earned the right by by playing this out and and and going by the rules to become a free agent uh you got to take a look at it\nI mean he's got to take a look at it what's out there I mean I think back to Dallas green wanted to meet with me in Nineteen eighty for the last month of the season and after you know went into it or whatever whatever after getting hot he says you don't really need to meet right now\nYou've earned a right to get out there and look I'm I I think Bryce Harper would would be silly to to have things already wrapped up without seeing what else is out there and you know the priority for him right now ... has got to be finding a team that he can win the world series on um\nWho would rather have Bryce Harper many Machado\n[noise] um [noise] I'd rather have rice I'd rather have right and you know what I Would have said Machado before the postseason started but I'm not going to be Johnny hustle I I'm not going to run things out that that's just not the tone that I Would want to set for an organization and that's not the way Bryce Harper plays the game\nYou're pretty sharp and six thirty in the morning are you still a lot from last night\nAnd I'm not you know that you know I tried you know partying with Bill Murray one time and and uh and then I went on there that night\nThat has you know more than I did lead that hey I Want to share one\nThing with you to what one thing that I really thought was the key to the Boston Red Sox this year\nThey hired away the assistant hitting coach from a year ago from the Dodgers Tim hires\nTim hires told me I said how did you guys put it together offensively last year he goes we started something along with the hitting coach turn award\nCalled hitters meetings and they do it's a lot like what you and the debt than as through every morning you guys talk about who the guest star what the question should be I Know you include your staff lot as as everybody should\nThis was the key to hire ... told me something that the the Dodgers were trying to hide in the hitters meetings what they did there was they included Justin Turner\nAnd Justin ... would speak he would go out and apply it\nIn his day robbers told me you know once it's out in the universe you own it you you got to go out there and apply that well all of a sudden all the Dodgers beat in on that will would hires came over to Boston he got JD Martinez to buy in on because they know if you're not the one leading the show and you don't encourage\nEverybody in your in your office to say something then they're not going to say anything when all of a sudden ... Martinez is telling ... tell you what are you going to do off this guy well to begin with ... he was like well I'm just going to see it and hit it well that's not enough\nWhat what are you going to do what are you looking for I tell you what these hitters meetings that the the Dodgers came up with last year and the red Sox applied this year I think it's a huge teeth to the reason those were the last two teams standing in baseball this year\nRefresh my memory how banged up where you after you went out with Bill Murray\n[laughter] didn't I didn't feel banged up at all and in fact I don't know that I ever\nFelt better you know you're in trouble when you're on the air\nYou know what I I didn't know what it all I didn't even realize it pulled the plug on me I I I\nDidn't know that it was funny so he spends a night with me right and we drive to his course\nThis is about an hour away from San Diego palm about it we go up there and and I didn't return my phone we play we played all day we're sitting here having lunch\nAnd all of a sudden I turned my cell phone on in the smoke was coming out of that thing I'm going oh boy well I had a text message and I'm asking everybody out there if you had a message from your wife to call her or your age at Barry ... who you know ASAP I mean\nWho you're a call ... exactly exactly well my\nFirst thought was something that happened to my grandpa 'cause you know I was raised by him and when Barry told me that you know what's going on out there I thought oh I lost my grandpa he goes I says rep okay goes yeah he's fine he goes\nBut you're all over the world then I go I go for what [laughter] I didn't I I don't know that that point I even knew that I'd gone on the air but you know it turned out kind of great you know you know normally Williamson than I Do um\nBut if you told him to stay in the ... shown it sounded like he had to run and even when you saw what he was running into that there was nothing there\nAnd you know more importantly you needed to protect the ball and give Rogers a chance you know getting for ... extra yards you weren't even getting to the ... it just it didn't make any sense there\nAnd you know at times you know the Packers were the better team there the rams made the plays when they needed to and talk to her early as spectacular timed early was the MVP that game time you're really was the best player on appeal it wasn't even close\nAnd I do like you know Green Bay to play the way they did and this is the philosophy this is what the ... are going to try to do next weekend it's gonna be All right let's see what a you know your quarterback can do\nBecause if I'm a defense I once I got it\nEntirely out of the ... the best I can and it's not easy to do but that's what I Want to do I gotta go I'm not I'm Jared golf is going to beat me at the beach me you know I'll tip my cap to him but I cannot let Todd girlie beat me but girl use beating you out of the backfield catching passes that's even scarier\nBecause you're putting them out there and you're putting them on the line backer and that's a mismatch but ah you know give credit to the rams they did what they needed to do to a girly though\nYeah I like how they they're asking him about a in a fantasy football and uh Vegas hey why didn't you scored a touchdown it's like I don't care how bad here's Todd girlie on the non touchdown\nAnd we'll go over the stuff around when we went over what to do and what situations\nWhere Mexico something that we are um you know a selfish players situation a massive invest would have gone about having an edge and it's not about talent or whatever you know you can always be somebody by just knowing the situation where the guy and we don't want to give twelve\nYeah you don't want to get Rogers a chance and Europe by two and he decided that you know we we at the time is what we want we want to control the clock here but if he goes in and then there's the over and you cover the point spread there with the Packers yeah for me\nIn that situation to try to uh to try to score plus in this world where everyone's worried about stats and touchdown throw their next contract and putting up numbers you know that was doubling impressive video the wherewithal to just stop and fall short of the younger\nYeah pretty cool unless you bet on the game or he's on your fantasy to all the important part of a of life Steven Virginia joined just Hi Steve\nThanks for having me yeah morning thanks for having me I've got two more so best is ah Steve\nPearce World Series of bitchy he's played for the entire ... ... says we're sessions yesterday that's forty again Seventy one turnovers that this last past as a buccaneer first passed last past are picked such as well as I said well\nHow about that for Steve my little throw instead of the day there well done by the way our sense of the day I brought you by the great folks have done it one time eras James Winston on getting benched yesterday against the bangles\nIt was very humbling but it was not about me is my fault that we were in that position you had to make a decision and his father still all all parents responded or greatly and we came back on topic came up and gave us it was a ... you\nKnow it is about huge Amish here's a telling quote from James ... who once said I can make all of the throat was like I have no fear I can make all the throat and then he was told no you need to have fear because part of the problem is the quarterback who thinks she can make every throw\nVicious in college and you know you're not Aaron Rodgers Brett Farr was able to get away with it very very very few quarterbacks can get away with it James which cannot and you can be out there and you can be a gambler and you think you're a you know Florida State playing against Wake Forest that's not that's not what's happening here\nPoor decision making he's just not an easy starting quarterback [noise]\n'cause you you have to make it goes back to this might be last year when I said you know what worries me is decision making like he thinks he can make all the throws and the great quarterbacks no the throws I can and can't make depending on the situation\nMore phone calls coming up best and worst of the weekend we'll give you hours I'm going to take the cabs to task they fired Tyrone Lew is coming up [noise]\nHow did

you say we're also happy for you I southern southern how to be said he was so excited that we took the time to come by and go in the foot or so happy for him we just met him like seven seconds earlier can be very happy to someone and not have a whole not where I'm also happy\nFor you I assume to pick up on myself to speak for the group no I don't want you to doing that but the fact that with where are you registered yeah\nYou know Creighton barrel [laughter] I ... I was close to getting adjusted typically I bet that would be not only been a big deal there\nI uh so Steve Pearce who is your World Series MVP I sold the Astros and Red Sox are the co favorites to win the world series next year rams now eight no she's Seventy one and St a sneaky six and one James Winston bench\nCould you trade him would you trade memory when the argument used to be James Winston Marcos Mario to\n... and I don't think that question comes up anymore Winston is more disappointing but I think it's because he thinks he can do more and he takes more chances and he's just not that good\nYou know I don't care how Patrick more homes is is taking chances but he is he's better than Seamus twins to\nThere are certain quarterbacks where you say just stick to the game plan here don't try to do too much and it's not that he doesn't have talent I just don't think he process is what he needs to do in the moment and that's really hard to do but man was terrible yesterday he apple\nMarquez Mario to in the past two seasons has sixteen touchdown passes and twenty picks and it's just not starting quarterback\nIn the NFL for a guy who does have a whole lot of talent\nAnd Winston does have a lot of talent I just I didn't like him from the get go I don't think he's the leader I think he's done stupid things obviously and then gets on the field and you just look at the the decisions that and it's not like he doesn't have talent on that too where you have to make something happen you're not you're not playing in Buffalo\nLike you have a tight in and wide receivers thank you got and brain and Howard Evans you don't have to try that hard but you don't get points for degree of difficulty ...\nTake the bucks to be in the playoffs picture if they hadn't been stripe it's Patrick ... I don't know but uh\nIt might have one yesterday I don't know about that I'm On its magic let's get it going oh you were excited yesterday I was so I\nThought it was fun because I it was one of those where I was watching the red zone and you know they went away from that day because the bangles we're getting blown or they're blowing them out and then all of a sudden Andrew Sicilian was bringing back the buccaneers I go wait or we just doing this 'cause fitzpatrick sitting there and all of a sudden you go oh my God they\nTied the game fits magic a Packers losing to the rams um you know this is I I Can't help\nBut watch the body language you know Aaron Rodgers doesn't hide things and he should probably hide it a little bit better as the leader of the team but man there's no love lost between him and Mike mccarthy\nAnd the fans of they've chosen sides to monitor and they have chosen Aaron Rodgers but if you're looking at the Packers scheduled that game was so important for the Packers because now you lose the ad game\nNovember fourth there at New England they didn't play the dolphins at Seattle at Minnesota those are some of the games coming up here for Green Bay some of these teams got brutal schedules\nI mean this seems pretty tough you have to go to Minnesota and granted they win last night now you've got the rams coming up\nBut uh that was that was pretty a\nPretty interesting to see how important that game was to Green Bay as opposed to the rams and maybe maybe he said send rams on inclusion course and of course they play this next week and\nI also saw this number here the giants lost again and yes I Know and thank you for all the people remind me but I thought the giants were going to be a ten when team this year I did uh he lie manning is not going to weigh is no a trade caused by the way\nHe was asked about that and he says he's not going to do that the giants have lost Twenty one of their last twenty five\nThe browns have lost twenty two of their last twenty five [laughter] [laughter]\nBut that doesn't cost of food do let that sink in a little bit\nThe giants the last Twenty one twenty find the browns have lost twenty to twenty which team would you uh would you like who is the future would you like\n\nLike it feels like the browns are more threatening next year then the giants are browser second the league and on defense and take away\nThey got they were gassed yesterday against the Steelers they were that that felt like Steelers warm down and er James Garner played well I don't know if it if anybody missing lay beyond bell\nLook great and uh picked up the way in plus you get a guy who's cheap and young and he wants to be there that sounds great I'll ... I'll sign up for them I had a few phone calls\nHere and uh we'll check in the Cleveland Cavaliers who fired Tyrone Lou\n[noise] right cowardly move a cowardly ...\nThey started out oh and six and a so they fired Tyrone will write a let me go to Matt and Vermont will take a break came at\n\nAbout five ten to twenty five [noise]\nAll right by the weekend a Baylor Bears they lost fix I'm On Thursday thought enough to watch that um fight\nFirst a daddy is that the Lakers they want um what's the worst and also the giants are dumpster fire which leads me to my where's the fact that the eagles and the red skins on making it tougher on my cowboy\nAll right thank you man yeah I watch I watch as much of the giants and the red skins as I could um you know in Adrian Peterson went off again I\nThink he's the oldest running back to ever have a touchdown of over sixty yards the ... the last guy to have a touchdown who is older over the age of sixty\n[laughter] Jim Thorpe\nSo over the age of thirty four ah so you're over sixty yard touchdown run over the age of thirty four was Jim Thorpe is that right mixture I Believe so yeah so they just had over the age of ... that would be a brass over sixty yards are at the age of thirty four\nDid you eat the long run though it's still like it's like an old manager impede yeah ... ... and took a little bit longer but he scored a touchdown young\nWhen I when I say about the giants an Iraqi man he was putting up these huge yard at the numbers every week heat on pace for like forty eight hundred yards how come they're not scoring points have shake one and Eli sort of move the ball lot\nHe throws like for yards yeah six yards for yards three yards to yards and then you know it's all little short things and he's probably got a high complex which is ... ...\nWell he's got a career high yeah going three completion percentage now he's on he's thirty ... thirty in the entire NFL\nCurries racing All right we'll take a break so as to what Chris Mannix will join us because the Cavaliers need a new head coach the tire on Lou deserved to be fired\nTalked to him about that coming up more of your phone calls best and worst of the weekend we are back

buy a car online shopping often leads to confusion but not anymore\nIntroducing troop price from true car now you can know exactly what you pay for the car you want including fees and accessories and best of all you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people paid for that same car you want\nSo when you're ready to buy a new or used car visit true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience\nI really think that it all depends on who is playing at that point um I Do I mean I think I don't think it was but this this cat's team stinks like they're really bad\nAnd nobody was surprised that\nNow yeah I mean you couldn't like ... read our back in and have him on the sidelines and and have it be successful so that it it's it is what it is I just think that that the ownership in the front office wanting to see more of a young players and I don't think I was willing to do that\nThe headline in the first two weeks of the season is what\nI mean that there's a lot of surprises\nUm for me it's it's Toronto looks like the team to beat in the east and then I mean you know why is Ben collide and that's you know that's a team and I was talking to an executive bought this last night as team played them he said when you play that team\nEverybody knows their roles and that's where they differentiate themselves in the south the track of how the Celtics\nFigure each other out and and the who does why everybody's got different a little bit too much collide step in that the roads are all the bench guys are still there so they you know exactly how they want to play and and now they want to play together so there I mean I I think as good as they've been early has been the biggest story to ...\nI also had to laugh when you had people say\nUh you know time to panic with the Lakers when they first three games and then they want a couple and then we're we still panicking and then now you lose an hour we panicking again is it going to be this way is a game to game the tire for example the season with the Lakers\nI mean every team liberal on his ever played on has been game to game remember when they were nine and ate with Miami in that first year and you know everyone's firing Eric ... at that point to me the same thing with Cleveland to me it's just we micromanage LeBron in ways I don't think we've ever micromanage any player in the history of sports\nAll that being said this is what they are they're they're ... they're inconsistent team that I don't think have the talent level to be a playoff team in the western conference two fundamental things that are coming into the season they struggle with they have one\nThey don't defense um they're they're trying to mascot with pace they play the third fastest pace in the NBA and\nThey'll just putting up you know a huge numbers but they're giving up well over a hundred pointed every single game that they played and I don't look at that team\nIn the whole bunch of ... defenders out there they're gonna make them get better at the case of progress is there also twenty fifth in the league and three points shooting and I don't look around that roster and see a bunch of great three point shooters like it'll emergencies the progress certainly the ... going to get by the twenty percent it caused but probably better than twenty eight percent but\nThey're not a great three points shooting team at Cal relatives of three well\nThey don't defend well I don't know how you're a playoff game in that conference\nFucking to Chris Mannix from Yahoo's board senior NBA writer there was a report that Jimmy Butler has assurances from now the owner when Taylor of the timber wolves that he will be traded\nYou believe that bad I don't believe anything of this this story\nAnymore I mean it's like every day there's a leap coming from ... um that that you know it makes it seem like he's out the door but then you have to go back to warn ironclad part of this at the top two but it doesn't want to trade him and it may come to kind of a loggerheads with tipper do\nAnd Glenn Taylor where you don't give it will say you could we will train him but you had to fire me too\nAnd and get me out the door because I don't think kids cares about dysfunction around the team I don't think he cares about the locker room dynamic or whatever the drama is right now at the moment\nIn Minnesota He knows the butler is his best to waive player and if he can have any chance of making the right to say the second spot in the west which I think it's wide open this year he's got to have butter on that team so the reporter for first round picks which\nYou know it was insane and its own it's on its own way that's not going to get it done for calm typical because you've got to include a starting level player you know that he can plug into that mix to replace you'd love it\nYeah I agree because I said look if Houston can give up these for first round picks for Jimmy Butler might do that if I'm Houston but if I wouldn't do it by Minnesota oh\nCome on Dan ... ... didn't we go down this rabbit hole once before we're like what for first round picks means and how devastating it can be to a franchise didn't we do this\nIt doesn't mean anything the these are picks that are going to be in the in the mid to late twenties probably in Houston as a change if you shouldn't has window here what three years to win a title\nOh hold on hold on hold I've been that said the same thing I did this story for Sri used back of the nets at the same thing goes player\nFor over the hill but the nets God no now they want to look after the file come on hold on hold on after the fact we learn the cage he had nothing left had something left at the time Dan Deron Williams\nWas in that kind of course Paul class are still comparing those too and so John was a high level guy over the cover story what Brad side on the cover it said who wants a piece of them because so every there was a lot of people that believe that team was a slipping ship level team at the time there's no way they could have imagined that it would have played out the way it did\nDo you think if the rockets good Jimmy Butler that changes anything and that was\nIt it makes ... yes a change to the west um ... crunched AS number two\nI've watched Golden State over the weekend they're playing the best basketball I've seen them play like Kevin Durant Arabs right now especially between those who are ... are just completely insane I don't think you get them a championship\nAnd more importantly than for the purpose is why I think it's dangerous those workers tropics Judy bothers him banged up in recent years had so many problems I dealt with some injurious use the U.S of course there's still presumably you give him a five year contract right you sign into the max level deal\nThat he's that he really wants at some point with Jimmy Butler they're going to be paying for ... production so how many years ... squeak out of a\nTop level Sunni bought their Chris Paul Keim Paul what thirty three Jimmy bothers now going to be in his early thirties\nI think you're giving yourself like a two year window to the championship but after that\nAll bets are off so if that's picked ended in like two thousand and twenty two you think that's going to be a ... a bad pick I I'm not going to that\nBut you're trying to win a championship this was all about in a moment trying to win a championship\nI mean my my talking to really came right now I mean this is like is it the same thing the nets did and I understand\nWhat they were only butler is is far better than any of those Celtics who were dealt a you know that we know that under\nA hundred percent but I think you're diminishing what we thought the nets were at that time we saw the nets or a legitimate title contender with that group and within two years because of injury because inconsistency those picks became disastrous for that\nBut I Know the rockets your title contenders I Know that I didn't know that with the nuts I Know the Jimmy butler can play at a high level higher than any of those Celtics good and if you're the rockets what do you do just decide to this is our roster and then that shit that we don't we don't we don't we're not going to try to win a championship here\nWell I mean it's it's hindsight but I wouldn't have made the move they did in the off season I Would have ... I agree I mean I was up three to uh go into the er at the end of course Paul injury\nI had done that now it just seems like these are I mean look at it if it all depends to me than on how many you guys I mean I just if you can get four years out of him playing at the Jimmy butler type level\nYou take the deal if it's less than that if we're dealing with injuries plus of course all takes a step back I think it becomes a pretty risky lumber capability or not kicked in a row right you can't do that in the NBA I got to be every other year yeah so there could be two ... two thousand twenty that turned out to be great picks whichever walls\nYear and you know that then he's going to go out that way it feels like the giants and I actually have a text into somebody who I Hope has some insights on this and I said you know it is a lie going to be there no matter what as you're starting quarterback\nAnd ah so waiting to hear back I get the feeling that he's going to be there you know till may be the last two weeks of the season then maybe you you see what you have Polly best and worst of the week at\nA big upset then you're in northern Illinois university huskies are party in dekalb ah they beat BYU at BYU that's a real nice right now I got paid to do so no army football quarterback Kelvin Hopkins junior that or there's\nI think is the first day oh okay uh he was seven for eight passing which with armies often says like being Seventy for eighty passing and any other school with two touchdowns he also ran for a hundred and five yards army took care of\nEastern Michigan and I still want to get up there to see a game I think they have air force next we are now I Want a couple of years ago when they play to get us air force it didn't go well\nFor for the good she know counter\nBest and worst of the week and my best to the weekend there was a huge first\nOver the weekend a ditch the Larry Fitzgerald spike the football in fact he talked about\nThat a after the game\n[noise] never spike the ball before in my life [laughter] it's a little frustrated and have a heavy heart today my son my oldest son didn't want to come to the game today so I was a house to live my feelings are low hurt so I was carrying that are all around all day so when I got in there are a kind of let it out [noise] so all the kids are watching I'm Sorry so bad example today [noise]\nThere's some things that he didn't he he didn't want to come supportive so you know tropical diseases I got to be a better father\nWho who all\nJust crushing his kid that's conference is\nAwesome depressing I think you'd\nBe spiking the ball because you're angry but you're playing for the cardinals you came back for one more season\nYeah for the he should be kind of proud of his son for realizing that one day and one in ... and wanting to sex has got to be a thousand other things that can be done\nI Will say that is the game that I I watched it I was watching the game and I went what am I doing yeah like I'm a loser I'm watching this game\nYou're the guy who we don't watch it there's got to be one viewer you\nThat that was the one game where I just go I'm I'm so curious

satisfied non castle anywhere\nNext week which is just crazy to me um sent it back row seats in polite\nAlright thank here at college football's been kind of law you know there'd been\nA couple of moments there I've watched the U.S she game is Arizona State I mean I watched a lot of college football I just there was anything where I went oh boy I'm locked in on this you know Ohio State didn't play Alabama didn't play unless you didn't play Notre Dame didn't play ah I was watching Washington watched the some of that game\nBut there it just feels like Alabama's planning for a national championship\nWinning a national championship and there was nothing anybody else can do we know the end of the movie I guess the drama is if you want to call dad who's going to be playing Alabama is Clemson that's not going to get anybody excited apple\nEven if Alabama loses to LSU next week they probably drop to the fore spot still control their own destiny you can't control your own destiny point in college football you can't\nI don't think so ...\nCan I see what you're saying you literally control your own destiny [laughter] when you throw literally in there no\nLike because you hear that about controlling your own destiny I don't think you can control your destiny\n\nI don't think so have you have you heard that before I yes I've definitely heard that before it as a missed a use of the English language but it's something we say I know but we shouldn't they control their own destiny yeah but they don't cause destiny controls it yeah it's ...\n\nLike I can alter its destiny so why would you even go to practice than if you if the results are already you have to go to your family you don't know what it is oh\nSee I Want to know your destiny could then be if you you were destined to stop practicing because he thought you were so great and then be a colossal failure yeah that would that would have been your destiny let's say the Packers let's say the Packers are playing the bills tonight the Packers a favor by twenty well how about the patriots are playing OK okay\nTom Brady could not choose to not show it to the game and changed the destiny of that game yeah but it would have been his destiny did not show up tonight [noise] like let's say he\nGot sick so his destiny says you're going to get sick\n\nWow yeah we just got to having yeah see so like part of my destiny unfortunately was getting this little trail mix thing I guess and having to yeah a massive cup of it\nIn the middle of the show may come up and would you look for the like the definition of controlling ones destined\nWell yeah I think we're getting some opinion in here it's not like I of course you can't control your own destiny Stephanie yeah but why do we say control your own destiny ...\nSuccess magazine success dot com yeah says a how to take control of your destiny therefore steps to take control of your destiny\nYeah but that's like a self help type thing isn't land or success magazine and the like like ... or you have no control over this right or don't read the magazine because it's either going to happen for you it's not you have no control over it that would be a terrible idea yeah make a lot\nBy the way a U.S had literally there I watched the sand man that's like special which is hysterical I finish at this weekend he thinks literally all the time because he's hanging out with his little kids and I get it because I'm saying it too and you just said it there too or we accepting literally no\nHell no but I was mocking 'cause 'cause my kids said like and literally\nI'm Sorry to say my kids say it wants to sentence\nOh they can't get through a sentence without a couple of likes it was like you know and then like\nThe war and I remember seeing and I don't like to be the grammar police but but those are things that uh\nBut then he got Chauncey Billups in\nOn Mercer I was around ... Kentucky yeah yeah ... we always talk about that if if I Nick Saban in Miami got Drew Brees healthy and if Rick Pitino guy Tim Duncan the whole that the the dominoes that would not have fallen\nCrazy great if breeze doesn't get hurt in San Diego\n'cause they they Dr phil rivers is that why they drafted rivers because they were worried about the shoulder or they drafted him anyway any sit behind ... yeah I don't think they believed in breeze in San Diego yeah that was smart black and white and worked out fine\nMay had breeze and flew to eat and Philip Rivers and I think all three are hall of famers it's almost like when the Phoenix Suns had Kevin Johnson Jason Kidd in Steve Nash from the same roster and Nash couldn't get a shift\nRight by the way you get that was a little hot that you just sort of we just sort of Passover ... hall of famer and find little hot yeah by throwing everything yeah and I know that I Know I ...
