satellite\nIn Seattle giraffes penny any I think he's third on the death shark and you drafted him a lot higher than he was projected to go so when you see there's sometimes the patriots get it right with these ... you know battle jak doesn't have a great track record but there are times when you go yeah he got one\nBut when they took Sonia show at the end of the first round like God I got so many running backs\nOh maybe they found a guy 'cause Sony Michel with James White I mean he's still a burqa there so they have a lot of different weapons but this is what the patriots due to Tom Brady they're like I'm here you go Tom here's your new group ... introduce yourself yes the club\nOkay I'm going to be that guy okay they they always\nWant to be ours has [noise] like I saw I sat\nJonas Gray where for two hundred against the cold side and prime whenever one thirty twice you guys have the cold side like nobody on defense so how do I read into Sony Michel ... he looked awesome how did he do last week he really good last night he looked like Bo Jackson I I okay but I can only\nLook at you in in in in his uh regards to the opposition so you go get an undefeated dolphins team\nAnd I'll get on line okay there's still undefeated make love it that's the worst undefeated team that's ever want in a week for our you know how can you say that there you didn't like I'm not an ... fan I don't think they're good they're faceless I don't think they're good but he did have a good performance there\nYeah but what happens when he has real games coming up we're going to find that at home at the bears in two weeks yeah it'll be interested that exactly last night was such a weird game because the culture for I mean I never heard of half their skilled players and their defense apparently was it but it's a whole\nSecond now I Know it's the cold I I don't want to overreact it's how they're using these running backs that that's what I Want to say I want to see Edelman how they're using him a Josh Gordon how many times and getting the ball\nYou know that's what I Want to see because it disregard September with though now is when the season starts with a New England patriots and we're going to find out just how good they are I\nYou know I'm not big on their defense or you know Andrew Luck maybe it was ... defense and Andrew Luck did have a big night but you know I look at the patriots differently than any other team because it feels like those first four games\nDon't really matter they matter when you're assessing the chess pieces here and now the games begin for bell check a find a way did you see the quote from the defensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens\nOh on Baker acre may feel a you know the third\nOkay I Know that we're all in the high train I Know we're on the hype train when it comes to you know Patrick homes\nWhere you know he's the second coming of Elway and whoever he might be but this one caught me off guard so the ravens defensive coordinator Don Martin Dale his nickname is wink he says Baker Mayfield is the this generation's John Elway or bread far\n[noise] now I Know that you're facing him and we like to throw out verbal bouquets when that happens but ah he's making sure that his team doesn't take Baker Mayfield lightly or his confidence and swag\nHe said yesterday uh then he did his best to uh to pump up of his trades when he was sharing of what he told his defense about Baker Mayfield I already told the defense of this I think Baker may feel to this generation spread Farber John Elway\n[noise] the guy knows where he wants to go with the ball and he's very accurate he's got a quick release and he's really playing well and play that much he didn't look that good against Oakland\nCan't you just say he like eight that's how you have to get your defenses attention maybe she what do I do I mean she says oh let me see if I should say he's a man what do I say he's an ... way and far\nCould we just ease up a little bit here just a little bit of here anyway and ... combined yes so two of the greatest quarterbacks\nOf all time and after a win against the jets and a suspect performance against the raiders and all of a sudden his swag in his competed man ...\nGo out and play like I got we got to get him fired up here if not then they're going to take the browns lightly yes make love\nI'm noticing a trend you said about Andrew Luck was ... years do we overhyped quarterback is we want to be sold a head of the curve you remember Colin Kaepernick was going to change the position that I mean just like ... three was going to change the position they both got her cabinet lost his shoulder and R. G. three got her two two guys get hurt that's the other thing\nYeah blackout hurt but that's part of your style\nHow you play and you have to factor that in far played like he's in the backyard but he was durable\nAnd a whole lot bigger than Baker may feel junior the third L way was one of the greatest athletes whose ever played that\nPosition he had it all and was a very good baseball player I just you know we want to be out there in front we got to have a hot take you got to say he's the greatest we've ever seen it's like Patrick more homes doesn't have any weakness ... how did everybody miss on Patrick moms\nHow was he not the number one player taken\nEverybody miss this that and he reads the only guy who went you know you know he's got it all\nReally\nHe's got to cool off at some point they all do apple\nI you know it's funny you say that because a couple days ago you said that all these quarterbacks Vince Young Robert Griffin all these guys to explode on the scene eventually they get figure it out to some level you know the all time greats never get figure it out and maybe that's the difference there always developing their game Drew Brees you'd think at six foot with some at some point the exposed ...\nThe the all time greats never get found out they never have that Ron where they they stink for three years well\nWhat happens is you adjust its you come in them they're not quite sure who you are you know the judge said we didn't have a book on Baker Mayfield who was a ... Adams their safety didn't Jamal Adam Sunni say we didn't have a book on beggar Mayfield and then Todd Bowles is go goes well wait a minute no we did okay well\n... hall of famer joining a stand Patrick show also when we look at running back numbers for the hall of fame the passing numbers are going to be different in what we considered for the hall of fame and it feels like with the running back now I think you you're catches are going to be just as important as you're rushing you are guilty\nYou sure absolutely I think we have to look at the totality of you know yards for running back I mean you look at what a guy like out in the mirror is doing if he keeps his pace\nAnd there's no question he's gonna be a and they go into the hall of fame based all just his receiving numbers along catches you know the dynamic I'm you know athlete an employer that he is through the passing game not so much\nHis Russian so yeah you're right that's the way we're gonna have to start looking at running backs in the future\nWhat do you think maybe on bills strategy to announce a month before his return and right before the trade deadline that he's coming back with Pittsburgh\nYeah you know I'm sure it was strategic um I I just don't know ... why do it now you know say your come back you know in a month or so um\nYou know but hey I'm certainly get the reason why he's doing what he's doing um he believes this is obviously preserves his body but also maybe gives him a chance at the big contract with somebody else\nBut at the same time why do it at this point because everybody in that locker room in Pittsburgh locker room I'm sure it it takes them off because you're saying\nOh you know you feel our pain and and you wish you were here but you're not coming back for another month and so everybody in that ... is pretty ticked off that he came out and said that at this point\nYeah I understand what he's trying to do but that does it mean as a team made I have to be happy to see him come through that door of course I mean right when you have a problem with that\nWell you know I think um [noise] I don't know if I Would dare I'm not sure um you know I guess it just depends on how much the government to to uh our team\nBut he doesn't want to be out there though he doesn't want to be there you are the ones that will be there well\nI think he wants to be there but the team doesn't want to pay him so he doesn't want to be there if they don't want to paint\nYeah you know yeah\nI mean he wants to be in Pittsburgh if they pay you know and that's the majority of players and the national football league if you pay me ... Earl Earl Thomas I I Will be there\nBut if you don't you don't want to pay me you just want to use me then this is the attitude that I'm going to have against organization\nWhat do you think of her old Thomas though with being upset\nYeah I mean I certainly understand why he's upset I I just wish she would have to live in a in a different matter because you know Earl to me he got caught up in New Jersey is the motions of of what he's feeling towards the teen\nCertainly not for the players I think it's for the organization that and the way he felt like he's been treated and so he's laws to me\nYou know that that sense of what he means to everybody else to young players his famous people that look up to and his family members that wasn't a good look for early to leave the field in that manner\nOr do you still hate the patriots\n[noise] I don't I mean you know I was stumped into that\nWhen I played I you know I hated the page by the writers\nTo you know and it's so so that was\nJust kind of you know something that that when when I played I was just kind of built that way because I had so many problems with the patriots and the writers for the for that matter but no I mean I I've had the opportunity to really\nRespect what what they have done over the years and this is really tremendous to be able to to have that long ago\nOn that many championships to do it consistently that's what any ... so you got to admire with with those guys have done\nWho goes farther this year the rams are the chargers\nAre they are going to charge you to do and I'll tell you why um I I think the chargers it they're gonna\nGet going all the ... like they always do it just season progress but I think the road is much easier now for Kansas City is that division which is it looks like they're going to end up doing that I think\nThe chargers their role to run deep in the playoffs will be much\nEasier because to me the AFC is easier to him as she is\nYeah off man you got you got six seven teams that you can you can say that possibly as a chance of going to the Superbowl\nStill waiting for your Vikings Jersey that you promised me a couple of years to God and I know you do\nIt but I still got it um just wait I'm way no Jew while to to invite me you know to a charity event to something that you're doing it you know just just less be friends but just be fringe\nI didn't want to be friends I just wanted to Jersey guilty I mean I Would ask in a lot\nYou can get the Jersey without being friends how 'bout acquaintances okay I guess [laughter] okay here's the deal at the super bowl in Atlanta\nWe're going to have you on that and you know we can make it a big production we'd get up a band there you know it can be like a spotlight\nA you know wherever you know that sounds great but I'll tell you what like like we always do you have your people\nTalk [laughter]\nGreat to catch up with the algae thanks for joining us always a pleasure damn\nThing about that is a ... I think the first time we had the money was still in college yes right before the Heisman\nYeah and we always I just loved his attitude and then when you look at those numbers who he put up some numbers there and that's why he's a hall of famer\nOr you can catch all the every Sunday an NFL game day prime at eleven thirty eastern on NFL Network\nAnd Fox I\nSaw John group and had this quote I didn't hear it but I just saw the quote and uh the raiders didn't kick dirt when James because they had recently drafted some defensive backs a they drafted Carl Joe ship a back up another\n... back they waived in August so John ... said that uh if it was up to him he would have taken the rookie safety director when James\nEndure when James I think when a couple of pixilated Moore when James is the real deal he's a good player but ah he said he wanted to take Darwin James and the first round but unfortunately they took his safety in the first round and one of the second round and the two previous drafted the raiders selected coal Miller to pigs before James in\nThis year's drought so because you took to defensive backs who turned out to be bused you weren't going to drop another ... back because you're worried that he's going to be a bust\nSo you take out is called Miller's fill no how's Reggie McKenzie the general manager of the raiders field since he made that choice I think the raiders could used or when James\nFor weeks into the season and the raiders have allowed the second most points in the NFL it's not all about the ... Mack\nI don't want to I don't I I come a point guard I don't I don't want to I Need\nI I Love having another team involved in it if if we didn't do it like this I wouldn't do it it's just fun and then you people don't want to hear a singular voice in my opinion\nIt in my my my radio world and my radio head I don't want to hear even Howard Stern and a lot of the show the reincarnation the show is modeled after Howard's ability to bring in the guys who work for him he he makes you interested in characters it's not that I tune in for Howard Dean interviews\nOr you know I think Robin underrated Robin quiver is really I think in the last five years\nYou know the interviews are legendary with what he does but ... ... what I hear I Know how to interview\nBut to incorporate guys behind the scenes are guys who haven't been on are guys who weren't professional that's the hard part and Howard makes you interested in those people so if I'm a system I'm trying to follow Howard Stern system any other\nArtists and worked out well for him oh yeah you know sometimes in the past and we worked with for a long time\nYou'll come out that first second and once in a while you'll light somebody up and I remember you know what you've done it ... you always do it like every well you never know when it's coming wide ever tell you guys we we know actually there was a tell because you're quiet before the show and you don't mention anything about what we're going to talk about in the first time and then you just\nKind of eviscerate something or someone and program directors always say\nHave said to us that Key West and to do that every day and we're like well that would be fall\nYeah I don't I don't want to do that and and look I I I'm sure I'm indicting some radio host by saying what I've already said I I just I don't want to do a hot take to do a heartache\nIf I have one then I'll tell you I remember I didn't even tell the ... about the information on Baker Mayfield when I found out that the browns we are going to take a number on overall I wanted their reaction so when I said hey\nI got this news in ... you know all poor guys are like All right and I said it has to do with the top of the draft and who the Cleveland Browns or take but I wanted the reaction but I had this information and then when I said you know the browns they're going to take Baker may feel and everybody was shocked\nBut that's the fun part of this I liked the reaction I have a studio audience here and I take advantage of that we do give the audience a chance to call in or you can email you can tweet so you can be part of the show and speaking of being part of the show it is to meet friday and yes we have more meat Fridays songs\nYeah we've got a whole new batch of them will give me one here said\nAll right um this one seems to be fading it's a brand and in Utah okay\nFriday's [noise] um\nHow how come [noise]\nTo seeing then she let a reader and I like it would be a\n\nMedium\nYeah na na na na\nNa na\nYeah ... well\nA little Neil Diamond in their voice and I like airline yes that was probably spend to be hired an entire horn section of the company and I mean that's\nThat'd be caught in the river costs a lot to yeah ... yeah that'll such bad in a wet and we got a few more meat Fridays songs are coming up next to ours Joel ...

about his daughter that he was holding in his hands shatter headphones on and she's like one one and a half two years old you know probably one and\n... and it's so frenetic up there because it's why there's a hundred million people watching and you have to get three questions here and two questions here bringing this guy and this guy and the most obvious question that I could have ask was right in front of me and I didn't ask that question\nAnd it probably was going to be what are you going to tell your daughter about this when she's old enough to understand like it just something simple and you may illicit emotion or you know I get in the program from football talk but\nHe was right there holding his daughter and it still bothers me\nA but look I've made it a science or I attack it as a science of trying to get good answers out of people and most host don't they want to hear their voices\nUm and it's because they haven't been trained as really came down to that comes down to that until I took a seminar that was five days eight hours a day for a week I really wasn't sure what I was doing I knew I wanted to get an answer I\nKnew how to get to an answer I thought a lay the

anybody ever coal Mr ... George Steinbrenner any any of the players\n[laughter] yeah I mean boomer wells Heathrow imagine that huh [laughter]\nYeah well he could get away with it I'm just curious 'cause even now you know everybody talks with such reverence with a George Steinbrenner that it's always Mr ...\nYeah I mean I I had heard\nFrom some that are on your degree guys played in the seventies that said you know he had really\nMellowed out by the time that that you know that the teams got together in the nineties in two thousand and I can't have enough respect for the guy because when I came over it seemed like you know he had as much on the line as far as winning and losing as a team did and you can't say that about a lot of our general managers and owners and anything we ever needed\nTo win a he would go out and try to do and to me that was a remarkable owner\nI was curious about the Dodgers approach to the Braves uh you know that you don't have played in crucial going in game one and then played encourage all said yesterday in a press conference he has nothing to prove\nThese guys who were great during the regular season how do you explain whether it's bad luck or coincidence that some of the greatest pitchers of all time have not been great postings in pictures [noise]\nYeah I I think that it it gets broken down that way and it's not just some baseball in sports I mean a period I mean you look back at the you know John Elway before he won the Superbowl so it was the same thing it was Jim Kelly it just it it it goes on with sports because people remember wins but\nYou know if you're a great pitcher you're a great pitcher do you get it in your head\nAfter you've had done numerous bad\nOutings probably and the media right about it and then you start to believe that probably ... ... you know I I'm sure that the the Dodgers um if they had a game seven I'm In a new series with the very confident with Kurdish all on them out I mean his numbers are they speak for themselves but\nYou know David crisis kind of in that same boat as far as um you know yet to really dominate a playoff series\nBut then you go to ... like what they're certain guys who just become bigger they become faster they become strong there was just something about it that maybe they're just entertainers they loved the stage there how do you explain shelling or ...\nSomething you know Jack more some of these guys are just they love the moment they weren't afraid\n[noise] yeah I I think that you know your last comment they weren't afraid I mean if you're the ability of\nNot being a afraid and and being able to concentrate at grade level or without being overwhelmed in those situations I'm kind of make you a break here but uh there are guys that um that are just better under pressure on me Derek Jeter to me\nYou couldn't tell us who's opening day of his game seven of the world series his demeanor never changed where you know you can see some players squeezing that bad and trying to force things because you want it so much in play off some World Series that are sometimes backfires and uh you know fortunately\nUh you know if you were with the Yankees you had a lot of opportunities year after year\nTo you know have to make up for a bad series where you know a lot of players you go to the world series maybe once in your career and you don't have a great world series then it's written like you know what ... you didn't\nYou didn't produce under pressure but unless you\nYou know you have a you know a little larger sample size it's very hard to judge somebody\nA movie or a former teammates told me about a another one of your teammates that if he struck out he wanted to make sure he looked good striking out did you\n[laughter] you know talking about it [laughter] no I
