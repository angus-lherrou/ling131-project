all that upset that got leaked either in the interview now he had no point\nWas he like yeah this is garbage and somebody told me out and I'm really mad about and that's why I Want out of here he was like\nOkay fine you had to do all that [noise] here's Jimmy Butler keeping it real by keeping it real\n[laughter] oh it could be it could be but a new I think so because you've got to be honest I mean honestly do I think so no I'm being honest with you but everybody's going to be honest no no everybody's not going to be artists\nLike if you're going to say what's on auto what Jim you said it in practice but oh I don't know\nThe honest I don't care and that's all we can do about it now when the honest\nOkay how about we be honest in and we say to Jimmy give me the players who don't care I mean look we are going to be honest here because if you spoken to him about it I mean if everything is transparent were gonna put on the table then it's just being honest here is kicking around to be honest\nWho doesn't really care who's mailing in and who doesn't play as hard as you do because he didn't say he plays hard and he does\nBut the passion\nThat has all of a sudden this passion just dripping out a Jimmy Butler here's some more about caring for Jimmy Butler am I being a tough one\nThat's how I Am I'm not the most talented player who's the most talented player on the cat\nWho is the most guys and gifted player on our teams\nWaves we got the wrong is our biggest asking jumped the highest run the fastest but like oh pi is the hardest me I'll play hard I play a really hard I put my body on a lot every day in practice every day in and game ... fast my past and that's how I give to the game that's how I give you guys\nAnd and everybody want to talk about some leadership everybody leaves in different ways that's how I so I'm here for you I Want you to be great\nRight [noise] I was reading Sam ... um he writes a Amigo hoops and um\nHe said that an opposing general manager says to me ... immature and selfish um that he wouldn't waste of time trying to acquire the all star forward I'm also goes on to say um I wouldn't\nTrade him I tell him stop whining onto your contract report to work I tell him to be a man he's what almost Thirty years of age grow up time to grow up immaturity selfish there's basically all the things that are wrong with basketball the opposing GM's said it's not even an NBA problem it's a basketball problem the current system is teaching great players\nThat they're entitled at a very young age is it any surprise that they're acting or they're acting entitled as adults Jimmy is just the product debate flawed basketball system that's poisoning the NBA\nUm\nLet's see the GM also points to the current state of the NBA where players constantly jumping teams and that's the problem the bronze the best player in the league he switched teams three times now Kevin Duran switch teams to mark his cousin showing the warriors Kyrie Irving demanded a trade\nThis is the way of the league now the best players are doing it why definitely not for the right reasons\nI I don't know Jimmy Butler I don't know if he's immature or shellfish but\nUh this feels like this was a ... coup like I'm going to get I'm going to get it back I'm gonna do management's gonna have to say you know what we can't keep him around 'cause look I I as I pointed this out of being in a while ago call Anthony towns in an through Andrew wages aren't big on Jimmy bought her\nBut I understand where they look at this guy like okay well you stop harping on us or we're not good enough or you know ...\nThese kids are used to be entitled they don't want to hear this timid oh it was a tough guy ... who is the guy who would be doing this you know need a link them and getting them to be better and they should be better Minnesota should be\nA top for top five to they really should be a buddy of Jimmy Butler doesn't so Jimmy ... talking about his passion and then once you be traded like how much she really loves being here in Minnesota and this team and making them better but hey I Want to be traded you can't have both answering\nBut can he be more passionate about winning then he has about staying at the team I mean if he's talking about these guys are a bunch of kids and they don't play hard they don't want to when they don't care about winning I Want to go somewhere where we went in because I'm more passionate about basketball than I Am to this one team\nI don't see why that's actually that's the problem with the NBA is that the ... some guys care too much about winning and they were calling out there are other players who don't care\nI mean that doesn't make a lot of sense to me that doesn't sound like selfish behavior I'd rather go someplace wouldn't you rather play somewhere where you were going to win and you played with other people who cared\nDon't you think that he staged this so he now has to get out they have to get rid of him so he does he really care about winning\nI mean it it's about him it it's not about winning when it when does Jimmy Butler one\nDid he do this and other stops did he be re Dwayne wade that maybe Dwayne wade didn't want to win in Chicago I like I I don't know and Jimmy mother was has been a great story\nBut it felt like this was just so happened that Rachel Nichols who's here and let me tell you everything that happened 'cause I'm going to be real here coincidence\nThat I think you're a hundred percent right I think he's stage of the whole thing that I think it's a total farce a but\nThat doesn't mean necessarily that he's the bad guy he's trying to force their hand a little bit he's trying to get out of a situation he doesn't want to be in and maybe he's not using the right tactics necessarily but I could find a lot more flaws are false and the guy than being like I Want to actually win\nYeah and then you're yelling at management you bleep it made me here but you don't want to be there right in and is there is there a way to motivate Carl Anthony towns in Andrew wagons by just ... you know by being a true leader not by denigrating them\nInterested that that was bizarre I mean this was the number one trending story for a couple of hours yesterday and I'm thinking this is Jimmy Butler\n... he's a really good player he was a top Fifteen player I guess but\nAnd I thought Houston was going to be a death but I don't know what GM's are gonna thing no are you now what do you get for him what are you giving up for him who are you getting in return but what a mess in Minnesota and\nAll of a sudden this information leaked I'm guessing the timber wolves front office is probably a ... day by the way it should be butler saying Rachel Nichols hey I Need you here in Minnesota 'cause I'm going to go off I I'm going to have some things to say\nIt's rare when somebody calls you and says hey I Need you to come in for a sit down and maybe Rachel, Rachel was working on this but then all of a sudden the timing of that\nThat she comes to town he explode all the information comes out it didn't seem like he was you know bummed out that these people hey you know what I Would ever happen in practice it stays in practice because I that's the passion I have it was like oh you want to talk about that sure we can talk about that apple\nWhen Jimmy bother retreated from the ... of the temporal he said just let me be a player for the ... man I don't need to be the face of organization whose team is it all that means nothing you know I've learned face of the team eventually you're going to be see the back of his head is leaving town said no thanks and you know seemed like he wants to be the face of the team\nLeaving town yeah yeah I Will take a break well a check in with the timber wolves yes you you are you're puzzled by this whole scenario or do you think that this was played out like everybody thought even front office and Jimmy Butler do they get played out like they thought it would have hoped it would\nNo I mean I think I'd even that quote of him leaving Chicago and going to like to me right now with the with the behavior that I'm seeing I don't think that he's saying I Want to go to a team so I can be the man\nYou know where he could be the face of the team I I still don't see that in his behavior he does seem a little ... for sure and I think that obviously this whole thing was stage just like you said but this whole this passion\nI mean could God well it is odd to be you know like that's just the way I play that's my Rob passion and when you're in between the lines and you're playing that somebody like that's why you're calling at the gym and uh playing against the GM what do you talk so dumb yeah you embarrass the geo doesn't make any sense oh righty\nPeter King will join us how important is this game tonight for ...\nMy ... and I'm Talking about this season of it you know if he continues to sort of be law is there anything that they can do during the season\nOr are they going to get locked into a top five ... talked to Peter King about tonight's game also Tom Brady has some comments about what the NFL has become a shocker we've seen this coming for about a decade now\nThe style of often says he didn't say it was being twelve foot ball but he might as well just said we're playing big twelve football and coincidentally\nHe goes against Patrick more homes and a Kansas City on Sunday night so few things talked to Peter about your phone calls are welcome and we'll get a poll question status today play the day all of that coming up here on the damn Patrick show\nOh heads up every buddy you've probably heard\nBy now hackers exploited as security vulnerability at Facebook potentially exposing the personal information nearly fifty million accounts attackers stole\nWhat are called access tokens and they can use those to take over people's accounts accents or access tokens or like digital keys that keep people logged in them so they don't need to re enter their password Everytime Facebook says they fix the vulnerability and inform law enforcement it doesn't matter\nI Want you to tell me if you're a furry and you're monitoring the pocket\n... in the world are you supposed to do I can tell you these officials who've gotten out of the game [noise] I I just I'm telling you they're thrilled to not have to chew ... impossible\n[noise] talking to Peter King NBC Sports would mourning in America a giant you an eagles coming up tonight I don't know if there's a point where can he like play themselves out of this role this year\n[noise] then you know the funny thing about this he like saying that everybody's talking about\nHe lie as though this is sort of a new thing I mean the and this has been happening\nFor years it's been you know he lie is quite possibly and there's been a lot of great ones over the years are the best most gentlemen Lee high achieving player\nUh since I've been around New York sports uh you know and I believed in the area since Nineteen eighty five he's an amazing human beings look there's a lot cruise community and all that but has anybody been watching football the last five or six years\nI mean by most metrics he's in the lower quadrant and maybe even lower than that in almost everything\nAnd and I I don't know what people thought was going to happen this year he line needs to have tremendous protection you know\nThat's all there is to do you need to have great protection and they saw offensive line even though it's got some new peace is a is not protecting Eli nor creating an alpha ... Berkeley\nAnd so when that happens the off chance is going to be is all and that's pretty much what you've seen\nBut based on that was sequenced filled the right pick if if\nI don't think so and I never did so I mean I I I've all I've always taught in look\nTotally respect Dave Letterman ah because I think he believes in this was told to me that there was not one of these quarterbacks even after may feel we loved enough to take anywhere very high so if that's what he chose\nThe giants basically now have to think that in the top five next year which probably order there'll be drafting in the top five next year\nThey're going to have to get a they're going to have to get a a quarterback maybe the Oregon kid or you know look I don't watch much college football so I have to get one of those guys they probably should have gotten them this year\nA look Dave Gettleman has proven it as well as to ... you know he's taking Christian McCaffrey number eight he's taken said calling Barclay number two he goes against the grain and he's a little bit of a of a personnel dinosaur in that regard\nYou ah where did you make of a deal Beckham and his sit down with a ESPN\n[laughter] I I\nDon't I don't know I think it was almost like little little Wayne was who was his blanket you know was his security or whatever I I don't really understand why that was ate together\nInterview but I don't know I guess they're friends I you know\nLook you know they'll back um took the money and he's got to accept the fact that I mean why do you sign a contract if a ... you've been begging for the contract yeah any sign the contract and you have four or five bad week that gets four at the time he did that in every\nUh and all of a sudden it's time to jump ship dude you're not going anywhere you better make the best of this\nUh the cowboys situation it feels like there's you know like an an undercurrent there with jak Prescott as to the future of this franchise has their quarterback you got you know Jerry and jazz and Allen Hern questioning ... and so what do you make of the cowboys so far this season\nUm [noise] I mean I make a deck prescribe it simply has to be better I'm\nA tree eight men have some telling comments on the radio in Dallas this week on the ticket that where he said essentially you know quarterback has the anticipate stuff that happens in a secondary and he simply has to be more accurate or he has to be an accurate passer and I think those are two things are right now that you see\nThat are that are a troubling deck Prescott and I understand they don't have the franchise receiver him a lot of teams don't have a franchise receiver and they figure out a way to get it done I think the other issue here is Jerry Jones Jason Garrett the funniest quota the week was Jerry Jones saying I'm not second\nGuessing we should've gone or an aunt ... [laughter]\nAh but but\nYou know a pro football focused those numbers for my column every week and I asked him this week\nOil is lower the chances of the cowboys making that\nAre making that fourth down at a win win Garrett on it and and they came back its I forget it was either Seventy three Seventy five percent\nAnd so you know you got it there are times in the NFL where you've got to take chances I didn't even think that was a particular chance the chance to be taken was hunting the ball and hoping to get it back and be able to score and win the game and obviously they didn't do that so I think in general the and\nI think we've seen a shift starting last year with Doug Peterson\nCoaches are basically thrown away the old book you know they thrown away the right wing book\nAnd I think we're doing stuff that is not only a little bit out there in traditional football but is a smarter play but you know Frank writes sixty three percent chance that that they were going to make a plan for for\n... you know against Houston when everybody's killing Frank rake well that's better than fifty percent now you can question which ... what what categories pro football focuses using but I've seen it I've seen how they do that it all seems logical to me and the fact is there are times when you have to say to your team\nLook it's a smarter id even though that seems very against the grain and just look and see what Doug Peterson did all last year uh he he he set the stage for what's happening right now and I think I think coaches need to go to school on this and go to school on a pretty quick\nOr how desperately do think of the eagles or I'm trying to secure a running back at pitch was showing the quarterly beyond bill\nI think they have to they have to get one um and I think I I\nDon't think they want to settle themselves with another salary you know likely be on bill they they don't have the legal room right now long term to be paying levy on bell like ... to\nUh they just they don't they don't have that that kind of money right now long term to spend ... makes more sense to me I think it's interesting over the next two weeks I think the bill to lose a couple of games you know that Brandon being is huge really\nA fan of remaking his team he's ... he's had no hesitancy in trading with anybody for anything at any time highly Rosen is pretty much the same thing so it wouldn't surprise me I'm not anticipating it but it wouldn't surprise me but they definitely have to go out and get some help and they are ...\nWhat would be your biggest concern with the rams right now or maybe long term this season\nInjuries and the secondary um you know markets Peters wasn't themselves last week and ah you know since he's been hurt 'em there obviously without totally maybe for the season but at least for you know eight or ten weeks um that's the biggest concern I Would have like what happens if\nI mean and and then I'm just throwing this out there because you know obviously we're we're only about four months ahead of ourselves or what happens if they play in the super bowl in Kansas City with the existing rosters that each team has with the trouble that the rams are having in the secondary now they don't have a great outside rush\nAt all they barely every good outside rush and so uh if if Patrick my home's essentially a has that secondary to ...\nAnd the ability to run around an escape or you know the interior rush that the ... I probably would like the chiefs in that game but again it in the long season you never know but the secondary the ... I think would be concerning\n... a good to visit with you said travels thanks for joining us as always\nA You're welcome to and have a great day\nMatch Peter King NBC Sports football mourning in America\nColumn Weber play of the day I got out of the day coming up the I'm Patrick ... up to this [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] now to start your next painting project before the holiday season arrives you'll find everything you need a fresh enough to look at your home including ... seen resisting paint primary and one that gives you everyday protection against Saddam Hussein's learning and just twenty seven Ninety eight\nAnd don't forget the valves barge Russia's rollers and other paintings applies to make sure you get the perfect vanish\nThe pay desk in store to learn more projects have a starting point and start with low [noise]\nHe needs the younger guys who have those legs\nThat he doesn't have to do all the work in Cleveland he was doing all the work that's the key he he has to sort of Porsche this out then I Can't do it all the time every night I Can't play oh eighty two games I Can't play record setting minutes for me and the club\nI think what you said it's hard for everybody to imagine the old and the new fitting together I just don't see be to be submitted everyone's going to be unhappy\n[noise] well I think if you were ... and that's my problem with this you know I don't know what to be easy you know is going to want to do he's got to get his touches or how ... play together is long to a starter\nMeal is Josh hardest starter charisma you know you get that little level of success and then all of a sudden you're like well wait a minute here it's like when LeBron came back to Cleveland with Kyrie inquiries like ... wait a minute or this was my team\nAnd then Kyrie who said recently hey I knew how this is going to play out that's why I wanted out of Cleveland effort\nIs it a matter of time before all of our bobble singer do something that's going to take off abroad because I'm like how the brunt as a measuring with his son during the course of history\nWell I think if I'm management I said a ... if you want your son to stay on the Lakers as the Lakers so it's convenient for you to come and see him every night\nUm then let's not say anything that was that that that that's that's our agreement here you know we like ... good kid maybe they've already done that but that would be my approach would buy magic and it's been quite quite summer for a little far\nI haven't seen him on any of these uh you know I'll take shows but that's probably a good thing but if I'm magic I say look Lamar we got something special\nYour son's going to learn from LeBron and but let's make it about them not about you it's making about them up on\nHad a fun game or playing next week than we're putting together who does not finished the knees and on the lake or roster game or playing mid week next room and where to go or all the way down the line\nMean spirited yeah no fast but I Know you're thinking of some names yeah but I I don't I don't\nKnow I should say if anybody is shipped out but other than if somebody gets injured my clients Stevenson has a role as long as you understand your role but these guys are on one year deals and they know how do I proved my value here to either you keep me or I get another opportunity so I don't think you'll have too many ... had moved here\nAt least I I wouldn't forecasting\nA got a tweet here at a B perk look at the teams on Jimmy Butler's list he doesn't care about going to a winner he cares about himself the nets Knicks clippers in heat is a better chance of winning by staying in Minnesota\nIn very good point that airport Mm very good very fair point yeah this was this was all orchestrated yeah I'm surprised you didn't have Spielberg in there or Scorsese\n... how do we set this up ... orchestrated this now that this was this was a stage production and I think Jimmy Butler did what he wanted to do he got his word out I care I'm trying to motivate these guys I'm about winning a passion\nYou know I didn't leak this story but boy Rachel it's nice that you showed up here after I had my blow up L. in practice\nI don't know how often this happens in fairness to Jimmy ... does he do this often they do another stumps they do in previous games years\nDid you do it last year I I I don't know but we'll find out I'm gonna ask you were going to have a beat writer on a cover in the Minnesota Chippewa 'cause it is is this is personality it does this all the John\nOh ...\nWhat kind of pull question do we have a glove and I actually put it up as a place holder is Jimmy Butler a top team player and the NBA and see where people are ...

watch a little bit of Atlanta with Trey young kept the game winner\nFrom about thirty feet with a couple of seconds left on the clock but uh that might be one of the highlights but the hawks are you know it's going to betray you and you're going to tune in to watch him and he's he's fine not consistent but he's fine\nThen do that's what I saw last night and as far as the Lakers and that was fun too\nAnd and I used to I just tune in because I I'm not I don't have great expectations with the Lakers\nBut my expectation is to see progress in fun and just to see how LeBron makes those younger players better how those younger players don't get caught up in watching LeBron play\nBecause I think you're going to get caught up early and then after that you have to view him as he's just a tease my teammate he's he's a great teammate nobody's going to let you know if you're doing something wrong there\nBut uh that that's what I'm curious about here and it was really important for the Lakers last night it was an important for Golden State they couldn't care less\nBut it was important for the Lakers interest that energy that feel and liberal and having fun and seeing these other younger players [noise] All right um anything else needs to be mentioned here\nI Am an alternative ... should be on it oh okay I'm sitting on this one which would you rather watch on Sunday chief said patriots or all the other NFL games on this late that day it said not a juicy slate what is the second best game this weekend Steelers Bengals maybe no I'm\nA I'm\nA ... cowboys which always Steelers

want to see what's happening with Jamison the and the bucks no no we ended up finding the bucks for like the number one team we were talking about the first three weeks of the season\nBut this means you can't watch chiefs patriots\nHuman their storylines here how we go to those storylines the over under cheese patriots in sixty\n... what's the over under tonight 'cause there's rain in the forecast for the eagles and the hell are you going to call your guy you know or honors forty four and a half torrential rain all day ... ... ... whenever trench all means ... village given three to

that game in Cincinnati ... ... ... ... ... it's out of your right it's not a great gave it to division again they they'll ... where's the jags cowboys\nThat is in Dallas and well that's good too yeah because this is against the great defense\nBut it's a defensive just faced Kansas City\nAnd now you have the cowboys that's I I'm curious how the the cowboys try to\nPut some life back into that often it's against the best defense in football yeah point Jimi ... really screwed up Monday Night football for yeah he's Packers yeah ... yeah they're already uh flexing out of one of those prime time the rams game\nThe niners I think ah NBC flexed out of that and I thought they might stay with it just because you still have the rams in that market and lead America she the rams playing prime time again like eleven\nBy if they do at least watch all the titans are on a by this week that is a team that you always slip away from I think more than any other teams are always in like a nine six battle in the fourth quarter something ... happened but the AFC South a little bit lower on the watch of building\nYes it is it's a it's a sad division yes point I could easily miss the dolphins gaming highlights okay ...\nDoesn't bother me even a bit and the\n... not that bad ...\nIraq and just ... compelling not compel you that's\nPart of this where you just want to be relevant\nWhere somebody tunes in for one player or you're you're white and like Baker Mayfield made the browns relevant you tune into watching whether you like him or not you tune in to watch him he's almost like the train young of ah you know in the NFL like there's a curiosity factor when you're watching him\nBut these other teams when you don't you're just not tuning into watching them\nEven when they're in the red zone with Andrew silly on those same into the titans are in the ... and it's like okay the dolphins are in the ... a good uh Brian in Minnesota joined just before we take a break Hi Brian\nHey good morning Dan morning but hey as far as that Jason Garrett not being the head coach I think I'm gonna have to go ahead and you disagree with you on that right now okay [noise] ah [noise] I think Jerry needs him and he meets Jerry you said you wouldn't want that gig [noise] you know if you were a coach and that's because you probably have some level of\nPride and feel like you're like you're confident and you want to be in control\nI don't think Jaycee Dugard neat that I think he\nIs not working the bill Brian\nJerry not working but it's working for Jerry Jerry gets to run it who else are they gonna run it's almost like I don't know the word might be talking a little\nIs that a bad word I Hope that's not bad learned get is like I think it is is it okay to block it out on our home ... out on the ...\nYeah it's it's like a well it's almost like Jerry cares more about where he is on top than he is about when it\nAll right well thank you Brian ... well ... yeah yeah\nI'm Still laugh at your Jerry Jones is going to be the gym coach and and in order to get three ... three press conferences\nYeah he just goes out and then changes into a different outfit and then comes back in and I think that's the way to do it but uh I you know at some point Jerry Jones has to say I'm sort of impeding progress here where I'm at no maybe done maybe done but if if it's not working and it hasn't worked what makes you think it's going to continue\nThat point was two thousand five not now\nNow now I Will take a break we'll check in with the Minnesota timber wolves more phone calls coming up or

of mixed messages\nHere I Am not sure what it's all about in the end only he really knows that and and even he is sending mixed messages about what he wants\nTo think this was all scripted yesterday\n[noise]\nThere's definitely an element of it that was scripted um I I I don't think ESPN just randomly shows up and and ... butler doesn't come back to practice\nThat particular day are all on a coincidence so I Do think there is some element of orchestrating to it um but you know this this is a this is how the sausages made some of these situations you know it's it's a it's a it's definitely a PR move\n'em you know we had her from from me throughout this whole process and he wanted to make a statement in a big way and and this was how he did it\nWhat happens today\nThe symbols we're supposed to have practiced a at about noon or one o'clock and then we were supposed to have media availability after practice so you know we're thinking we're going to be hearing from some players that were going to be hearing from pseudo but we just got a message a few minutes ago that they cancelled the actors today and so\nThey're often Milwaukee to play a preseason game on friday and now this is going to be layering you kind of in the public narrative for the next twenty four hours with nobody to\nSpot to it nobody to downplay it nobody to talk about it and they'll go to Milwaukee for their game on friday where it's still going to be an issue and we'll see if Jimmy Butler's there he did tell ESPN but he would practice today if there was a practice so it'll be interesting to see if she actually sits up tomorrow night in Milwaukee\nGood ... good luck with the ... and good luck with a job there Chris we appreciate your time bake a dad appreciate it\nChris Pine Minneapolis Star Tribune covering the Minnesota timber wolves\nHe just started covering the timber wolves in recent weeks imagine that you walk right into that here was another story that got a lot of attention or a little more attention than I thought LeBron James kids um he explains why let his sons ages fourteen eleven drink wine with him and this came out\nAnd a liberal on it that you know told USA Today's Josh Peter everything that uh\nThey he's talking about his teenage everything that they listen to these days my fourteen year old in my eleven year old they watch two and an apparent effort to prove his sons are up to date with those young Laker teammates\nLeBron James revealed a little secret about his boys drinking habits in the process I've got very mature fourteen year old an eleven year old my fourteen an eleven year olds drink wine that's how mature they are\nBenny a joke that there'll be driving a next week or when I ask what kind of wine they drink LeBron left reporters guessing before taking the blame for any criticism that might come in his way whatever dads and moms happening he said\nPut it on me though don't put it on mom's put it on dad put it on debt\n[noise] I'm I'm not surprised that this happened so I was surprised that it was made public by LeBron because she's usually pretty PR shabby here and I'm not here to tell anybody how to parent um you know\nWhat I Do and exposing my shoulder and now you know they're twenty three twenty seven and how I expose them to alcohol is going to be different than somebody else do I want you exposed to it or at least understand what it is a do it in a controlled environment the taste of it\nBecause a bench you're going to be on your own and my wife and I looked at this and said I Would rather that they were with us if they tasted it\nOr they understood it they're around people who haven't ... been around people who act stupid when they've been drinking so they they are at least aware of it by the time to get to college or high school\nBecause don't kid yourself\nThis stuff that goes on and you don't think goes on with your kid [noise]\nChances are it is and it has and it does but I think LeBron wants to parent his kids this way that's up to him and his wife\nAnd by all accounts seems like he's done a pretty good job of parenting but when it comes to how you want to ... your child or discipline your child or what you expose them to\nThat's up to you are but I Know the mothers against drunk driving came out against LeBron James there were some pushback from people saying you know you shouldn't be doing is and if you say you're doing it than other parents might look at it maybe they don't handle it the same way you do that was what's surprising that the brawn James made it public\nBecause I don't think there was any upside to as much as you want to say your kids are mature you know they're mature you don't have to tell us their richer and if they are mature will notice that but when it came to this uh I was surprised because he's PR shabby\nYeah for the\nNumbers Wilson thank you thank you [laughter] oh by the way we got a a new song in addition to meet friday this is the status of the day this isn't any of those things what what what's the tone of it well she was the one who found this out and do you want to give us a little backdrop here on this song damn Patrick shown\nIt can almost be a theme song it feels like because it's really just sort of a I don't have any sort of box to put it in\nIt just somebody who is a big fan of the show yeah page ... page Gen and and but she's famous for something other than she is like an Internet sensation isn't she correct famous for falling actually okay she's got some really funny videos a milk shake one is our favorite\nOh my gosh it's amazing but she sends me all these videos and then I go with which they have to do with this song and he goes that's the girl in those videos who sang the song about the show\nAnd I went oh All right 'cause the song is titled Dan Patrick\nAnd I think it's on ... yeah [laughter] All right well this is what it sounds like it if you're watching an audience channel two thirty nine direct TV in the NBC Sports network we did incorporate some of her videos in there uh and so this is what it sounds like\n\n[noise]\nTrying to run over a proposal\nFor\nFarm\nRobot\nI

love and you okay with ... mile high yeah that's fine and actually I kinda think that sounds better than darkness\nAll right we'll take a break here will come back ah we gotta stay out of the day more of your phone calls as well or back after this gym or for that will join us in the final hours of the show yeah Patrick show [noise]\n\n\n\nThursday Night Football on one\nIn the NFL\nAnd they came in

you rather be in right well thank you I've been um here's the thing at least Jerry is competitive I don't know James Dolan is competitive\nI man\nI I I guess I Would still rather have Jerry because I I Do think that there is\nHis pride is putting a good product out there it just he ... he doesn't always it gets in a way sometimes of doing that and I you know go back to the draft when it's you know Jerry one of the ...\n\nAnd and you got to jak Martin can be a hall of famer and he won a Johnny ... and like the shiny new object there and so Jerry can get in the way of Jerry and then yeah\nI don't care if he takes credit for it but they were going to take Johnny Manziel against a great deal over and often said well I'm an amicable\nSo someone's helping him in situations like they've trap it's good players lately but George Steinbrenner used\nTo do this dirty mind Brenner would go\nGet rid of this guy and then somebody say no like Jean Michel was always that like the guy would always say no no no you don't want to get rid of Andy Pettitte Shan didn't send me to Philadelphia you want to keep Andy Pettitte he's a great pitcher ball right will keep it\nAnd then George can take credit for Andy Pettitte being a great pitcher for the Yankees but there'll be times when you just get emotional you're getting ready to train for that guy\nAnd then somebody say no you don't want to trade for that or\nDo you sometimes have that but I don't know who has Jerry's year just said you know Jerry don't don't do that\nWell Steve and the sun and I'm kind of running thing now\nI guess But Jerry is just that's why he drafted you know some of these shady characters there he's just desperate you know Greg Hardy is a leader he not a leader he talented player\nBut he's desperate to win a Super Bowl won more Super Bowl and you go back to that fractured relationship between him and Jimmy Johnson I mean you had a the ideal coach\nOne of the great coaches and it didn't work out what makes you think it'll work out with any other coach and anybody who stands up to him and that's the unfortunate part you\nKnow Robert Craft as an ego but Robert Craft smart enough to know\nYou know how I look better when that team wins and that's why he led spell check you know pretty much do what he needs to do\nAny of these great coaches in teams you look at the man of ... when did you ever hear from the owner of the spurs\n[laughter] it it's even rarer if you hear from our seed view for the GM just stay the hell out of the way\nThat Dr bus would just led Jerry West being Jerry West and that was good enough you just said and Jerry didn't care about the the spotlight\nBut you're paying people to win for you and Jerry Jerry's on capable of doing that for some reason Kevin in Massachusetts Jacob\nWhat's going on than first time caller from a gospel national she bought a retired air force veteran sixty one years old six three two hundred\nAnd my question is about the patriots just curious about\nHow much longer do you think that they're going to last us a dynasty his let everybody thinks they're starting to and then people say well maybe it's not um I get the feeling is going to have to deal with like go ballot shark and Tom Brady leaving at some point and I want to do what you thought about their future\nI think as long as you had those two you're in great shape thanks for the phone call Kevin ... as long as you have everything in place there then I think you're you're fine because Brady has it down to assist them they just plug and play with these off into players ... but if it changes with spell check\nYou know Josh McDaniel ... you know those are big shoes to fill a is he capable of doing that you have to do they bring in a general manager to help\n'em after Brady who comes in\nThis battle check on a ... check on to prove I can win without Tom Brady would Brady want to continue to play in front of proof he could win without bell checked for do they go out at the same time\nThey're worse problems to have been what the patriots F.

Believe everyone deserves a second chance we all are humidity we've all made mistakes\nWe get over your radio take is once they should we take and you're ... if you don't like you know watch we've come into your life span\nAnd you know everybody thought even as he kill LA like should they have gone that high for running back\nNobody says that any more jak Prescott you got him and you know you could that was a real surprise now granted that's not who they wanted I think they wanted Connor Cook out of Michigan State\nBut and then they were looking at dairy car but you know they got ... got a but dealing looking at this team down the road how good can they be there's you're in a bad division where nine wins can you can make the playoffs with nine wins it feels like this year\nAnd how many playoff ... how many playoff appearances have they had in the last ten years Fifteen Years yeah I'm a club\nThe two thousand sixteen to thousands fourteen and then you go back to two thousand nine yeah fourteen was the really good year actually sixteen to they were thirteenth racy they've had some excellent seasons but no postseason Sam I mean this is so silly but any any chance he should have stuck with Romo maybe they kicked him to\nKnow no I don't think physically he could have done it I I don't I Know that he says he feels better now that he's ever felt but that he needed his body to heal and Tony Romo was not going to be the answer you know Tony is a better quarterback the dad Prescott when they're both playing at their best\nBut you know that Prescott did all the right things when you were Thirteen and three\nAnd the office was great he did everything right but you know now you're now you're asking quarterback quarterbacks win games for you\nYou can't throw for two hundred yards unless you're rushing for a hundred and Seventy five you can't throw for two hundred yards quarter but I look at all these quarterbacks they're winning games apple\nAnd the odd thing is that the defense of starting to play pretty well yeah I got some good line backers could pass rush for the first time in a long time jailing Smith is really\nGood hailing Smith that was another great draft pick breakout star yes they took a trip man can he fly to Marcus Lawrence Vander ... they they took\nHim in the first round because of Sean leads propensity for being injured\nYeah it'd be OK he had a big game and he said yeah but he's he's learning on the job at a tough position replacing Sean late\nBut you know people thought that maybe a Calvin Ridley would have been a smarter choice there's a wide receiver Jerry talks about you know we don't have a number one wide receiver when I think a number one wide receiver I think of Julio Jones\nWell what are the falcons do with Julio Jones\nThey drafted Calvin Ridley\nSo even with a number one wide receiver it doesn't hurt having a couple of very good wide receivers and they don't have that\nYou know ... replacing Whitman okay might take a little while there's Brian All right but you get you don't have anybody who scares anybody there that's part of the problem and that hurts\nSee what happens but um I I feel like I'm at a really good place than in my career right now I'm comfortable with how I'm playing and how I Am as a as a basketball player and I feel like you know wherever I'm going to play\nLike an opportunity I'm going to be able to succeed and a niche though I'm excited to see what happens is off to\nThe gym or for joining us after putting up for forty ... you put up forty shots against the rockets\n[laughter] I Know right ultimate green light [laughter]\nAs you did you know that you had forty shots you shot more than hardened is\n[noise] no I did not know that I mean I knew that I saw quite a bit\nUm you know I I was out there just playing aggressively obviously I've played the whole game and um you know you know it's difficult you know with the rockets typically on the way they play defense because they just switch everything\nSo we were running our plays you know what I mean they just switched everything and then everybody's like wall that didn't work so what are we supposed to do now and so I just tried to get the ball and tried to be really aggressive tried to make something happen\nA lot of times off of the ... than a one on one situation or whatever and just trying to be it'd be aggressive and uh you know obviously it's put up a lot of shots but uh you know it's a fun way to play basketball for\nSure oh yeah man I'm so enemy and the green light [laughter] what'd harden said too\nHigh said just keep working as I keep working you know and you're you're ... I think he respects my game and obviously I respect his game being an unbelievable basketball player that BP\nHad a great season last year and a you know ... try to see how they do this year I'm as as far as coming back from the year that they had last year but I think they're motivated and playing hard but uh yeah I Know we just you know exchange presence trade is real quick and everything and that we're on the basketball\nWho's game ... who are you is similar to that ... who's having ... I Know that we want to say you're Steph Curry but I mean that's your not Steph Curry but it does it mean that you don't have a place in the league that's what I'm just trying to figure out what is missing here\nYeah for sure um you know I I don't know specifically like a player that I'd just like see myself model my bottom I gave after I who I compare with completely but\nWhen I see myself as a role in the NBA and that was the case to get back into that would be a guy that would be you know a guy off the bench that can come in and just you know light it up you know what I mean being able to come in and\nAnd score the basketball and and be able to be a guy that's a um you know six man type Jamal Crawford type you know come in and be able to just\nGo and score the basketball and out of high level and hopefully you know effectively a night in that out I think that's something that you know I could bring to it seems I can come in and it really score and shoot the basketball be aggressive\nAnd um you know be able to play you know somewhere out Fifteen twenty minutes and be able to really um you know how the team if they're you know if they're not doing well are they need a spark off the bench I feel like I'm a guy that could come in and\nIt really helps with that in any type of scoring are shooting quest that a team but they so that's kinda how I see myself being able to have that type of rural and the NBA and I know that I can do that I'm with the right opportunity but you know that's that's kind of what I say\nWell enjoy the flight back um if the if that's a possibility of and joined the flight back but ah [laughter] and all that good luck over there and we'll check in with you and uh you know hopefully there is still a chance in the NBA there for you Jim ...
