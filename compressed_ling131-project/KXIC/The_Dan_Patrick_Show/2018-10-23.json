... is a glowing recommendation or leave very satisfied non casually\nFor the raiders does is make the ... trade look better as a plan because it's not just you lead one guy go for two for ... you're completely dumping for the future of three four or five years from now well\nI thought the John ... was disingenuous with what he said that ... didn't want to be there because ... look nobody called me I Would have taken less to stay there they just didn't want to pay him\nIn the same with Cooper and if you say that okay fine I get it there's a plant it just ... does it want to admit that and ... says hey you don't want\nDon't want to pay those guys right now we're not ready to be an elite team and I don't want to pay those salaries right now I find you got a game plan as a raider fan\nYou want to know is tell me what the plan is give me a heads up here at least just a little bit\nBut I've said it before I said it you know when they started the season this is a team that is basically in a two year window or once they get to Vegas you're going to see a completely different too and that will be in the shape of what John ... months\nNot would Reggie McKenzie ones or the owner once it'll be what John brood months but I think that he's playing with house money now and by the time he gets to Vegas it'll be a different team but you know John just not good at this track record in drafting is not good\nGoes back to remember where the Cleveland Browns they had all these first round picks and I said it doesn't matter if you're not any good at drafting\nLike more bad pigs is not a good thing it's still more bad picks\nAnd then you see somebody like the ravens with ... how did he find that they got that guy you know it's just weird how these things happened that we go and you can build up on ... are you good at drafting no no but we got we got more drastic sheer apple\nBreeders are paying paying Derek car seven million this year he's do twenty million next season ...\nPretty low for a quarterback probably like lower CERN yeah but if I get a rookie contract that Israel well\nThen it's great that's all the NFL has become now get that rookie contract and hopefully he's able to contribute and you you have a five year window that's that's what's going on here and then you can all of a sudden spread the wealth elsewhere and then all of a sudden the bill comes do and then you disassemble yeah ...\nWhere do you think that cowboys pick wild land for the raiders\nI think that they're looking at probably between ten and twenty somewhere in there the bears pick is probably going to be ... between ten and twenty and the raiders or you know could be a top five pick but let's say the raiders around the clock and Justin Herbert the Oregon quarterback because\nThey're like you know I don't it's\nI don't put that out of the realm of possibilities here I this is the giants ... you know stop with these have should the giants move on from Eli Manning they've already moved on they just have to play out the string there's nothing they can do\nUnless they could trade him but they moved on from Eli Manning they're going for a quarterback and the draft apple\nOr out of sight out organs Justin Harvard has there's a lot of headlines yes two days ago he's expected to return for a senior season despite being the man and they put them on pick if you want to Google Sam Donald at this juncture last year Sam Darnell expected to return for seasons\nYeah yeah the club ... has a hurt ankle the bears pass Russia's totally disappeared is that trade looking a little better for the raiders\nDo I still have potentially the best eventually player in football absolutely but well his ankle get better\nNot maybe not this year that's a real concern so he was going to be a free agent next year I Believe so the raiders I mean I'm not sure the raiders were ever going to resign them\nThe eighth grade raiders were doing what's best for them that's fine my problem was I thought John was lying about the whole ... situation because Aaron Donald did the same thing and nobody at any point said you know Aaron Donald\nWant to be here the rams are ready to win now the raiders weren't if this was reversed and the raiders were the favored should go to the super bowl ... would be a writer Aaron Donald might not be around if they were you know if we switch situations here\nThat back in ... ... couldn't win that division they have a good scheduled they bid yes ... actually I thought as can be a high tech played ... okay against the patriots I mean I don't think that's a hot topic well a lot of people are saying purpose he didn't play very well\nHe played okay fine but I only gets a hot ticket not okay he had a great touchdown run damn Patrick show brought

watched it but now you're watching morning anticipation because every move because they got a guard one another to every move out of all you will be watching between these two\nTalking to Reggie Miller coming up Thursday night it'll be the luggage and the Lakers so you\nGot the Lakers losing the spurs and they got Phoenix and you know this is a fun Phoenix team you know I mean there isn't a point guard but they're they're fun little team and then you've got to Denver and Denver's a playoff team\nSo little bit of a stretch here if you're going to handicap what you've seen so far Golden State obviously Houston the second best team who is the third best team in the west so far\n... over to backtrack a little bit because we talked about this I said Golden State than Houston yeah I'm not sold on Houston anymore I said\nAnd I will say this now to through eight they're going to beat up on one another there's only one outlier in the western conference in really in this league\nGolden State but to through eight\nThey're just going to beat up on another that's why if I ... the Magic Johnson I I'm not worried\nUm early because everyone's going to be one another I had Denver at number five Lakers at number six I think the numbers as good as to stay if they stay healthy they can get the number to spot I Am not sold anymore on Houston they play it zero defects now as great as\nA hardy and Chris Paul are\nCarmelo did not look the same I I I'm just not sold on them I mean they beat the Lakers barely and then the next night they lose to the clippers so\nTo through eight are just going to beat up on one another and so if the nuggets can stay healthy or they can be number two I had okay see at three they haven't won a game yet they lose at home to the kings\nLast night Washington goes into Portland and beef Portland Memphis on the road last night and goes into Utah and wins so do I if I'm In the Bronx I'm looking at the western conference saying what these teams are better than us Memphis goes into Utah\nAnd beats Utah come all that\nWell you know they there's not many off nice that's going to be the key is no different than they used to when people say oh just pencil in the Bronx the winds only said no you don't get those off nights it feels like why you know when the games\nThat you're supposed to win especially at home I you know the game is early account just the same as the games late and if you're Utah if you're poor then you're going to think back\nTo this one you know you're going to think back to that that in Memphis loss are going to think back to that wants to last or at home when you're trying to jockey for ... seeds to get home court advantage that's why there should not be any panic in the Lakers\nStarting a win three because to through eight are just going to beat the heck out of one another and it's whoever gets hot late like last year in the east Philadelphia when all that sixteen game winning streak going into the playoffs and they had hot momentum it's who gets hot late and can kind of find that rhythm\nTrade on right now right now I have Denver as my number two seed\nTrait young going off on Sunday it was against the cabs
