I Love with him in the way\nIt was just like ... and I was at home to hundreds of years um yeah I was on the radio and I was like what is your loved ones Brianna say amazing some and I'm like whoa\nEven listening to I heard radio for more of you to an all your favorite artists\nLike hello and welcome to another edition of the ... edition like all of our money these days\nIt's available for God can by downloading the data Patrick ... or visiting our Web page at ... dot com but what is it about ... is a glowing recommendation or leave very satisfied non castle anywhere\nThere at Ohio State knows these players you know hey it's it is about getting to the league and getting paid when you get to the league I don't like the fact that he's a captain and he's not going to be there for his team I don't like that aspect can they voted you a captain I don't like it but I Do understand it's a business decision I'd I I\nKnow it's a bottom line business now urban Meyer you know nobody be grudges him for the money that he makes or my ... so I don't begrudge these kids they have to wait three years\nThree years to play football you get you get three years of them playing football I Know don't don't tax don't email with the whole thing and tweet about all I have a hundred and thirty thousand dollar education there okay\nIf I say that about Nick ... is he worth more than a hundred thousand dollars to Ohio State football and the answer is yes he is\nOr what would be the magic number where there was also wouldn't quit if he was paid let's say thirty grand a year to play for Ohio State and he had the same injury and he was gonna make thirty but you've got to finish the season to make your thirty this year ... let's say every college football player got thirty grand there is a round number would have a point out from the team\nBut yeah yeah thirty grand that's that's nothing in the big\nPicture right so if someone says well this is why they should pay college players that's a ... argument because it wouldn't affect ... you know we can't have them\nBecause you can't itemize this\nI mean who gets thirty who gets ten who gets a hundred thousand dollars what what is to uh\nWorth to Alabama\nWhat what is jailing hurts worth about what he what he was worth two years ago as a whole lot different now you ... you just can't do this Josh Allen at Wyoming is a top five pick\nWhat was he worth a million dollars\nSo I I don't want to get into that conversation of paying these athletes this is just a business decision I don't know how many guys you're ever going to be in this situation\nBut I Do think the bulls situation is real and that's where a player goes I'm not playing for anything it's a meaningless game this is all about the school and the conference making money I've already showcase my talent if you don't have enough film on me you know what you haven't done your job\nYeah for it and then you're opening the door to reading the players trying to renegotiate their deals with their schools and hold them hostage well I'm not going to play in that big game it gets Michigan or I'm not as easy title game unless you know when you're up the money that we initially agreed to when I was a freshman I\nThink what happens and it happens in basketball we're seeing that right now play out in a trial you know there's benefits that these kids get\nIt happens\nLet's not be naive and it happens just about everywhere uh you know all of a sudden you see a hey this guy ended up at that school how did that happen okay I mean let's not be naive about this it's a business it's big business as much as I Would love is to be what it was when I was growing up\nIt's not\nYou know whether I'm going to stay for four years and I'm going to fight for the team and I'm going to put my life out their life and limb it's just not that way anymore\nYou know see this is the only bit of control that a student athlete has in the system you know and I mean you have to exercise that when you feel like it's the right choice for you [noise]\nA pulley just sent this what is the cost will be three years or three years of scholarship\nOf education for both should've got for free at Ohio State it's a hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars\nOkay it's whenever they say they don't get paid back to that in okay but what do you think Johnny Manziel was worth a truckload okay but so\nI mean we have this what we can have guys every year when we go okay what's the word I so I could look at a guy who was marginal when he's worth a hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars Johnny Manziel help them build an entire stadium\nHe's worth ... Fifteen million I don't know how do you put a price tag on it\nYeah it is but there's also I think there is an in between where people say oh they don't get paid anything they can't afford pizza that's junk or I didn't like most of us go to college and we don't have free books tuition a special dorm for football players where they get twenty four hour food not occasional food and it's just it's not an extreme where they're not\nIt's a fulltime job for them I mean let's\nLet's not kid anybody they also get choice will work but they do have the choice to also get an education that's free I mean a college education degree from Ohio State whatever school this is a great backup plan for the Ninety percent of the players or Ninety five percent who won't play a minute we're only\nTalking about a special situation here\nYeah I mean it and if I'm Nick both said he could he could have done both he could have a guide healthy played for his team but obviously all that weight lifting and all that stuff you do there's nothing that says I also would like to win a football game with my teammates or have a special athletic moment\nI don't know if this affects them at all I don't know if anybody any scout goes you know we don't want a guy who's going to be me first guy I don't know\nThat would be the only fallout from this yes we love it\nI think one one difference is what we know about house now and football players and also it's this is not a concussion story but like Lenin for net did he really have to take those hits for no money for you know I think we just know so much more about how that changes the whole picture right now\nI Will take a break more on this will settle on a pole question\nIt's good you know I ... I everybody's got their opinion on it but I Do think that the college football fan is like you know what damn you you're ruining my college football because we'd like to see Ohio State if they play Alabama being full strength or Ohio State versus Michigan be at full strength\nI'm sure Michigan is glad the Ohio State won't be at full strength and that's for sure Charles Barkley will join us coming up next and uh\nYou know Charles has always talked about it\nThe student athlete there he might have an opinion on this as well uh seven seven three D. P. show email address TPA damn Patrick a gun we're back after this Charles Barkley\n[noise]\n\nWant to be in Toronto or you just pay his dues until next year what do you can go to the clippers or the Lakers\nAnd then you got to six or that you saw last night\nBen Zimmer is unbelievable but unless they get something for march ... votes or they can't beat the Celtics or to run into so those are the three best storylines I'm going to be watching this I Love the bronze he's a\nGreat player he's a great man but the Lakers don't have a good team they are not contenders and we can try to make them contenders\nThey're going to be fun to watch and I think the thing that I wouldn't want to guard against ship on the Lakers front office is\nThat you get some success and then you may want to trade for somebody to help you make a playoff Bush or help your position for the playoffs and I wouldn't do anything with that roster I Would I Would let those younger guys you know be around the brawn\nOr have them get to a point where they're not just watching him be LeBron where they're actually equal teenage with him and some of the older guys that they got let's see how they rub off hopefully rub off in a positive way with the younger kids but what would what would make what would concern you the most about the Lakers this season\nWell what kind of a team or are they going to put to let those young guys play or to go put those old guys out there that's why I didn't understand because those old guys are not a future ... ball\nCools random Ingram that's their future\nSo I don't know what the Lakers are doing are they going to try to groom those young guys and go forward with Ron or are they going to play those old guys\nI think that's what's going to be the most fascinating being I mean I have no idea what the Lakers are doing other young team or their old team and I think that that's what I'm going to be watching for the most\nWho is the first player to be traded off the Lakers\nThat's a great question um I don't know\nBecause I liked Ingram I like ... I like bowl\nA but like I say that with all of them older guys on the bench you or I just I don't know who's going to get to play are they going to try to win some games with those older guys are they trying to build for the future with those young guys also like I say I just don't know\nYeah I'm Wondering if these launch a ball going can he fit in with them with with LeBron and and they're going to be up tempo and I loved that but you got a point guard who can't shoot can't shoot free throws so I I just wonder can you still have him play a big role for these two\nWell you know it's interesting we have a conversation last night what are they talking about a ... Twain more care folks have been someone's I look at ball closer to ban certain ones didn't folds he can't shoot but he makes a big difference in the game like being assembled canned soup\nBut he like but he makes a he's a he's a terrific player and he's not a good shooter and I I look at ball more in that light like full still have to score to help his team win 'cause uh 'cause he's not a great pass or he's not a great defender of you know scored he's not going to happen to Seventy Sixers ball\nBecause he was a terrific defend a it's a terrific pass or if you make a difference in the game that's a good comparison like I I like a clue like bring some of the little bit more but ball can make a difference in the game but all the other stuff he does even if you can't sue\nTalking to Charles Barkley the hall of famer NBA on TNT enlist you if you can only watch one NBA team this season it would it be\nA it might be to Oklahoma City thunder because I think they're probably I think they got a chance of being really good that's not a knock on could mellow it just didn't fit but going out and then the Schroeder and going out getting nervous Noel\nI think the Oklahoma City there's no pressure on politics or is this year they don't have to answer whether he wants to be their role is going to do it ... does so or the other than the warriors\nWatching James Harden flight I gotta admit chains are to me I said last or might be the most ungovernable NBA player I've ever seen Michael Jordan was obviously better Kobe Bryant was obviously better but from my office of standpoint I ... I think James Harden is the most uncomfortable\nNBA player obscene but they're still costs I'm probably going to Oklahoma City thunder\nSo if I knew said the heart and go out and score how many do you think hard would average\nOh a ... in today's NBA I think I think he could get fifty Wayne [laughter] you know I mean is it has to beat you up at the game\nBecause if it's as if he's making this three minute Ken guard him he's going to get it will be God's gonna get Fifteen free throws again are rooted thing James Harden could ever scripted points but think about it he's also lead lead again is says than you know\nI mean the guy is armed guard as friends will be making that well you know when he does the moon walk where\nYou can step in the left and right due to the story I mean he's armed guard a bull\nMore likely to lead Golden State after these huge Iran's or Thompson\nWell I think it's got to be the rent because to me they're not going to be able to pay for guys two hundred million dollars\nA day that that's a that's was probably going to bring or rain or anything of this because they got to pay clay and dream on yeah and you can't pay for guys two hundred million dollars so\nAh are probably think Kevin Will leave because well it depends on what they pay those two guys are those guys take hundreds of millions of dollars less are because they're all young but like I say you can't if those guys they say they don't collect call you\nSay you take a discount three months that he's not taking this kind of I don't think those guys should ever take discount I think that's one of the stupidest things I ever heard the these teams are going to be around forever they're all going to make billions of dollars I think it's idiotic right here\nThere was Saddam will take less money is crazy\nBut you have to rent though who's overly sensitive but feels like everything bothers him and yes and and I get the feeling that he's\nHe wanted to improve his spot on the list of greatest players of all time that's why you said you know nobody's going to vote for me for deep into play or the year or the fields under appreciated he feels like he's just as good as LeBron he's overshadow its not his team and Golden State and I just think he gets one more title\nAnd then all of a sudden he goes All right now I'm going to establish something on my own and therefore I I'm going to let the NBA fans fall back in love with me because I'm going to do something great for the NBA I'm going to leave Golden State in all go to wherever the Knicks can you see that as a possible scenario\nWell I don't know if he's mentally tough enough to handle that he's going to Kevin\nKevin ... is a great great player and he's a great great kid but he's got ... skin and floods totally\n... in New York City I Can't imagine that yeah because it gives them and he's arguing with high school kids on Twitter about him arguing with depressive your if they're not winning\nHow's your summer by the way\nOh you know they're you know what I Do I play golf and not fish every day my golf still sucks when I'm a really good for some time you want to go fishing it let me know then I'll take you out there I might try to drown\n[laughter] can you swim\nThe black people do say\n[laughter] okay I just want to make sure if we're I like to go fly fishing so I I'm actually\nAlert I haven't learned to do that if\nSomebody told me I should learn to go fly fishing but I have a massive debts yeah\nIt is it's so much more difficult than it looks I think everybody watched that Brad Pitt movie a river runs through it and said oh my gosh that looks like it's so much fun it's it's so tough\nBut when you get it and then you you know you you can sort of navigate without putting it in the trees it is it's just different it's a lot of fun you put the waiters on you go in there and that's how many fish Charles not like you do where you just have a ... bomber and then you have a six pack of beer\nOr limited cigars too but let me tell you to live yeah I Want to hear when you go five thousand dollars go to our favorite charity oh shoot it Brad Pitt has not been fishing pole says that movie that will just put a movie but I don't even know\nWhat I care about his life was that movie [laughter]\nI'm not going to take that bad I mean\nYou could be right you could be right but I'm just saying if maybe I'll go fishing with you one time 'cause I Know even in my my condition my health condition I could still be jihad golf\nI think\nA moderate Muslim right no no no no no they're in a time you

Hirsch measure called out managed chateau and uh you know everybody says the same thing on like many Machado and he's a great player you know it just a Bush league play but he had at first base\nThat's all you're trying to step on the first baseman ... foot you know it just it was wrong wrong to do and he's had a couple of slides that were overly aggressive as well the previous game\nThen and then I like the Kenny Rosenthal talks to him and he says that he's he's not a Charlie hustle kind of guy here's Machado are talking about his lack of hostile\nI'm not the proper parents kind of mean Johnny ...\nAnd like the first thing\nI said my my first one either one of my class who\nA lot more effort into ... but\nConsequences for Doug with ...\nRight well he was sort of that

but he's a hundred percent sure he doesn't hustle yeah funny yeah but he's a hundred percent sure that he you at once three hundred million dollars with his next contract why did he say that he's a guy who\nProbably has no clue and just says hey I'm talented somebody's gonna pay me all this money I'm a young guy and we get all this money\nYeah approaching affects I'm trying to get a base hit or

respect for him as a player but [noise]\nYou can't respect someone who is a baseball game\nIt has no place he's right it was a dirty play now trying to break up a double play okay you know above and beyond the call of\nDuty we've seen that before but this is the chief subtly ruled they're they're trying to get out of the game but you had at first base was inexcusable here's Machado explaining what happened at first base\nMany from your vantage what happened on the play without you are\nWhy did you uh collide with value are there\nYou celebrate their product so this was on bag trying to get over him for a third of them are are\nTraveling Shaw said it was a dirty play yell at shut it was a dirty play by dirty player wondering what your response would be those\nBaseball I'm Out there and

for it\nTo something we should have taken that five thousand dollar bed with Barkley who was so sure bread never picked up a fishing rod since ... told me about moving I'm seeing a story from a mirror a in a in England says from August two thousand eleven Brad Pitt swaps movie rules for a fishing real to go angling with his adopted son so okay and I was just\nSeventy ... it was a backyard pond editing okay by okay in ...\nI don't know if he's gone fly fishing with them but I think the bread pitch probably gone fishing with his kids since he did that move I'm guessing he might have gone with

pie\nHere's a the the angling instruction that Brad Pitt got from less Etheridge quote I taught Brad Pitt how to fly fish and my swimming pool back when he had to audition for river runs okay I don't know if he pulled a lot of a fish in\nFrom the does it matter fly fishing is not about catching it's casting emotion yes 'cause that's what you want if you watch the movie they do it in slow motion with the beaches of water coming off the line you could have played the Tom scares\nHard yeah I could I could but fly fishing as an art huh yeah it is it is an art many [laughter] what why [laughter] [noise]\nAh I used to fish all the time and then I got bored and then I my brother said why don't you go you know learn how to fly fish and then I started flying fish\nAnd that was a great challenge

Ben ... get to spend a thousand dollars\nYou know I'm a I'm a gear guy on the gear and then you use it once and he said banging man I gotta go fly fishing again look at all the gear I bought\nAnd their special shoes that so you don't slip on the rocks when you go in but I went salmon fishing in British Columbia is years ago\nAnd uh I the salmon were spawning and it was unbelievable just the scenery and going fly fishing um a lot of fun but there's a lot of room there when you're casting\nIn in uh British Columbia yes you\nDo you then ah like cook and eat the fish they caught or D just thrown back\nI'll be thrown back now you could catch to\nCould keep too yeah cause there's rules right this law about what you condemn yes but uh we caught some Silver's and we throw everything back\nBut I stayed at the Sony fishing lot or a cabin excuse me Sony fishing cabin or ... that the head of Sony built a fishing lodge in British Columbia so you stay if it was spectacular sounds awesome yeah I did a show called fly fishing the world\nAnd our guide was awesome went there and that was on ESPN I think back in the like Saturday mornings I did was it called again fly fishing the world yes for to\nDo they have big posters over there in the capital of all the fishing related TV shows and movies and no no\nNo they didn't have it it was it was a it was like a huge\nFloating log cabin Google it poli let's work and you want to start doing a fly fishing show no [laughter] that sounds like so much fun here's the problem with fly fishing you can't drink beer when you fly fish because you're always working hold up\nWhat yes because you're casting your your ... you have to use both hands\nAre very busy yes you but that's part of it that's part of the skill flight but what if you have one of those backpacks those camel backs and you filled with beer and a little ... novel goes in your mountain you drink beer you could do the little ... your ... how about the baseball helmet yeah you could do that at um south\nDo a couple of beers up there\nAre others from in Rapaport shot and con as informed\nUh or\nIs it the Football Association the European football okay so in that he will be withdrawing has offered to buy ... stadium we fully respect his decision that just on her from the jags owner\nI Wonder why is backing out does it feels like there are a lot there was a lot of ground work being laid for the jags to relocate there in London yes yes protect\nSometimes you raise the you weigh the pros and cons and then you realize you know what that is a little too expensive even for me I don't think that's a good investment\nBank you taught you walk alright got our poll question make love and would yeah if you were in ... shoes what would you do stay at Ohio State or prepare for the draft sixty three percent ... uh prepare for the draft\nOkay All right we'll have more on this uh coming up now who just sent me the top celebrities she loved to fly fish\nKnows me I came across the story at something called chi chi dot com from march of two thousand sixteen the list of top ten fishers or a celebrity people don't like to fish and Brad Pitt was standing in a number eight says learning how to fly fish for his iconic role in a river runs through it Brad Pitt fell in love with the sports and still Fisher leisurely you surely\nAs of a two and a half years ago he's still a leisurely Fisher and\nSo we're going to run down the top ten or ... let's see who else is on and I've I've\nLiam Neeson was one of them I Know am I on it or not\nAm I mean I can [laughter] Tracy Morgan on it\nThey're pregnant you know a bottom baby why why am I going to stop looking at me I could out fish Brad Pitt whoa my eyes oh are you yeah it's a challenge yes\nChallenge has been laid down for Brad Pitt and Jacques him I Will have a fish\nA river runs through a too yes I uh wherever used wherever he wants to fish she\nIs a when we're out in LA in November what's I don't know if that's fishing season it but it all day that I mean this can be a pay per view like tiger and Phil\n... and just do it and I think I'd rather watch this okay and there'll be trash talking\nYes ... I found that top ten list Nebraska and pretend Luke Bryan way let's hold off okay let me get a good breakfast yeah this is a teachable item right when we come back the top ten\nCelebrity fisherman is that what Whitley celebrities who enjoy fishing overfishing okay but not fly fishing not necessarily fly fishing some any type of fishing greater Ginsburg numbers every [laughter] that's not true it's true that is not true\nThat is not true some of ... [laughter] I\nWhy come back if you're not going to be really the Joe the ... also\nThat ah maybe it was in the eyes when you know a discussion\nAnd also you know this defense who's not formidable I you know I thought that they were ... uh and you got pretty coming up in Michigan is now a legitimate off inch of threat unlike maybe years gone by\nSo let's handicap is now with Ohio State with ... that may be a little more susceptible or vulnerable um how do you see this playing out during the regular season and to get to the big tent title again\n[noise] [noise] well ... is a is a challenge to states\nHas struggled against really pass happy teams like the boiler makers and those who made a difference there's no question about it he was a game changer ah\nWith all kinds of scheming or how they how they accounted for him he made the linebackers look better and made the secondary look better uh I think they get past Purdue because typical Ohio State is everyone talks about trap game and this is a tough game and they rise to the occasion and a week after that they lose your was Iowa\nUh yeah so I think Michigan is a real test I think Michigan is going to be a a real deal\nA and the game which is kind of dropped off because it really hasn't been much of a rivalry in terms of results I think this is a year maybe it gets back uh back on track\nAnd it feels like a boost his teammates were backing him up or at least some of the public comments that I saw a big ... here's the only thing that he's the chain captain that\nThat probably bothers me more than maybe it should but it doesn't feel like it bothered do some of the marquee players on this team who tweeted out\nThe stuff about Nick boso like hey go get paid broke\nYeah different culture a this was Twenty years ago I think we see different responses or think these guys all come to Ohio State now with the NFL in mind not that they didn't before but I I think it's you know get yours and\nI yeah I ... and James Franklin Penn State made an interesting comment the yesterday which was\nHe he kind of hope for the day when rehab centers when guys can rehab at the school and I think that that's a whole nother issue where [noise] you know I mean does that feels like he has to leave Ohio State to get what he needs to get ready for the draft of water\nEvery college had that but that's down the road and I'm not even sure what I think about that if you become you know just a whole different entity at that point of\nOf rehabbing guys for the NFL but uh yeah I think the captain things a little bothersome and I think that's where people are are are hooking into to be upset about but uh and we did hang around practice for a while and and now he's he's screwing off so uh I think this will as soon as Michigan await towns that this will be forgotten\nThank you Rob we appreciate your time and thanks for joining us\nThank you Dan\n... the a book on a sports columnist for the Columbus Post Dispatch nobody's talking about urban Meyer anymore [laughter] that all of a sudden that that got a evaporated and all of a sudden it's about Nick ... as they move forward here to get to phone calls coming up what was the question we were going with\nNicholas ... if you were in ... what would you do and sixty four percent now would leave to prepare for the draft\nYeah I I Am trying to understand the severity of it and when I saw him hold his groin area I didn't know it was just sports or you know they said it was a core muscle\nBut I don't it it sounds like and I've had this sports hernia before or you know this has to be far more different than that I'm guessing that you know the severity of that I did come back I don't know if I missed any time\nAnd but the fact that I'm the captain of the show Daniel I I was going to go pro I was going to go back to ESPN my memory serves he hosted the Winter Olympics with the sports arena yes I did yeah I did when winter stuff in the summer you got a trench in the snow to get your set up to Anaheim in Russia where the medical field is not as professional she might thing\nI don't even think they recognize sports hernia as they're in Sochi yes for it to\nCome out looking for a pat on the back or anything but now you yes you\nAre but there was a mechanical bull Super Bowl week thing when I was in may do golf balls thinking growing\nVan mechanical bull that you were on my ... was was that that's the lowest setting we could possibly\nPut her diamonds to reduce their got cute and then he went to the next level in the next one and I fell off the thing and it's a lucky and we'd like from colonel merge into surgery\nBuried scene when we showed the video view it almost looks like it's in slow motion but it's not it's real speed ...\nOff and you were screaming like trying to hurt and was not from\nHere I Am I going to hang on oh I Know we heard\n... and a half a Dallas we were showing it right now and it's going so slow for me that's real speed right there like we didn't slow that\nDown seemed a lot to me and I was trying to mock headlines or something looking down holding on with only one hand and things like the ... took a bunch of Ambien barely even\nNotice [laughter] barely make the bowl is stoned it seems like\nA very ... it was a nightmare\nUh well I'm Glad you're a you're feeling better for the right [noise]

that is a dynamic that I think could be a potential problem there because these guys want to play for another contractor\nAnd that's another thing would boost bogey cousins one boogie cousins got hurt he realized that there is about two hundred million dollars hanging in the balance here\nOf how healthy he is when he comes back\nWhen he gets ready to come back in December or January he wants to prove he is worthy of a two hundred million dollar contract he's not going to get that with Golden State obviously but he wants to prove to somebody I'm Still one of the better big men and basketball\nMania grab a ring on the way out but\nThe bigger picture for him is he wants to prove that he is worth that two hundred million dollar contract [noise]\nA couple of emails we were talking about ... of Ohio State he's decided that uh he's going to call it quits at Ohio State not going to play anymore it's going to prepare for the draft which is his right you know these guys these elite athletes are looking at schools is a trade school you're going there and the trade your learning is football he's learned enough\nAnd are ready to graduate to the NFL I have no problem with this whatsoever I'm the only perception part of it that would concern me or bother me as his teammates voted him kept it\nSo that's it and it's a business or Ohio State used him he used to Ohio State and you're not going to get a shot at an actual title if it's not that important I I don't know about the re occurrence of this it's it's a core muscle injury but it's\nSounds like it's more glorified sports hernia and to be able to come back from that and what do you risk when you come back I don't know\nBut uh you know you miss Michigan game you're gonna miss being ten championship game and maybe play for national title\nBut in the bigger picture\nHe's looking at you know twenty million dollars\nMaybe even more than a piece of top I pick a Ralph in Wyoming said instead of paying college athletes allow colleges to pay for insurance policies for their players most of them do the better players would get a better policy guaranteed a lesser players get these scholarship only the players could then go to the school with the best offer\nYeah I I don't want to get into these insurance policies and we're going to pay a X number of dollars or it's going to be worth this I I think we get into dangerous territory there\nBecause do these are boosters involved in this ... you know now you're you're hearing what's happening and this has been happening with um the shoe industry because you know all these coaches signed up Nike or Adidas or whoever it was\n... you know they these two companies want something more than just hey here's our shoes you know we want to make sure you're getting the best players at your program wearing our shoes and our gear\nAnd that's what's playing out here in real time\nYou know the the kids are still getting paid they're getting paid in a different way uh I've talked about this when I went to college and knew of you know one of our guys who got something um but you know they it wasn't in a clandestine way it was just sort of you know he got a car\nAnd it's like okay All right and he's a good player got a car All right I'm fine with that but I wouldn't even at a major program\nAnd imagine what you're worth on the open market a ... with going in one and done like what do you mean for a program\nOne and done is I on Williams you know the testimony came out that hears representatives were asking for money um jobs for I think a family and housing\nSo\nHis do soup didn't offer anything apparently but somebody must of the ...\nYou know according to testimony here so that's why on Williams I\nCan go back and tell you that there was a star athlete whose entire family was moved and got jobs so he could move into a certain school district so it happens it's going to continue to happen because there's so much money at stake plus with college basketball if I only get you for one year but you are so valuable for one year\nThen what am I willing to pay if ... paying a kid who is now playing in Australia a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd he wasn't that good what are some of these other players I mean it's not kid anybody\nKnow Kansas is doing this or Arizona or you know what I all of these big time schools\nAnd they don't rat on each other because they're all doing the same thing you don't want to get caught so you can't go there doing it because you're doing it\nAnd it happens but ... ... he had a chance he had the power\nAnd it's the only time it'll have the power to say no I'm not going to play anymore I don't need to play anymore and I'm going to go I'm going to work to get ready for the NFL Draft and he has enough of a highlight reel resume too that he doesn't need to\nI don't know if any of these cows look at him and go you don't want to be quite honest to apple\nGoing back to players get paid like colleges and boosters and people around colleges rat people out is when they get screwed over like remember the cam Newton's story came out because someone from Mississippi State said here's what he was offered to go here and he didn't go here so that means he must have gotten this to go\nHere Reggie Bush the only reason that story broke his because Reggie Bush didn't pay back alone\nHe pay back loans story never comes out USC doesn't get in trouble\nIt's rare when there's stuff comes out because the NC double A. has no teeth they're not investigating this it takes Yahoo or you know some other out ESPN they do all the work and then the\nOn to the to the world series so yeah\nHe's a allied or major league baseball network analyst you can see 'em on ... be tonight or pre and post the league championship and the world series games how important is distorted for Clayton crucial\n[noise] I think they're all important I think late in his\nBattle the little bit with a you know that the\nThe pride is aspect if you will with him being you know generationally the best pitcher up certainly in the last eight ten years um listened in his stuff isn't the same and and I think the anticipation or the people who watch baseball closely as you know you're you're looking at a guy who had a run that\nStatistically rivaled only Sandy Koufax with without dominance he was his stuff not being the same his fastball as down to ... three or four miles an hour therefore the differential between his out pitch which is now mostly a slider he throws his slider very close to speed this basketball so he's\nYou know he he's got a pet so I I don't know what to expect um you know I I think it could be there eight ... against the praised it was terrific um\nDid you see the tweet by more Moulder former pitcher who said I and I'm paraphrasing but he's he's saying as he's watching in real time you know of course I was telling us I don't know if he can get I never thought I Would say this but I don't know if he can get people out with this stuff\nAnd and you would never say that about ... Shaw and that brings me to he can opt out of his contract but if you're the Dodgers do you have to look at this in and said do we want to have this guy you know and two hundred million dollars for the next seven years or six years\nI mean there's a bigger ... right\nYeah I Can't imagine him up to now can you know I mean if you really think about that back as you have to go back to two thousand sixteen when it all started creep into it and you know is endings worked out I think\nIt through right around a hundred and fifty hadn't throwing two hundred innings two hundred plus sending since two thousand fifteenth so that you know those are serious\nIssues obviously back for any athlete but as a pitcher and his ... his delivery was always unorthodox pilot he's a big guy I'm you know I can not imagine him you know pulling out of that contract or you know he's got\n'em you know a few years with some big time money and especially now that the way that that we're looking at this bullpen and the less important so starting pitching which\nI can go on for thirty minutes about that [laughter] um yeah so you know I I I wouldn't imagine being a show that he did I ... I can imagine that they would renegotiate that contract\nA Red Sox an Astros what are the Astros accused of\n[noise] not really sure [noise] uh\nThere's definitely something because the Indians I guess complaints and they'd say baseball about you know somebody videotaping something\nAnd the Oakland A's you had to\nEnd the age that too right listen to our back up here I I think ... are you surprised really Dan is that there's that there's\nThat technology with apple watches a couple of years ago I guess with the red Sox rose last year I forget um you had the Toronto blue Jay incident a few years ago somebody sitting in the outfield this is where we are folks\nI mean you got to go back to ... when was it when the rough Frank I guess they found out that ... a ... had a somebody had a a a binocular in center field at at Ford Field or something like that you know getting the story wrong\nOr you might but that's like your honor roll\n[laughter] I mean I remember\nBack at the old ... old ... with the big picture wheel and there was some concern back then that there was some like go about\nShould we allow and they go out that you would ever by whatever means you shouldn't be able to try to steal side\n[noise] I think to a point I think anything beyond that line is cheating\nEmail it feels like I like how do I draw the line on cheating if if the Astros are accused of having a guy in a position where he wasn't credentialed to be either taking photos videos in signaling players on pins shoes I you know way\nSomebody here let's let's think of the ... the the actual timeline of that Howard ... I'm In Atlanta well you're in the batter's box and I happened to take a video I I don't know how it can all happened within twelve fourteen sixteen Seventeen Seconds to get to the batter\nWhich ultimately that's what it's all about don't be stupid as a pitcher I played with pictures and I won't mention any names but they were relievers that was what the bats that when there was a runner at second base and the pitcher would shake\nThe catcher was told to just put one son that is done you got a guy at second base who can easily transfer the science right 'cause this is one at all it's all about communication with\nWith not a headset which you can't even do a headset anyway 'cause we'd be talking to each other and I'm like football we're across the line of scrimmage or you have the catcher talking to me on the mound with the hitter standing there so you can't do the headset the creative with mine that's ultimately what we're coming down\nTo about why you have a guy there who can cheat or is trying to cheat if if he allegedly\nThan they are hearing a legit I don't know but this is what I hear and I I trust me I don't have all the information but they were looking for somebody was videotaping the dug out to find out if they had a fun it's her that was then looking at the sign that was fixated on the catch which again let's go back to\nUse multiple signs on every pets if this is where we are and everybody's insecure and buddies you know they don't trust anybody with the first pitch it again don't\nI don't have one side if you put one down and it takes three pitches and no one's a fastball tears occur three decided well you got to be more creative than that because this is where we are with technology and ultimately that's what everybody's trying to steal forget about bonding and hit and running and stealing wheeling and see that at Fort right now what was the last time I saw a hit and run in baseball\nWas the last time he funded they don't they're not allowed to ... will tell you that at forty three percent you know nobody's\nOut of the chance of shoring better chance for you don't give up on our so we don't even have that you don't have hit and run and you don't steal unless the guy's really fast and they give them a green light so what are they still inside it's pitch selection\nOkay ... where the Astros were the Astros then trying to see if [laughter] the red Sox were cheating is that what was going on here\n[laughter] so [laughter] I don't know I was the year ... now that a lot yeah you're you're punchy here uh what do you expect ... well yeah but they're real quick enough that labor and I have a\nVideo out go into the camera well a viral video is the red Sox dug out what is that going to do to help me to get assigned to the hitter to know what the pets is that video what are they videotaped and I don't understand\nI Know here it's like oh they had scouts I noticed when I first got called up in Nineteen eighty seven with the Yankees they would have a scout that just was fixated on the third base coach to follow his science to see if they can pick up actually what the scientists now I thought that was rather creative right", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "17"}
