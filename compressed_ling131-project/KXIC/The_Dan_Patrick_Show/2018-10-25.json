John ... got to be careful about losing the locker room I think the mark Cooper trade 'em you know that that are ruffled some feathers here is John ... about what are the immediate plans or the raiders before the trade deadline on Tuesday\nI don't see us making any more trade that is just making a trade the other day I really did [noise]\nSometimes like I said your class change where they like and that you don't know who's going to call in what they're going to say\nYou really don't know that goes all phases of life\nI don't see us making any more trained to all never say never again anybody\nIf I said never duty I'm Sorry I don't think I did\nWell I think what John is saying is uh hey we didn't call anybody they called us hey never say never okay\nSo when somebody says oh they're not going to trade Derek car the raiders are more likely to trade their car than the giants are Eli Manning and you would think that the giants if they could somehow unload Ilan ... got a new trade costs too but it feels like the raiders there are still open for business ...\nAre you hearing anything about a possible jak trade or we play poodles are they are they gonna ride it out or\nWell now I I heard from somebody last night and he didn't have first hand knowledge and he said that he said I don't think you're far off from Jacksonville at least asking about their car\nAnd I said okay but you know he said look I'll keep you honest if I you know feel like there's some momentum there because I'm just curious that here we are saying All right what are the jags doing now they're in London but the trade deadline coming up Tuesday and I thought well there's somebody just go hey what would it take to get their car what would it take\nSo I think you are you at least have an exploratory conversation they're ... they may hang up on you or they may go no it's gonna be a to number one see on the globe\nAren't they are all sorts of international calling issues then you've got to\nBut the area you go to going to cost them the trade is it oh one yeah and then the number one ... one yeah I always had problems with that\nIs it a plus sign and then zero one yep all whenever for the books the gas from another country it's like a there was like an extra ... going on in the back thing it's like you're in Egypt it's oh one one eighty seven out you know sometimes you gotta end zero but in some parts of your leave out the zero it's\nCrazy but ah so what do you want to settle on here make\nLove and I'm On a question okay a tanking a problem for the NFL we talked about this for the show I kind of wondering players careers are so short none of them can afford to put give anything less than a hundred percent I feel like taking a little different in the NFL guys are still potential pipe pretty intensely even when they're ...\nYeah but you it it it's front office tanking it it's not the players on the field tanking they're trying\nIt it's like you know the Marlins with Derek Jeter hey we're not tanking you're not putting the best possible product on the field so your tanking your players on the field or not the raiders on the field aren't taking the front office is\nYou know the giants are going to be taking as well but we know when's the last time we talked about an NFL team and use the word tanking it's really rare when we think that somebody is just doesn't care right\nBut you know basketball we see it all the time\nWhen you're younger you and I had that prized possession there in the drafting why not why not tank here makes more sense to you know Mark Cuban Mark Cuban saying what you know a couple of months ago he said we did everything we could to lose and he said that last year\nI mean that's an owner's saying that but what they did it was front office tank and they didn't put a great product on the floor those who are on the fourth floor played Har so there is a way of tanking and it has to do with the front office and that's what the raiders are doing what else do you have ...\nI hate to bring this up and I don't know if you want to talk about college athletes in shoes we could do it [noise]\nLet me let me take a break here because once we start on the topic then everybody's going to have a conversation here but a a former Syracuse recruit who signed with LeBron James is management company\nSigned a shoe deal a very unique shoe deal and the timing of this you got some executives from Adidas who perhaps are going to jail\nBecause they were paying players you know the trial just ended and they were found guilty now I'm Talking about jail you know that this isn't like a sports jail where you're not going to get another job this is jail jail where you're going for paying these are kids to be able to go to college\nWhile they're in college you're going to pay them a soap or Jimmy I'm not thrilled or I don't think with LeBron James is management company taking this kid who's you know instead of going to Syracuse he's going to be an intern at new balance and he's going to get a salary\nTwo hundred thousand dollars so it's completely legal here and he's going to be doing endorsement deal and get ready for the draft here we'll talk about that\nComing up a seven seven three ... show email address sepia damn Patrick dot com Harold Reynolds on loan from the major league baseball network will join is coming up we'll dissect what we saw

place he says it also the national league game basically scripts sit out for it it's easier to script and that's what the Dodger front office likes to do is script out a game or National League you can say oh the pitcher is gonna be a\nThird and the third inning will make a switch\nAnd we'll go ahead and use Kemp to hit them okay that works that doesn't work at an American league game so I think you know double switch will make will have a we'll take\nTaylor outlook put Salinger et cetera and will do that and the fifth inning you know if things work out properly it's a lot easier to try to determine their outcomes and\nSo we'll see a lot of that from the Dodgers I think the more conducive to that and I was a player I start to anticipate when I might be going in or or not\nA thing as the other day or stuff like that but you know as we are trying to learn is after the game and we're asking him about you know what did you do to get ready for the at bat when they hit the three around home he said well I knew I was just starting out told me they had before situation\nComes up be ready so he's ready for the situation the phrase ... ... I went down\nTo the title I watch a video of him I knew it was going to throw a break every time he had Roger ... is it that's what did ... he had a three run Homer that's the difference and the two teams that preparation\nYou so Harold Reynolds major league baseball network analyst former gold glove winner three time will love winter\nUh yes yes three times that\nI Know I Know a three time below\nWhen you're thinking you only had a lot of them that's why I wanted all three of my ... I Love is love and tried to hang on to slow\nThe you know what's weird though like you know you loan to assure gold glove and it was great to have in in what people have to understand is it's actually just a baseball Mitt that his spray painted gold\nGets I mean it's cool but it's it's kind of a cheap you know award I mean it's a great honor Harold don't get me wrong I think the actual [laughter] the trophy they they they give you is just a glove and then they get you know rush stole him and then they scrape and\nFloods last night I'm broke limits it or was it was awarded to let it right so don't feel it a little Clemente award looks like the Heisman Trophy well I Want it back in Ninety One that gave me a ball that was basically the silver bronze to fly\n[laughter] come on man [laughter] got to get the highest [laughter] or\nThe red Sox with choose to al ... and you know this ability they're hitting over four hundred with two ...\nAnd I I guess I I look at what Cora has done for this team and what I Love and that is put the fat on the ball don't try to you don't have to hit homeruns they're not relying on home runs here and they put the ball and play and I I don't know if more teams are going to look at this and go oh Gees such\nIt does make more sense than striking out that you put the ball and play and then things happen oh what do you make of is a strap and it's not strategy I guess but it's just the ability to you know put the ball and play with with two outs in runners in scoring position\nFor I I think it's a philosophy that you know as as as blending the new analytics and also the old school together and I say we've gone through numbers and data always constantly changing right that changes or our thought process of of\nHow we think about things so\nAlex comes from the ... the little way out there with all their analytics let's say\nThey're the first one to sit there and say take up this gets it counts they let the latest strike out set limit it just sort of put the ball and play and I want a World Series and I was like oh it's just about that here he had a quote last night than that is said and the press conference to ten\nAnd three of them are under Seventy R B as you can apply for the red socks that doesn't get it was a hundred and Ninety five strike out your cat play here so I'd\nSay I didn't really exist today oh Harold ... that's the problem is baseball has accepted this as the new normal\nI hate I hate it I Know most people do the ball's going to be in play and\nIf you put the bomb play good things are going to happen\nTo strike out not just us out of out you know production so I think there's team starting to see it when you have\nThe same leading right now to oh in the world series I'm not gonna give it to them yet although I say so far we win it and last year winter saying strike out says not the way you play you put the ball and play maybe we're going to start to say this turn into a full face 'cause we got to get the game\nBack to put the ball players it's just\nA charge safe travels to Los Angeles so we'll check in with you a little bit later on in the series thank you\nVery much for him\nThat's Harold Reynolds he won three gold gloves yeah for it to\nNo offense or anything but it's kind of cheap\nAward it is like I Know what you met your most people are looking at the gold glove looked like a cheap a war against ... it's an amazing honor to get but [laughter] when we all got it we were like this is not a game of them really do you think it was actual gold glove\nAgain like it was a gold glove yeah like when you tap on it in the ass salad yeah it was a rush stole him high and restoring yes because you could get a glove\nAnd I could spray painted and I could spray spray paint to baseball's I I think that we could probably construct a\nGold glove it was a little more it had the feeling of like a more high\nAnd sixth grade art project okay\nIt was a little bit more art project that like I can see how somebody did that out in the garage and like look I made you this morning skipping congratulations ...\nI feel bad for heroin he wanted to Roberta Clemente award which used to be just like this all now it is it's it's probably bigger than the Heisman Trophy and it's very similar to I got on my screen is gigantic a gorgeous in the past five years [laughter] five to seven years that's what they awarded\nShe can he he should get one you saw an award winner yeah\nBut yeah I remember when we got the gold glove and Harold had three of them and he and he loaned it to us for I don't know a year and then he said hey I Want my gold glove back it's like when various rocker gave me the Grammy\nAnd then to the folks from the Grammys saw it on my desk and they're like who's Grammy is that on Dan Patrick's desk and then\nSomebody said oh that's a serious rocker who the in the blue fish and so they got a hold of various and said you better get that Grammy back and I'm thinking why can't I put it on display isn't it isn't it ... Grammy\nLike it's about the value of that it's on the patch I Wonder\nHow well that is\nSo so we had to overnight that\nVarious goes gotta send me the Grammy back I said nope not happy I like I don't know what's happened here gotta send me the Grammy back yeah not happen to know I'm a serious serious you got to do it by getting in trouble [laughter] and like I'm going you're never serious you know you gotta send the Grammy back I said okay\nBecause you know the the ... [laughter]\nI think he thinks or thought that he might not win another Grammy because they're going to hold it against him\nLike the boss of the recording academy without falling 'em up you know going in and I you know I'm telling two days ago and you gotta send that it's got to be there tomorrow you gotta make sure uh how much joy insured for I go I I I Am not a million dollars I don't know I don't know what it's worth\nIt could cost various Rutgers career but but you know that was that at least had some\nUh I don't know no\n... ... something that had some feel to it I think the Grammy had some some ... half that's it and it's not big but solid I I I went and gr you instead I have\nTo buy back thank you thank you thank you [noise]\nI just I just go by right while you're talking to Harold and are not intended for crop under three gold gloves you only get better with your great accomplishment because there's really no way\nWe all thought the same thing when we saw that gold glove right we did I never thought were going to say it actually too narrow on line with signing arrows and all it's the you know Rawlings or baseball that they had this cheap award\nAnd had a child papier-mache project deal to him with a nice ... you know it did\nBut when you said cheaper ... nobody's telling everybody kind of get a gold glove at some point they have no no no and I really only one I didn't quite well they used\nTo hand out those goals gloves I forget which pitcher it felt like every year they just handed it to this picture and I don't know if it was a gym caught\nCaught I think when like Fifteen gold gloves they're Greg Maddox would always win a gold glove there is certain to memory one Raphael ... won a gold glove at first base and how many he didn't even play I don't think he played twenty games at first base\nAnd I'm thinking how did you handle like how bad or the other first baseman when Raphael Paul marrow plays what twenty five games at first base he scooped up a few bad pros suffering apparently must have been great and it was twenty five yeah ...\n... had the most spray painted gold glove awards in baseball history has Eighteen wow Nineteen Ninety three two thousand two\nWhere do you just play those\nAnd he was going to go to Syracuse but he decided and he's a five star recruit he committed to Syracuse changed his mind and then he was going to go into the G League so we decided last week he's not going to go into the G League instead he's going to spend your training and getting ready for the NBA draft\nHe agreed to a deal with new balance it's worth a guaranteed one million dollars so he gets two hundred thousand dollars a year salary and it could go up to fourteen million dollars with incentives according to the New York times now Jim bay Hi the Syracuse head coach\nSaid he I guess tweeted this out he said LeBron did a nice job of helping his client it's LeBron's clients right\nQuestion mark a yeah it is yeah uh this is what LeBron James is done and then the bronze or he tweeted back\nAll of a big mad exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point but then Jim behind responded to him on Twitter less than thirty minutes later saying not me I'm happy for him I Wish him the best Jim bay huh\nI'm OK\nWishes he well he wishes he would be in the Syracuse wind up as a five star recruits but I Wonder if you're able to do this how many players could you do this with let's say LeBron James and his his management team go\nWhy don't you not go to college we're going to help you with Nike we're going to get you an internship that's going to pay you two hundred thousand dollars you sign with us\nAnd we will have your rights and so will Nike by the time you get into the NBA I mean imagine if LeBron said his eye on Williams who's you know projected to be the best player in college basketball this year he wants to do\nBut he says his eye on Williams and hey don't go to Duke you don't need to we senior highlight reel\nSigned with me with my company my agency and you're going to get two hundred thousand dollars so you're going to make more than the ... and I'm going to get you endorsed Mitt deal with Nike and you're going to get my training regimen I'm going to train you yep all\nI think this is absolutely just step one for LeBron and his team I wouldn't be surprised in five years of all of brown has an I. M. G. academy because who we're going to be about a recruiter LeBron James or my ... I Believe me do cause a great place to go for one year but\nUh there's no money there there's you you got delayed the other thing the brunt of this guy may be getting these guys on the cheap because new balance is getting this kid now before he's a ... the number one draft choice yeah see\nIt feels like a brown and his people are in a unique position to do this too because not you know random sports agency can't really pull this off I feel like it it says a lot about the player when it's LeBron that's choosing you not Jimmy lip or agent yeah I think if you're able to say\nI'm going to train you you're going to you're going to have access to everything that I have and if we set up an academy we set up a camp in Los Angeles I'm going to be able to see you occasionally uh you know when I I don't have a game I can go over there or you know you don't have a scrimmage against them but it feels like you could have\nA group of five to ten where Nike is going to benefit from that she asked me climate\nPlay devil's advocate what about the notoriety playing for Duke and being on national TV and ESPN and\nBabies I on Williamson does not need that notoriety\nReally even the final four no no he's he's famous guy ... say the second or third player who's not quite as famous as well\nYeah there's always going to be the trade off of\nEven if you went to the ... you're not going to we we might show your highlights on sports center but you're going to be you know you're going to be down the list before you get on sports center there I think with the guy on Williamson at Duke ... he's already had his notoriety he's been famous for five years um\nI can understand that if you want to get paid or you don't want to run the risk of getting caught getting paid in college are asking for something everything's above board here because you got three Adidas employees who ah could go to jail because they were see what's weird is the shoe company guys are the ones going to jail\nThese coaches who you know were involved in the process I I haven't heard anybody is in trouble\nOr the parents who took the money in trouble is the IRS going to ask you about this I mean there's a few things the judge said their actions tarnished an ideal ideal which makes college sports a B loved tradition\nWhat does this judge thinking there's this judge you know what happens in college sports like you I Can't believe that you gave twenty five thousand dollars to this guy to give it to that guy to give it to this player and you've tarnished the ideal which makes college sports they'd be loved tradition you asked me what\nI mean there's so many problems with that these are so many obvious problems with college sports everyone knows players getting paid football players are getting concussions and not getting health benefits are like the show many problems with this ideal world\nYeah these guys are guilty and all the people profiting off of these players without rewarding them they're the ones holding up what is called this ideal so [noise]\nI think the judge somebody needs to tell the judge fix step back and just look at this and you'll realize\nHypocritical views here has picked up [noise]\nI agree on for so yeah\nAll right Greg Kinnear for just went to the same concert is I went to last night but I have VIP treatment for it did not [noise] so uh Greg will join his final season of house of cards and a lot of things to talk to him he will join is coming up next year damn Patrick show\nLove to have a quick way to refresh don't look at your home in time for the

differ meal yeah um but were you around ... wouldn't research do you do when you're portraying did for me I went\nUp to a he was in his last year at Kansas City right and I went up to his training camp I think it was at Appleton, Wisconsin has anybody would that be right what is it\nThat sounds right I think that's where they used to practice yeah and attackers will check yeah we're just making stuff up yeah exactly anyway\nI wherever it was who I think it was I Know it was Wisconsin I went up to the training camp and um and they you know I'm a hot\nSummer watching these guys work he was he was accessible you know he was super nice um\nAnd I remember like taking me you know with all the guys at one point you know I'm playing Dick it's gonna be it's a it's a good script that good a project I I didn't really know his work you know I knew him as a coach but I didn't know him that well it was really a great learning experience kind of get to tap into the guy\nAnd all of a sudden as we were standing there with him coaching the guys they're all taking me he's doing his coach Daley said and now Greg it like to say if\nYou were [laughter] and I like I I had absolutely I remember it was like one of the great I mean just sweat pouring now my ... going football is important\n[laughter] a number of reasons [laughter] because of the movies invincible so this was Nineteen Ninety six

every time he cried and you did a great job I just wanted to say I was at Westchester training camp as a kid watching the eagles like you did in the movie and you nailed it\n... I was so taken with those people who are cynical were always kind of cynical about his his emotion\nAnd thinking out of this for this guy can't\nControl it or that it's there's some sort of artifice to it I watched a bomb them and it's all over Youtube videos you can go research in yourself he honestly had just such a hard I mean he really did was just such a a a passionate guy and it just really came out it was great fun to play 'em because I felt like\nHe was different you know he really was different\nAh let me give the full introduction a house of cards and Greg Kinnear Diane Lane or a two new cast members here so I'm the sixth and final season ... premieres November second\nI'm curious of when you walk on have you ever been coming into something that's already established and firmly establishes house of cards and then kind of figuring out what's the water level or which the temperature of\nDo I get I get up to a certain level or my so it just an odd feeling with what happened with Kevin Spacey so how do you sort of find your way navigate\nWell I I\nReally uh to answer your question no I hadn't had that experience before I mean I did an episode of uh you know Modern Family I I did a thing with raw who we just saw a stealing things are on and on their friends years ago\nSo I had come into it but just for a you know bad or whatever that this was a obviously an extremely well established show and\nKind of an iconic show people have very strong opinions about it so it was a little off putting coming into it and and you know obviously given our speed bump that we hit right out of the gate I dying and I are brother and sister building that shepherd there to basically wreak havoc\nClaire who's now the president layoffs Claire well yeah\nAnd so we ... we were up there in ah we were in Baltimore and I just for like a day or two and kinda got getting started and and I was actually shooting movie in Memphis and I went\nTo finish the work went back to Memphis and I got attacks from Diane thing are we doing this show is this going to have to have I I Am I already fired I didn't know what the hell she was talking about and then the you know Google sphere blew up and the text started coming in and the whole thing with with him you know kind of\nYou know happened they had to shut down for\nA you know quite a while obviously that fix took care of the crew which I thought was remarkable\nHow many ... and those are juice shot\nA we had just started on the first one just show up all day so yeah no it was odd and and and then going back to what you would think listen there's the elephant in the room right how awkward is this going to be on the new guy plus you have this thing that happened\nBut I have to say I genuinely feel like they ... the crew and much credit I've said to Robin who you know there was an easy out for her you know your co star this happens it's like I think maybe this was the you know with us today we all walk away from this cat that train on the tracks everybody was there they were enthusiastic\nThey weren't afraid to talk about their own experiences over the years you know but everybody knew what the job was it's it's a big show and and it does feel a little strange watching this thing that I had seen for many years\nI'm suddenly in the White House with the characters that I've known all these years and um but it was really cool is great fun they write devious character it's\nLike being a bad guy I did and then as soon as great they had a good guy because you don't you don't have a bad guy look yeah\nI mean you're nice guy from the mid west I mean we're we're nice corn fed good looks I mean us or we're not ... yeah that's where we are I had to double down on the acting you did at the at a double\nDouble it up [noise] no I mean honestly I don't get that a role but that that often so it was a yeah I mean\nWould you like to play them or like a killer like a like a total ...\nI I you know I never did do like a lot of action pictures have been kind of I Wish I'd had a gun in my hand at some point you know from one of the ...\nAnd you can do like Bruce Willis stuff you don't think it's too late then you can tell me looking Liam Neeson that's true\nThat's true yeah actually it was everybody yeah man\nHe wasn't always killing everybody either it's still it's in the last it had like a resurgence\nIn the last five seven years she's a snowplow\nDrivers taking revenge on people in this new movie the like those films and then I'm going to be you don't want snow plow genre movies like the one of the [laughter] Francine Francine those a a Liam Neeson impersonation\nHunker down I Will find your real good [laughter] pretty good [laughter] wow [laughter] uh okay Paul he's got a question for you which he won lonely Columbus had his well she wasn't really a question I think he just was falling all over ...\nOkay there's a great movie arraigned called Green Zone Matt Damon is a war movie was weapons of mass destruction you play like a State Department guy who's really mean spirited in a bad guy how do you know your nailing a bad guy role because I thought you were great natural\nThank you uh I guess I have done this I guess I Am I'm Out of the corn Fred nice guy thing apparently um I 'cause I forgot about the greens on a you know I don't know I mean like a ... I don't know\nIf you have to be I remember Paul green grass who directed that is a very funny guy you know British lovely guy great director and he just kept saying ... butch [laughter] you know foot foot push it up\nJust kind of more of that ad and um\nSo then all of a sudden you drop the hey your dad was a diplomat to a new play\nCalled it ought to my own kids about the ... remake because you know\nAnd then you can see his face when you're asking the question he's he's got like scrunch up face like voter wherever we go in with then\nIt's not rocket inside the actors studio audience here asking me wants to James Lipton\nHere yeah ... where we kind of represent the fans 'cause whenever we have an actor on you know and when I go ask them on this movie and not necessarily the main movies are known for\nYou can go to rock auto dot com all departure car will ever need rock auto dot com a family run business it was founded by automotive engineers in Nineteen Ninety nine two goals in

talking earlier about different concert Charlotte doll too and uh I have a uh\n[noise] the benefit of going to see a Elvis twice when I was young I was like five and seven years old he used to come to our town our just said if anybody at it I Know the answer probably too young to to the scene and I didn't know if it ever seen Elvis right by and your crew they said\nNo I did not ... thanks for the phone call taught I did not and I think it's the fiftieth anniversary of Elvis when he was dressed in black\nAll black leather and he did that TV special and I think at the time behind the scenes that Elvis didn't want to come out by I think uh his wife Priscilla headed talking into doing that special that night that he wasn't even going to do it\nUm and I don't know exactly what his fear was but I think there was something that was going on that he was worried about his career\nAnd uh but he did that special he looked he never look better than than that special that was fifty years ago tan hair look great had black leather on and was killing\nAll right uh uh let me see gotta are we going to say what the question with\nA lot and I think we should switch it off okay so the question was is taking a problem for the NFL I decide question off that or do you want to be two in fourteen or seven and nine in limbo an MBA limbo is the worst and don't want to be thirty five teams you know you want to be bad or good yeah NFL I'm not sure\nLike how do you feel if you're a browns fan of bills fan a a Cardinal's fan right now are you like well at least we get to restart or is this just suppressing\nWell I think if you're a browns fan you just want to see progress\nAny of these bad team she won like Arizona right now you want to see some progress whether it's Josh Rosen a you know David Johnson doing something you feel bad for Larry Fitzgerald that this will be his last season they often should lines not very good imagine Patrick Peterson\nHe goes in and meets with the owner who then says we're not trading you normally when you go in to talk to the owner they're going to tell you that they're trading you or cutting you\nAnd here's Patrick Peterson probably going in there going please tell me you're going to trade me please and then you go in or we're not trading you know 'cause I thought maybe there was a\nChance he was going to end up with the Kansas City\nBecause I think if kids said he picked up Patrick Peterson and the defenses young in Kansas this was pointed out to me yesterday hey you keep talking about ... wait until the end of the year and then let's have a conversation of how good Kansas City ... and I said oh okay 'cause this uh NFL scouts said they're good\nThey don't know it yet the defense is good they don't know yet because they're young and I said I Know I'll buy into that we can check in with the raiders a re righto covers the raiders and are always great to talk to him and there's there's some turmoil some tension going on behind the scenes there and what\nPeople thought was a crazy concept idea a question that I brought up a month ago is not so crazy now when I said you know I wouldn't be surprised if their cars not what this team by the time to get the Vegas he might not be with his team by the time to get the next week Tuesday yes ...\nIf you are the raiders and someone called and said we'll give you a second round or for Derrick carton or maybe a low in first round\nI got to get a first round her first round yeah I got to get a first round her\nYeah I think so\nAnd you got him later in the draft and later in the first round but still you know if Jacksonville called up and said hey what's going to take to get their car I'd say I got to have a first round here I mean you've got a first round or for mark Cooper\nNow granted the cowboys overspend and they were desperate to get somebody in there or you know Jackson whoever's training now there's going to be a little bit of desperation their him a club\nForget the logistics sudden the salary and everything will have a teddy Bridgewater from New Orleans has the back of their to Jacksonville to get a shot\nIf you're in New Orleans do you want to help Jacksonville granted there in the AFC but do you want to help them and you know how valuable was teddy Bridgewater to you\nSack around her I guess I have no idea I think he when he went for a third round her this off season right to object\nI Would have ... yeah I think yeah I went to the sound starting tonight there is live football either college or pro on TV every day for the next twenty seven days that's through the night of open November ...\nWhich is Tuesday of Thanksgiving week so we got some action there ... football coming up then you've got a pro football coming up tonight\nJeff in Rochester joined says Hi Jeff what do you have for me today\nAnd then they just taking my call big fan of the show you guys do a great job thank you Jeff\nJeff Bailey show at fourteen over seven and nine I'm a lifelong bills fan and\nWe uh have been in the middle you know eight and eight nine and seven we had kicked you Ron get us to seven and nine three straight years and being in limbo is just the worst you know you're not good enough to contend that you're taking in the haves and the draft\nAnd you'd never get those top five prospects so yeah I got to go to and fourteen over seven to nine everyday that week I'll hang up and listen\nRight thank you Jeff yeah I think it goes back to that you just don't want to be in limbo and it feels like if you're seven and nine are you close to being nine and seven or ten and six there just certain teams you feel like they top out with eight or nine wins and they're not going to get much better than that\nI Would rather be really bad to then get good or really good\nAh we've seen is in baseball with the cubs got really bad and the Astros got really bad and the Marlins have done this twice where they get really bad and then they get really good in football\nOr can you have a turnaround like that 'cause normally you bring in a new coach for an off into coordinator or new quarterback or so it's a little bit different and basketball I just need one guy who can come in and change the fortunes of your team\nYes ... and the AFC East I've heard the narrative that they're waiting for Tom Brady to retire so they are constantly rebuilding and waiting but it doesn't seem like that's about to happen\nAnd we thought maybe you know buffalo being a playoff team the jets were going to be a little bit better with sand Arnold and the dolphins were going to sort of be\nA you know they'd be a tough a tough out against New England they usually beat New England you know down there but the east is once again it's just sad division\nGoing back to David cars or their cars looking at the two thousand fourteen draft which of these quarterbacks careers isn't the best shape these were all draft in the first round for a second round lake portals Johnny Manziel petty Bridgewater Derek car Jimmy ... was it five guys\nDifferent direction I guess I'd rather be Jimmy gee you're always welcome and he's out for the season yeah\nI don't know what's gonna happen with teddy Bridgewater because if if you're you're waiting for Drew Brees retire I Can't see breeze no balance out here anytime soon you know what\nI yeah I I think my daughter had some market at some point you know he does but he sure see Mike in previews and that he's a pro just breeze look any different now than he did ten years ago to you\nWhen they threw it more so I think the being able to adapt to an audience that changes when you're the star of that office\nNow he's he's he's sort of the compass there ah he's not the star of the audience who feels like it's the running game that often should wind is really good you got good wide receivers their breeze almost feels like the complimentary quarterback to them\nDerrick car is second best in the league right now so he's got Seventy two percent completion for the best red zone a percentage oh I Know this okay\nWith Joe Flaco because the ravens had set a record for most red zone completion so early in the season Mm no though that\n\nThis is a Drew Brees all\nWell and then Derek car let me see if stats got this right of what I was asking for all of this so this is completion percentages and the red zone\nI'm looking at conversion I'm looking at converting a third down into a first down I'm looking at when you get into the red zone you score touchdowns that those are the number so uh if uh if Blair from statute that's where I'm looking for\nYeah boy who would you guess in the worst starting quarterback in a league in quarterback reading non rookie non ... [laughter] no offense is actually worth of morals or a former keys in the bottom five a quarterback rating or as one veteran\nMan I hate to pile on this guy\nTrying to do for markets Mario [laughter] sorry [laughter] that would throw interceptions and so now you can Marcus Mario to wow\nMm oh here the guy asking I uh I receive 'em\nSo just to completion oh no they didn't they didn't do that you All right so I Need to do I need red red zone conversion for touchdowns in third down conversions for first don't she asked me\nThat makes sense Abby's ... will be like Thirteen fourteen intro to yard yeah pass yeah I mean we've been saying that so yeah\nNot to pile on oh let's\nSee Brian in Boise joins ... what do you have for me today\nBy taking my call Dan for a long time by the woman in three border one eighty eight [noise]\nAll this talk about front office tanking and I apologize if I missed it but I Can't believe nobody's bringing up the Nineteen eighty nine Cleveland Indians\nOkay and lightness out pretty well all this out from up is taking these like James Taylor Ricky ... von Willie Mays Hayes and Pedro Serrano wouldn't be everyday name\nOkay you're right major league well done thank you Brian ... you know what we missed that\nThat that they they were told to tank and they defied the ownership yes the club\nI made a little extra help they did use voodoo is part of their product at\nA Willie Mays Hays\nHow how how long it's easy to take pictures to know not to throw him straight fastball serrano because it's kind of going out every clinic thrown out in the curveball I couldn't even touching\nYeah he had holes in his swimming like a young hobby by as you point in the what the hook on it not going to go to Scott in Texas joined genocide Scott what do you have for me\nToo and I saw two thirty [noise]\nBack to the whole you want to be a nadir two and fourteen I just want to be bad enough to get on the air it fired\n[laughter]\nWhatever that number is\nWhat do you think that number is Scott\nFail it may be only sixteen yeah might already arriving out for next year my no\nThank God yeah it's that's the number one question I get from cowboy fans\nIs always a how does Jason get fired when does Jason Garrett get fired\nThat that's what ... number one it's always about Jason ... and I don't know if Jerry I mean you're this far in I don't know Jerry is going to change coach is the only reason why I thought maybe of Jason Garrett gets fired and you want to bring in Sean Payton uh what do you leave New Orleans and he might not want to with that that\nTeam as good as they are right now\nBut if the money's great in Dallas what do you do something like that [noise]\nMy final hour coming up more phone calls [noise]\nAlso a check in with the Oakland Raiders [noise] just heard from Johnny Bench Johnny or send a tweet suffered sci fi displays the fall of gold glove is ten gold glove nice [noise] type final aren't coming up Bennett NSM Patrick show\nIs your job sucking the life out of you wake up you can do something else information technology I Know what you're thinking but\nI'm not a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer career go to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today\nYou could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four months my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot edu\nSingle alive you wake up you can do something else information technology I Know what you're thinking but\nI'm not a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer career\nGo to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today you could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four I'm On my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot E.

you know Ballenger in Muncie\nYeah I mean it's hard to get\nOut of the out of the line with the ... and ... you know what else do you get ... you know and and again and you'd go towards the last week and then go towards playoffs and what they're doing you look at their batting average and what their numbers are\nBut I just you know I just have to you know he just says invaded the who's fold they pulled all the strings to last a six week sort of Susan\nAnd and maybe the ... winter\nAnd they I mean he's got so many teachers they're seeing so many of these guys out there on the field pretty amazing team that\nYeah it's it's kinda hard for me to relatives who had a couple of these guys are allied I don't care about how their match you up but you know against Chris Sale you got to say at least an opportunity to switch over to the right side of the ... she absolutely but yeah it's it's the daughter is going to be happy everybody's going to be happy to get out a little warmer weather

you know when Johnny bed just watching the show he's tweeting and I if you'd have told me when I'm growing up I Would go to those games that I Would get tickets you know I Believe it or not you've got straight eight tickets\nI Do I don't know teams you know you got it yeah yeah that can tours\nOh well I don't know [laughter]\nYou know they could have been like I'm a charitable\nAttendant tick attendant [laughter] something we showed up but you would get to continuously it would be to the Padres like you know you got to pick my games you go to and you know this is one of the Padres had those uniforms that looked like used baby diapers\nAnd you know we'd go there and you know see Mike ivy you're you know those kind of guys are and I remember getting these tickets I didn't want their teams do this now\nWhere you get if you have straight A's or you know that they'll give you a group of tickets make loving\nI think I'm the only one in the room can ... to ... graduate I never heard of mine is I didn't even know what you meant when you said I'd never heard that expression\nIt was a wonderful thing where he and I don't know why teams don't do this I Want you to experience a game I don't care you know I Want to lower the cost and I want you to get into building because then I can get you to come back and if you send\nChildren to the game and let them experience it ... all those things then you have a better chance to have them coming back yeah see\nSo I just Googled 'em straight A's tickets in the reds come up first with I guess they still do my picture a you know I haven't gotten an animal around All right ah but sort of the cardinals actually okay I'm I'm maybe there's other teams that\nMaybe it's just good mid west people taking care of good mid west people with good grades I like that but but you did get tickets and you got to go to a ... now you sat in center field and they weren't good seats but I was in the ...\nUh nobody's spending all over because they know nobody Chris Cooper deal is a good deal because they got more than they had any right to expect given the fact that they were they had no more you\nKnow how to get him to be the receiver they drafted\nAnd I think they had just finally said look let's just move him\nAnd the fact that Jerry Jones is equally desperate equally nuts and offered her first [laughter] there's nothing wrong with that deal in a vacuum the Mac deal I think you know you could you could defend the notion well they've got to first such ... history is not good and in either of then\nYou're not going to get a player in the draft\nAs good as ... so I think that's harder that that's a hard one to sell\nBut it it's more just the idea that\n... was brought here to make the fan base feel good and the\nTwo years it had left and instill that in sort of said well you know what I Need to do is not what you want to see and so they're not buying it and they're not you know so I get an answer your question yeah it\nIt would have been more benign or are they staying but because they're not uh that's really you know everybody hates everybody now it's a much life\n[laughter]\nBut ... ... ... as he lost the locker room\n[noise] ah I think there are a lot of people in the locker room who know that they are very much short time merge\nAnd I think that you know that as much as anything is true\nUm because when you move on math and then you move confer after saying you're not that a little Cooper or\nAll of a sudden everybody's in clay and when everybody's in clay everybody's nervous and the coach can't tell you anything you're going to believe because he's already on the hook for having a ... for me when he told the team that he wasn't going to pray to mark Cooper\nAnd then quote something called them up\nWell don't take an absolute you just you just tell you you you say you know look you know where we're not we're not a good place right now anything could happen but I'm not clear up but I'm not looking to trade anybody\nYou know but you you sort of couch it so that there's a possibility that something could happen\nFrom what we've been able to glean so far all they heard was we're not trading Omari Cooper and then ... days later cooker is traded and then they don't get told right away they learned from swine like us\nAnd that really for us to do so yeah I think I took in large part you know for a bunch of different reasons he has lost the room\nAnd I don't know that he can get it back because\nHe can't make a convincing argument that\nThat these are the guys he wants to build with because it's there clearly not the guys he watched appeal to if he wants to redo this team from the ground up so they know they're you know they know they're playing for another job somewhere I don't believe they're going to quit but I don't believe they're going to give the hundred and ... percent that\nGordon always insist they do\n... to talk to you and we appreciate the time as always\n[laughter] [noise] well you know fall and great to mirror so easy for anybody\n[laughter] thank you may have to re route ... bay area\nAnd the raiders or a mess man I always like talking to re these fine\nOr you know when they say oh no we're not we're not trading you well you never know now is now John is going well we don't know who's going to call us like we're not actively trying to trade somebody but if you call is\nThen I might trade somebody\nI Would be a little uneasy if if Mac is traded and I'm Ari Cooper's traded and the possibility of dairy cars traded there is no untouchable there with the raiders and you might look at the raiders roster and say there shouldn't be any untouchable sheer michelob\nI honestly don't think this could go any better for the raiders this is now that they are the top I pick I mean this is really you had no idea that crude was have this much draft capital coming up they're like the patriots except they can't draft that's the only problem [laughter] that's a big lie I think you have to have faith that you're going to be better this time around you had just come in the draft I think a traffic\nIt's like saying I got brand new expensive shoes or jogging shoes but I can run I mean\nWhy do but I don't think John ... and look I Know they have\nBut I can drive like okay\nCouple of phone calls here ah Don and Michigan two inches high Don what do you have for me\nLove the show you guys do a great job don't change my ... all ... story straight days that I never had I'm sixty four so this happened in the middle sixties Catholic school they used to hand where you're at or cars and you bring it home mom and dad cited taken back well they switched to\nCoordinate on the dot matrix printer computerized cars and there was like a blank report card\nUnderneath the report card which I stuck in a typewriter and I gave myself straight A's Saturday at Boston Cleveland took it down the Cleveland this whole stadium\nThey get twenty reserved tickets for the Indians they had to get people in the stadium and back then and uh never got caught they gave me the tickets my older brother convinced me I was going to spend time in a slam up for this but I never did\nFor that or anything else they turned out okay if I Love your show\nDon do you feel better that you got it off your chest there you've been holding this for decades now\nOh I have a lot I saw a lot of people that I Know that [laughter] I thought it was probably one of my old report cards in the basement once when they were helping grandma and grandpa to clean up the basement and I got a a at a model here and we need to talk to you\nThank you Don way British ate them did anybody ever changed a great on their report card\nBali yeah like seventh grade it was really really ugly really are quite there's only a couple of letters that you can actually change into something else you'd be surprised that like an F F to be dealing with the data would be the derby was the simplest last and now it's common I think I did it\nI think so but you had to have your parents sign your report card so you had you had to make sure that they were you know they saw it yeah ...\nI had a kid my biology class to change the green from Mike sixty eight days when he did something with his pen and instead of obviously take his word for it the biology teacher took up his fancy microscope and had a way of putting it under there to see the strands of ink\nAnd matched up the colors and to see that one was over the other and he was able to figure out that it was something that was added after the fact that there was a great man what was his name\nHis name was Louis Miller I Believe random out [laughter] [laughter] no my ... and didn't match up right or you could you could tell if you look closely enough that one thing was written over the initial thing that the teacher put on and that's pretty amazing\nBut if he was that smart and trying to do that ... been smart enough to not get a sixty eight on a test\nAnd you would think there was actually very half one guy was incapable of you know either one of those things\nI think that particular test with like a mid term and there was like a sexual reproduction automated system all kinds of stuff there was a couple of them the average tests but he was a very good student in how embarrassing was and he didn't even take them over to the side into another room where a lab right in front of all of us takes up the microscope and so we're all watching this happen\nYou're getting your reading them out in front of me just read it in my own ethical snitches get stitches so embarrassing yeah he lives close\nIt was right across the bridge to ... over and showing them under the under the microscope like Howard was added after the fact that he cheated and I don't get a bad grade because you're just trying to trick me I can tell the ... over mine\nYes who now Lewis his boss is listening now let me go back over those reports on the minute you know what let me see your resume again that's odd this year where a three point five grade\nPoint average year coming or Louis that Mike in Missouri Mike welcome to the program\nSo I wanted to mention something completely random but I was watching the uh bucks play the pictures last night and they were saying that joy and beat and John I found it couldn't go we're going to achieve some stuff that hasn't been achieved wilt Chamberlain did it in the sixties and then got he was saying\nWhere people are being you guys have with the great they're not great yet they've only been played for ... for ... years they're very very talented but uh people are comparing them to all time great so I just wanted to get your opinion on people comparing guys like on a dictator low indeed\nA Steph Curry guys like that are very very talented I'll just say some of the best players league but why are people comparing to the grades I think that's just kind of absurd thanks for taking my call\nAll right but but that's what we do\nI mean we love that you compare arrows I mean it's not fair to compared but it but this isn't a perfect science you're just saying hey this guy is doing something that hadn't been done since this guy or it reminds me of this guy or the way this guy place\nBut I don't know if it was Mickey Mantle might've been er Willie Mays when somebody said uh you know uh but I didn't know forty forty forty or thirty thirty season was that big if I Would have done if I Would have thought that I Would have done it every year like they you didn't think of numbers were so numbers driven now\nEverybody's conscious of their numbers they're touches you know no matter what sport it is my numbers compared to somebody else's and that means more money that's not the way you know players played\nI'm sure of Larry Bird wanted average a triple double your average a triple double or if magic wanted out average a triple double he would average a triple double it just that wasn't really into binocular like you guys just played\nYou know you came out of a game you didn't say wait do I need what do I need for a triple double one more shit like that it just didn't happen that way now these guys have agents who are basing their salaries their negotiations off", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "city": "Iowa
