I you know so those are the things where you go I I have to trust my God\nAnd I think when you look at Tommy ... and Kirk Gibson is not even able to really swing\nAnd even when he walked to the plate and then you go it's a gut feeling that I have and it proved to be one of the most iconic moments in baseball history I don't know would Bucky Dent have have happened\nWhat Aaron Boone have happened I don't know if we go I got to play the analytics here\nI mean that that's what's always and it's usually baseball that we're looking at where you go I all I can bring in this guy for this match up or I'm gonna start this guy that's always one of my favorites where you go watch this guy starting I don't know I just had a feeling he's swinging the bad will be ... I don't know and then they go out there and they you know have a ...\nA great game become the store\nTo Adrian Peterson which one is coming up more phone calls we're going to stay with the whole question for the final forty five minute yeah these are ... said last probably got someone else here nobody out a lot of reaction okay only\nI think there was a Christmas Story to made someone just sent us an and lesser punk and they did they although they did a live version of that I don't know this looks like a movie\nI saw Matthew Broderick ... didn't they do a live version of Christmas Story on NBC I have a Christmas Story to made in two thousand twelve or a disaster okay\nBut when was the first one may yeah see\nThat's the first one is Nineteen eighty three okay then in Nineteen Ninety four there was another there was a sequel called my summer story which ran in theaters or as it runs in the family which followed the further adventures of the park or family from a Christmas Story and then you have\nA just a few years ago like Paul said a Christmas Story to officials sequel\nWeight was Peter ... who played Ralphie in the sequel now no he would never OK to that we know Peter Billing and yes you would never do that\nYes yeah I in fact I saw Peter ... what\nA couple of months ago in Los Angeles and you can't help but look at him and\nHe's still he's got to think he wears glasses and he got those big blue why he works with Vince Vaughn\nIn it you know you're dying to ask questions about Christmas Story to Ralphie but then you don't want to be the guy who's asking questions and I don't call Ralph either [laughter] name is Peter ... here notorious for that he's a very successful producer has\nHis name is not Ralphie you rub your call Jerry for our a turtle entire idea weeks ago I Know I did and he'd go to Jerry for our played turtle an entourage he said ... my mind is a deep economy turtle to only goes I\nDon't have any idea that somehow ... character I did called e you have a hard time with the answer I was a guy who for some right do you must have been really invested in that\nI was yeah yeah for [laughter] you can't call messy more of an either wasn't that therapy to billings we what the Hershey Chocolate milk and we used to do those commercials when it was a little kid I didn't remember them yeah he was messy Martin messy Marvin yup\nArm and then all the time I think he was messing Martin before he was a Christmas Story can kind of Christmas Story so good\nWell if I said it's a wonderful life or Christmas Story and you had to choose you only got one each holiday season\nIs Adrian Peterson Redskins running back out the giants coming up next game I was wondering about this\nDoes it bother you still bother you that you've finished runner up to Matt Weiner has been in two thousand four\n[laughter] [laughter] I'll realize\nThat you did I did and then oh okay you know especially\nYou know especially when the first freshmen and you know those are winning ... and stuff like that like ma'am I Know I really I should have been first freshman to to win a higher than trophy but now when I look over when I look back I'm just like okay I'll become a lot of great things you know mad\nHe didn't have the type of career that you know I'm ... I'm sure he and busy and having so you know he got the Heisman Trophy to kind of you know make her feel better about that\nBut I Do think you would change the voting process because I remember arguing and I didn't vote for the Heisman back then but I Would argue with people who did vote and say why don't you consider freshman and sophomore I thought Marshall fall cat a chance to win the Heisman\nAnd you too and that's you know a Herschel Walker and I said why why do we make this you got to be a junior or senior you're not being fair to the underclass men I think when you came along and rush for Nineteen hundred yards\nYou opened people's eyes to pay\nA freshman can be the best player in college football so you didn't win the highest one but I Do think you change the voting process\nYou know and I can look back and say you know what that that's good you know if it open the door for her\nTo freshmen come in and had opportunity then you know it was it was it was a good job by me he was funny about that year as well um I think marriage is where the only two running backs up for the Heisman Trophy and obviously I was the first one I didn't even when I Do walk her award\nFor the best running back\nYeah if I don't want us NATO prizes been told me when is it huh that was an odd year not bitter you're not bitter you you've you've totally let it go right you can as you can tell I can tell I remember\nYou telling me you had a black on black badly yes where's the black on black mentally that long gone\nActually yes long ... rid of it are you driving now well right now I'm driving a forward [laughter] for that for expedition out\nThe way they give it to you is that while you're driving in\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] ... [laughter] ... well my my car\nBack home as a as class Mercedes sixty three okay like on black again\nOkay I got one of those black on black yeah those are great cars now do you do the driverless you let it dry view\nNah nah I'm not that comfortable I like to be in control\nSo they get a little nervous I was also wondering is too because you finished runner up to liner\nAnd Alex Smith your current teammate finished fourth in that Heisman race did you know that\nYeah yeah yeah you know there\nIt was um exclude GOP thought about that sort of being here and it's like you know how things can kind of come around full circle ...\nPhrasing are coming out of high school if it wasn't Oklahoma you would have gone to\nUSC oh [laughter] yeah\nTexas now lives in Texas was already out the picture because many brown said hey you know said it misses coming back for senior year so we're going to be loyal to him he you know he started to the first one so after he leaves that you could take off I got every other school telling me hey you can come to compete for the store and job\nWaiting you ought to have gone to Texas if Mack Brown says you can come come in and compete for the job\nYes oh man how close was do you want to see\nIf they were on the west coast so it was close you know I 'cause Oklahoma it was it was really close it was really really close really close\nBut then you would have been competing with Reggie Bush yeah him Allendale why owners have been ... oh my God yeah I Know about those gas yeah all the fun wow ...\nWho coached shoot a you didn't have switzer\nDid you know coastal oops okay by a by foods are going to run back coach\nNo that's right yeah yeah yeah um I also was curious about this with what like the evolution or maybe lack of the road with the running back with lowering your head um that this was supposed to be a big deal that running backs can't lower their heads but that hasn't been called very often how come I thought they were gonna enforce that this year\n[laughter]\nYour line that they're not I'm sure yeah\nYou know and I think it's a it's a natural movement for the running back you know I think is more of a focus on you know defenders you know and then blow on their heads when they come into you know to tackle guy as a buffer running backs those kind of hard to to lawyers shoulder pads and you know\nWhat do you like ... go ahead\nI mean do you get your bell rung I mean you get you know they they even when you're lowering your head or you are I'm sure you're bringing other people's bells but do you mean do you lower your head and get your bell rung\nOf occasionally that might happen but you know for me I'm really having his parents that normally when I when I I you're ready to lower my head you know I'm I'm seeing what's coming towards me so I'm able to gauge enough I'm going to hit this guy with my shoulder pads you know\nAnd it's happening so fast I'm so normally you know I gave her right when I lost my head I kind of know where I'm where I'm going and you know who's approaching me you know so you can't you can't afford those as well as when\nAs soon as really when you got the defenders who or you know kind of really making the last move to make a taco or guys are flying in after you're wrapped up tomatoes tackle tacos um that should come in when they're faced with a phrase mess up you know to prevent hurting themselves in calls an injury to other players\nIf you could be any running back in the league now\nWho would you be Adrian Peterson\nCold now you're already Adrian Peterson who's who if I said I can pick a young running back and you can be that running back now\nMhm would you be ... or ... it'll be dog tag early or I'm Barkley oh really those those are those guys are ...\nOh yeah yeah and that he is now I Love that kid you know ... ... heart worker you know where you know I just love high he or you know carry carry himself itself and oh Barclay just watching him as well man you know I I I I can see it\nYou know so I'm just going to watch 'em an overly cautious should of course was shut down this week or so you are sort of the courtroom dot as we continue to watch them for sure\nIf I talk to you in three years what are you doing\nI'm Barbie seeing hearing the same room [laughter] you know\nOkay when they interview you think you'll make you think you'll still be planted thirty six yeah [laughter] if if that's\nWhat I Want to do you know I don't feel like anything else will keep me from doing that for us like talent or anything like that so\nAnything you know on on your grip when you shake people's memory we had an issue with this were man\nYeah we do that yeah that can be eased up a little bit\nI I have a I I Am how about some data Adrian I mean that's man [laughter] yeah you are you a lot of people\nPersonally with those [noise] ...\nOh I Would I wouldn't Jake I wouldn't shake your hand and not out of disrespect I just don't want my head hurt\n[laughter] just lose that there is a though ... other than yourself huh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "24"}
