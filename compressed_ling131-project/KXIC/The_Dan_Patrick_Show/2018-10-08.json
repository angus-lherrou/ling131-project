{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "Did you take a lot of showers or and I see you look good\nWhile the cleanup nice you know I was thinking I I mean I should have like a some walk up music or for the morning shows ... when thinking about hockey games coming back and black or some enter sandman near the program\nDr [laughter] how 'bout uh quickly thinking off the top of my head all let me see if I can pull it up and maybe it will be route your oh keep going how would a hockey game for you\nI Know I didn't get to enjoy it while I ... I listen to the game for most of the first half but then I was I'm like I Do some mobile DJ business on the side and had a wedding dance on Saturday Night so\nThat took up a most of my um uh most of my Saturday Night uh but uh what I'd be curious and I um\nWould Iowa in Iowa State both one scoring forty eight points I'd be counted out when was the last Saturday both teams won score and forty eight or more points and I got to be a long long time\nWell obviously there was no defense and the Iowa State of Oklahoma State game that's football and the big twelve that mean that's just I mean obviously it's just all kinds of ah not finding the song that I Want\nBut a a ... I Believe it was the name the the quarterback for the third quarter back\nFor Iowa State comes up with the wind on the road at number twenty five Oklahoma State that's a that's a pretty good effort there for the cycle and then I Will winning in that hostile environment anytime you go for the battle for ... Rosedale ah it's always a grind in Minneapolis a but the the guys want to but I ... I Would look\nLike on the coverage when you're talking about pretty ah the cover of the Ohio State um a town football game where they based out of the also Ohio State or I'm Sorry Oklahoma State Oklahoma State uh that would be still water Stillwater it said pretty awful [laughter] like that's a classic right there\nAnd they gave all the stats and everything that was just a bunch\nOf those aids Rosenfeld tonight ... going to be getting ready to go\nSo but yeah and again it's a great show a sign up reaction Monday Night so during the football season five to six oh well it's the same time during the basketball season's wellbeing during the football season uh again it's hard to find better analysis wrote then you'll get from a former rival quarterback jak long and former Iowa State quarterback said Rosenfeld uh between that layers\nThat speak extremely well in eloquently about how to how to get their thoughts across\nYeah and they break it down so that uh the the the common fan common man can um you know I can understand that and and get a good sense of what's going on housing teams are doing what they're doing or why things happen in certain ways I thought a last week's show with a great example\nChuck given a great breakdown of how teams as a whole mis manage the by week\nUh and just you know all the different ... thought processes that go in to figuring out how you're going to handle it you know how much time do you get the guys off how do you keep them sharp with enough of practice time and stuff like that and\nYou know so the ... coming off the ... you never quite know how things are gonna go when you're talking Nineteen twenty Twenty one twenty two year old guy ... they've up thirty one point yeah um but uh you know and in this day and age a win is a win and a complaint I make what they what they are what what you're seeing is\nThat separation it's ... it's Wisconsin Iowa probably in the battle\nFor the uh the Big Ten west unfortunately uh Wisconsin as the tie breaker in that Rob\nA but it looks like Wisconsin in Iowa where the cream of the crop in the Big Ten west\nAnd uh so now we take on a Indiana or they just lost their game last weekend and so there one in one right now and I wanted to and so uh Indiana\nProbably not well big of air on there and improved team I I think they started off the seasons Reno or of course then early in the big ... I think to open the big ... Big Ten season\nAgainst Ohio State and Ohio State just blast and everybody that gets in their way or with or without urban Meyer uh so uh but they're an improved team uh they've certainly better themselves as an offensive team and it's going to be at Indiana so up again there are no easy wins on the road in the big tent\nNorthwestern one also and so they're looking good at two and one but so that was a big a big win for North west and why did I miss you date yeah that was huge and so I'm\nNow we turned her eyes once again to Indiana so we'll get we're going to be on the air this Saturday on the eye heart radio ... dot com and right here on the court like comfort care of eastern Iowa bumper brigade on the air eight o'clock in the studio\nAnd eleven o'clock we kick it over to Indiana for the kick off and then a five PM Hawkeye huddle will be at Hudson's will be at Hudson's so come on down\nAnd I won the thing that really really quick before we do about it if I Want to tip our hats to the brewers\nAre there are still going strong and as a cubs fan lifelong cubs fan I'm not afraid to root for for a while\nAnd only ... you like yeah you kind of like to see somebody uh even if they are arch rivals uh somebody within your division to carry the mantle carry the flag of so to speak [noise] um and uh you know once the brewers you know beat the cubs and that one game playoff or the\n... central title um you you start hearing more and more experts even before I mean they were kind of talking before that they really felt the brewers were playing the best that they are off actually maybe have the most consistent lineup from top to bottom in while their starting pitching isn't the best they've got such a strong bullpen\nUm you know if you're starting to go five or six innings then turned over to the pen a it it's almost lights out and a lot of people a lot of these so called experts you know or that kind of waving the ... brewer banner that they're going to take it all away\nAnd I think they should I was just reading here really quick they ruined their third or a a ... in club history I'm In having run one eleven in a row now so they are absolutely\nWhite hot you know it's ah yeah you got picking up the right time you know I'm all you think about all the ups and downs during the cubs season and uh you know it's you don't hear so often you know obviously baseball especially if the marathon it's not a sprint and\nYou're a took a hundred and sixty three ... and then there's also the adage it's not how you start it's how you finish out and the cubs while they started slow unfortunately they also finished slow and that's why they kind of limped out a lot of the ...\nYou brought up at something interesting the all star break we lead with most ... runs scored and then and then absolutely tanked after the old guy\nYeah I think [noise] I forget exactly what it was yeah a debt to after the all star break or they were just almost dead last and run production yeah I'm In the national league\nAnd we lost a lot of close games to to won three to two and so\nAnyway forty games where they scored one run or know runs\nReally I mean I Love those statistics on that's baseball for you right out of there is a statistic basically on everything but we've got the damn Patrick show up neck and I'm sure he's going to have a lot to talk about as far as the Vikings are very\nBig window to the Vikings at the eagles uh yesterday they kept it interesting that all the way to the end um and uh yeah so uh the ... when does when a when NFL\nIs a win and today is touched tag days right before I leave the studio I'm going to run into the production room in ... say not as you've gotta catch me for you gotta catch out here and I think I got him and then I got some sprints on yet\nA fifty seven right now is mark Monday's with mark right here on eight hundred K. act science the recapping once again it's the science hawk reaction the only place in eastern Iowa that you can hear it is right here on eight hundred kick science the but anywhere in the state or anywhere in the world that you have a wife high and data\nOr you can download that I heart radio ... and we will have that for you or at tonight from five to six recapping the great Hawkeye wind for both programs\nUh I Would stay over Oklahoma State and uh Iowa over Minnesota Dan Patrick show up next and I said he's new an sports station eight hundred ... dot com happy\nI hardly radio goes one on one was Steven Tyler from Aerosmith to ask what it was like to run his twenty eleven autobiography\nTwo years it was um\nIt really is you're\nListening to I hard radio for more of Aerosmith and all your favorite artist ...\nTo build a winning streak on the road\nEveryone's shoes are shot I\nFollowing Saturdays forty thirty one victory in Minnesota Buckeye football travels to Indiana this weekend for having eleven o'clock kick the\nOne cost at home or always been the defense but in particular the front for pressure led by and Anthony del so they'll have three of I was five ... against the gophers and agreed his success does it happen without the rest of the defense performing its role\nYeah definitely one of them as as we focus on but uh you know rush didn't get into the quarterback is the entire defense do we got to cover in the back in and uh you know do our job a front luckily we had enough time getting to the quarterback is no different than learning how to walk\n\nI Believe everyone deserves a second chance we all are humidity we've all the mistakes\nTeam courting to Jay Glazer\nIt had been on my heart honestly says it had been on my heart [noise] um and I think all the phones both of us on and just kind of came out in the wrong way I'm In touch with him and I asked five minutes to talk to the same goes\nFor like we don't really know if we're not on the same page of his ... and we can all understand each other and there's going to always be with your fish so\nHave you ever do that was big for me I was nervous to get a van and these are your brothers you see every day but once it up there in front of all of them the lunar writer so I'm just excited about the way we pull together [noise] I'm like I said we came up short but we don't\nRegret anything medicine if it's if it's for us to come together as a team like we did that they are the kind of a sort of how much you talk to your teammates first now\nWhy is it and you tell the media and then you have to tell you are to me how about you have a team meeting\n... ... I mean if you really want to tell people about your heart\nThen you can do it guys\nYou know what we need passion here you know he like how do I make you better I Need you better I Need the ball I Want to make play whatever it is you don't need to go let me sit down and go oh I Know you've got doubts about your quarterback yeah what about playing in New York and I don't know\nAll right\nAnd then that galvanized you let's see how long it galvanizes you does it galvanizes you on Thursday night against the eagles yeah for ...\nAnd sometimes things come out the wrong waiting just bored something out to him you know in passing this was prepared plan sit down interview with Lou Wayne next to him and Joe CNN is and how he agreed to do this and I I don't I don't think and not think something pork and come out of it when he didn't talk to his team directly they're going to hear about it after\nThe fact well I don't even know if uh ESPN went through the team to get this interview you know this is Dale ... ... you know being in the spotlight and ... ... is he the team leader\nI I don't I don't know he hasn't acted like a team leader and even this is an acting like a team leader but and the giants play\nThey play well enough that obviously they could have won that game a damn Patrick show brought you buy discover card they believe anniversary should be a time a celebration not obligation and that's why they think annual fees are ridiculous and now for just giving them a dry discover will give new card members at one year anniversary gift will never forget\nAt the enemy your first year they'll match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar ... know catches try it and believe it at discover dot com\nOr will digest what happened uh with the fight I'm Ariel ... covers the sport he'll join us coming up Reggie Miller had some strong comments Reggie was like in ... the post to fight fight\nTo what happened at the pound smell is at the palace with Ron R. test so a wrench involved in that so he'll join us coming up\nA little bit later on a lot of baseball over the weekend a and a lot of baseball coming up today and tonight the brewers advancing congrats them they still seem like a there the faith in the national league or at least that's the fan favorite\nOr to go to the world series here and it also will look back on a college football over the weekend what kind of ... looking at my glove and\nOne question off the outback um junior yup or his comments ultimately good for the giants for bad for the giants because all of a sudden they're they broke thirty for the first time since ... ... a decade ago\nI still don't like how you do it like you're not sure you want to be in New York you just got paid dude like that's all he wanted was to get paid now he's not sure he wants to be in New York I don't want to hear that from you but is it possible that has a positive effect in a weird way that you don't want to be in New York\nFor the team and you just got paid so I don't understand that logic what because he lie is\nNot an elite quarterback now you don't want to be there well he lives only going to be there this year\nBy the looks of this so\nHow long has your contract not one year\nI just you know it it just in maturity what it is like hey I I ... it's it's selfish is what it is\nHow can that possibly help Eli Manning where you're going to question him and you're saying you're not sure you want to be in New York so that galvanizes you\nMaybe I don't know they they looked like a new all science yesterday it gets pretty good defense\nWell I don't think it's any say you know am I look scared back there at times he just looks like he's nervous and he doesn't throw anything down the field if they block if the line blocks\nI'm assuming you're a star players will get the ball does does oh back and say you know I got doubts about ...\nHe didn't do that duty he should do and it varies every recall people out there that that's going to see on the opposite end of the questions is coaches coaches got there yes\nIt is a little weird not that I Want to nip pick on every word that he's saying but it is a little weird to be like I'm Glad I was able to make this happen\nYeah congratulations it's a funny way to CNN doing something really stupid and to be in that hey you know and all of a sudden he's the martyr in some way like people are upset at me but that's okay because as long as I was able to pull the team together I'm I'm okay with that it's like such an odd thing to say it's a wonderful talent but he's not somebody I Want I don't want him on my team\nNow not every wide receiver has to be a diva oh\nNo casually you can just keep your comments to yourself or maybe talk to your teammates or maybe you know how about this novel approach to go to Eli in say\nHow do I make you better how do I get that magic back that we had a couple of years ago what what's missing here is right now you stink yeah and I want you to be better yeah right now my question if you were any good and I question if I Want to stay in\nThe might be one of those guys that just always says ... things like he means well but says it the wrong way\nAnd then you take credit for it [laughter] well did somebody asking you lie or did you get motivated by auto back him juniors comment ...\nRefunding to you I just showed up to that press conference with both the super bowl rings on and just ... happened the wood ducks [noise]\n[noise]\nI Will come up with a poll question jaws will join us coming up your phone calls on a Monday best and worst of the weekend eight seven seven three D. P. show our Twitter handle ... show and we'll collect all those are coming up throughout the show we'll come back with Ron Jaworski right after this show the damn Patrick show\nSimply save home security they're the best of what they do and you know what I'm not prone to hyperbole but you can't help but just how verbal bouquets when it comes to simply say home security the system is beautifully designed to look good in your home and you're actually going to want to use it a\nLot of people don't use their security systems and they're like I Want to turn it on\nSimply safe makes

you safe protecting your home if you lose power you lose Internet connection somebody attacks the system and uh you know what I also love is no long term contracts nobody else provides this right\nLike they make you shine that long term contract why best all around the clock protection you can find it simply say fourteen Ninety nine a month protect your home today I get free shipping free return simply saved in dot com that simply said Dan dot com and tell them we sent you good luck [noise]\n\n\nOver if you are when you're not gonna yep just a cleaning [noise] haven't been here for six months\nYou'd have some loose lipped time I'll be the first to admit it and it got me in trouble but you don't ... the coach always was the one that rectify that problem\nThe rams um I thought they were going to lose the game going into it I thought Seattle was going to beat them but you know they they survive there and that's all you have to do and obviously with the fourth one play but\nLooking at this it feels like that division you know winning that game in Seattle means they're going to win that division and winning handily um maybe there was no doubt there but your thoughts on\nYou know the rams long haul here the bigger picture here is that you got any questions about that defense\nOr after yesterday's performance I I Do and they have they have not been consistent and obviously they've invested a lot of money and you know in an era Donald ... sue on the defensive line but as a unit or they've been getting pushed around a little bit and people in may have been able to move the football on them but what's going to to to help this is the rams\nAs a season whereas on his are off and so I mean it is literally unstoppable even after you know losing\nYour first and second best receivers they're still able to move the football and maintain\nOur fence and you know what's going to happen is they're they're gonna get leads in games they're going to force teams that play catch up and get on that note passing situation and if the defense knows you have to throw the football man what they can do ... radically and that secondary line backers and let's just make it very very difficult so I think the rams we'll figure it out defensively as they go on a I think the\nAlthough camp sees playing good football you know I Would say right now the rams the team debate\nSpeaking of the cheese with more homes and you break down as much tape if not more than anybody what is what is a Patrick my home's weak spot here but defense us that are going to try to hone in on\n... it's amazing I I haven't looked at the same from yesterday's game yet I you know I I I Will probably within the next couple of hours but I've looked at his previous games and they were ... we all we all see the play making ability and the guy\nWhen he was coming out I thought he would be good I never thought he'd be this good I thought he was a little bit erratic ah I thought the accuracy you know because of the big guys you just take longer to develop the touch fast says he has done that ah the the one thing that I Would say it jumps out but but what would concern me a little bit\nIs because he can run he does and quarterbacks that can run well both on the pocket prematurely they won't stay with their progression but what he's able to do is when he does move out of the pockets set\nReset and throw the football with uncanny accuracy and velocity anticipation so he's doing all those little things but you know the as good as he's playing I think it's going to get a lot better\nAnd I'm watching the show and watching last night I mean he he got to have self preservation here I I don't know why these quarterbacks think that you know these injuries only happened to other quarterbacks and dish on Watson I I don't know how he last the entire season I don't need you to be a tough guy\nI I Want you to be there for sixteen games not take on a defensive back on a run for you know a two yards\nAt the end I think I may have mentioned you were talking about Carson and went over the past year you know and people talk about you know advice you give quarterback since I talked to guys and you know what what should quarterbacks do and and I have a pretty common phrase like you say put in some Peyton Manning tape [laughter] you know and\nAnd and watch Peyton because when the ... on the on the pocket was collapsing around and he wasn't trying to fight for a yard or to yes he wouldn't move around the pocket and let someone uncovered but Payton was you know he'd go down he wasn't going to take that hit because of Vail ability\nIs more important than ability you got to be on the field in the Sean watching you know season ended last year it's going to end again this year if he doesn't protect himself\nGo to visit with the jaws who's always we appreciate your time thank you\nAlways always great with your breaking down on a Monday morning Dan\nThank you Joe says a ... a former ESPN enlist it'd be watching tape go down into the basement watch tape back it up for backing up on him and Merrill Hodge most guys they'd go down into the fall to the NFL Films made they disappear for days it felt like the apple\nDoesn't that sound fun and has a job like you got to tell me what you did all day Sunday Monday afternoon now is watching them ... tape for three hours\nYeah but there's going to be a book on him and whatever it is it still goes back to the inexact science of playing that position\nThe fact that Texas was going to make Patrick my home's a defensive back if he went to Texas reportedly he was going to be made into a defensive back\nThat the people who were looking at him at the combine and his game tape when he was at Texas Tech you know what you think far does crazy things this guy is going to have twenty moments in a game where he's going to do crazy things these these are all things said about it\nSo that's why when people look at this and they're they're falling all over Patrick ma homes\nThe ... they're the same people who missed on all of this that's what's amazing people criticize the chiefs were going up too high to get Patrick ...\nThese are all things that actually played out this isn't speculation these are all things that play down you know maybe we'll make him a defensive back\nThis guy can't miss this is the guy who was far when John Elway michelob\nI think that it fell scouts can be looking at that current tax a secondary they seem to like to put great quarterbacks and the weather didn't ah Johnny tell us they did the same thing that energy three\nJohnny Manziel and a Robert Griffin\nWere supposed to both supposed to be defensive advantage of that is pretty good trio right\nNow I Wonder if you got a Heisman Trophy winner plant defensive back for Texas right\nNow could be maybe somebody could play quarterback Roethlisberger\nTell us he was recruited what's my hide in the tide in Ohio State or something yeah tied in\nA couple of phone calls to your best and worst of the weekend or Palmer and Oregon leads you to solve pi Palmer what do you have for me\n[noise] hey what's going on and on\nUh I I for our decide if it works is that we barely buy a car I watch the raiders check to pay ... a really bad ... ... ... yeah go up\nAnd ah my extra early by far my new favorite ... illiterate shut it down on every single day leading to fight just sold areas or Larry\nHilarious yeah he went he went down to is a underwear thanks for the phone call there\nYeah it's kind of interesting uh interview there Joe Rogan was doing the interview with\nThat whole fight though I Know you know there is at no point did I think that kind of McGregor is going to win but\nHe was over managed and you know when you you jump back in Maine you better be I thought that he would have developed himself as a boxer more to be more dangerous because when it came to wrestling a beam was going to take him to school\nBut now that all played out and you know I've talked about this before with Dana White you know Dana White at some point wants to sound like he's you know the commissioner of the NFL or major league baseball\nHe has to act like he's bothered by this stuff like\nMy God Conor McGregor so disappointed in him and then all of a sudden I can make a couple of hundred million dollars of Conor McGregor and all the comments kind of macgregor had prior to the fight about who beat him and his family terrorist and then all of a sudden you whack surprised that there is something that happens after the fight\nAnd ... yeah yeah\nIt's it's I think the state of white just has to say look I'm Vince McMahon here All right\nYou don't try to tell me that you got this moral compass that you're really concerned about the sport you're a businessman and you're going to have a rematch in six months and I'm sure the same stuff's going to be said and people are going to buy it but you know all of a sudden these like you know I got these ethics and oh my God\nSo disappointed really I think it was a good weekend for him and may I think it was a good weekend for Dana White I really do you have all\nMight be a really dumb statement but is there any downside to the enemy 'cause you can find a lot of social media videos from this weekend there were other fights in the stands in the concourse during the event is there any danger that\nYou can have a drive where you go All right well at least got three I mean the the value of talk or for the ravens got one block yesterday but it but he's invaluable I mean he's probably the best player at his position of every player in his position in the NFL\nJustin Tucker might be that much better than everybody else\nThen the second best guy and his position\nFew more phone calls here are best and worst of the weekend mentioned Georgia Hi Mitch\nIn a six foot two hundred [noise]\nAh my worst that we can was a terrible first strike calling attuned your last night all the ship all um and obviously the best for the weekend was the only pitch or he took him to put a grand slam to give the Braves the first one to the Sears\nYeah that was a big hit I thanks for the phone call I like when they said you know you're the youngest guy to hit a grand slam in the postseason since Mickey Mantle Nick junior goes I I don't know who that is [laughter] I I don't I don't know who this Mickey Mantle or that you speak of is\nJosh in Indiana hey Josh when you have for me\nMartin dead I was doing a great Josh forty\nDriving back from Detroit right now I'm On our Ninety four I think I'd pass ... about thirty miles that their choices\n[laughter] didn't pick them up okay\nThat's got to be my where it's just going full blown college kicker and ... I Hope this farm I'd like to see you know I'm a pretty loyal sad but a lot of stuff's all shoveled estate itch and I'm a loss though sometimes sometimes it's titled out\nAll right well thanks for the phone call yeah it's one thing to get rid of somebody who you are to bring in like he might not white Crosby has been good for the Packers\nBrandon in Cincinnati Hi Brandon\nDan may but a a five seven to twenty six [noise]\nMy best of the weekend or my Cincinnati\nBengals scoring twenty four [noise] fourth quarter point\nTo win and my worst of the weekend is CBS inexplicably or by NFL rules having to cut out the end of the overtime game for the second time that the you know a set citing NFL rule yeah believable and I just want to say thank you Todd [noise]\nAll right back your brand and the bangles down Seventeen came back an a beat the dolphins yes the club\nI'm not sure how good the dolphins are I'm [laughter] I'm not sure how good the bangles or\nI feel like the Bengals are better than the dolphins\nYeah but I keep wondering how they're using Ryan ... what they really have them because the Bengals have pretty bad defense and they kind of dominated them\nI was watching the bills game just mean Josh Alan ... he's he's gotten nimble fee for being a guy that big any any does well I don't think they're very good but I I Want to see how you perform in a big moment in you know granted it's you know against Tennessee and you're at home but\nYou know young in their\nEven Josh Rosen\nWith the cardinals and you know just you're trying to survive out there and you know those rookie quarterback so they went for no yesterday did they\nThey did but they all passed for like an avid denying the artist known Baker Mayfield through for three hundred yard or a ... Allen through for eighty to ... yeah well that's not a good team that's how they got a window\nAnd saw it against a a very good defense Tennessee yeah you're gonna have to win by three points you know Seventeen fourteen stuff because\nArnold by the way I did have some big big play yeah he did it it's nice to welcome him back I Know that's a weave one\nEverybody was oh I hadn't heard anything about Sam Darnell didn't last couple of weeks yeah apple\nThen last week I Would like to you know the titans are exciting but look at their grinding it out yeah three in one\nAnd then how you lose the bill yeah you're definitely the only non bills are tightened fan who actually checked in on that game that was like an immediate pass on red\nAs it is sometimes pathetic what I'll watch where I'm going to go and I'm gonna check on the bills why nobody scored yes ...\nAnd when you're in Vikings eagles and ram Seahawks going on at the same time that the cardinals forty niners game at all even for the red zone kind of when he went through and it's like you don't even want to see like even a minute or two that even\nIf even if ... was there you'd probably still don't want to watch that yeah I'm a club\nI was so confused a good game was at noon on Saturday and the bad game was poor Indiana's supposed to play a new what happened\nWell Ohio State do you want them a little bit later on\nI don't like to join asking saying then\nYeah but he's putting up some big numbers there make love and you could be in trouble could be in trouble more phone calls best and worst of the weekend talk some baseball with Jim corruption and Reggie Miller an aerial hell wanting will join us as well to more hours to go [noise]\nThese days you can\nFind just about anything on line but if you're looking to buy a car online shopping often leads to confusion but not anymore\nIntroducing troop price from true car now you can know exactly what you pay for the car you want including fees and accessories and best of all you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people paid for that same car you want\nSo when you're ready to buy a new or used car visit true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience\nIs your job sucking the life out of you wake up you can do something else information technology I Know what you're thinking I'm\nNot a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer career go to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today\nYou could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four months my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot E. D.

to Karen I cry council\nA treat a best and worst of the weekend how 'bout ours Fritz he'll start with you\nBest and worst thing that we can go in college football with both Beth Texas Oklahoma Red River showdown lived up to the high points again Ninety three total points scored most in the history the matchup exciting from start to finish and then we asked the question is Texas back\nWorse for the weekend Florida State blowing it twenty points in Miami first time the Seminoles last that the hurricanes since two thousand four\nAnd the defensive coordinator for Oklahoma Mike's troops got fired and now you give up what forty point what if what if Oklahoma won that game fifty one forty eight ... does he does he get fired when\nMaybe make a lot of investment worst I'm going to go the opposite for the defense from both Texas and Oklahoma I I've never seen every cliche about big called defense was proved in that game it was unbelievable screen passwords to Seventy or play every time\nBest is the artist Banksy I I think we all know this story sorry if I still seasons here\nHe uh his paintings auction for one point three million dollars is how the bees and then re did to automatically ... so ... right after the purchase ... died in front of\nPeople so they bid on this I think it was one point four million and went for and then all of a sudden the painting storage moving and he had built a shredder into the frame\nSo great and then on Instagram on his Instagram he showed how we yeah it it I saw that and like the planning now the ironic part so that I was going to do the same a dangerous at your worst that was my best oh that was your best sorry I didn't mean to cut you off you\nKnow I and I knew the whole time I was feeling is proceeding here's my question are you proud of he bought that I'm a psych defy at one point three million\nI was told watching it'll be worth more money because of what happened\nSo my best over the weekend was going to be banks he ... his own artwork my worst of the week and is that it backfired totally and now it's more than double\nIn ... and so when it sold for the one point four million that was triple what they thought it would get and now it's already doubled from that just because it's the shredded one that is the art world is fascinating\nHe likes to thumb his nose at people you know I mean banks you if you if we don't know who use but there's a documentary and it's it's so great of what banks he's done and all these pieces of work throughout the world um any any loves to you know his nose at the art world but when we\nUh when I was in Amsterdam they have a Banksy museum there that he they were very up front that he does not support the this museum and he ... none of this money goes to him like he's not in which\nCould be a front to a but it's all done without his permission but it is fascinating to look at the the work that he's done and sort of the message the messaging behind all of it is amazing\nYeah I think this thing is a big big scam I think a bunch a group of artists came up with a fake name of a fake person\nThey're trying to do to John Paul ... or a Thirty Years' later\nAnd I don't believe that in any way to ask you I was a person I Know I Know what I'm saying is they're trying to create something so I don't believe it's a real parts I think it's a collaboration\nOf three or four people who created a a fictitious person that can never be found if there's no real person you can never find this person interview on I'll bet you ten years from now story comes out that this was four or five artist who said let's do something where you could really make something big make some money off it and it's working on\nI'll take the opposite\nBecause they knew how about a person Banksy shower shame yeah maybe banks she can create the sharp shame poor\nSee them all the SEC wound lie still remain yeah they they are a little bit of entitled but just ... they have to have some close games at some point right this can't continue I mean I Know they value in Auburn yeah but I don't even\nKnow you know Auburn lost again so I don't I don't know if we look at all burning go I\nI

being in the middle or you know where people can't get in and out that you were I think you were doing people a disservice by by taking the window and crash would\nSay so I don't feel like such a jerk

S. C. controls all the production\nI'm not surprised I'm I'm very happy that someone like uses you know say I'll say like a novice them and they spend noticed is that because that unlike anything else than any other sport approaching our sport it's still run like pro wrestling\nYeah but who's going to be offended by this I mean you're watching you see that give us was what you pay for don't you\nOh it's not so much being offended it's just that they don't want you to see it so it's the same thing when someone is coming off a year long suspension for steroids\nThey won't tell you the real story as to why he was way they'll just say he was out of action for a year [laughter]\nYou know it's all through rose colored you know say again and I I Know I hate the comparison is apt to be in the sense that\nYou know I I Would get all fired up in in April I was getting a couple of people were saying like all the the Brooklyn incident with the bus was you know scripted but that wasn't scripted and I think you saw on Saturday just how personal this thing was the way they present their show and the way they shy away from talking about the truth\nIs is is to me a very big problem and two dozen Eighteen the audience is far enough and you saw that on display on Saturday Night because they kept\nGoing further back for further back to not show you and and and look everyone has cellphone footage everyone saw it eventually I think it makes them look bad for trying to hide it\nSo what happens next\nFor what happens next is that Nevada will probably you know give Habib some kind of punishment of fine suspension but it's not going to be anything drastic cheated awkward to get strip\nAnd and and and Dana said afterwards that you know anyone who ran into the cage or threw a punch if if any of those people are on the USC roster and some are on the USC roster they will be cut off of that I'll say why you didn't cut anyone\nAfter what happened in Brooklyn and there were people on the USC roster who are you know involved with that incident at the ... center with the ... and the chairs to being thrown at the bus so you can't do it now\nYou know everyone on this Monday morning wants to blame someone they want to blame Habib for jumping over they want to blame Connors trading partner deal and Dan is for yelling at 'em they wanna blame Connor for throwing the punch they want to blame Habib trading partner for punching ... guess what\nEveryone's to blame for maple to October everyone is to blame everyone has some sort of part and all of this from from the way this was promoted to the talk about religion and family\nAnd and and Russian politics everyone was to blame you cannot be a surprise for what happened on Saturday this was very combustible and so at this point it just to move on except it and at some point I Would not be shocked if they do the rematch and I would certainly not be shocked if all this footage that everyone is claiming to be so upset about is used heavily in the promotion for that rematch\nWell done real good to talk to you again thanks for joining us was always\nMy pleasure anytime\nAerial hill wanting covers the sport for uh ESPN yeah he's right I mean this has been a six month process here and they he's right on the rematch they're going to be showing you\nKnow kind of McGregor picking up a barrier and trying to put it through the bus again and what happened in the crown\nMaybe you put it may be ... you and close the cage so nobody can get in and nobody can get out may maybe that maybe it's a glass dome there a glass ceiling from your uh these two\nYou know we've got to keep him caged oh yeah\nI Do think he's right you know that you you you're all of a sudden you have Dana wide who's making it seem like you know this is so sad\nYou know this is a shame so it's unfortunate damage still good as what you want him to say yeah boy\nThis real thing is when you see Conor McGregor trying to get out of the ring trying to climb and they pull them back and he's being pulled in by a bunch of big dudes wearing sport coats like you know ... ... security guys but not hardcore security guys man and he looks a little like he's well he's not a big guy but he looks we next to them we but he's swinging for the fences there swinging at\nHim I Know it was funny uh best worst of the weekend Adam Adam in Iowa joined just take a break
