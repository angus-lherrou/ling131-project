know maybe I'm getting a little deep you know CSI and they'll be here but you know I'm just curious about that that what did you see that you would go automatically and I do think that Joe West was probably fooled by the other fan who was reaching out\nAnd he didn't make any contact but he's the one that was reaching out unless Joel West thought that ... you know his a sideline was impeded with you know the fans hands something like that then that's another thing but\nIt just didn't feel like that that was just hey that's cut and dried yeah ...\nDo you think they may have looked at it and said we're not sure but we think he was going to catch it so the righteous thing to do ... would give them credit for like the catch almost by enforcing the rule\nI'd love to hear the conversation as you thought he was going to catch it yes I think a lot of people thought to absolutely yeah absolutely my ... going to catch it but I did think it was\nA home run he almost got it what else do we have ...\nOkay what Milwaukee did with it starting pitcher pulling them after one batter is that gamesmanship smart gamesmanship or is that I'm looking for wired hair tacky or\n[noise] [noise] well I

out of players like this is the strategy that's being played here the only issue that I had was you have to be a hundred percent right because you're going against Russia\nNow counsel might have

eight and or the field for rookie of the year after one to one night who do you got\nA ... going to put up numbers he has to you expect him to but you know is is he going to be an Eighteen ten guy the entire season and I'm just curious the element of it\nIn that don't have a point guard a and it's a young team and sometimes you everybody wants to be a star in a situation like that but I think Phoenix was building something I don't know exactly what they're building it help if they had a point guard but\nEighty eight and was ready to go\nWhat happens is you'll see some of these guys that by the second half of the season then they start to understand the game it slows down and then you're going to see somebody emerge that you didn't think was going to be a star you know we saw that with Utah last year\nYou know it just there's certain time plus when you see these guys because you're not going out of your way to watch the Utah Jazz\nAnd if there is a national TV game which is rare you know then you might it's ... it's like you know if the jazz play the Lakers then you might go oh wow I didn't know they have the Eiffel Tower in here he's pretty good\nIt's like Josh Rosen tonight gifts his chance because it's the cardinals\nBy the way the cardinals rank last in their conference in points passing your parents rushing yards the last team to rank dead last in its own competency

Will say that's a balanced often like if you're bad in passing and running and points your last you know it's balanced yeah bowling\nOne concern with the NBA I Am concerned that the key point guard from a Kentucky for valley clippers is going to be good here to Washington eleven points or ... ... Alexander ... I Can't I don't know how we're going to have good he he's good does have to shorten his name and the Lakers guard\n... K. C.

Thompson next year\n... ... you know maybe I think you really have to ... these parts out\nIt's like you're rebuilding something you've got all the parts there and you're going oh this looks like a mess and then you put the parts together start to put the parts together and see what the engine looks like and then you're going to add and subtract with this and that's what I think that that would be my philosophy if I'm the Lakers let's just see what this year is all about who were all about\nAnd then this next year if Iran leaves\nOr a ... and ... Thompson and or clay Thompson leave now all of a sudden it this is different we can be the favorites\n'cause I don't think the Carmelo thing works in Houston uh I I Know that everybody wanted to and maybe it's going to figure it out and it's only one game but I don't think he's I don't think they're better than they were last year\nAnd only mellow makes them better\nAnd I think that's that's the big difference with this that I don't think you got you you added a little more often perhaps but defensively you need you still need to have that ... but I ... I still want I'm watching harden last night [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm\nThinking about what Charles Barkley said yesterday I said if I just said no hard and go out and play go out and score how many could he average and Barkley said fifty\n\nOkay maybe forty when he's not going to average fifty willed average fifty one season is harden holding back here like he's only average in thirty instead of ...\nDo I just\nI don't think he could average something like that but but there is a feeling up he'll get a shot whenever he wants to which is pretty amazing Barkley also said he's the most unstoppable off into weapons he's ever seen and that includes Jordan well Charles did leave out\nKareem Abdul Jabbar creams the most unstoppable player of all time\nNot even close no one ever\nWas able to shut down that guy you know hard news a great all around off into weapon but Kareem to me is the most unstoppable pleasurable to see and Kareem and throw up the sky hook from like all the foul line yeah\nOh yeah he could shoot the Fifteen Fifteen foot sky hook you up on\nHere's a couple of records for LeBron for ... to go to tonight Kareem Abdul Jabbar and his Laker debut scored twenty seven points to the bracket that\nYes magic at twenty six\nMost sense in the first game of a Lakers career last Thirty years Carl Malone and Gary Payton title nine on the same\nNight [laughter] well that's when they all tried to sneak in and get a championship prayer\nAir passing racket ball for those tonight yes yeah\nI think twenty nine and eleven for LeBron tonight LeBron James most of his first game a besieged at\nFourteen that was two years ago and then new ... yeah I I I'm going to guess that you know he I don't know if it's it comes down and takes the first shot or he doesn't take a shot in the first quarter I guess\nIt just feels like it's going to be a little bit strange their ... eight and score to Eighteen antennae dished out six since last night the last two players to get

Joe Jacoby like they they had two guys just for Lawrence Taylor\nHe's one of the the few guys that I think you had to account for on every play you knew where he was and you ran your office accordingly but she ... she was playing in a high level\nI don't know if I've seen any buddy more impressive on a football field\nAnd I don't know if there's any higher praised in that because I've been around the game for you know covering it for over thirty five years now so I've been able to see most of the great play in person or Jim Brown I only saw the highlights but you know a lot of the other guys in the modern era got a chance to see them in Lawrence Taylor\nLarge Taylor is actually better than what you think in my opinion is I don't know how many ... actually had but that really wasn't the point he was going to get to you\nAnd when you watched him and I still go back and it was a preseason game giants jets\nAnd when I saw can O'Brien show fear in his eyes like I could actually see fear in his aunt was in my opinion because they'll tell you what's coming off the corner coming off the edge and it was a pre she should get the apple\nLawrence Taylor was first team all pro his first six seasons\nOr you don't have to Google that no one's ever done it I'm surprised that it was it more than that\nHe well he got injured in eighty seven I missed a few games that went to the pro ball he would've been first team all pro his first nine\nSeats you know he was incredible and and it is you know greatest kilo Mac is I could ... combined clue Mac and von Miller and still not get Lawrence Taylor and my opinion\nLike there was just something about ... to that and he was very lucky that out of Harry Carson and he had a a banks a he had\nGary Reasons he had Leonard Marshall handsome good do you get some good players but Carl Banks was a really good linebacker as well\nProbably got over ... way did get overshadowed Carson and Taylor were hall of famers but you know battle check there's the defensive coordinator man what a weapon to have as a team coordinator when you have Lawrence Taylor already two hours in the books one more to go\nCheck in with ... the former Dodger great more phone calls coming up as well she probably for Jimmy club near surely\nAggressive you'd answer adjustable ranch delivers the most torque on the job so you can secure carriage bowl ...

you've got David Price how confident are you a price on the road\n[noise] quantities rise spin a beauty here as a our old manager Joe Morgan would say at age to I was ready to pitch last night and he did get hot I don't know how much that'll affect\nIt'd be when and it's a it's a really interesting scenario in a culture shift\nNow you make the move I had no problem with it I understood what he was doing a ... you know took some explaining in the beginning where I didn't I didn't know Miami was hurt or not and then we realized that it was just hey we're gonna bring in a right hander for right handed heavy line up but you know your margin of error is so small because if ... on\nThen whoever comes in has got to be great and you know they roll the dice on it in her show was great\nIt is ... great uh it's going to be really hard even for another starting pitcher to beat him right yeah so uh\nIt's it's just the ... this new strategy to say this is what our ability levels are and we're going to attack it this way or this is what our roster says we should do to win the game I\nI don't have a problem with it all and you know what a everybody's like well okay now this is gonna upset Miley or this Miley knew what was going on and my only knew when to throw they told them this coming out of the last start I'm sure and when you know as an athlete\nThat this is my new game plan you adjust your cardio you adjust your weight lifting you adjust your throwing on the side you adjust your playing catch so this was used as his side works at\nAny time I was asked or thought there was a possibility to go on three days rest back in the day I didn't throw my side work I just play catch\nAnd you have to have confidence that are throwing the baseball is something that you know how to do and rest is more important so you don't go down to the un have aside work and have\nThis great side work and your curve balls were great singers were great you're locating all you're having so much fun and you throw those extra thirty pitches down there because it's just fun to play baseball and fun to throw and fun to know you got great stuff no\nYou throw a few years ago oh mom feels great\nUh I'm hitting the my uh my spot on three pitches I don't need any more I'm done it's like going to shoot free throws and no one I don't want to go back to the three point line and make three pointers now I've got my stroke\nAnd I know I can make three pointers on game day so I'm fine rest is more important we are not golfers we can't hit a thousand shots began hill that chip shots forever we can't do pot forever we've got about eighty throws in our body a day to be able to maybe pits the next day just to play some catch and that's you just make an adjustment\nAlso with ... you know you didn't have that ... hasn't had that I don't know if he gets it back until next season but\nRight you know as I told people when I was growing up following baseball loving baseball you know pictures pitched in and people look at you know like what are you talking about\n... pitched he didn't throw a lot of guys thrown now I'm In ... ... what we saw was\nI mean that was brilliant to see that he didn't have great stuff or he didn't have a consistent stopped but he had it when he needed to you as a you know former pitcher at a high level obviously what did you make Web ... performance\nOf pitching Isabel location we've seen ball's thrown at Seventy miles an hour and a hundred miles an hour and we seen guys just get lit up\nYou know and they come back then they go I just didn't hit my spots I didn't have my stuff stuffed includes location that I've never heard anybody say I was hitting all my spots exactly and got bombed over and plenty of guys say\nI had great stuff the day but got hit a ... or got bombed well that tells you location is most important the next most important\nThing and pitching is movement late movement has the hitter can adjust why does the knuckleball work at sixty miles an hour because it moves late and you don't know where it's going to be so it's about location and movement velocity is the last\n... we see guys get hit a at a hundred miles an hour or ... months he got a base hit to the opposite field\nOn on a Ninety seven hour fastball earlier this year we had somebody hit a hundred and three mile an hour fastball for a base it it's about is the pitch and the right spot that gives you the highest odds\nTo ah to get a guy out here to have it hit weekly or miss it and it you know is the pitch have late movement and that gets it off the barrel the bat gets it either swing and miss or hit weekly uh this\nThe ... the love for velocity is is part of the game\nThere's right now but I think the guys that are winning they're still hitting their spots even though they throw at heart and the guys that hit throw below average fast balls which Clinton's Haspel now is below big league average average fastball Ninety to Ninety three miles an hour and he averages about Ninety Ninety One\nTalking to ... the former Dodger Greg no Dodger broadcaster let's go back a couple of days ago you were critical many Machado the play first base a also he said that he's not Johnny hustle Mets on his cup of tea here [laughter]\nYeah\nWhat bothers you more the play at first base or he says that he doesn't you know he's not Johnny hustle son has a cup of tea\nI absolutely love visibility and I think that's why the bars raise so high for him because there's so much ability in his body and you get to see that\nUh all the time and sometimes you wish you saw it a little bit more uh you'd probably get to see it about Ninety five percent of the time when there's five percent of it you go oh man I Wish she would around that one out or oh man I Wish he to attack read a little bit more but\nI'm absolutely amazed by his ability and we should be talking about that the beauty of the game but there are a few times\nThat you know people pay to see great athletes and great athletes need to actually show that and to hustle and you know\nIf this was on the opposite side of the field or I think people would be more critical that where a Dodger uniform and that are part of the dodge organization and part of baseball I think you see a true a\nCritique of what players are doing from the opposite side usually and from the rest of the game and the rest of the game has disappointed in his quotes and his effort and disappointed in a few things that he's done on the field so\nThat just something you can ignore no matter what uniform you where are what organization you're with and uh I absolutely love many and his abilities\nAnd I have talked to him to his face and said you know what a little bit more effort all the time would be great\nWhat did you say it's just his style the same thing he says publicly he says privately style [laughter]\n... you know what and and then in some ways as an athlete who was performed there is a mindset that you find where you perform at your best and if low key if him engaging on a on a mental level of\nYou know last I you know fight or flight syndrome where you're just I'm In sight mode I'm not going to fly but he found out you know I don't want to fly away from this challenge I Want to\nFight it but when I find it I'm not good I Try too hard so maybe he has found a place where being low key she finds he is at its best and it doesn't always play well for everybody\nOr for fans and maybe even for management or for broadcasters but it plays well and he understands himself and and that's where I have to almost default to now\nWell as long as the front office in Dave Roberts is fine with it because if you're going to pony up three hundred million dollars for many Machado\nThen you know what you're getting right\nExactly exactly you know and I you know this is oh it's just it's a hard topic it's a really hard topic because we work so hard to get to this place and and most people that do have to use every ounce of their ability to get to the pinnacle and when you see somebody who seems to have\nEven more ability than almost anybody on the field uh and and it's a kind of a\nSwath of a kind of approach ah it it's hard but you know what it's it's not jealousy uh it's it's not Chelsea for his ability it's boy is there more you just see almost crave for more\nThe Dodger you wanted to play with the game on the line\nIs who oh my gosh Kirk Gibson well no no no I mean you know having current [laughter]\n\nCome on let's go out there a current current Dodger occurrence odds are all okay I I didn't know anybody [laughter] the way every Jackie Robinson element yeah back row [laughter] uh the current the odds are at\nThe plate when the game is on the line while\nUm to me it ... well just in her yeah okay yeah yeah it is best to strike hit or in the game a fifty percent of the at bat\nIn baseball end up at two strikes an average of for a to strike hit her in the big leagues is below two hundred he'll hit three hundred this year was as a to strike hit her", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "18"}
