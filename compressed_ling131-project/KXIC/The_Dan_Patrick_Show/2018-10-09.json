out if I were Drew Brees I Would want to be listed at six feet or five eleven to me that's too obvious\nI think he might be five ten okay so he doesn't even go to five eleven you know he I think he's five ten so he's gone from five ten to six feet to the program yeah ...\nI have a theory on this back at Purdue we checked he was lifted six feet in the program yeah and I think he he opted to six feet to look bigger to be drafted in the pros he stuck with six feet at once he became like a three time pro bowler he should've dropped it back to five eleven to make what he does look even better I think it's too late now though ...\nThen everybody want to be listed at six feet as a human\nA guy does yeah and certainly in that position\nWhat were you listed a and your high school program I was like four inches taller than I Do I ...\nI was like I went I had a coach who was by the book so he you know whenever you put like well how much the way I keep wondering like I said uh you know one forty eight and then they said you know you could probably put in you know one sixty and he goes no you're you're one forty eight\nBut you were being recruited why wasn't eating lottery one for he didn't think that way six five one night I had six six three one forty eight\nYeah hell yeah that are hurt\nI mean let's be realistic here at the ... that's what it hurt it hurt the opposition

eye on planted a dome Matt Ryan playing in a dome\n\nWe don't grade on a curve would ... playing a New England or Rogers are far of playing in Green Bay playing outdoors yes michelob\nOr back to the hype for one second to a is listed at six one is that the Mac the Alabama quarterback seem accurate to you I Can't imagine I I think that\nThe only quarterback who are lying about their height in a different way or the guys who were six six who don't want to be labeled six six that they would lie and say instead say there are six five so those are the guys who were actually they want to they want to be viewed as shorter than what they really are every one of these guys if you're six foot\nThen you're saying you're six one if you're five eleven than your six foot absolutely yes he\nDoes

playing serious and it was like best out of a hundred balls\nAnd Thomas in one by one and breeze was beside themselves you know let's go again in the army like now we have to go to go back to the topic because I Can't believe I lost to a running back and and you mentioned it to him a decade later because I'm Still looking for talent than because I Can't wait to ...\nAnd when people talk about you know what separates good from grade in great from hall of famers the fact that Drew Brees two years ago came on our show and this was during the super bowl and we handed him his draft profile\nWhat was actually being said and most of the things that were shed were negative\nAnd he was just now he's already a hall of famer so this is only a couple of years ago and he's reading this and he's reading all this and you can just see where he is just going to take hitting me they said this about where are you is this true\nSo he gets ready to leave our studio at the super bowl and ... you know I say goodbye to him and he goes oh hold on he walked back over to pull these desk picks up the piece of paper and he goes\nCan I keep this ball he goes yeah and he folded up neatly puts it

I mean we talk about everything and we could have been talking about college football and how bad for the state was and I was probably you know what I mean it could have been one of those things I might do or not that bad and then you never know what what somebody heard 'em\nOr what they said you know sometimes you jump in the middle of the conversation you have no idea what's going on you just hear a certain part of it but it's not it's not always the case and I don't know what a what they think they saw what they think that her but it was it was far from the truth\nDo you think you could have taken him I don't know it would be it'd be a good match [laughter]\nI mean I've seen I've seen I've seen I've seen instances so I'm sure I'm sure would be a good fight it'd be a maybe not as good as the McGregor friday\nOr even if I put a or the or the\nFight after the fight but um it would definitely would be interesting maybe so if you shoot tickets\nYeah I think PGA Tour could or could do that like a just a who else oh I could you know what I can do here I got Patrick greed and I got Jordan speed than the octagon\nWhat do you think who [laughter] you have to\nFight if we're really going to sell this so Brooks I could get maybe tiger Phil\nOkay but who's the main match oh you against us to okay All right\nOh yeah absolutely yeah cause I can start out because there's drama although Patrick ... against the Jordan would be really interesting I think we could sell them into\nI'm yeah I'm sure a lot of people got so right I\nMean it'd be fun though it'd be it'd be interesting\nI go take a picture of your trophy and a tweet it out and congratulations and thanks for being a good sport\nYeah you gotta stand ...\nPGA Tour BJ tour player or the year\nAnd dozens got three Johnny though\nVersus stacking yeah yes jacked up yeah he is\nYou know Phil Mickelson he's older but he's got that new flexibility leg kick thing these days now\nSee I Can't have tiger in there he's gone through so much that I Can't have him in the Arctic he's got a lot of that pent up frustration though he may laugh out now I I Can't have him in there but could you imagine if Patrick greed and Jordan speak\nBecause those who don't like each other son black and white belts everywhere yeah but\nThey'd have to go out there and they're PGA Tour outfits and they have to yes\nFor ... I Love and it's maybe it's the way you pose it or because of you but that they were actually answer that question every once in a while when you pose the ... could you take the fight that when they they they are more than average to respond and actually answer that question I think everybody\nWants to know do you think you can take Dustin Johnson\nIf it came to that yeah like\nI I'd have to know a little I don't know I'd have to have a tail the tape your you know kept his jacked\nBut Dustin Johnson probably the best athlete on tour\nAnd he's got reach their ...\nPhil Mickelson like kick is killing me by the way if you ever see he there's so many tweets have been doing in his face and how proud he is at all I Know he's more proud of this than anything does on the golf\nI Know that you're right hey how'd you uh play oh I don't know but why should we do my leg kick out he's going to be in the Rockettes here you've known him for a long time but the big goofy through the years he yeah he looks like he's having a great time guys on tour I have a problem\nBecause Phil nose at all and and so they they they have a problem with that that Phil tends to know everything\nI think Jack was like that when he played too you know there's just certain guys that that they're just like you know it'll just ask him he'll tell you but fill fill up show any of that kick good stuff to it so\nI don't know if we've found out exactly what happened with Brooks captain Dustin Johnson but he said nothing I just don't know what somebody sees and then they report that in a couple of people reported it\nUh you know maybe there was shouting but you know was there really an incident may is in two buddies who get you know I with my friends I can yell louder at my friends and I would somebody that I really don't know and maybe those two they work out together they know each other\nLike I guess their friends so I don't know maybe it was one of those\nHave a couple of pops and ah you know you start to yell your your voice gets louder there yeah ...\nDo you ever wonder if you've ever going to get in a fist fight again because there's a certain age and the man where you think I think my days of getting punched are punching someone or behind me but there's always everyone in their life has their last Best Buy\nBut you had to think if you're forty plus those are in rye were everywhere who's most likely in this room to get into it a fist\n[noise]\nNot back row you know\nThe guy or the glasses over there ... he's a little bit of a temper and I know\nI don't think he has to be drinking to have a fish yeah most most I'd say Ninety seven percent a fist fight they involve booze yeah the army or the other three are boxing the other three percent of toxic yeah\nAnd make love and doesn't drink\nAlso I Can't afford them for breaking more glasses after I broke them in the box several years ago\nYou know I don't know I'm probably seating or myself well I can see poly to I don't know\nI was with Paul uh within the last year only almost got into a fight [laughter] there's not any and Paul but we're on the streets in New York City you remember that dude\nI'll go do from your right yes yeah that was the uncle drew premier and we were we were the there was this after party or at a I don't know some hotel or something in the East Village in New York City and we got out of our cab and we're walking and there was some dude who was wasted\nWho all of a sudden like God in polish space is I Would you say and I'm like huh what and I thought that was the closest I've been to a fist fight in a while 'cause you could tell that\nA pause ready to go for sure\n[laughter] and you remember when I said\nA laugh\nYeah oh yeah yeah [laughter] yeah it's actually one of the polls had a very big cursor but he uh he dropped a bomb on that guy laughed right in space you're like al kick your butt and then you went out [laughter]\n... off and then like I walked away yeah yeah he was a little guy oh he was I mean\nLike ... is like a ... he was just a little I think he's all hype hopped up like Muslim and said he had a rough night\nAll too many ... and that's the closest we've come a long time yeah\nBut you know when you get that adrenalin rush where you're like oh we're about to fight that happened you know where you get that like oh wait I think if we're going to punch this guy in the face right now\n[laughter] wait both of you see what their ... and we like its collective like we are going to punch you oh yeah no I wouldn't I Would have helped Wiley out for sure well by he would need it [laughter]\nMaybe you never know so yeah I can in like a MA guy that I mentioned police choked out\nI'm actually more in fear of smaller guys who start a fight the bigger guys I always look at\nThe years yeah anytime that it feels like there's a little bit of tension I always check the guy's years because you look at how beams ears\nLike they look they look like cauliflower like they're a mess it never messed with those guys who have just figured yours\nIs not your broken noses or your fingers are all mangled and so I always look at your years because that means you're wrestler and if you get me on the ground then I'm In trouble actually doesn't matter where you get me I'm a truck\nWhat's bar fight policy if you get into an argument tiff with a guy who has glasses you wait till he takes his glasses off till the fight and suicide now it seems like a that's an etiquette thing I think no I don't think there's had to get in a bar fight I think that you can you apply to fight it can't punch all my classes that\nWell if I hit you in the jaw yeah Geico do oh I think ... ... and\nI don't know where it turns into the uh low hit me a number of men first I'd never met before you hit me first do you hear me first you ever see that you know these are like they're squaring up and is it good hit me I'd never hit 'em [laughter]\nOkay guy let's just everybody walk away then this is stupid [laughter] I like basketball\nFights where everybody's on the verge of hitting everybody has like a pick up game and nobody ever gets punched for some reason I don't know if you've ever been hit but we've all seen been there for that\nI thought I was going to get hit one time\nOh that shot I Wonder if you're talking trash day I was\nI was I was I was in Milwaukee I was in Milwaukee and plan to pick up game\nAnd man was that I feel in it and I am just roasted in this guy and he you\nKnow like it's like check ball and I said I broke and he goes what I should check ball real because I'm not your borough\nSaid ... no no no I'm not your borough I said hey I just said check all road here and then after that oh boy\nAnytime I had the ball went to the who then ended up on the floor\n[laughter] so high I realized that we we finished the game and then all of a sudden it felt like there were more people coming over to the court and then I said to the guy that I was with former Arizona basketball player Craig McMillan Cher I said Craig [noise]\nI think we should get outta here he goes I I think it's a good idea [laughter] so I started to walk out\nAnd they started they started saying some things oh dear yeah and then I go in and I like I turn around ... you know like you're right no but then you know I had to\n[noise] then I asked ... what he was thinking when he actually broke the record Bush to\nSuper slow motion of my mind is which are we was just or others should try to stay as focused as possible and just wanted to make a you know are going up streams very walk there and play the top saving them over just the hard part was that one was two hundred ...\nSooner also you know maybe it happens sometimes and the\nThird quarter or maybe even early fourth quarter something like that um you know expecting it to be a ... you know the way that we played the Redskins last year it was a dramatic go or the ... but it was tight little way and so you know I I just didn't want to kill the momentum on average you're so focused on the game and a way to do that\nSo I took the fact that it happened when it did you do to me that drive at the end of the second quarter where you know it's all so I stopped us or adults with sort of scripture for over\nTwo hundred and thirty two passes inches lasted interception which is the longest active streak in the NFL each tied for the second longest of his career he actually had three hundred and five pounds is over the span of a twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen without an\nInterception [noise] you know the numbers are mind boggling with Drew Brees but it still feels like there's a glass ceiling on just how great he'll be remembered\nAnd really comes down to Drew Brees as six three I think he's viewed differently than he is being six feet tall\nI keep over achieved chip on his shoulder I'll look at that guy out there if he can play quarterback anybody can play quarterback but you go back to when he almost signed with the dolphins\nAnd the dolphins took Dante colpepper and there were shoulder issues with breeze because he got hurt in San Diego San Diego is dropping Philip Rivers so Drew Brees is expendable he doesn't know if he's going to play again because of the injury\nAnd Nick Saban takes Dante colpepper if Drew Brees had gone to Miami\n\nTo save you know how long did you stay with Miami does he take the Alabama Georgia does eventually take another job but\nSo the dolphins not taking Drew Brees changed a couple of courses of history or careers with Drew Brees with you know what he had been the same quarterback with the dolphins wouldn't ... have not gone to Alabama yeah by\nSaving was nine and seven with the Miami Dolphins in all five six and ten\nIn two thousand sex with Joey herring that quarterback Joe he had Harrington via Drew Brees incentive Joey Harrington you could assume a couple of more wins maybe\nYeah I Wonder I Wonder if that delayed someone else gets the Alabama job and Nick ... even last one more year he's at ah Michigan or something\nYes who it's crazy to think it could have just gotten the other way to write that yeah that breeze wouldn't have been good at all yeah in that sense I mean could have while he could have washed out somehow because it was the wrong system or something [noise]\nJay ... is the Washington Redskins head coach and he didn't single out one person being bad last night\nI'm not up here to anybody say they played poorly has think ah overall I think our whole team of play poor and that's a reflection on myself I think I think everybody and matlock room hopefully will say they need to play butter and I absolutely understand that the coaches on his staff how to coach butter and that's the only way we can look at it\nIn a crazy the NFC used because when the season started you thought OK giants will be better because it can't be worse than three and Thirteen the eagles will come back down to earth a little bit and then Dallas would still be Dallas a formidable team you would think I'm the NFC eastern is a mess\nLike nine and seven when this division the eagles now with al ... do you make a run for lay beyond bill you got to second round picks coming up could you use those second round picks and maybe on bill Mick eleven\nMaybe now is on the air is Carson once doesn't seem like it's a hundred percent back why sell any your future\nBut you can get him now unless you feel like let's wait until the off season and then\nIf the ...\nYou know the divisions up for grabs here so I don't know if the eagles are going you know what let's wait until next year already after five weeks [noise]\nFinal hour coming up we'll check in with Dan Sean to see the Boston Globe [noise]\nAre you considering a

satellite radio Sirius satellite radio station I have\nYou know you don't want to combination there then and it was great last year but it comes down to or they they felt like they were more of a running team last year\nDrew got his record you know now you have to do what's right for this team is not saying that they were doing this to cater to drew so we could get the record he was going to get it no matter what but you know that's a running team and a very good defensive team last year and then you throw in with Drew Brees compliments that run that's pretty crazy yeah I'm a club\nBecoming weeks they play in two weeks or three weeks rather they played the Vikings and then the rams to possible NFC championship previous those will be fun\nYeah how important is this game on Thursday night ooh giants and the eagles I don't know if it's that important because the division is a mess but\nIt I mean the eagles needs something\nHere get kick started in\n... he is out for the season do you make a move for levy on bell what would it cost to get beyond bell yeah people\nDon't you think that the Steelers when the only thing they wouldn't trade to him into his the eagles 'cause you can't help the eagles won the super bowl ... no matter what the eagles offered to the Steelers you can't train them across the state I Would think you can't train him to the browns yes couldn't do that all Tamar\nThat big rival yeah you can help of rival when the super bowl ...\nAs a Philadelphia and we don't really feel rivalry with Pittsburgh I mean there's six other cities that are much closer I think Pittsburgh rivals with Cincinnati Cleveland Baltimore I don't I don't know if there's a real rivalry there oh there's more\nRivalry in the division and it feels like with the eagles and and the eagles being in the NFC\nBut I think the fact that she could play the eagles Super Bowl would make them nervous knew that I Do see Paul's boy yeah so but at any only contenders gonna want levy on bill ... not good you are not knocking it\nUnless you realize hey if we get him now you know can we get him on the cheap and and can we give you two second round picks for we know we have to pay him but can we get him now if you're the cold or let's say the forty niners and\nYou got ... back next year or we get a better off inch in line for Andrew Luck like I wouldn't look at it this year if I'm some of these teams you know the jets if you'll get laid down bell although cruel well just had this incredible performance\n... maybe a ... year by day a crow el\n... well it's still my ticket fire with lady on bill or John in Kentucky Jones who say John winning up for me today\nDan how you guys doing a great to talk to you again I just wanted to mention\nThat I think the average NFL or even college football fan someone who has a ... you know people don't know when time outs associate called people hero when red flags district is thrown out there ah you know general just\nAvid football fan [noise] do they I mean I don't really think they care how tall Drew Brees is it's something that I mean I don't mind me so that you all bringing up and it's gone up quite often and I guess it was because it was brought up when he was gay and traffic but I mean I don't compare\nA you know I'm not a Chevy Chase in ... I don't care what golfers by\nUh you know I just I think he's a terrific quarterback I and I I didn't go as far as age there was a John Elway\nWell the point that we're trying to make John and if you didn't you know understand it then you know blame it on me but we're we're sort of um making fun of the biased against George quarterbacks that did it you know but he got caught up in how tall he was it\nAnd so we mock that because if you're six five and you're you know two hundred and forty pounds then all of a sudden yeah you can play quarterback they like Russell Wilson\nCan you play the court can you play the position that that's what it comes down to their guys who looked like they should be able to play but\nThey can't Christian hacking or had it all\nMean couldn't play\nAnd I think that's the problem with the position for years they profiled and therefore I thought Doug ... he was in every game every week starter I think flew to use one of the more fascinating underrated quarterbacks in NFL history but he if he was playing now\nI I'd love to see flew to play now because he would be so much more dangerous and he was so athletic back they're extending\nPlays but we get caught up in these are six five linemen and you've got six for deep and she players you can see over them and you know you create windows\nAnd that's what the saints do and that's what Drew Brees does but no we ... I I'm mocking everybody when I talk about how short Drew Brees is because I don't care\nNow Russell Wilson I don't care how tall you are\nBigger Mayfield I didn't care how tall he was it's how accurate are you a leader you love the big moments do you want to be great it's like Johnny Manziel you know we love Johnny Manziel at no point did somebody say you know the problem with Johnny\nManziel as I Know it was everything else wasn't that partying that was the problem but\nBaker Mayfield I you know I couldn't care less oh totally is or isn't can you play the position\nYou know Patrick more homes was going to be a defensive back in Texas are G. three a defensive back in Texas Johnny Manziel defensive back in Texas I\nMan most ... must be held quarterbacks there are a Texas I'm guessing you imagine if Texas ended up changing the the the history of college football\nIf you had these guys playing deep into back oh man yeah apple\nMumbo Jackson tell you the story about being recruited by ... Alabama line back they said they didn't have a lot of room in the backfield would eat the over the switching alive accurate [laughter] hello offering\nAlthough I could have seen boat and could you imagine voting linebacker ooh boy\nImagine him he he could have been Ray Lewis with more speed\nMore athleticism God how scary it was scary anyway but imagine if you had ... Jackson there are playing middle linebacker or even outside linebacker would it be like Lawrence Taylor 'cause he's more athletic the Lawrence Taylor\nThat'd be fun [noise] might have been fun I Wonder if his career would have been extended if he play defense instead of often you know you had that injury where you know the\nLeg was pulled out of the socket there I Will take a break Dan Shawna she was there at the Yankee Stadium last night Red Sox rough up the young sixteen to one and a little bit of drama pre game with Louis Severino getting there to the ballpark apparently late so we'll talk to Shaun the sheep from Boston Globe right after this summit in Patrick show\n[noise] sleep numbers Seventy five\nSo many couples disagree on mattress firmness in sleep number beds let you choose your ideal firms on each side so it's right for you perfect bed\nYou get more energy less brain ... did you feel sharper you're in a better mood you're more productive if you get a great night sleep so why don't you invest\nThe sleep number three sixty smart beds help everyone from parents to pro athletes improved their daily performs through proven quality sleep come in now fall sale save a hundred dollars on the queen sleep number\nThree sixty see too smart beds now only eight hundred Ninety nine dollars the bedroom so smart they send your every move automatically adjusts to you keeping you sleeping comfortably throughout the night\nSleep number the official sleep and wellness partner the NFL you only find your sleep number at one of their five hundred and fifty sleep number stores nationwide go in and ask about your sleep number setting mine is Seventy five ask how they come up with that it's all scientific and you can't afford another restless night sleep\nSleep number dot com slash Patrick to find a store nearest you good luck [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIf you suffer from E.

have state championship game that you every year so they have high expectations with everything that's happening in a conference in a Davis I that that's a stretch but it's nice to have it talked about\nAnd what about Kyrie and they do but he he said he wants to resign so it it's I Know it's just a verbal but what do you make of that\nGuy but he says the earth is flat very I don't believe in and it comes out of his mouth but it seems like a nice kid is are they is always messing with her so that was a weird thing to do in front of the season ticket holder so great hope is true\nAnd uh there's a lot to believe in here and given the young roster they have and you know coach they have in the weakest of the conference why wouldn't you want to stay here so hopefully that is true but uh I Believe it when they re re ups\nAnd Gordon Hayward a green light and he's he's got to go full go\nYeah and that you know yeah they they got so that one day for the conference finals from the NBA

looks at the garden like we used to and say boy it's magical and when it works in New York and they never forget about you\nBut when's the last time you looked at the Nixon ... you've felt stability\nBeen a long long time well anyway you know poor thing is going to play this year\nYeah see and then Kyrie is talked about maybe going there\nRight it's like for some reason just it feels like just because it's New York city yeah and it's the next you have to throw them in as a possibility even though that might be at this point completely overrated as a draw\nFor somebody but it used to be that way with the Lakers like who wouldn't want to go play in Los Angeles but they couldn't get any free agents to go there now the Broncos and now we want to see who you get next year because who you get next year is going to go a long way and deciding if ... going to get another championship here you know pull the\nKnicks have made the playoffs four times in the last Seventeen years that's almost hard to do and that sport where forty three games can make ...\nWho is worse who's been worse over the last Twenty years the Knicks or the cowboys\nOoh I quakes back the next door to achieve so the Knicks or for for Seventeen and what's what's Dallas\n... some years was Romo right they might have strong couple playoff appearing\nWhy you had one where he lost in Green Bay I Know that that you didn't have you always been cowboys just three playoff appearances in the last eleven years\nOkay ... yeah but you got more playoff appearances in a truck on the idea eight and eight nine and seven yeah [laughter] so Anthony Davis signed with the promise summer right or yeah so that is yeah that's huge yeah but what is his contract situation\nBecause why is he why are there are rumors about where he could end up\nI saw a headline actually I'm Sorry I don't have exactly when it's over but that they can train them before the all star break to get maximum value so I'm assuming it's after this year but let's ... okay yeah I have Anthony\nDavis locked up through twenty Twenty one\nThen he just signed last year yeah he's getting a\nTwenty five large this year and then he's got the twenty Nineteen twenty see than twenty twenty ... opposite yeah through twenty Twenty one he's an unrestricted free agent he'll be twenty eight years old\nNow but I I wouldn't want to get rid of him and we have Brian junior will be playing yeah you might get the Bruins son now I don't I don't want to lose him if I if I'm New Orleans\nI why would I be giving him up and helping one of these teams certainly if you're in New Orleans you're going to help the Lakers I get to see if you're going to end you're ... you're a trained to Boston for who like Tatum and brown are automatically in that conversation if if I'm New Orleans but I and who the\nKnicks going to trade ya Kevin knocks fear of\nSummer league superstar yeah and Mitchell Robbins isn't that crazy center a guy that got\nYou know I Want to see get some playing time this year is Josh Josh our to my Lakers than nine point guard time oh I Know I really like Josh short\nAnd I ... I like him a lot and he plays defence you not afraid he went to this summer league I I like him a lot you also what's the shooter that you like get out of Kansas sigh\nHe he can play he comply can shoot got an ... you got an MBA body\nHey they have some talent there I really do I'm not keen on these you know these older guys but Iran do can help\nAnd and maybe when you get to the post season that Ron do is going to be the guy who's starting more playing more calm postseason time okay but my point guards can't shoot or can't make free throws well that's really really troubling\nAnd granted you're not the typical point guard when LeBron is on the team but I I Can't ... out there in a big time situation when you don't shoot free throws very well yeah I'm a club\nI just so you have all abroad as kind of a point guard ... Rondo Josh heart for there to probably some of these guys here to\nWhere they had anger him as a point forward the overnight\nAnd I just you know they have they have an interesting nucleus there I Love the youth and liberal and had to see this in love that and if you get a complementary guy come in whoever that is\nNow all of a sudden I can get rid of some of the older guys who were just here for one year one and done and then then you've got something that you know to that is formidable in my opinion yeah bowling\nSheila brown and being a post up guy this year and pacing himself all season getting it down the blocks working people getting people fall troubles slowing down the game known a lot of guys pass to him\nThere up tempo yeah only Golden State was more up tempo than the Lakers and and it feels like that's what the bronze gonna want to do but I got young guys that's where I have to take advantage of these other teams that you know Chris Paul\nI got to take advantage of him being older or even Golden State with some of those players being a little bit older here\nThe game who's the second leading score on the Lakers this year\nI'm ... I'm going to guess anger that charisma no\nI mean it's if he is and that's not a bad thing but I I I Want to see in Rome be more of give me the ball I Want the ball I could not take over a guy but I I Need him to be a twenty points score\nBecause the bronze going to need that as well because we're not going to play all you need to games you play the most minutes I don't think because that's where you got to\nPlay enough that you stay in playoff contention but then I got to have him ready to go ... postseason taught but that's where these younger players have to be able to step up and play more minutes there did you see Steve Kirk got tossed from the game last night\nThe preseason game and he said he actually went out on the floor to get tossed where he just said I don't want to be here anyway [laughter]\nI think he he he's able to do that he's he's playing with ... money there you know ...\n... or reminded me of when he got fined for saying that thinking about the mid level accepting about wanting my Bronner alone John I felt bad about that\nHere I don't think he was mad at you like why costume ten grand and nice is that a lot to an MBA coach\nI it yeah he was the GM at the time with Phoenix was any\nAnd I said if you have you thought about the LeBron James and he said yeah the mid level\nExemption or something and you got fined ten grand I think by David Stern\nMeanwhile Magic Johnson is out today [laughter] magic goes on Kimmel and recruits\nThere I Would take a break and I just found out today Roberts from the Dodgers will join us on the program tomorrow along with Matthew Shepard I Will be back with a final twenty minutes after this [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a seat that had to look up a beautiful empty so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works shakes at rhino safe dot com", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "09"}
