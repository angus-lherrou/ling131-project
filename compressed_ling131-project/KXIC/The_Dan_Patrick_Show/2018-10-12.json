Ninety ... no two thousand nine that they'd be\nAnd it was Nineteen Ninety seven the first time that they beat the cycle and\nThe names and then they were at Nebraska earlier in the month or or late September I think it was but uh uh they want a ... game at ... in Nebraska they ... they lost the match but they won their first game in there and about some twenty five years so good stuff\nHappening and bond is very positive about a ... bringing in the younger group just a few years ago and then all of a sudden it seems like it's starting to collect so good stuff there Hawkeye football for going to be ready to go but we got to get that running game going [noise]\nAh well they're always helps that kind of a once when the Hawkeye rushing game as are going well all things and everything else seems to click and fall into place and uh\nUm what we'll see what happens or Indiana's got a a ... or so it's kind of those uh you know a ... a ... you know opposing forces there uh with the Indiana ... against the Iowa defense and um\nSo the difference could be that ... and see what they can do if they can do anything close to what they did against Minnesota last week or will be ...\nYou know in ... during the hot talk last week that you know you need to run it twenty twenty five times in order to do it but when you're only producing sixty Seventy yards on the ground you know it makes it a little bit tougher when you're running a twenty times but you're only average Kerry is only one and a half\nYears well it it it it does make it difficult but it makes it even still have to respect the fact that you might pass off that play action because I mean that's I was bread and butter is is they're run again the ground game kind of sets up everything and so they're going to still churning out a bunch of yards are still going to commit\nAgain to those twenty five thirty rushing plays a game and hopefully set up everything else off the bat that are asked\nAll right my final thirty seconds or

the defense and I don't know did the defense look that good because sake one Barclay made them look bad on quite a few plays [noise] alright eight seven seven three ... show email address sepia damned Patrick dot com will come up with a poll question today correct ...\nYeah I mean we have some giants options it's all it seems like it's all giants today started with Polly throughout the giants should bench Eli Manning now\nA trade ... outback him now\nBoth or neither I mean obviously they're more options to that but if you had to choose between those bench Eli trade out back them do both are neither and we're not going to get caught up in the salary cap ramifications of trading hotel is that's probably hard but [noise]\nBut if I bench Eli Manning like what ... and last time saying I'm going to play for the number one pick\n'em ... and\nWho you're bringing in like what what what are what are the other options\nKyle all that a baby\nWell he is athletic I he's just not ready to play\nNo I wouldn't do it I'm just saying that's the other option and I you can't trade you know\nOh it does still great I don't I wouldn't want him on my team you know this this is one of those in the off season or if you could have signed him and then said to Jerry Jones age you're\nInterested in ... who knows what jury would have given him but that would be the that'd be the destination where if I thought I could rip off somebody it would be Dallas but I I I don't know if I can bench Eli and I I Can't ... back I'm yeah I'm a club\nIf say that they do steak and they get a quarter back next year I mean you got it like having owed Allen Say Klein as weapons for that a rookie quarterback down the line [noise] yeah like a promising I mean you said the browns are in better shape but I agree with that but that's something to build around\nYeah you do have talent there but it comes back to and and everybody's going to say that it's now um and I was going on say going Barkley I was so I thought if you were getting somebody that special does he make does he help Eli and you had oh Dale back and junior does that help Eli\nEli needs help if it's a perfect script Eli is able to play and that is giving time to pass I have a good defense and you've got some skill position guys I mean that's how he won two Super Bowls because he had a perfect script he's not a great quarterback\nEven obey a hall of famer because he beat the patriots twice in the super bowl and played well but he's not a great regular season quarterback\nHe's had moments but he ... and you know he's not one of those guys where you go boy ... gonna torch you owe it always feels like it's so Dale back them who's going to towards you know shake one Barclay was gonna ... gonna carby up here but with no opposition line it doesn't matter\nAnd it's not going to matter\nAs you move forward with this team but he lived thirty seven there is no way he's back next year at that kind of price tag but if you're a drafting somebody can you train for somebody I don't know if it matters you still have to play behind that often she'd want what else do you have a club\nOr a question what did he lie if he does is it when the giants where he start somewhere else I say Jacksonville next year or is it thirty eight or is this could be the end of the line or I guess it depends on\n... would you rather have Blake ... or ...\nOh saucy yeah\nI'd rather have ... I Can't tell who shouldn't be insulted and that ... yeah ... ... I think we're being insulting I I Would rather have a lake ... than I Would Eli Manning while\nI went oh what\nIs there a chain you lie could start for aside from the giant\n\nNow I have a ... factor in his salary because it would you take him over CJ bathroom with the niners you probably would\nBut do you need a good maybe maybe do you want a good line so yeah it can be fully lie or what am I going into that\nSituation maybe it'd be the niners quarterback I'd rather have CJ bath or I don't know if he could start for any other team right now I don't know if any other to let's say I took out his salary salary didn't even factor in is there any other team that would go he's better than our quarterback\nYeah buffalo I don't know but Alan's I I I don't I don't know\nAlan's headed for one of the worst statistical seasons in the history the NFL I mean he's definitely better now okay but he is you don't want to bell ate a couple of games but this year it's gonna be nothing but bad in this for him it's it's gonna be a really rough year okay\nI'm ... I I'm just putting it out there okay so buffalo you would say be grudgingly buffalo ... I I mean you would take Eli over\n... I mean I think he would compete with tannahill right now know what's going on with that Miami team I they seem pretty few Taliban\nAnd al ... has had decent number I mean he's not a guy but I think it's a franchise quarterback but it feels like I like he's got athleticism eat he throws it battery\nJust yeah yeah ... if you were the giants management what'd you shop who doubt that come and see what happens ... no matter what even though he can play he's still stuck to the to the franchise sometimes wait until week so when are you\nGoing to trade him Nick at the end of the year now man I don't I don't know what you get during the season off the dolphins they could use a face well the cowboys could use him would tell like South Florida the titans yeah you know\nThey would want to one for that though right on my own no I yeah I don't want to do this because they're not give it up in New York\nTalk radio I don't want to do that hey ah but we trade oh they'll do the cowboys would we get three number ones are going up and lose it maybe a trade him for ...

[noise]\nFriday morning unhappy friday it's October twelfth and it's certainly chilly out\nThere and we begin with meteorologist ...\nGood morning it's all about the cloud coverage here for your friday look for plenty of those with high temperatures today back into the mid forties the wind is a lot lighter only around ten miles an hour here today\nFor the ... newsroom I'm Justin Roberts new protections are being released for the crust of the cedar river in Cedar Rapids National Weather service expected to crest now at fourteen point one speech tomorrow evening\nPreviously was projected Nineteen point seven foot however in Iowa City some roads are closed due to some of the increased output from the coral bill reservoir you can find that on our station website Cedar Rapids metro economic alliance and city leaders wanted to make sure contractors are ready for the massive upgrades along that cedar river project my hosting a workshop yesterday\nTo get contracts an idea of what's coming and how quickly local leaders hosted this historic build workshop the work of building Lebanese floodwalls removable walls and other features on both sides of the river will stretch seven and a half mile the scope of the project will likely draw regional even national contracting companies stay\nBut the Dodgers have won ... last eleven or ten of his last twelve postseason start so to me that that that speaks to how he has adjusted and last game he showed that he can pitch without Ninety five um the only struck out one guy\nWhich is like one of the first times in a long time that he's ever done that if I ever and I think this series 'em\nKnowing that he has been arrested and that he has been taken care of as\nDoesn't have to be the bulldog all year look his mindset still give me the ball on I'm On the best pitcher in the universe that's what you got to have but the team has recognized that you know the depth of the rotation allows them\nTo not have to have ... come on three days rest like he did a lot of times those posts pass postseason so\nI maintain that's in the rearview mirror for him and a statistically I think you'll see that come down and and be more reflective of his regular season\n[noise] Fox Sports opens its coverage of the national league championship series between the Dodgers brewers tonight for Miller Park pre game will be at seven eastern on Fox Sports one game coverage in aid eastern on Fox Sports when Joe Buck\nJohn and Ken Rosenthal Tom produced she will be there on the whole game too from Milwaukee or Saturday afternoon for live on Fox Network\nHow do you not let ego factor in when you're on the mound\nIt can be hard um especially when you start thinking about uh let's just say last series what gr shouting star game one um you know that there are things that in this game that\nWhen you have a reputation or when you are the best pitcher in baseball for the last ten eleven years in guys and your club you know stuff is starting to be a little bit better of you'd better look\nMe I think what Clinton represents is everything they want a player to represent so at times an organization may have to have conversations or communication since with your star player\nFor the ego I on the mound um\nIt's got to be there in the ability to think that you are better than anybody steps in the play but\nCan't allow it to have such a chip on your shoulder and that's easier said than done when you may\nBe passed over or somebody else might be the hotter pitcher at the time and um that's just a unique situation that the Dodgers have pay of so many good pictures that um they get to line it up the way they ended up\nChristian ye like as a nine for Seventeen against Kurdish also he's batting five twenty nine there were certain guys that had your number do you change anything because of that success that they have against you\nYeah I think you know the tree it's over the regular season ... you\nYou look at this certainly there to look at all the video he's going to look at everything he's a look at things that you did the passage in life and make certain judgments but at the post season uh is always a different animal a but traditionally you are going to the first thing you're going to do is look to\nSomething different you want to you want to show the hitter something different [noise] um you you want to be able to make the necessary adjustment but the biggest thing is it is\nA different stage so this'll be the first time they face each other in the postseason and that that in that in of itself reset the clock but as soon as he gets hit\nYour memory starts kicking back in and you start getting frustrated or because of the past success and it's really a small sample size so that's that's why you have to make changes and as a pitcher [noise] um and then vice versa if you've had\nA lot of success you don't really want to make a lot of changes you want to see what the hitter is going to do\nSo I Love and missed the cat and mouse games especially in the postseason 'cause you're just reading the body and\nThe aggressiveness of a hitter at this time of the year to determine how you want to attack them I felt like Eddie guy in the postseason that wanted to be the hero at the plate or aggressive I was going to be successful one hundred percent of the top but if he was more towards like I'll take my walk and patient than it was a battle but that's\nWhat you're trying to figure out\nWhere the postseason you want guys aggressive you want each guy standing on the plate on data Homer trying to be the hero for their team and and let the moment get too big\nI talked today Roberts about this I should do rely on the home run too much and he said no we rely on a lot but we did was twenty seven times in the national league uh divisional series I looked at the Yankees and I thought that they were built for the regular season not the post season and you know this better than anybody\nBeing able to come up with that big hit or just something small moving or one or over a getting a runner in from third ... it just didn't feel like the Yankees were built that way um you know we see a lot of teams that are like this do John So I I I Wonder where\nWhere there there is a place for that in baseball and how important and I feel like it there's something going to happen in this postseason whether it's in the championship series with the world series where something small will decide\nWho wins at all I I really believe that and we get caught up in strike out ... home runs and it still feels like there's nuance here that ah you know some of these teams don't factor in your thoughts on oh\nAbsolutely absolutely and I've gone back ten years I mean eventually if everyone starts probably closer to the same type of baseball someone's going to win the world series leading the league in the home runs but he rarely happens I mean you've got to go back for ever that you got teams that lead to leading home runs enter up there and strike up it just it just doesn't\nBode well for a championship run but if you do take your walks and you get on base and you put pressure on the pictures you have a better chance look last year was ... it used to the Astros getting those strike outs making contact doing the little things that's what allows them\nTo win the world series about what's going to always stand out as the big home runs you know Springer is home runs ... still arraigned king and our game from a standpoint of instant runs and they're just harder are typically they were harder to come by and the post season 'cause you're facing the league pitchers\nGoing every guy on the line up now or the potential of guys hit home runs or in the line ups you gonna run into more of those so that's still stick out but I still totally agree with you that\nThe the team with the least amount of selfish of bats\nAnd I'm Talking about a selfish it back to me is defined as run or a third less than two outs and you're still trying to hit a home run\nWhen they and fields back and all you gotta do is had a ground ball to get the game closer or tied up you know those are the things that if you still have too many of those ... and you're ... you're going to have to be so much better than the other team\nTo win because you're given you're just not putting yourself in the situation so I totally totally agree with that statement and and as time goes on um we'll see if a team can fly that on a year where\nThey win at all and they ... you know they led the postseason strike outs and they let the post season and it just it it's going to come down to that and and that's what I'm always looking for to see which player um is able to do that or which teams able to do that better\n[noise] good to talk to John and have fun tonight and will catch up with you soon thank you\nYou got to dance\nSo John ... hall of famer and working for Fox is there a baseball analyst in the postseason coverage tonight seven eastern on Fox Sports one and then the game at eight o'clock on Fox Sports ... Jon ... Kenny Rosenthal temper to cheat\nAnd then game too will be Saturday afternoon it for on Fox will come back out our play of the day phone calls Saturday coming up as well damn Patrick show [noise]\n\nIt's actually like a fifty one forty nine no but so most people it's like half and half a lot of people think this is going to happen that the Lakers are hoping for is that wishful think yeah and\nSee because you wanna you wanna get Golden State out of there because we're already tired of that we've seen that you get the Lakers now and the excitement I saw where a lot of the money I'm On who's going to win the championship the money is uh on the Lakers and the Celtics here but that's just because the odds are in your favor\nCertainly with a putting money on the Lakers here\nI don't I don't know if people actually think that the Lakers you know are going to win but you know you're putting some money down on us soil so I get the\nUm what kind of numbers do you have on that McClellan\nOr wait hold on an effort to you on that um but I think that's where you just had wishful thinking the same reason we always go towards the cowboys right is that the the fat thing\nSo here's what I have here at the betting public is all in on the NBA like it's the Nineteen eighties according to the MGM sports book\nA book by book across Las Vegas the Lakers have attracted the most best to win the championship the Celtics are close second at five to one the Lakers are twelve to one to win the title which as it Wednesday out of the hundreds of NBA championship wages placed MGM sports books the Lakers had\nJust Eighteen more ... than the Celtics however both teams are drawn more than three times as many batch as\nHad been placed on any other team the rockets or a distant third so you're not going to make any money off Golden State and that's why you're hoping that maybe there's something special with the Lakers and you can get them at twelve to one are you surprised that they are twelve to one\nHave you with LeBron that seems like a good good bet that he could catch fire [noise]\nWell he's going to catch fire and I got to have everybody else catch fire they might catch on\nFire yeah I I'm not worried you know [laughter] incendiary locker room yeah pulling\nMore over ranked going into a seasonal acres of the niners this year or the niners I'd like a top oh I didn't get the niners even with ...\nYou know I didn't get that at all because people they were based on that all of last year in the last what five games and his numbers weren't great and all of a sudden\nAnd you had the rams were going to be great and that division we thought Seattle was going to be better than average so I I knew Arizona one gonna be good but I wouldn't get a plug in nine wins for\nSan Francisco to\nFootball this weekend George LSU Washington Oregon and Wisconsin Michigan sneaky good they're a Dodgers brewers game on coming up tonight uh Davies irony sports editor of the nation edge of sports dot com will join his coming up\nA about a half hours from now got are a\nWhole question the glove and we're going to stay with that we can say that for now we might switch up an hour to\nHere's some things though you know a coach ... talking about Eli Manning says he's not concerned\nOr like I said none of us did anything well enough to win tonight\nYou know he's going to try to move the headlines off Eli in ... I understand that and he should he says he's not concerned about our effort even though Troy Aikman was concerned about the giant shepherd last night I'm concerned of how we executed and we didn't get in the end zone and we're only six games in\nYou can't be questioning effort six games in but the fact that only the browns have been worse\nOver the last season and a half and the giant tells you a whole lot there\nBut it was fun watching sake one Barkley but it did bring back those memories of Barry Sanders saying oh there's not really hold their let me see what I can do the fact that he would

well\nWe used to Carter NBC News radio\nConsumer and business news Joe McConnell NBC News radio way you missed and Patrick show [noise]\nThat's a big mistake that I Believe everyone deserves a second chance we all are humid and we've all these mistakes\nWe've taken over your radio taking once they should've done we can you ... have you don't like it don't watch we've comedy and dear to set alight\nDuring a screen passed so that the guy that catches the ball whether it's a running back are wide receiver gets the first run two years just to get to the line of scrimmage than you expect him to run another eight ten twelve years to get the first now you're not making any effort to get to get a first down on third\nOh they'll Beck and junior had some controversy last night he hadn't butter to big cooler thing and left early at half time he said he was de hydrated it was hot and humid last night there\nUm I I don't know if they're protecting him I'd go back to Louis Severino with the Yankees they said that he actually warmed up in another place privately before he went out for his bullpen session and his last\nStart although I don't buy that at all\nUm\nAnd I don't I don't know if ... if he needed a an IV at halftime and you only have ten minutes okay that's fine I mean I'm not going to crush and there's other things to crush 'em over and certainly not that I mean he cares he wants to win these immature\nYeah all those things um you said he was trying to get himself going uh um you know that he was heading budding the cooling fan he had six catches for forty four yards there it always feels like can you get him more involved\nI don't I don't know it those little short routes like Antonio Brown it feels like the Steelers just get him involved it feels like hotel once in a home run\nHe he just he wants to de Paul ... instead of let me give you as many touches his possible you know she said the\nGiants are actually built just like the Yankees they have too many homerun hitters and they need more if say Kwanzaa home run hitter yeah and that can Junior's a home run and that's why they're not any good\nGotta have a couple of single sitting there they belong will be down and walks is go to bed\nYou don't hear that any more do you watch as good as it is I always hated when they said that when I was at the plate like damn I think they want me to get or hey don't be afraid to get hit like takes [laughter] like get hit did just to get on the hell no you can also get the mom wants to go ahead [noise] yep on\nHotels averaging ten and a half targets the game that's top three in a lake so ... Kurtz Antonio Brown Adam ... Hopkins Jarvis Landry who we are joined all the great players and Adele back all the leaders in targets per game\nOkay but if I had a line that can't block\nAnd I have a guy who likes to you know have those home run catches the you know something is there's a disconnect there and that's where it feels like band just gets the ball out to Antonio Brown a Jarvis Landry with the brown just get the ball out there to him in space and then let him do something\nOr it feels like if if the audio was waiting for the line to block Ben ... you know eat ... going to be under dress I can target you that doesn't mean I'm going to hit you you know up on\nThe other thing I'm curious if this plays out what if oh del gets frustrated because he used to be the most exciting player and all of New York he may now not be the most exciting player in his own often ... and the most popular player on his own off at kids are going to start by and say Kwan Barclay jerseys cetera et cetera which sacred Barclay comes out with blonde hair\n[laughter] that'd be [laughter]\nA D.C ... kicking field goals last night\nAnd he puts on a whole pre game show his pre game shows rivals Steph Curry is pre game show who has more catches Beckham or Barclay [noise] I'm going to go Barclay\nMm he's catching them Barclays got forty catches that comes got forty five okay by the end of the year who has more catches\nBecca Barclay discuss\n[laughter] [noise] I don't know if ... going to go and sit on getting a lot of attention here I mean all of these wide receivers you know they they love their attention here but it feels like say going Barclay would make a deal Beckham better\nRight\nLike an old by the way and Ben Roethlisberger as an elbow issue he is a been messing with his arm angle on passing according to the Pittsburgh Tribune review I didn't throw in the ah\nHe won't throw during the coming by week following the Sunday game against the bangles so I don't I don't know what his elbow issue is there's always a like just a hint of skepticism when it comes to injuries with Ben\n... and he's not afraid of talking about um as as [laughter] whatever he gets up and I still go back it's one of my it's one of those strange moments where the Steelers were on Sunday Night Football and al Michaels said that he talked to been prior to the game and been told him about like some injury that he had\nAnd then I think I'm a shelter for you ask Mike Tomlin about prior to the game because I don't I don't know what you're talking about\nSo they head coach didn't even know that ... had an injury but banned wanted out and know that he had an injury there and look I Know it gets banged up I Know it gets beat up and I know that because he tells them about\nOh\nAll right Ben is on track for his greatest the fiscal sees more yards per game than his career high in every court I mean I have a ... and ... and led the league in that category multiple times and it's crazy the have you seen the numbers I Know we've talked about having the you\nKnow what the numbers don't match like home runs they don't matter anymore the passing yeah no it doesn't matter\nLike I I looked at ... homes and I didn't think he played a good game and then I saw you had three hundred yards ongoing right now it's just common place that's what makes what jak Prescott is not doing in Dallas stand out even more\nBecause it feels like you you can accidentally get two hundred and fifty pounds ignored it just feels that way\nThat number that's a bad day yeah\nLike that's all you had in ... barely getting over two hundred are also Aaron Rodgers miss practice yesterday is hailing listening and they may have to put a brace a bigger brace on this I I I think that he's ... far more injured that he's going to lead on\nAnd I'm going to guess that he's got surgery in his immediate future here when the season and try and do and I think that is part of the frustration I think he's frustrated that he can't be Aaron Rodgers and then you throw in his relationship or lack thereof with Mike mccarthy and it just feels like the ... grumpy men right now\nTo see through what fifty fifty two times last week the climate\nRight he had a terrible game and he put up a cool for forty two and three touchdowns to nobody\nYeah well not that divide that yeah I Know you keep trying to dismiss the voluntary out and\nI don't know by date their fate I mean like they had to start three rookies you know they run for receivers they beat up and he still finding guys\nYeah just having talked to Tom Brady yeah you can talk to him and say oh so that's what his wife for Utah when you don't even know you're wide ... when they come back to the huddle and he said what's your name like they need name tags on the front line Tommy and you know Jimmy ... yes but\nThis year it was a little easier 'cause you only have like two receivers on the roster to start the season but now I was reading Josh court and that everyone considers the patriots loaded\nYeah what happened to Jimmy grim remember when Jimmy Graham was awesome and New Orleans bingo Seattle now with Green Bay\n... we did a thing one time immigrant was such a hot young player that we did a draft on the show like uh who would you take any position player in a league non quarterback and Jimmy Graham want it and it's like there's like six years ago\nWhen we like he's a mismatch he demanded a nightmare he's young he's tall he's just scratching the surface and Jimmy ... everybody\nYeah I Hope freezing cold takes doesn't pick that up [laughter] I Hope I didn't say it or or is it and it yeah get rid of that Eighteen after\nThe hour we'll check in with one of our favorites Dave's Ira and he's the the sports editor or from the nation and ... dot com he'll join us also we'll

premium\nTime he says he says mother died I mean she was sent 'em all sorts of hate mail and even dead animals in the mail and it was it was a horrific thing\nAnd it took about forty years it really took 'til the early mid to thousands before they got rediscovered and appreciated and statues of them were built at San jose State University and they were given the ESPN Arthur Ashe award for courage and\nAnd so that they ... there's been this re appreciation and you're seeing it more now because of people like ... and this idea that there is this tradition of athlete activism and that that's something that as someone who I consider John Carlos to be like family to me I did I did as a book with him and he always speak every week he's he's a dear person to me\nAnd we started knowing each other back in two thousand three when he was working as a guidance counselor\nOr in the public school system of California and he was this kind of unknown figure and kind of lost in history and to see him be appreciated over the last Fifteen Years and to see him open up has been one of the great blessings of my life\nOn every I all I wanted to do was interviewing because he was from New York I was working for a very small newspaper in Prince George's County Maryland and I just thought how cool would it be to to interview the bronze medalist that guy and I knew he was from New York and I'm from New York and I thought this'll be a cool story\nSo I Googled him online and up came a website that looked like an angel fire ... from like Nineteen Ninety three\nWas very old school you know geo cities Web sites um and there was like this a picture of him in a phone number at the bottom and I just called the phone number\nAnd I got a public school in Palm Springs California and this ... voice saying hello and I said Hi I'm trying to track down John Carlos this is Carlos who the hell is as like a [laughter]\nI don't want to interview you because you don't want to hear what I have to say and then a couple of more or let's just say profanity is followed about how little I Would I I actually want to hear his truth and but then I interviewed him and published every word he said and it just started a relationship\nDoes it help Colin Kaepernick scholarship he doesn't play again\n[noise] uh in in so many respects I think it does and it's so interesting you say that 'cause I was thinking back to a time I was on the show in the fall of two thousand Seventeen and you asked me if I thought he would get signed\nFor the coming season and I said no and um you were surprised and then I had just a little bit and there was this idea well of course he's gonna get fined because someone is going to need him\nAnd but it's like as the months have gone on and as he hasn't been signed\nThe memory of a quarterback who is probably on on the ... who who is just um the memory of a quarterback who you would not say was in the Tom Brady class you know has faded\nAnd this iconic status has developed I mean he's he's at Harvard today accepting a W E ... voice award I mean so so the legend has grown in so many respects it's helps him for whatever he wants to do in the years ahead why is he not doing interviews [noise]\nThat's a great question I mean I I have theories about that I mean because I've certainly tried to interview him and I've contacted him and asked\nWhat he's writing a book I Believe ... and that's what I was told that he's saving everything for the board\nSaving everything for the book and he also has a a television series about his as high school years that he signed with ... the the director of sale of Selma\nAnd it's so I I think that there there's this idea that the ... like from him and the people around him that that the mystique and symbolism of him matters more than anything he has to say\nThat's what they've kind of figure it out and\nHard to disagree with them because it's almost like the less he said you know the more curious people are about him I mean he did this thing for GQ magazine where he was named there I think like sports uh\n... sports person than a year in some respects um and he didn't do an interview with him he was just a pictorial and other people wrote essays about his meaning to them\nAnd it's it's stab you in a way that I think it's almost like the anti Ali it's it's it's ... and almost where the less he says the more you're curious about what he wants to say he's the Mona Lisa smile of activists athletes [laughter]\nOh we're talking to Dave siren he used the sports editor of the nation and host of the edge of sports podcast ten years from now if you're still teaching this class yeah what would you teach your students about the brawn James\nI Would say that you can't understand the way the fundamental landscape of sports and politics has shifted without understanding LeBron James for two reasons or the first\nIs that LeBron James was the first great athlete to realize that the goal is not to be\nAs pleasant to as many people as possible and as non threatening as many people as possible but in this social media landscape you can actually create more buzz by getting about three fourths of the people to love you in one fourth of the people to not like you but to talk about you all the time\nThat that you know it's one of those as long as they spell your name right he was that really\nAre the first athlete since Ali to get that right\nOr the second thing I Would teach them is that LeBron James created a shield\nFor an entire generation of athletes to speak out because if LeBron James the most famous athlete in the United states could do it then they could they could do it too and the last thing I Would teach them is if you want to understand the shift from what I Would consider the Jordan era to the LeBron era\nIt starts with him getting the entire Miami Heat team to wear ... back in two thousand and twelve and take that photograph I mean this is for years before ... and to take a photograph in solidarity with Trayvon Martin in Florida\nAnd that if you don't understand that image which was a viral image when we were only first talking about Twitter and viral images are then you can't understand anything that followed\nSo I think LeBron James is actually that important that you can't understand an era\nOf what's taking place off the court without understanding LeBron James and now that he's in Los Angeles and he's even moving on to becoming like mogul slash basketball player and from what I hear every time he walks into a a studio or production room\nI'm In Hollywood he leaves with the money he leaves with another deal another documentary idea another show idea I mean the guy is cleaning up in Hollywood like nobody ... W Griffith\nAnd I think this in and of itself is going to um ... burnish his legend and so we don't even know what his legacy is going to be at this point\nDo you think Jordan would have been capable of this like is he wired to do it if I gave him a Mulligan and should you know what you could be playing in today's generation\nYou know I I honestly don't think so I mean I think he would be revered for his play\nBut the idea of being this outspoken person on social media this idea of feeling like he needs to say something when there's a social cause that's risen to the occasion\nI don't think he's wired that way and he's done interviews where he's spoken about why he's not wired that way and speak to them self in terms of being a post civil rights athlete and growing up in this a stable home and will in Wilmington North Carolina and just not feeling that\nIn the same kind of way that he may say that other people expected him to feel that\nAnd so I mean there are athletes they certainly there there's legions of them who who don't speak out and still believe in the the actually this this goes back to people like Joe Lewis and althea Gibson like people who said ah let our play is going to do the talking and that in and of itself is our contribution to the broader society I truly think that that's\nThe camp Jordan would be it it's just hard to imagine I mean maybe it would be different everyone's a product of their times but it it it it it's just hard to figure I think he'd be the Aaron Judge of basketball\nBut also when you look at Michael Jordan he there was so much privacy too yes and people didn't write about things that they would be writing about now with today's athletes and I think that you know I I just can't see Jordan wanting to share more of an shelf where's\nLeBron sort of grew up in this ... today's athlete grows up in emission just says oh it's common place but I share pictures and I got here you know everything about my life on and off the field on and off the court\nYeah they're they're growing up now with this idea that they're on camera twenty four hours a day and that they need to document what they're doing twenty four hours a day and this is part of not just um how you function in society but also how you build a brand those magic three words that every athlete gets put in their head as soon as they enter the league\nAnd I I think for for Jordan it's like he was willing to let the companies build the brand for him I Can't imagine him saying I'm going to build my own brand through social media and basically give it away for free\nAnd ... as opposed to ah getting paid by by Haynes by ballpark Franks and buy Nike to be able to build this brand for me\nIf I gave you a chance to interview any athlete in history just one\nFrom a particular time I mean this is going to sound very basic but I Would I Would out I'll go with Sudan so I'm not so basic 'cause the basic answer would be Mohammed Ali in Nineteen sixty eight when he was banned from boxing when he's doing a series of lectures on the college circuit\nAnd I would love just to speak to them about how he was feeling a being that alone but also immersed in the world and then the other person I'd like to talk to us is Paul robes and in the Nineteen twenties\nOr when he was a an absolute football star side of her first\nBlack star in the NFL or the first black player in the NFL\nYeah ... ... it's it's interesting because the NFL um had players like Paul ropes and and uh Charles fullest and Fritz Pollard yeah the great for its Pollard in the

athletes are different times you get that blank stares sometimes have somebody who is younger who go ... or not\nI'm not familiar with that and I try not to lecture school even my own kids as always say you know research it\nJust research it and get a better sense of who this person or what that moment was like you know Jesse Owens Nineteen thirty six just understand what was like what it could have been like for him to be there in Nazi Germany and\nTo compete and competed a high level with Hitler standing there watching wanting his area nation to dominate\nMe just just imagine what that had to be like and Jackie Robinson with what happened with him\nEven the sixty eight Olympic sports illustrated did a great article on this subject to understanding Tommie Smith and John\nCarlos at that time what they did you know we look at like Colin Kaepernick not kneeling or not standing for the anthem bench nothing compared to what they were doing they were on the Olympic stage there on the podium\nBad one to the three medals and they did black power had black gloves they took their shoes off and this was in front of America in front of the world and they did that\nAnd it took forty years for people to actually look back and give them praise or say nice things it's sort of like Mohammed Ali when Mohammed Ali lip the cauldron in Nineteen Ninety six\nLike it you know it's amazing how many people love Dali ban but when I was growing up white America like Joe Frazier they want to Joe Frazier to shut up Muhammad Ali and\nYou know I wasn't old enough at the time to understand well

drafted\nHe said it ... it's a war we're not going to when you're not going to that war and my dad was in the Korean War as a marine and and that's when I realized\nWhat Mohammed Ali was saying even though it was on popular at the time unpatriotic he said I I don't have any qualms with the Viet Cong I I don't know how that's why why are we fighting these people and you know when you look at Ken Burns\nDocumentary oh my God\nIt's just so powerful when you see all the mistakes we made and all the presidents who made these mistakes and all the kids you know who lost their lives men who lost
