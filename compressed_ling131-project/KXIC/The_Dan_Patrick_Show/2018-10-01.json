{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "[noise]\nGood morning we're going to be on the lookout for some precipitation for today also watch for some really in mid morning fog lifting and from the south over all kind of a messy day in front of us some\nHas it is whether this afternoon in the form of some scattered thunderstorms and maybe strongest severe look for higher around sixty nine a chance of showers continues to knock down to fifty two patches of drizzle possible tomorrow along with a few areas of fog again in the morning look for high tomorrow right around sixty four when the upper seventies by Wednesday\nThat your TV nine first alert forecast meteorologist ... [noise]\nFifty it I Would say these news and Ford station eight hundred tax icy and kick science the dot com Monday's with mark ... say you good morning it's\nRaining again it is a man and then ... and looks like another wet pattern here for about the next ten days\nYeah it's going to be certainly of soggy one and unfortunately uh we do have ag listeners out there down in Washington, Iowa county they don't need this right\nNow [laughter] you know and for for the longest time this summer you know that and yet in extreme south southern southeast Iowa they were in drought condition for so long and now we've got a lot of like lots of people that kind of excess rain um if you if you remember the or the total they ... they said for the month of\nSeptember and September wasn't even done what the city Waterloo had twelve point eight nine inches of rain there ... ...\nNot just for September ... ever and they're off to an October start also because ah it's been raining them a north highway twenty for about ... about twelve hours or so looking at the forecast so hopefully it doesn't rain in Chicago or you talk about the game and I'll look that up\nSo [laughter] um yeah you know that the game yesterday the cubs are played a with intermittent rain um but yeah you're one of the year now of course the again the the one game a division championship decider coming up this afternoon eleven thirty ... five first pitch\nAt Wrigley in Chicago and so yeah we'll keep an eye on the weather um but again at this stage of the season uh they're pretty much all options in terms of you know I have to be really really severe weather um and torrential downpours for them to a postpone today's game at the at any rate a show on\nA Monday will do whatever they can to get this game played didn't\nYeah mostly cloudy and Seventy three with only twenty percent chance of rain so ah the storms that are moving up long period of gene in Upton towards Wisconsin hopefully won't dip down too much\nYeah and that made me without you know continue to a break up as they get closer to shy town a ... recently heard ... can be a new talked about says if you talk to anybody who's actually lives in Chicago they never used the term ... shutdown\nYeah [laughter] you know what I've had that same conversation with somebody in in it got popular for a while but a ... on the mound to day and he's a reading this morning or he's done extremely well against the brewers foreign one with a to point one forty hour a\nYeah you know when you kind of looking at their the rotation 'cause I was going through my uh my progression is you know all I knew Lester pitch Thursday at Hendrix at pitch friday and so I was trying to think yeah who's going to be in line for today is a wiccan town who's had some success\nThis season against the brewers add up to his last time out against them was a little a little rougher\nBut um you know it'll be a similar situation to ah yesterday as soon as the there's a there's trouble um you're going to probably somebody you see somebody out of the bullpen I don't think the cubs I lost track whether he was six seven eight pitchers yesterday and get the job done whatever is going to take at this point\nJoe Manchin post game was kinda funny he goes how many ... was that game Fifteen Fifteen something like that was a laborious game for he said my God how many pitching changes that we have between the two teams I\n[noise] it yeah it was a it was incredible um and and the cardinals had nothing to play for because they'd been eliminated before the game and started but\nUm you know ... of course would love nothing better than to spoil 'em the the ... if they could um but yeah I saw again today will be a ... probably ... unless\nA ton of is lights out um you're going to probably see another parade of a different picture said to to uh to win this National League central and then get a get a break and until Thursday\nThe thing I was happy the most about was especially after losing on Saturday was the bass returned once again reserve went for for for Chris Bryant had a double in there with a two run our you know RBI info it's just like yeah you guys were hidden corners also when you up\nAll the big guns are gone with the exception of hobby by us and um you know there's a lot of debate right now in terms of of who's going to win the national league MBP or by as has a very strong case yell at show from uh the brewers a super strong case as well um and\nI guess what I what what I think it would be really cool is to have\nA hobby by us needs to have some hobby by as moments today um maybe to to get that a ... a MVP vote away from yell at such a once and for all but a true ground layer yeah to solid seasons and um so uh yeah I think we need hobbies hobby a today\nWe have great and so once again the way that it shakes out as if the cubs lose they will play tomorrow against the national league west loser or in that game slated for three o five this afternoon central time and so there'll be against the Rockies and Dodgers\nYeah a hundred and sixty two games wasn't enough to know why they support same as a result Dodgers and an Rockies uh I'm so whichever yet that whichever wins that whichever team wins brewers cubs or gets the wild card at home um and the winner of today gets ... and then it gets to have a couple of days off till Thursday\nYeah and also for the uh and I'll see the championship or whoever wins they'll have the best score in so they'll have\nThe home builder entered in the in the ... home field advantage throughout the nationally playoff if we win\nToday than we play on Thursday against the west coast of winter so ah things are obviously going to shape up after the Dodgers game tonight will know exactly where everybody's a who's going to be playing\nYeah you know hum and regardless of what happens with the ... I was just before the ... the Dodgers in Rockies and decide whatever they're the they're ... yeah well the cubs and brewers will know what their schedule is for the rest of the\nWeek Monday's with mark right here on eight hundred ... damned Patrick show up next have a great safe they and they drop\nThe offering circular which contains information about high times on the court the offering and other related topics including the risks of investments pleases high times investor dot com that's high times investor dot com I aren't media and its affiliates are investors and I tend to hold and corporate are not associated with is offering media and its affiliates in that responsible for the information contained in his metrics bi racial\nThe information filed with the securities and Exchange Commission it'd be a crime committed a crime alert with Nancy Grace we do more than just six fifty five when I see an eye or radio station this\nBy heart radio goes one on one model when the talking about which party they consider to be in the\nEven somebody on the weekends you know I Love his music I have so many of their name in love with the yeah the way\nIt was the oldest was shown as I was at home to hundreds of years I'm ... on the radio and I was like what is amazing Brianna say maybe some and I'm like whoa\nKeep listening to I heard radio for more of you to an all your favorite artist\nWebster online and to learn more visit the risk you run dot org shop or shoulder will be held on Saturday October sick from nine until more on that day the domestic violence intervention program all team up with area high ...

I I think is the lock that the whole family but really compiled a lot of numbers in the last what eight years he didn't catch that much so I I think he falls short I really do\nI Do MBP or National League is it yeah much\nBetter than a hobby by as all year just because he affects so many games a defense Philly as well as offensively I mean you look at these got over thirty homers over a hundred already eyes is done at wired a wire yellowish really carry the second half\nBut I looked up yesterday and yell at you like to Harvey eyes and a home run short of the triple crown [laughter] that's how well he plays you know\nI'm I think it's got to be a coin toss I pick hobby bias but I think post talk of the ...\nYeah I agree we were you with a biased but I I think that yellow ... wanted here in the last three weeks or not the bias lost it but I think he'll be euro nationally given BP American League MBP yeah Judy Martinez blurb the triple crown but it feels like it's ... and BP\nYeah that's a tough one to 'em and and for the first time we really have some great races all the way through the fan is with the guys that were carrying their team so I think that's what's been missing the last few years that\nUh this kind of minimize the importance of a playoff run at a pennant run and being on a contender for those type of a war it's like you look at the ... that's that's embodied the drama and he has nine wins and he's on a team that wasn't even\nThose to being in the playoffs but uh that's kind of one of the writers of down so it's good to see guys that were in the race for me anyway when you start talking about those big awards\nI was also wondering about this that the Dodgers thought that the you were going to have a ... or pitch and then it said it felt like he was announced that he was going to be pitching and then all of a sudden ... not pitching what did you make of that from like the Dodgers perspective\n[laughter] yeah I Want to ... he set it on friday you know so if he doesn't set on friday he basically said\nIf the game as important on Sunday I'm taking the ball I'm pitching yeah when you say that then don't do it but I then I heard word that they had told the Rockies last week that ... was not going to pitch\nSo I don't know I missed that the other one for me than the kind of got me was the cardinals are playing the cubs yesterday and yah de Molina and ozone both don't play and I'm sitting there going you got all the rest\nAnd had the cardinals fan the game meant something yesterday they both play and I just think when you already makes that big of a difference too pitching staff\nI Would love to send him catch for jak flared yesterday and see what the cardinals might have done to affect the cubs so I I don't know I just think those things are part of the integrity of the game as you go down the stretch we play one sixty two in this case today not one sixty three but\nThe game doesn't quit at one sixty one I think we should have let those guys compete\nGood to visit with the age are will be watching during the postseason we'll check in with you thanks for joining us\nAbout it and I say thank you\nHeroin rentals major league baseball network analyst and uh all the postseason action you can get their coverage pre and post for the postseason on M.\nB. network there or you know interesting though with Chris Davis like the ... the same for every single season the last four seasons to forty seven\nYou had some other players who batted the same they had the same batting average for three consecutive seasons I knew moody Wilson did it once I think there been like five guys who've had the same exact batting average three consecutive years she asked me club\nI Can't get over what you said about Joe ... is a hundred and forty three career homerun well he was never a power guy in this day and age I feels really slight\nWell you bat three hundred but Harold right if if Joe Mauer was if these are just catching numbers that is why Buster Posey you'll be all all the fame or in my opinion because if you do it as a catcher we always well you know we we grade you on a curve with your numbers as a catcher we've always done that\nBecause you know it's the most taxing position that you have\nAnd you know to be able to put up all friendship numbers I mean ...

Charlie word when he when he went to the NBA\nNBA so high and doesn't guarantee pro\nI Wonder if the Oakland A's are they watch Oklahoma football games or do they try not to because you just like oh my God I don't want to watch this\nYou know that's our draft pick their oh because you you're watching him and he's not afraid and he used electric him and he was unbelievable against Baylor that accounted for seven touchdowns there\nCould he have a better season than Baker Mayfield\nI'm curious about that I say yes he can have a better season than Baker Mayfield yes going to go out on a limb and say yes I think you can you asked me what\nIt will get drafted like ... you know he will not\nNFL teams can't watch Trevor Lawrence anymore they're just they're ... he ... he's a Andrew Luck he's a guaranteed number one pick and he's getting destroyed out there\nWell he's the first of all he's a freshman\nSo we've got a couple of years before the NFL can get their hands on I Know second of all I don't care how big you are\nYou know how to get out of ...\nWe say there's every single week\nGet out of bounds\nYou don't have to fight for one more yard you didn't need to do that\nYou know see I don't even understand why do they just flirting with the idea of not getting out of bounds Aaron Rodgers how to play yesterday where he says or is this like you'd see and to get the last six or half a yard sale like dude get out of bounds if I'm a defensive player at some\nPoint I go look either get out or I'm going to pop you okay ... okay I'll get out about that\nOne of these days the ... going to go away I don't know you know he didn't get out of bounds crazy by the way Aaron Rodgers I I don't think you had to read between the lines he's not happy with Mike McCarthy's by going you\nKnow it all he was talking about basically you know how is it that my good guys can't get the ball here's Aaron Rodgers on how bad the Packers off inch was yesterday\nOr we were terrible an office so I don't think there's actually off and split\nA jolt to the defense for a little bit in the [noise] as I can take credit for them and their um first should Austin's twenty ten maybe\nThat's what I was it was as bad as we play on our friends with that many yards and long time why did\nYou watch the game I played\nThe boy oh righty he actually said after that everybody should be fired [laughter] you know he's like fire everybody except for me you know Ira everybody else now and I said everybody in Tampa should be fired and everybody ... fire mobile\nI Will come back your phone calls her next and double settle on a ... question got our play the day is well coming up next our\nWill can Notre Dame go undefeated got their new quarterback now about forty will join us will uh recap college football over the weekend and Troy Aikman will join this coming up we may hear from Mitchell or Mitch Trybulski after his career day\nOn the phone call he's going to go I got it made you mention whenever you want to be a great feeling\nWas his first task that now no no stop stop we're going to take a break ... you're turning into a frenzy here with the Broncos about this every one of my ex touchdown oh I get to go now know it'll never having to take a break we'll come back our play that is [laughter] [noise]\nAnd if you lose I still had my ... in football I can get you know you can you can have plays that are designed to get your best player the bowl quarterback or running back harder to do that with wide receiver if I put the ball in the hands of my best player and I can do that\nThen why not do that or she is from um five kale NBA back and just the best worst Ryder Cup fail\nYeah get some friction going on with Patrick greed and Patrick ... wife been tweeting and do you know a Jordan ... and Patrick greed and don't like each other it goes back to what is great about the European team\nThey really like each other and they were forced to\nSpend more time you know guys would actually get a hotel room together because they didn't make the money that they didn't you know the Americans did or the European Tour there's a lot more camaraderie and you saw that\nLike I couldn't help but root for the Europeans don't they get along you know they're supportive they ... you know they were really excited fairly Jesus who's going crazy Tommy Fleetwood\nLike he was putting on a show but\nYou know the United states losing over there is not a surprise to me you know as far as Phil Mickelson say goodbye to fill with the Ryder Cup tigers played a lot of golf he needs to take some time off he looked tired um\nYou know there were some movies made not may that'll be a question there but it Patrick Greek St Patrick read rubs or the wrong way you know he's a pebble in your shoe\nThat's how he plays that truly is a you know he's a great player but as far as pairing him with Jordan's speed I don't know if I can have two guys who just don't like each other playing together\nAnd so I don't understand that logic but apparently a George ... reportedly didn't want to play with Patrick ... yeah by\nThe reporter Jimmy Roberts was interviewing in pulled her right after the wind and he had a question I thought was interesting is it do people in America understand how big this has to the European fans and the European golfers do you think that the Ryder Cup means more yes to the European team yes absolutely does that manifest itself in the in the play oh\nWell you're an underdog trip on your shoulder because when you think of the great players\nWe always think all these American players in tiger's back now you don't feel as last call Jordan should be adjusting Tom and she got a you know Dustin Johnson Brooks kept like all of these guys they win major you know we talk about them\nAnd it feels like the European team Hugo who's that who's ...\nWho's a roaring oh okay oh Rory without a how to\nMake a for instance ... oh yeah what do you like a nice story earlier this year like you forget you just you're not in their world\nAnd I think that they play that up and they were the better team they were they were the better team\nSo I'm not surprised the U.S was favored but I'm not surprised United States lost on foreign soil a Korean Ohio Corey what do you have for me\nUm I got a worst first as though is the worst is the raft enough around the raiders game yesterday

we have got some phone calls to get to\nOkay poet before I get to that I had one I thought of last night that you will absolutely not like but I haven't been and Terry had the all time feel go record what it's all said and done who is a greater ... had a military\nOr just some Tucker all metrics has the greatest kicker another fell history Adam ... it's got to be cocker not always a machine\nAdam ... you can't write the history of the NFL without out of ... you can write the history of the NFL with Justin Tuck Justin Tucker is a machine you're right automatic the clutch kicks that Adam ... had in his career or unmatched I saw a good and now he's going to be a hall of famer because of\nThat I saw analogy vegetarian Tom Brady Jesse Tucker is Aaron\nRodgers I thought that was okay All right yeah I find that yeah\nTucker's I'd done yet I I totally hear what you saw the huggers unbelievable ... it's almost like an unfair advantage for the rape it's I feel like you need to to limit him\n... yeah if I'm John horrible like last night he's kicking forty nine years and like it's like it's so big deal you're already planning for what your defense is going to do when they take the field so like Justin going out there and a gold ... they'll give give me three in our defenses\nUp here on TALK to you I Would even watch he never missed an extra point in his career adjusting Tucker that that's a great comparison that he used the Aaron Rodgers of kick or is he is the most talented kid her but Bennett Terry you got the history there you've got the resume\nI Do have a real ... do you prefer NFL overtime or college over time as a result we were talking about it and that was enough for me to put it up\nWell now that it's ten minutes you have a ... you know the likelihood of more ties and I got all want that so I Would say people are going to they're going to side with college will Seventy seven percent college him up on\nWhat if he switched the NFL's overtime to the college overtime but you remove kicking so you start your ... you know first down to twenty five yard line and you have to go forward in all circumstances you know punching there's no feel goals there's no extra points well\nThey don't want to have more play you know the NFL is trying to limit all of these places I guess you know how to how do we do this that's why you went from Fifteen to ten minutes you want to cut down on the here the ... plain overtime game they have a quick turnaround Thursday night against the wing length that they're trying to limit the number of plays and an entire game\nAnd if you have over ... you can have a five overtime game\nAnd and that's what the NFL does it want to I don't think that you know college cares about these kids they're fine let them go on there has been come on Tommy go out there and went on for the team you know\nI noticed watching the Penn State of ... a college does not have the ... body weight rule for quarterbacks the highest the quarterback asking yeah Haskins got landed on twice in one series and the commentary even mentioned because we don't have that role down here\nYou have a you don't have a hundred million dollars invested in that quarterback and people aren't necessarily going to games to watch the quarterback look the way they do in the NFL yes see\nThat and most of these schools having better quarterback waiting and I mean how many every other we just did last week where there's you know three of the top five schools have quarterback controversies other rotating between two\nPoll he's got a bat do you have this was Mick loving or you want to you want to\nOwn a hose out to the room okay remember a few years ago my glove and said that the Sean Watson we that I'm On overall pick in the NFL Draft yes same we're going back to the Clemson well whenever Trevor Lawrence leaves Clemson\n... where will he go in the draft the over under ... is this three point five that make up one I I mean these three and a half oh he didn't even need that\nI've said I didn't even need yeah he says he's going to number one I I'll do that as Tom Watson baton on Trevor Lawrence if he learned to run out of balance two and a half years from now\n... who else is in that class is there anyone famous yet done I I'll take the other I'll take I'll take everybody else I I get the field pick yeah you get earth yeah I get everybody\nOut I'll do a shower shame on that one for sure\nHe feels like darn old and um who didn't go walk and walk a little bit\nMario put it on the board there put it on the board the U.S so that'll be it'll be up there for two and a half years [laughter]\nWhen Trevor Lawrence yes he's\nSpeaking of things I had a question about our quarterback draft that we did last week yeah okay so we do the draft we do for the next five years yeah these are the people you build your team around now but then we do the draft every two years\nYeah so do I still have the first five guys or six guys that I took also 'cause right now pollen are splitting Andrew Luck and if he turns out the ball out for the next three years I mean like you should still be on my team 'cause I draft I was building my team around no\nYou should have taken the same players that you took two years ago if you truly believed in them\nShould only change that to me in two years from now shouldn't we change that to who you're going to build your team around for the next two years since two years from now we're going to change our team again\nNo I Want to know if you're still re investing in your quarterback two years from now don't make it complicated that I over thinking yes you did I feel like those guys are still in Nineteen Wednesday night hockey night is back the stars come to play it kicks off with an

instant classic well he was thirty five ten and a half time\nAnd I was in the minority when I said hey why don't we go over and watch the football game and then I was told men nobody goes to the games oh and then I realized that everybody was at the game and it turned out to be for overtime sixty eight sixty six funnel whittenberg and I took over two and a lot of money riding on\nThe ... yeah but what if they had a ten minute overtime it wouldn't been a classic\nI guess I didn't think of them yes just to\nSo where are you getting comments like hey how come you're not at the game or know aren't you supposed to like sports may laugh like that maybe they aren't you supposed to like sport yeah there's a game going on right now on\nAnd I know I you know and I love division three I just you know I just didn't uh didn't have the time to go in and watch it if if Denison would have been a little closer as far as thirty five ten and a half\nAnd then I Would have gone it probably\nDid you bring beers in their own own or would've needed a couple of beverages there I Will take a break pat forty from Yahoo Sports will join us to talk to him about possibility he thinks Notre Dame will go

those go fast yeah you got to get in on those early before to target said all I wanted was a doctor ... butter there's some right there ... got a little bit of split know does this was Dr ... that's right yeah but you ... if you don't want I I Need to get a shepherd\nOrder from dollar shave club I Do because when it comes in somebody takes Paul made one white Charlie's Ari competitor yesterday has got to the second you're walking you better start looking at ... you know she\nIs Dr Carver dermatologist I don't even know what is a PHD I mean you would think that a guy who developed a shaved butter he must work with skin right I don't know a doctorate in shaping he or she but like you know Dr j not a doctor [noise]\nI think that there used to be a picture of Dr j where he had like a ... you had scrubs on you know they did one of those picture Dr j like they might have been in like an NBA player there and he was operating on like\n[noise] ah another second straight ... find comeback by Ohio State that was eight and then the better by Penn State and said hadn't been able to finish against or say they've played too great games really three great games in a row against them but the last two\nThey've given away late lanes and then you know the whole thing it was a heck of a game and then the fourth and five called by James Franklin and his staff was just such a colossal buzz kill you know you're heading towards this really climactic exciting ending and you run that play in that\nSituation and there was like what the hell is that\n[noise] yeah my problem with it is I have to have my best if I can put the ball in the hands of my best player\nThen I Want him to have an and I want to trace makes or need to have a win or lose at least I have it in his hands and I know they solve something with the defense or they thought they were going to catch them off guard here I get it I I just I still want my best player to have his hands on the\nPhone [noise] absolutely especially when you're best player can either run a or throw it I mean he's been phenomenal all night he was\nYou know remember him for a hundred and Seventy five yards he made big throws say they they couldn't stop him and to take it out of his hands in that moment or was it was pretty shocking and especially after time out time out I'm Out and it was just seemed like a classic outsmart themselves situation\nI Know you pose the question about Notre Dame going undefeated looking at their schedule do you think they'll go undefeated\n[noise] I Would say no just because while there are a good team I don't think they are a great team I don't think they're a team without weakness\nAnd usually those teams find a spot somewhere along the lines of the trip up you know and maybe it's at Virginia Tech this Saturday but Gina text starting quarterback is out with a broken leg maybe it's at the end against us see\n'em you know maybe it's somewhere in between uh Syracuse in Yankee Stadium could turn out to be a tricky game but you know my gases I'd probably end up with at least one last but if you want to look at it right now in projects are going to be favorite you're thinking ever get [noise]\nYeah it feels like those slip up someplace they're uh you know we're still not sure what we have with Virginia Tech Syracuse Syracuse is fun um USC I I don't know what to expect from USC I mean they they allowed Arizona to come back and nearly lost that game and how would you handicap USC right now\nA major question marks um you know I I was young and some key places not very well coached I don't think not overly tough on physical\nOr not not very impressed with them at this juncture now clay held those teams if they've done one thing over the last few years they've gotten better as the seasons gone along you know five games in a an underwhelming by us\nWe have this situation this past week we're Trevor Lawrence was announced he was going to be the start of the Clemson quarterback get to the call over Kelly Bryant who was\nA decorated starter won sixteen of his Eighteenth storage senior now all of a sudden the incoming freshmen five star recruit he gets distorted gets injured in Syracuse has any does anybody know where Kelly Brian is right now\n[laughter] uh he's from Piedmont South Carolina which is like twenty five miles from the ... campus so I Would not be surprised if Clemson dispatched several staffers to carry him on a Sunday on all the way to\nCampus but I you know I don't know whether he's interested in coming back I don't know whether devil wants him when the question came up after the game he really did seem interested in it uh and I can understand that like what we almost lost because in one of the reasons why is because this guy ... said\nI wanted to talk about the Cheney has right now so I that situation is still up in the air\nUh it it would be a difficult returned but I don't think it's an impossible return but if you're looking at it from Clemson standpoint say OK\nChase price was good enough to get us through or playing Wake Forest next week and we think we can win that will chase price then we've got by week of Trevor Lawrence a you know if the injury and more severe than it look he should be back after that and and we can make it make a go of it\nSo I got a bad forty from Yahoo Sports but we're also seeing this trend here at where\nYou really get a couple of years to prove yourself in college football and even then that might not be enough because everybody's bringing in another five star recruit these kids are ready to go as soon as they hit campus there in rolling early in some cases here\nAnd it feels like you know Trevor Lawrence when he gets to be a junior is going to be facing somebody who's a freshman coming in and probably challenging him for his job\n[noise] yeah it's pretty amazing I mean ... quarterback so I think already earlier and you know there's more of them especially at that position but will ... come in early and be there for spring practice and give themselves a chance to play right away\nOr certainly the best of them want to play as freshmen I don't want a red shirt because they're like\nThinking you know hey three years and I'm going pro baby so you know the timetable is just different now and quarterback so they get so much more coaching before college too with the quarterback camps and individual instructors and that sort of thing I just think there's\nA lot of 'em that are a lot more ready early than there used to be\nI was also watching the Louisville game against Florida State\nAnd I'm thinking okay and I actually kept it on even though I thought well you know ... just going to run out the clock and then maybe for state gets the ball back with less than a minute to go and you know let's see if they mean goes the entire field or whatever they need to do to tied the game or maybe when it\nAnd then all of a sudden Bobby between off into genius ... says let's throw the ball\nAnd and now you're quarterbacks last name is pass do you think that he thought it was an instruction like Iran has [laughter] and then quarterback thought he meant pass instead of he was calling him over to on past [laughter] okay\n[laughter] what do you think [laughter] that's the best explanation of because of the other explanation make any sense\nThat was a just a catastrophic bad call I mean between that and between what James Franklin did and Frank why Wright's station yesterday it was like oh my gosh these coaches have lost their minds at the end of games but\nThe train or not many people have had a worst month and the train or his team is terrible\nUh fans of kind of gotten tired of his act the march ... not there anymore they cannot score which was his thing they can't move the ball they can't sport\nAnd then you blow one of the few games you're probably going to have a chance to win and it solely on you and that decision I mean just made no sense whatsoever with his name may be passed but he doesn't do it terribly well and that showed it right then and there I mean through it directly into the chest of a Ford estate guy and they win the game directly off of that\nDo they have a backup quarterback named taken me [laughter] or hand off yeah they should get a a let's say a guinea and they're a okay give me a three games this weekend to keep an eye on [noise] okay\nI Know it's a pretty slow light slate I Will say but start with the red river shootout um Oklahoma and Texas Texas has bounced back after the dismal lost to begin with they look pretty good\nAnd they play Oklahoma pretty tough in that series lately uh then you would go LSU at Florida LSU has been one of the better surprises so far at or drawn a lot of people thought that he'd be playing this way on the hot seat by now and maybe it's the coach of the year instead\nA but it's tough game and the swamp Dan Miller has Florida playing butter and then I'd say a Notre Dame at Virginia Tech see him in book and keep that thing role and\nNow you did say the red river shootout not it's not known as the shootout is that because you can't say Red River rivalry\nIt's because I yes I I have a at a version to cleansing names like that for reasons that don't really struck me as compelling\nWhen we were ... yeah yeah and got a problem with them [laughter]\nNo no all my foot disease here I just don't like the red river rivalry\nThank you pad it's good to catch up with you my pleasure Dan ... of the weekend\nAll righty pad forty Yahoo Sports national college football columnist there\nWhen we were why but we we went down there years ago when we were still at the mothership yeah yep yeah Mark Cuban\nCame over did we did a show from the ... the fare wasn't

best and worst of the week and so you're taking the overall and the Lakers make love and your your your body and I'll read it\nYet but I could that could be a ... it just feels low for LeBron's team when I hit forty eight and you know just because you had so much success I Know he's going west I think that they're ... they're\nWell this this schedule like the you know you don't have as many off nights when he was in Cleveland and it'd be like guard who do we got you got the hawks and what kind of put an\nEffort here we got our land over here you know to be a little tougher for the best and worst of the week\nAfter the weekend in addition to being a David writes emotional single feels Saturday Night for a number five the captain I'm going with Arizona State running back you know Benjamin

three years since they've been this bad\nYeah I can look at this and say All right this is a you know a different coaches she uh players and Scott process trying to coach them you you still have to be able to coach effort and Scott process and not even coaching effort out of these kids watching some of the highlights from that Purdue game you're just going to just chemical like they're not even tackling people\nAnd and that's on base coach ...\nBest hit the music ... ... for my best that we can go\n\nThat\nThe top what five seconds to go\nDave lap um there is the color analyst let me hear that again\nI go\nIt [laughter]\nI Know that\nFive seconds to go yeah\nIt's not easy being in the play by play guy when your color analyst does that because you're trying to sort of set up everything for the analysts to be able to describe what he sees\nNo seed and normally over the years he's been good about doing it off Mike where he's just sort of in the background and you're like\nMe is that guy ... he's like you\nKnow and then that time though he went fall right\nInto yep all I just transcribe with Dave lap and said there boom boom yeah\nBe just to let her be was the last ... worth is going to be a oh got Tyler eye for an injury ... ... yeah\nYeah when I saw him do the imitation of chugging of beer and then I say scored a touchdown and then I thought oh man that always comes back and haunt you and then I turn away and then I come back and then they're caught him off the field\nWith a broken neck he's had so much trouble is eating whole quits if you're a player like that who just gets injury after injury\nHe's on a good team and they feature him but I I\nYou know once you're done you're done like you you you know then that's it I any Xiang\nPraying [noise]\nI'd front row

I think ... percent that no tone\nThat's from a from west gate or at least as of August fifth when they put something out and they got the Lakers\nOkay later and a half forty eight and a half Houston at fifty four Golden State id sixty\nTo\nThose are ah so I got what teams are going to be a ball of uh the Lakers in the west and let me see you're gotta get the book um Denver forty seven and a half so they're below so Golden State Houston\nUh who else was going to be above the Oklahoma City is going to be above them\nPortland Portland at forty one and half\n\nGot the San Antonio like five games below two yeah Utah says the same who has more wins Lakers Utah Jazz doesn't feel like it if it's the Lakers but this according to Las Vegas they've got a boat that forty eight\nUm\n[noise] let's see since LeBron's rookie year in two thousand three here's the minute she's played regular season postseason so most minutes played regular season postseason since two thousand three two thousand four he's he's not even close fifty four thousand minutes\nNext is ... in a bit ski at forty one so Thirteen thousand minutes less raunchy Carmelo I'm now coming off the bench Anthony at forty thousand minutes Dwayne wade forty thousand minutes Andre ... thirty nine so not even close with the Bronx\nI mean that's a lot of wear and tear on that body\nThat part of their off since has to be better if they're all going to achieve what they hope to\nHave you ever seen a situation where they're all Thomas with what you saw yesterday where he flips up his own sidelined [laughter]\nNot quite like that I I've I've witnessed quite a bit in Dallas over the years when I was playing but um I you know obviously just a a lot of frustration on his part um\nI thought it was interesting when we had the the Seahawks as you as you mentioned with the cowboys\nHow into the game he was and he had not from what I was told when we were there at their facility had not really talked to anybody in the building outside of just teammates and uh\nAnd yet on that Sunday and and maybe it was because he thought it might be the last game that he played for Seattle and that ultimately ... this past week is going to be playing for the cowboys I I'm not sure but he was certainly into the game show and a lot of enthusiasm excitement\nThroughout that game and then to have happened what happened yesterday is is obviously a real let down and that's why these players want these big contracts but I I think you know earls a he's an intense guy and and just a lot of frustration came out in that moment no doubt\nTalkative Troy Aikman joining us Dan Patrick Joe I'm going to a run down some numbers here and you tell me where we're headed with his back in twenty fourteen eleven four hundred yards passing performances that the entire thing you know or this is\nConnie my hand twenty sixteen twelve twenty Seventeen were aids such games so far through sixty two games we've had twelve four hundred yards passing games where we are really\nWell wherever we're headed I think it's where the lady wanted because of the rules that they put are not\nSo much the rules but the emphasis is sheer on illegal contact the defense of holding him they wanted to see scoring up it was down from last season and it's worked you know so we're seeing a lot of yards as you as you said and and a lot off fence and and that's what\nThat's what fans one um I I\nThink it's I think it's great it's more fun for me to call games when there's a lot of scoring we saw that with the Vikings and and and rams last Thursday night um but uh yeah it's a different game clearly and that's ... that's why I say that this this you know when we go and we talked their coaches every week obviously and\nWe still have coaches who say well we got to run the ball go stop the wrong\nOne of the Nineteen Seventy I mean that that have been\nChanged a long time ago and and you better stop the pass I you know I understand yeah we want to stop the run but if you can't play passed the defense and you can throw the ball in this league you're just simply not going to win\nWhich segue into tonight with Patrick ... a ... you know we keep waiting for he comes back down to earth does he come back down to earth dinner joy [laughter]\nOh I you know if you'd like to think or you know the uh the law of averages would say that this paste can't continue but\nWhat an impressive young guy he is and and I'm looking forward to watching them play tonight I haven't had a chance to to really sit and watch 'em ... will have Kansas City at some point on the on a Thursday night to where I really be able to study um but uh yeah I've heard nothing but wonderful things about him as a as a\nAs a person and then of course the way that he's come out and played and it's pretty remarkable and you know Alex Smith had I had a great year last year and a and yet they were ready to to give this young guy a chance and see what he could do and he's taken advantage of it and\nUm it'll it'll be from I'm I'm interested in watching them not as well but uh I I Do think he's going to continue to have a great career\nBut I think with Andy Reid and I gave the chiefs credit because Alex Smith would have been the same quarter back to keep and used the draft pick her draft picks on something else that can help this team\nThey needed to stretch the field because they weren't staring anybody twenty yards down field and if I got Kelsey and I got hill\nI got a chance that you know a semi once I get a chance to hurt you and then you you have to at least acknowledge the play fake they're so Kansas City went all in with Alex Smith being a very good quarterback\nThe well that's right and and as we know when you tell your quarterback in the first round I mean it's it's it's not a foregone conclusion that the guy's going to be a success it's uh it's about a fifty fifty chance and and so there was a lot at risk um a lot of belief in him\nI went back and studied on this off season a and study the number of these quarterbacks that I hadn't gotten a chance to really see there wasn't much taped to watch on on my home he played\nYou know in the season finale play in the pre season and\nAnd although I thought he did some good things in weeks Seventeen last year there were also some moments where you say yeah you know he's a young player or just simply hasn't played but but yet there was this excitement in Kansas City about his future\nAnd and so people were right on him or at least at this point and then you know I mean I I think obviously as I said he's going to continue to play really well he's going to a great career in Kansas City and seems to have the makeup that you want from that position but uh it it it was not without risk a\nTo make the move and yet it has paid off and and and that team has a lot of talent around them and their utilizing that so uh and he's done an amazing job he he has shown that ability everywhere his band or inability to\nTo to play within a the strengths of a quarterback and and and be creative offensively and that's been an exciting group to to see we don't see Kansas City like I said\nDuring the NFC package with Fox but I Will this year in our Thursday nights and ah I've got to believe that they're right up there with the rams as far as often as a firepower\nHow much he does Frank right deserve with his play calling they're not going for the time\nUh that was a that was a little bit of a head scratcher hum I I I think primarily because they ... if you don't make it there you know unlike a rebel\nIf you don't make it there than just one\nPass and and all of a sudden you're losing the game you know whereas in with my ... going for it and they ... they weren't close to given up a field goal if you know ... and all that so um I I I ... there's no doubt that the success of the eagles last year\nGoing forward on Fort down and Frank Reich being a part of that team a has has changed I think the approach with a number of coaches and uh\nI think that played into it yesterday and ... and ... I heard what everyone said after the game and uh I'd I'd have to you know you don't want to tie but you you'd rather tie them loose so ah I that's probably one had like a back but\nYou know when the results are when you have the high side of the results than ah than it's easy to say that but I at the time I I thought that it was a\nPretty risque call and it ended up backfiring\nOn if you're the quarterback don't you love that or your your team like you I I Know we look at the results but but in in the moment here like hell yeah like if you're Andrew Luck arent you saying then or are you thinking I think so\nI I I Believe so we hey I was uh in Ninety five I I was with the cowboys when Barry Switzer went forward twice on fourth one and and uh and we didn't make it and uh\nAnd only the first time we went forward again and [noise] and we were backed up we ended up losing a game and I and I was all for that decision because I felt that was the conditions in the game that if we didn't pick up the first down there we were going to lose any ...\nWe saw bill Belcher I go for it against when he was what the Colts are backed up and and he felt that if they didn't make the first down there on fourth down there we're going to lose the game anyway and so I I think there's something to be said for that\nOn day and Patrick ... noise NFL fans can't get enough football with maybe one exception [noise] I'm not sure how we all feel about over time right now\nThere were three overtime games on Sunday none of them fortunately editing Taj but all three easily could have [noise] we've already had two ties the season\nThe drama in the extra period is because it'll be twenty twelve rejecting the receiving team can't win with the ... one the first drive up the extra possession [noise] and now the extra period is only ten minutes and set up Fifteen minutes ties are very much in play a lot of extra football being played\nWhich in turn affects next week's sanction the colds when the full ten minutes on Sunday and now they have a quick turnaround they visit the patriots on Thursday night good luck with that\nPeople are always going to have problems with the overtime format politically started seeing even more time to watch out even more rain changes could be coming for a policy that the national football league will never perfect\nI'm Dan Patrick and this is above the noise [noise] [noise]\nIs Vicky our regular economic yep just a cleaning [noise] haven't been here for six months [noise]\nThey redid the lobby I think how did they [noise]\nThey magazine though right\nFour and a half diet happy about that definitely [noise]\nAnd Seventy eight reviews waiting rooms are boring make them exciting\nWith movies TV a music from Beijing and T the new Eighteen unlimited and more premium plan gives you over thirty channels of live t._v. and entertainment Boehner's like HBO or Amazon Music unlimited and on limited wireless service at the times you need them most aging anti Maher for your thing that's our thing\nAfter twenty to get back to the line for Monday Tuesday may ... may be limited to standard definition choice one out on service cotton subject to change restrictions apply to guarantee dot com slash unlimited\n[noise]\n\nOpportunities present themselves every day\nIn your home either [noise]\nTo be air force reserve\nPeople listening for your chance to win one thousand dollars in the harvest of cash contest sponsored by the hazy either way on the debris tax icy [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThe use of squeezes mayor for terrifying attractions one\nLocation designed to get why didn't take it away I was trying to take it away\nStill putting off building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan that is right for\nCall today and get started\nMessages that are we talking there will return text messages listened to Nick and Vicki story about seek quiet\nDuring last very loud and stone very draining town next to somebody who you're trying to sleep and we've got that Loughner reverberations\nYou're always hoping she'd get to sleep before I come up because I started getting the point where I was concerned 'cause I knew she wasn't going to get much rest if I came to bed at the same time you know she's been so used to me by on all the", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "01"}
