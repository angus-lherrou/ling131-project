'cause you're like this do they need to invest on defense not draft Holyoke Jones under six and you're absolutely right they took forever for them to catch up\nOn defense but once they got a defense they went to the super bowl yeah now you know they came down to ... and they're they're often ... you know was doing great against patriots we all know that story but I always thought that you had to have at least\nThe semblance a rumor or the defense she'd have to have something in there and\nYou know that feels like that's the difference with some of the I don't know how far Kansas City goes they've been five but it'll be for but how good is the ... going to be because the office is going to have in defense travels often doesn't always travel\nAnd you know ... the ... traveled to New England and I think Kansas City is saying hey we we are not afraid to go to New England if we have to in the playoffs\nI don't think Baltimore's afraid to go there but Baltimore's weaponry is nowhere near Kansas city's but their defense is really good\nUm San Diego's deep bench with fat off ... can make them as balances anybody in the NFL if it all comes together the rams the same way the officers great the defense has been spotty but if the defense goes back to where we think it'd be\nThen they're going to be the team that beat me and I'm the same with the ... really good that line might be the best of all offensive line and football\nAnd the deep end was great at the end of the year that's why they were so dangerous and really should have gone to the NFC title game but the team that had the best all offensive and defensive line\nWith one team was Philadelphia and they won the Superbowl I don't want to just prove their yes by\nDuring Aaron Rodgers run they drafted wide receiver divided Adams and the second round wide receiver Randall Cobb and the second round wide receiver joining Nelson as sack around them\nBut those are great traffic's so maybe they feel like we can get wide receiver in fairness to tend Thompson and the Packers maybe they felt like we can get receivers\nAnd we have a quarterback who's going to make a second round pick into a first round pick\nBut can we get off and should lineman can we get defensive backs here because you have to have a great off inch in line and it's harder and harder to find often she'd line that because of how they're taught in college they blocked differently\nAnd then you got to have these ... because of the exploitation know that these ... are doing to the deep and so I get that\nUm they just having these the ... the defensive backs haven't been as great as the uh the the wide receivers had been that they've found he asked me what\nIs it safe position to pick in the NFL these days because everything is topsy turvy be spread off at the pass Russia maybe\n[noise]\nI don't know I mean ... with the Broncos finally appeared [noise]\nRight [noise] gender war it's been great ... been really good [noise]\nBut nobody everybody was so caught up in you know quarterbacks and running backs and nobody thought about Denzel war they're like ...\nAnd the bill select [noise] whenever the books to more to go [noise]\nWe all love the tailgate at the stadium for the big games right but the one thing that can really ruin a tailgate is dry over cooked food and thankfully triggers wood pellets ranger and scout girls are ready to fill in for those unreliable portable gas in charcoal grill ... thanks so they're innovative compact designed a scout and ranger\nAllow you to bring wood fired flavor anywhere you go anywhere your team plays and with hundreds of recipes to choose from\nAt trigger drills dot com slash recipes or go through the trigger app\nNo more excuses for boring game day grub say goodbye to frozen hamburger patties or on inspiring hotdogs and say hello to barbecue burnt ends in pulled pork smoke chicken wings whether you looking to grill smoke bake roast razor barbecue trigger has the winning game plan for game day\nThe ultra portable trigger a scout and ranger grills allow you to grill off the grid no matter where you travel you can find a trigger a scout or ranger grill at a local dealer visit trigger grills dot com slash dealers trigger grills dot com slash Neil Young\nMy hello their men welcome to another edition of the ... visit dish and like all of our previous addition\nThis ban how strong arm I guess huh Rogers Roy Rogers has um\nHe's got every throw so you've got a strong army's got touch him ...

Presley is really stepped up and that's all and so it it's going to be tough I had the\nAstros originally and sex I'll probably stick with that and um to me the red Sox absolutely have to have good\nStarting pitching to win three more games\nI and I also I Know that we're all everybody's a hell bent on hitting home runs but I think the Astros changed and I think the red Sox changed a little bit because Cora came over from Houston it feels like he gave that mentality of let's put the ball and play\nWe can still hit home runs when you know if if we needed or we can rely on a little bit but I think the smaller things that's what stands out with uh the Astros they're not afraid to move around her over and do some small things there\nAnd I think the red Sox were trying to adapt a little bit of that I even asked David Roberts about that with the Dodgers I said are you ... you're you're are you too reliant on the home run and he goes maybe a little bit but we do walk a lot well if you're not bringing anybody in during the little things and you're not hitting home runs I don't care how much you're walking here\nWell you're right I mean listen there's nothing Ron home runs but I don't think there's such thing as headache too many home\nRuns but even better mix and as you said you send in Boston do this you know putting the ball and play with guys on base\nIt on your anything ... Yankees issue that I thought they were built for the regular season not for the post season and and I'm Talking about just audience you know we can talk about pitching staff but it feels like there's certain teams that are just built for the post season I didn't think the Yankees were\n[noise] yeah I see I Do believe that and again I think you have to have both you know and for me the Dodgers a kind of built along the same way I mean forget runners in scoring position number as what the Dodgers okay I Know he loves to look at that that\nThey're a team like the idea is that needs to hit home runs to the ear and they had a ton of them and they as Dave Robert soldier they'd do walk a lot so they get guys on base\nAnd you see I said home runs with a guy on first base but they don't get a lot of hits with runners and scoring position you know if they don't hit home runs like last night they're gonna lose games I mean they're past that went into World Series is to hit home runs period\nAnd you know damn that's tough to do every day and the post state in the lens some games that way but can they went enough\nOh I didn't want to tell you I really liked the Justin Turner piece you did last night you know it was just well written and ah you know you didn't have to have any soundbites in there it was just it was well done and so I wanted to\nSay I really appreciate that he's he's fun to watch I have an exception to this you know and then just home runs great heart and soul that team but I think if you asked me to pick one guy in the Dodgers to get ahead or the guy on second base no doubt he'd be the guy [noise]\nHave fun denied Tom always good to catch up with you thank you\nAbsolutely death on\nAnd so Tom reduced the sports illustrated senior writer with a Fox and major league baseball network analyst game for coming up tonight at nine eastern into the brewers and Dodgers and of course a Red Sox and the answer to this afternoon NBA tipping off as well\nGet a couple of phone calls you didn't hear did you do some research on the last team to win a Super Bowl when they first team all pro wide receiver I Do have a name\nMarvin Harris and with the colds but I don't know if that's the last time a team won the super bowl\nWhen they first team all pro wide receiver make\nLove his dad take is all over it you want would their research now when you want to hold it well do you have the research yeah I Do oh well you know China Marvin Harris in two thousand six a guy named Jerry Rice in Nineteen Ninety four\nOkay here's another question I don't know if he was first team all pro Victor Cruz second team approach ah\nOkay\nAll right I'll tell you I think that caller's point was right you don't need a ... a league wide receiver to win the super bowl I think that's becoming clear\nIt it feels like you need three or four very good wide receivers are good wide receivers\nActually came back to how do we know these guys are good it's just the quarterback putting hidden them in the hands again and again I mean on the surface of patriots wide receivers had been short\nYears but we're going to look at these numbers and a lot of these numbers with wide receivers\nThat aren't as good as guys who were already in the hall of fame but they're going to dwarf them if I had Lynn Swann or John Stoll worth the Steelers playing now pie Lynn Swann playing now\nFunny could do he was one of the most acrobatic he was sort of the the new ... he was a different version of Cold War field who I thought was inland ... these are some of the most acrobatic athletic\nWide receivers uh of their generation and if I put them in today's game\nYou know it's funny I didn't even up four hundred catches I don't think of his career John Stoll worth but that was the style now I'm going to have you know Julian Edelman with nine hundred ... or something in his career is he anywhere near Lynn Swann no\nAdam feeling is on pace to break the record this year for the most catches ever how do we know he's better than those guys\nI think feeling is is real I remember saying this Rodney Harrison last year at the beginning of the year and I said to him as we're doing the highlights I said this guy is great he said how can you say that\nI said I just did he's great and he had an old\nPro season and he's off to a record setting season do today's rules like they're all of this ... yes and it all helps him but the one is a very good wide receiver ... great I don't know what grade is anymore Larry Fitzgerald is great\nA growing because it's been great Adam feeling I Need to see a little bit more Julio Jones can be great how many great receivers are there there's a lot of productive receivers and I think there's a big difference in that you know the globe\nWe just got a tweet asking interesting question went to last time a first team all pro running back as one one I have not had we obviously have to stop and think about that but I bet you it's pretty rare as well\nLike maybe do some research on that show first team all pro running back and you won the Superbowl so we're going to prove that you know running back or a wide receiver [laughter]\nAll right\nA couple of phone calls here before we take a break I'm Adam in Indiana Adam welcome to the program what do you have forced [noise]\nAdam\n[noise] she was a um Adams listening I'm Robin in Rochester Hey Rob\nIs it going then great Rob good good I have a question you were talking about the Buffalo Bills earlier and um you're talking about the shale and injury yeah uh do you think that's going to happen to the bill season going forward like that is their citizens shot now they don't have Josh Eleanor what do you think\nAbout I don't I don't think they care about this season and they're not competing and being ... even though you went to the playoffs last year and you were a great story I don't I don't think I think they were surprised that they weren't that good I don't I don't think they care of this year I I don't I mean you care but I don't think you're\nI Know that you're going to be heartbroken if you end up with the top three pick this year\nAt least that's the same with the raiders said this\nThe beginning of the year I'd only John brooding thought his team was going to be good or\nCared if they were going to be that good that he's gearing up for the next two years for Las Vegas and I haven't changed my opinion on that John in Texas said John\nAh five ... eighty eight [noise]\nBut I always wanted to do that and I just wonder what you thought about maybe the Packers going after ... um I feel like the window on Rogers disclosing they're sitting on to the first round draft choices and a lot of money and I know it would be a one year rentals probably fall that by getting a chance and keep that ...\nYou know what John I thought they were going to use those picks for ... that's what I was told the Green Bay thought that they could get clue Mac and imagine ...\nOh wow\nMatt Ryan didn't win the Superbowl Cam Newton didn't win the super bowl I'm\nSo you're saying all skilled position are ready made all you want to now you know you want a great tackle\nJoe Thomas didn't even win a game and he was the best how I don't know what you want cornerback ... quarterback is okay\n\nDoes that sound right that the last time a quarterback was first team all pro and won the super bowl was Kurt Warner in Nineteen Ninety nine\n[laughter] [noise] no air Rogers when he won no I I Know Brady there can only be one\nQuarterback for first team because you're going to have a couple of wide receivers and a couple of running backs with quarterback you only got one that doesn't seem right that is Kurt Warner polling\nTom was first team all pro three times in his career oh seven and and Seventeen\nOh there you go if why and they lost ... they were perfect I Do last game into seven\nOkay so it is Kurt Warner the last quarter back to win a Super Bowl and be first team all pro\n\nAge of the eight teen\nWho were first team all pro since Nineteen Ninety nine lost in the super bowl including the last three years Cam Newton mad run and Tom Brady\nDoes that sound right make love and before I get to the\nSounds I guess so it's very surprised I Would never do since\nWe're also curious about the worst quarterbacks through the first three quarters because we were touching on fourth quarter comebacks\n[noise] um let me let me start here of let me see\nNow this is since two thousand ten the worst quarterback through the first three quarters\nRaiding his his right I'm I'm taking away the fourth quarter this quarterbacks rating is eighty two through the first three quarters I'm sixty seven touchdowns forty three interceptions\nI don't know if that helps you um\nSo that's just the number to play off the worst number of the first three quarters here is your\nTop ten [noise] um let's see I got Ryan Tannehill then Derek car Carson Palmer a blind man and Ryan Fitch Patrick Jake Cutler\nAndrew Luck Cam Newton Sam Bradford Joe Flaco is number two on that list below average and then he's really good in the fourth quarter and\nYour worst quarterback since twenty two thousand eight I Believe or ... or is sibling boredom lake ... your worst quarterback through the first three quarters yes for\nSomething that makes us actually worse they also broke down just the fourth quarter Blake portals is also the worst quarterback quarterback rating wise in the fourth quarter ... two thousand and Kay of any actor quarter but the best quarter insistent Blake portals as consistent ...\nNow these numbers here are the best quarterback ratings in the fourth quarter so um we were talking about fourth quarter comebacks um disguised quarterback reading is one moon nine

Thompson and stuff and Kevin Durant\nNo I don't know if you've seen a team in NBA history that has two shooters like they have and then you throw in ... so it's the greatest shooting team of all time\n... greatest ... you know team to have those kind of guys those weapons and I think that we're sort of like okay let's let's get Hugh if Chris Paul doesn't get injured\nHouston might win that series probably does and then it's a whole different story but even now\nWhen you start to look at you know confused and challenge I'm not hearing anything about Houston being able to challenge Golden State I haven't read anything about this\nAnd they brought in mellow you got Chris Paul James Harden\nAnd okay you're not gonna you're not going to compete with the I get the feeling people think Utah and Oklahoma City have as good a chance for some reason I mean I still look at Houston is there the second best team out there yeah ...\nDo you think any experts like guys are really know the sport people know the sport look at ... as an addition that roster and a positive for that Ross stern is the way I've only if he\nUnderstands his role because of the great players who come off the bench who play men who ... understood hey I'm not going to start okay I don't get to hear my name I don't get to go out there\nBut I can go in and I can be such a dangerous weapon for this too\nAnd he made himself into a hall of famer by embracing the role of Kevin mchale embrace the role\nYou can go back to John ... check with the Celtics the embraced the role and you know metal is kind of embrace it and if he does that he can be an addition if not then I think he's going to either be neutral or subtraction to this too I ... a seven seven three D. P. show email address sepia damn Patrick dot com uh got\nNBA Tonight we got a look at it the over under\nAnd I got Golden State around sixty three wins\nIt seems that seems low now they're going to page themselves here\nAre they in the fifties last year or they they mail it in most of the last\nWell Houston at a better record the Lakers I have at our around forty eight forty seven forty eight\nI think that I bet a shower shame on over ... because I Would I feel like I feel like that scene I Know it's a soccer but that's still feel so low for a ... ... more years had fifty eight wins last year and into you know they were injured I'm not trying [laughter]\nFacing themselves for a deal I think that\nThey looked at the model that San Antonio out then that is I'm going to rest my guys and steep current learned under great pop of it so he's going to go hey we don't have to win Seventy three because when they won Seventy three they didn't win the title\nIt's how I got to pace you know I got to know these guys I got to have them pace themselves and we're going to be ready for the post season that's not what the NBA commissioner once\nOnce they here but that's what's gonna happen you know Muslim\nI back to the Lakers are forty nine I got to be low right then that's a skill way lower priority it does because of LeBron yeah I Know that's but I I saw the money's going to the Lakers and the Celtics\nWell that's because you can get a good odds if you're going to bet on the Lakers to win a title I mean you're not going to get any odds with Golden State so I think that's where you know people it doesn't mean that they're putting a ton of money did you uh did you see what was the game where there were a ... oh the bay or she ... the most bet team this past\nWeekend the bears by far\nAnd\nVegas went one big because they took in a couple of bats that were a hundred thousand dollars on the bears beating everybody all the all the guys thought that they were smarter than Vegas what was the line on that big loving\nMy daughter was around pick um I'm not sure what is it a double track but everybody looked at this and when you got Broncos while it's the dolphins\nSo they didn't know Sunday Morning what have I mean these guys get in before the line like what how does the line changes ... why don't\nI have no I don't know I just read where Vegas took in a couple of batch of a hundred thousand dollars yeah boy\nI I really think that if I ever bet against my initial reaction not be a millionaire whenever I see a line and go holy cow and it's got to be like when I saw the patriots um chiefs the other night I think the line was fifty nine and a half like that's a huge over\nI should've bet the over because I thought he was going to go the other way based on my reaction and you had the under\nWho I hadn't navy first half underarm yeah army first I find it but I always say I had the bears I had bears a Miami as an under and it flew over but I said ah I\nDidn't say ravens titans first team to Twenty one when this yep a way under my uh oh we found that are found that ... was correct the last time a quarterback was the first female prone won the super bowl was Kurt Warner in uh Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd then all the other guys in their rich Gannon Kurt Warner rich Gannon Peyton Manning Peyton Manning Peyton Manning Drew Brees um nobody won the super bowl a lot of them lost the super bowl there isn't that amazing\nSo we found out that you don't need a great running back and all pro wide receiver or no pro quarterback to win the super bowl is that when we learned today make money out\nBasically not by the way the uh the bears opened a three point favorites tend to very close it all moved all the way to seven\nOkay that's what they were talk and then the you know the sharpest still went in and were betting the bears I think that the most money in Vegas this past weekend was on the bears\n\nYou you were you rent money when it comes to this stuff you don't own it you don't keep it you always give it back it just feels like that oh and I know so so painfully\nSo painfully\nDoesn't seem like they're going out of business in Vegas [laughter] just doesn't [noise] All right we'll take a break more phone calls coming up and a an NBA segment coming up the first flake or to be traded who's going to be the rookie of the year the MVP pick if the warriors slip up who wins the title\nAnd if I take away LeBron who will be the most dramatic covered NBA player this year [noise] I'm gonna try to answer all those questions next Seventeen after the our this is the damn Patrick show\nTrigger man you just say the name face lights up trigger trigger app\nWant recipes go to trigger grills dot com slash recipes they've got that for you because you may go what do we have an today I don't know just go to the ...\nFor any of this\nLike you know jumping it cost him eight million dollar he got suspended the entire year yeah Paul\nI that was because there was a concussion lawsuit and violence in the NFL was a hot topic and he was accused of being ultra violent and defense according\nI was like yeah but he ... he was now but it's under his while I Know\nAnd they were trying to say the NFL is tough on of violence and there's a pass find the people who have promised concussions Sean Payton had to pay\nSo we're not tough on the amount of the amount of airing a football like if there was a big crusade on the amount of error to football than double check might have been\nIt has been her that airlines [laughter] it's like for environmental ... something like that\nAnd the ozone layer of Scott the emails a deeply I was born and raised in Hawaii now live in Oregon in a huge market as Mario tougher than it would be awesome if he had some talent around him in Tennessee if you put him in Kansas City I think it'd be awesome hoping he gets some protection CU thanks yeah\nWhen you get sacked eleven times but I just watch Tennessee and it just feels like there might be\nIn points with metal fence and that's about it and it shouldn't be that way but that's what it feels like All right here we go [noise] if the warriors slip up how many teams can win the NBA tidal Celtics one\n\nI think that's it in the east and\nYou're not going to throw [laughter] literally exploded I I Love your reaction to it because you know I'm going to go the Celtics\n\nDid last year in the playoffs the Sixers worth five to one favorites in the series against the Celtics in Al Gore for found the fountain of youth and destroyed them singlehandedly\nOr who who didn't play for the Celtics last year carrying a word OK other than that [laughter] he goes gosh I'm going to go Celtics\n... rockets\nI I think the raptors could play for the title\n\nI I'll ... I'll be grudgingly throw the raptors in there you could really see them playing in the NBA final ... when they got they got my guy ... who's got a whole different personality\nI just saw a thing that's at odds wise out of the east it's Celtics raptors Sixers\nAnd having them ahead of science and then I Would do the rockets\nAre no may\nMaybe ... or the thunder better without Carmelo Anthony\n[noise] ah I Would go the rockets Celtics raptors have a chance to win the title if golden state's flip so\nYou mentioned jazz earlier there you're not no no no how 'bout the nice they're nice team to their habit is that while tied the Lakers I guess because of liberal on\nBut I I Need the brawn to take some time off this regular season and then I Need the ah the younger players to emerge I Need brand name for him to be a star I Need Josh hard to be a contributor a big chunk a contributor\nA you know what am I get out of my point guard position I'm Still not sure ... you know great surprise now now you take the next step I'm so can you be a fifty when team yes\nBut is that going to be up to play for the title like are you going to be dangerous and do they make a trait I Hope they don't make any trade to this year because what happens sometimes is you start to play better [noise] I thought you're kidding [laughter] no I don't want them to make trade right um\nBecause I Want them to stick with what they have this year I think the game plan is to be great next year cause then Golden State is going to be different I think um Houston with Chris\nPaul you're older um mellow you're older\nYou know who am I going to be looking at the nuggets are going to be competition there a jazz will be competition\nBut uh you know you can Portland reload there so I think next year is when you look at the Lakers and say they can buy for a championship because they're going to get somebody next year I think that's the difference yes you do you think this segment needs a little music yeah because we can food man\nYou know some time together yes [laughter]\n\n[laughter] that's cool I let her know that really all that's how I needed and that's the only reason why I wanted to do a NBA segment\nI like that are so are there you go the MVP pick a ongoing Anthony Davis I don't know who the sneaky pick would be here I guess you know the Greeks ... there's no surprises when it comes to the MVP unless unless ... Leonard won the MVP then that would be a surprise\nI miss this memo so pop of age Manu and all those guys also went to Toronto because I don't understand is why Leonard talk\nWhile you're playing in the east that's true but have you looked at the east\nI'd like to see him recreated San Antonio success without that that support around them I got an eastern faction you're right it is the so\nYoung a ... a throng [laughter] wrong [laughter]\n\nFirst like her to be traded\nAll I Know you want to go ... a hundred percent I Can't do that LeBron is not going to let that happen I Know\nAnd I think you're going to take matters way first Laker to be treated\n\nMichael Beasley ooh\n[laughter] ... yeah the China yeah for Jimmer for debt to the Shanghai Sharks the rookie of the year [noise]\n[noise] oh John Luca ...\nI'll let everybody pick on this one um I think the under aged will be the year rookie of the year just because they're going to need him\nYou know they don't have a point guard they don't have a gym or a point guard like what do you what do you what is coming up on he'll get Steve Nash bank lending place season I'm I'm going to go ... eight and just 'cause I just think he's going to put up big numbers so\nAnybody got anybody else yeah my club I got dark horse\nMiles bridges when we're not doing Darkhorse lie and say like he's like the Donovan Mitchell I think he I think he is eight and wasn't such a dominant this little forced you know people are hot or British he could be this year's Donovan Mitchell\nPossibly in Seventy Sixers passed up on my guy or not ... it's almost bridge the Michigan ... okay\nHe I mean he's older that's the only reason that's one reason I like him to the plate of a while All right Paul window Carter to do is going to get all he'll be starting day one purpose Chicago Bulls probably like Eighteen and ten would be sneaky pick their guy Jerome Robbins and they added Boston College to the clippers\nYou know you'd think shooter yeah but he's not their best rookie shade Gilligan's Island guild just you know he good guy I work Darkhorse yeah he's good yeah I like your\nBoys tray young Darkhorse enough for what about him\nNo I think he'd be one of the favorite she's going to put up good numbers they're printing\nExcuse me I have\nMy I gave you a cough button ...
