All right so the player comp game\nWell I'm going to go with the obvious with Brett Farr\nMan it's time to play the NFL ... oh and we've got the music here it sounds familiar um this is from\nA month before the NFL Draft NFL dot com or what player was Patrick ... compared to Dan Patrick ...

J. Cutler is the player comp for Patrick ... was the player how did you pull Jay Cutler out of that ... yeah\nWell the J cholera strong arm math I was trying to think who moves well strong arm athletic\nWhich could drive coaches not\nOkay that's a good call less lethargic Che Cutler says that up [laughter] All right\nI think Cutler was an extremely I who do we have on who said Cutler is has the talents of Aaron Roger or was it Brian her locker he just says decision making was the big difference there\nThey can you tell us that if someone was saying that he was a great basketball you know he's athletic as all get out if you look\nAt his high school tape as sad as that is that I did you could say that he was great and basketball don't getting a great athlete running at quarterbacking position\nI here's another thing that bothers me when we talk about Patrick ... when you throw in comparison to bread far which is what I did but I'm sort of mocking everybody in my business you're kind of forget how great Brett Farr was\nThen he went three consecutive MVPs yes I I feel like farm is under\nRated if that's possible wow I Know I feel like it I mean like farmers underrated probably the most covered\nQuarterback in NFL history maybe even more than Peyton Manning is\nUnderrated course but I think we remember him with the Vikings ingestion you forget what what football was like when he was playing with the Packers the game was different back then and farm okay he can drive you crazy because he can give me a six touchdowns in six picks but\nMan what he did how did it where he did it I think he's under rated I Do ...\nStill if I gave you Rogers versus far when it's all said and done who is the greater quarterback\nOr they have one Super Bowl ring farmers got more than BP's right Omar yeah well but Rogers is what thirty for\nUm [noise] I Would take Rogers because I feel more confident with him that he won't make a mistake whereas it feels like far I I was told this by an assistant coach who said former assistant coach now said Brett got bored\nLike he'd love degree of difficulty and it feels like Rogers is a little bit like\nThat like God I got that yeah I could hit him an ant\nFarm look for a he's a double coverage with Dr triple coverage no or throwing a double coverage ...\nFarmers are pro bowler and Ninety two and two thousand nine that's how long it for your with [laughter] Ninety two and two thousand ... has a quarterback ever had Seventeen years\nWhere he he was a pro bowler and then the ... first and last time\nI got a check that's got to be the racket ball will check manning could be up there okay\nIf any test ... came on late or something I don't think we're actually ... I don't even know if he did early either\nYeah I don't know Vinnie was a pro bowl quarterback we do love Patrick Boyle homes watching him we loved his arm loves stomp it you know what we love more than anything else we love his voice here's Patrick my homes on well everybody trying to fight to win this guy\nSpeaks volumes and his team and like how much hard termination that we have a that the deep has got up there but a lot of ... kept fighting off its like cat fighting the running backs the receivers everybody's kept fighting we came out with the when\nEverybody kept ... he's a month it doesn't feel like that that that that's a ... voice here is a mobile homes he had a ... a tenet T. Bo tribute and I'm ... talking about that\nA quarterback competitions across our challenge and we play left handed sometimes that's about the the variety of non practicing that uh I did it a couple of times in college but it was to throw it away I I never had thrown at to a receiver so I mean it was it was a cool dealing with the first time I got to win\nBob cat Gulf white or ...\nOr ... he created his own ... voice there [laughter]\nRemember\nKelsey ... he was talking about you know it gets to know how to get that voice you said you know you can't help but laugh a little bit yeah see\nI don't want to be above scale\nBut I I'm going to be okay because I always am I don't I don't think that we should uh laughing as what I'm going to close on that I have a deep fear that he may have like a throw the issue and I would hate to that be the case I Know I'm we're being seen I were just cringing about it\nIt's fun to do believe me it's a blast soon I like his voice and seeing that actually does a pretty good imitation but I think we're going to know I don't know what Kelsey Kelsey had\nFun with his voice when we had him on yeah we've talked about we just boy\nJust ... just want to start over and get out and yeah as long as armed I Love his voice what's wrong with Andrew walks voice means you have a problem\nYeah he might have a problem with his throat or something ...\nYeah [laughter] oh oh [laughter]\nI guess I got to stop making fun of Lou Holtz to now man apparently\nYeah yeah\nUh I'm going to set the over under for touchdown passes\nFor the season for Patrick my homes at thirty three and a [noise]\n\nI think the obvious as the over\nGoing to have to I'm after ratcheted up nurse ratchet just thirty five thirty five and a half to ... make love and says over\nThey just kind of ran the ball in the last like those could have been touched down yeah how about this over a hundred K. Kurt Warner and his first year as a starter which is\nThe cop with ... homes forty one touchdown passes does he take down Warner no I'm going to say no\nEars up I got out of the day ... bears out why would take Roger sober far but I I just I think when you talk about foreign style\nAh you know there are ... there was something unique about his style\nThat that it almost it was old school style and I think that's what people love about while homes is he just\nHe but he ... he has told an interception yet that you know part of the amazing uh aspect of what we've seen so far with him and last night with that Dr no granted case Cain um doesn't overthrow dumb areas Thomas or marriage Thomas doesn't stop on his route then we're talking about Denver picking up a big win and Patrick my home's not playing great\nBut he did have that drive and they got the wind and they stay undefeated in Jacksonville I like how people go yeah been Jacksonville is committed down next week like it's like okay well\nGot to face them all so we'll see how it goes against that Jacksonville defense will take a break ... page was there last night in Denver will talk to the Denver columnist and around the horn star what he saw and also does he think that there's bigger problems on the horizon with the Broncos didn't why can't John Elway find his quarterback\nOr will also dive into the baseball postseason the Steelers situation and Kate okay Lynn brewers fan stops by Eighteen after the hour damn Patrick show\n[noise]\n\nBehind every great team is a great leader and the best leaders never stop learning however\nLess than twenty percent of organizations say they're very effective at developing leaders for all managers supervisors in business owners I have a great suggestion on how you can help your team this year don't miss the refreshed leadership ... event on Wednesday October twenty fourth it's hosted by expression employment professionals\nRegistered today refresh leadership dot com ... so recharge your leadership skills to inspire and motivate and encourage your team\nYou can hear from the former secretary state General Colin Powell he shared strategies for taking charge during challenging times learn how the former president of Adidas North America more king encourages creativity incompetent with big dreams vision and energy\nAnd pair Olympian Josh Sundquist will bring as high energy blend of humor and motivation to inspire audiences to do one more thing one more time go to refresh leadership dot com slash same old cast you don't want to miss it\nA veteran quarterback who had a great year last year with the ... that it would do was make\nA significant difference in really K. scare my plate of good games so far in\nThe first four they're lucky actually\nGiven everything that their children to at this point that could last of the writers so and they were behind and ... an open a game to the sea hawks and the fourth quarter so uh I guess if you were to go back in ... now look at the production of ... of those four quarterbacks were their\nBecker Mayfield was they they they saw him play like fifty different times and the coach do men in the super bowl and they really wanted wanted him but I think there was fear about a six foot quarterback and whether he was another Johnny Manziel they ended up getting a six foot quarterback in\nIn case you know uh the uh first glance in person I'm guessing that Patrick moms what'd you think\n[noise] I haven't seen anybody throw a wobbly left handed passed since ...\n[laughter] but\nHe's he's as advertised or I should play\nTo earlier times on TV but certainly berserk [noise] he's very mature and I think he has all the ingredients are to me with the Taliban he's surrounded by the Broncos did their best to put pressure on him and they didn't believe global they've all died so I I\nThink that you know the the debate continues between my homes and an al ... is entered into the conversation in regard to know who's the best of the younger quarterbacks cause one been here for a while but I I think I'm homes\nIs ... was worth what Kansas City did last year to get it and this is a quarterback that guy was telling me or on the elder yesterday said Lou Donaldson and I looked at it but it's always said to\nLarry ... and I said what do you mean you said that's the last time we better quarterback and I said said look what it needs to add ... who said look I bet it's last time the Chicago Bears that are going [laughter]\nLenny ... yeah I'm trying to think who else Kansas City ... Smith I think was a better than average quarterback um like just while\nHe was talking about somebody they develop from the very beginning ... okay\nYou know as you remember Joe Montana had a nice ... I remember him beating John Elway in a\nMonday Night game here so they had Montana for a while but other than that\nThey've had such a string ... they're like Cleveland Browns they had a they had not had a a drafted quarterback for like twenty something years I think so that's what they're talking about the pay the last time they had a quarterback was uh in ... that took 'em to the Superbowl\nHe's page to arm around the horn a Denver economists joining us Dan Patrick show I'm curious if you've ever done this when he I asked Dan shown to see about this if you've ever published\nColumns that you wrote during the game and then all of a sudden you had like a different ending but what you would have written what you were writing at the time if you if you release that column what would it have said have you ever gone back and looked at that where all of a sudden you go I got to change the entire column that I just wrote\nOh I I Would guess probably thirty times during the NBA playoffs World Series but I'll tell you the best\nAnd the worst was uh the Dodgers played in in Denver no Nineteen Ninety five Ninety seven something like that and the game was delayed because of rain and didn't start 'til about eight thirty and I wrote a column saying the Dodgers were not were not any good\nTerrible team not good pitching just\nHad no chance of winning the world series and I wrote that about the sixth inning a guy name Milo was pitching a no hitter and somebody said well maybe you need to rethink that column and I said well there's no way anybody ever going to pitch\nA no hitter in Denver, Colorado it just all happen all the games were sixteen to forty and he went on to control the middle hitter and so I was writing the column that I called the newspaper and I said well I got a new column on the no hitter and they said uh are deadlines past the papers of be printed\nAnd it was the only time in my life that I prayed for a blizzard\nOf essentially [laughter] and I got so many responses that was really in many bursts of theater dead but I got somebody phone calls the gym or the system in Denver and saying you know at least you could have said that uh even though the\nPaintings bad for the Dodgers Pitt says no interest [laughter] yes\nIt is it's a rare but it's one of those times when you want to give the cargo rather try picked up by every newspaper in Denver\nOr how how do you feel about the rock has the Rockies mindset because he used to be that slug fest softball like scores there or why don't we why don't we had that flow of often like we once had in Colorado\nBut the humid or really changed to who I think not only Denver but uh I Know the diamond backs have have installed a humid or because of a\nSecond highest elevation right then and nobody talks about the Arizona Diamondbacks and their stats but we always talk about the Rockies\nWell as they ever has to use that word again but I started the fourth quarter last night that the Broncos have a a a video they play about\nA showing Aspen and the mountains and one mile above sea level and there's no other team and and football has that and there was a great moment where they show one of the Kansas City chiefs on the sideline\nSucking up oxygen and\nBecause of the out to not talk to\nA number of former major league pitchers it it it it's not so much uh\nThe height but the lack of humidity here day and and you can't get a good grip on the ball and obviously in the in the air and it's been proven scientifically I Know that doesn't doesn't ring true with a lot of people would do much but the altitude does\nAnd the climate here does change or the flight of the ball in so dads who can break off a grade curve ball at sea level can do it at\nAt altitude and so everything comes in flat and is said one one of the story you never can get a\nGood feel on the baseball because it's so dry and humid or kind of change that but I think what changed more is that a and I'll give you a prime example tile Friedland should be and the ... conversation and nobody really talked to him\nTalk about it until late and he's one Seventeen games Cal freely grew up in altitude\nAnd maybe their mistake has been not\nDrafted [laughter] who grew up in Colorado\nOr in other nearby states because he didn't care I mean he's told me he doesn't care about the altitude you said it's always been this way but they have drafted and and signed as an drafted free agents from Latino countries uh\nPitchers who don't care about the attitude attitudes or the attitude here and they also are\nFor the first time rather than getting washed up pictures from other clubs because as you will do\nMost veteran pictures want no part of pitching Colorado either as a team or certainly not as a home team and so I think the mindset change the philosophy change when they started just drafting pitcher after pitcher who they thought could pitch keep the ball down ... to\n... have you ever come close to wanting to punch somebody on around them weren't\nEven though you're not together but if if you were to gather who who would have got popped\nO. J. Mary ... [laughter]\nAnd it was not for anything he said but [laughter] I don't know what I can say this with the radio but how is the funniest story behind the scenes story around the horn was I always called it Richard and he would call ESPN executives every day\nEvery day she called them and ... and Jim Cohen who is now with the NFL Network was a good friend of mine is vice president and he finally called me and he said a ... complains that you can't get his name right ... keep calling and Richard that's the well I Can't call and\nDig [laughter] [laughter]\n\nI Swear it was true story at is that why you do that and I said of course it is [laughter] so he said you can't do that anymore at least in rural that I couldn't colleague Richard anymore so the next day I called him Jim and\nJim Cohen called me said why are you [laughter] call they marry out Egypt out and I said because your day\n[laughter]\nI Hope reality gives you some bonus points for this you\nKnow he he he does like my old time references yesterday I you know there are ... are a Ryder Cup\nTeam was so bad but then we haven't won anything in France since you're before I was born in reality is that what happened Mitt and then\nI said from work to [laughter] you one that she does but yeah I mean it just puts up with me today that it was a big\nDay in Denver a Rockies and the Broncos needed to win because I'd already one\nAnd some guy wrote me and said what did you when he was ... really read [noise] uh go into any member I\nScam\nCan look\n\nA long ago to swim in a sea of blankets yes calling my home and says disgust inspiring nicknames who for em homes had his favorite nickname is Showtime 'cause he heard it since he was younger\nOkay nothing about ... wonder boy my home's came up with nothing but I think Mario just maybe marriage just like the song\nYeah that's all play of the day brought you buy discover card they believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why they think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving them a try discover all give new card members one year anniversary gift will never forget\nAt the end of your first year the match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar ... tried\nBelieve it at discover dot com slash match [noise]\nAll right I'm a still a little unsettled by with John their bodies to wonder\nHow do you mean that if I song is written about yeah getting out of all the songs that can be written about you was pretty good\nIs that uh that's supposed to be a what's her name uh Jennifer ...\nYeah right yeah it's pretty good tribute song there yeah that's pretty strong trying to think because you have songs that have been written obviously about women\nA\nDeal yet clapped in with a dark and the dominoes with bell bottom blues when he was writing about is that Patty Boyd Patty Boyd was also married to George Harrison and uh I think she had she Patti Boyd had a few songs written about or by George Harrison and Eric Clapton\nI don't know if there's anybody else that you think of like is there a better tribute song then what John mayor just do it you know for\nMost states his mom's got going on [laughter] on the outskirts in it yeah you mean a song about an actual person who Stacey you are just talking about like a real person to Layla yeah he was a law that was uh the\nUh George Harrison that was another one about Patty Boyd\nYeah right yeah clapped in in in Harrison and I think Harrison might have played on Layla and he and clapped and we're both seeing the same woman yes\n... if you start if you already mentioned is you're so vain is about\nWell let's Carly Simon but she's talking about we think Warren Beatty so I ... well could have been either way probably the same person I have a huge problem with that song\nBecause she is criticizing saying you're so vain you probably think this song is about you but the song was about him so that means he's not mean he's just perceptive [noise] he's like yeah what what do you mean I'm not so vain you didn't write the song about me it is about me that doesn't say anything\nAbout my and as much as I Love Carly Simon I didn't understand that\nProbably think this song is about why don't you but he's\nHe's got a more ... has to think that Carly Simon spend with more men than him and he would assume that it's him\nThat she wrote this about that's a little arrogant arrogant on who's part\nOn Warren bass parts at all whom the song has written about him\nI'm sure she'd been well no she's talking about\nDetails we we went to Saratoga a and your horse naturally one I don't know who else wants to Saratoga whether it's possible she takes a lot of our late ... yes by\nChristie Brinkley ah uptown girl is about ...

around them but I'm not doing it here\nOkay All right I'm just curious I'm just asking questions here to Fritz you ever written a song for your wife\n[noise] I've written poems I'd have to go dig out and find out where they are but I ... I Know I wrote a poem when I\nPropose and uh now your proposal was a poem yes I had the ... I guess I had an overnight a a red eye from LA and I was in JFK and I propose the baggage claim of JFK which I had to do with that because it was a surprise to then get her on a plane for three days to in Miami so we had to do at the airport now and his whole poem planned and\nThe ring and all kinds of stuff when I when I landed the\nPolling Danny I team has obtained the palm I'll redo hickory decreed\nThat analogy [laughter]\nSomething dice clay related she didn't really appreciate kind of ruined them or\nI or would you I Know you've read the poem on there sure if I find it I'll be going\nWell does your wife I'm In\nA she might I ask if she's got an hopefully she tells me she kept in put in a special drawer or something and I know I like to keep memories and ticket stubs and hold on to stuff to look back on\nI ... my wife kept the card that I wrote will you marry me give me your answer when you land because we landed in Newark airport and we landed in different terminals\nBut I I gave my sister the engagement ring to give to the flight attendant who'd been presented to my wife as she was taking off we were we were both leaving Cincinnati we got in on different flights and we're leaving on different flights I decided to go back to work at the time and I\nI just so they gave her the engagement ring and it said on the card will you marry me let me know your answer when you land and then I ran over to where her terminal was and she kept that car I didn't know she kept that card and that's you know over Thirty years later\nAnd she uh the first time I saw it was a on our thirtieth anniversary in ...\nAnd that's a good death love that that's not slow yeah that's when her father kiss me on the lips\nWhich means you're in the family now well it's an Italian family I did not know what it meant but it turned out that he was gone left and I thought he was going right and then we kissed each other on the mountain\nSo that wasn't plant and for years he fought but that's that I wanted to do that or is it like it was on me [laughter] and I went no I thought that this was some tradition I didn't understand that I thought I was in trouble might be swimming with the fish is there a lead in Milwaukee joins is highly what do you have for me to\nStart a long time oh way back to Bob and Brian oh great go over\nAnd sleep numbers fifty five [noise] ah I just want to say that a bronco fan for a lot of years and they got a job last night I not only the the clock call but the third down a key completion for first down\nA law homes was clearly over the line of scrimmage a they replayed it wants and just made a small comment but never followed up on it and just by watching it you could tell he was he was on the line [laughter] ah but my my ... my main point is there seem to be a lot of picked up flags this year through out the\nAh these guys are I don't I don't know if these reps are afraid of making a bad call it'd be ridiculed uh in the press or or just what it is\nI think what is happening a league and thanks for the phone call is that officials are airing to the side of calling a penalty like they call it and then you can pick it up call it and can be overturned instead of not calling something that feels like this is what's happening as we speak I'm In probably at the commissioner's office\nThat the players association is asking for clarification on these rules there were there was a play last night with cream hunt when he used his helmet as a weapon\nLowered his helmet and no flag there if that's a defensive player you know who knows it's targeting and gonna get fined or suspended or objected but the the players association is asking for clarification on all these rules because they don't feel like\nThe NFL and the officials\nFully explained what they were going to call when when they were talking about this in the pre season the one thing we focused on was the helmet and using your helmet offensively or defensively they want to get rid of that and get it out of the game\nBut these you know in the grass with the quarterback and your weight and those kinds of things\nThat's where they want clarification on this and from what I'm told\nYou know they want the NFL to further explain to the players exactly what they're calling how they're calling it why they're calling it so then the players can understand this as we move forward but uh you know after four weeks after a month you know we're trying to ... they're still trying to figure out what are you calling\nAnd why is that a penalty or not a penalty\nI um I just got this from a disc nine one one guy police shuttling debate can be claimed to be a fan\nOf an NFL team or a baseball team without knowing at least\nFive current and active players all parties agree your verdict is final can you beat well fridge she is a fan of the Astros you could buy the eighty six asked you know that uh you know you you can't be a fan if you don't know current players\nIf if you're a fan of a certain team or era of of your your franchise than it is one thing but if you're going to say you're a fan of a base board NFL team and you can't name by current players\nNo no I don't think you can squeeze that one but you don't see why it's by the number I have no idea this was what a just nine one one guy and maybe that's over fifty percent of the starting lineup\n... well not in the NFL no in baseball yeah five current players yeah I don't think you could be a fool true fan there\nAnybody disagree here\nSeems reasonable man could do it I think baseball's the one in this room that will be if you know maybe not for everybody I mean she knows five Red Sox won ... a Yankee fan yeah right [laughter]\nOnly getting any more than five cubs stir fried seem might be able to name five Astros and loving you can can you name five Philadelphia Phillies\nProbably yeah right [laughter]\nCharlie Charlie Hayes is a virus or a ... you know not liking it but\nI Will take a break we'll talk some baseball Ron Darling on loan from TBS are coming up next dark ... brewer fan I Know he can name the entire starting lineup for\nThe

know one of those guys that says the best ever because I think baseball has so many different\nPeriods and generations of the sport we've seen it all from a from dead ball era to steroids to I mean it's really hard to judge when I think uh\nYou know the greatest pitchers ever I you know I couldn't Clemens is on that list I think ... on the list I think called facts despite um you know the limited a career that he had the cause of elbow injuries on that list I mean there's there's so many to me it's hard to\nPut the distinguishing him from you know the half dozen or other great ones\nBecause you look at post season success and you know somebody like Curt shilling was brilliant in the postseason um Whitey Ford great John ... grade\nJak more jobs great like there are certain guys that this the moment they'd be they'd makes it the kind of overshadows maybe what they didn't do during the regular season but if I said I got one game to win and you can handle ball to anybody\nWho's that guy\nRight now yeah um I Would hand the ball to Justin Porter lander um I think he is\nThe John ... of his generation I think he not only um gets it done during the regular season but in the postseason he takes it up another notch we saw last year and things that they had the when he was on the mount a I just think that um what what he's done\nUm the is it's amazing to me because if we talk about we just were talking about ... and ... you know his philosophy has come back to the pack a little\nI mean why wouldn't it be with all the endings and starts that he's had but for the ... other than that small stretch of about two and a half three seasons\nWhere ... was a five hundred pitcher and trying to figure it out you know he'll come back and unlike\nMost scriptures uh like cc ... for you or someone else you know have to regroup and rebuild your game he is at the same level he was a\nHe's when he was an ... an aside in two thousand eleven so um I I think that's the most impressive thing to me is that he is a great country during the regular season\nGreat big you know big game pitcher and he has lost the thing on his uh ability to dominate lineups that is a remarkable\nRun darling major league baseball on TBS analyst the wild card game on TBS tomorrow to be the ... and the Yankees also trying to trouble shoot these or figure out what is hall of fame worthy here in the next\nAnd to Fifteen Years with pictures because of his specialization you know I look at a you know you're looking\nAt ... ... if you've got three ... are you going hall of famer Cory ... with a couple of ... or ... you know like what is going to constitute a hall of fame career as a starting pitcher since you might not have too many guys who were getting two hundred and wins in their careers\nYeah then you make a great point uh I think that it's going to completely change I think also you know with the younger uh I'm a voting a people that vote younger voters um you know analytics come into play I think there's going to be able to ... different change\nAnd then we we think about the science and the national league this year you know you're going to have a guy that one was nine time damn games games uh ten games and Jacob the ground probably one of I think we're at a confluence\nRight now where voters are are coming off some of the numbers that you and I grew up with three thousand hits five on home runs three hundred wins automatic into a baseball hall of fame that's going to completely change I think a\nWinning percentage run prevention or those kinds of things are going to be big before I'm starting pitchers moving forward awards of course like you said I'm ... I think with three young says an automatic yeah\nI um I don't care where he finished his career crushed Shaw I'm less than two hundred wins heat automatically goes and if he did not pitch a game and two thousand and Nineteen and beyond so um those magical\nKind of mark so I think of all ready been um shut down with Pedro Martinez getting in you know um I I think the the the\nBig huge when numbers the big huge home run numbers of those don't matter as much as bill you know the or and and ah he already plots and at the ability to uh prevent runs\nWas there ever a guy that scared you when he came to the plate when he pitched\nThe [laughter] that's pretty funny yeah uh there's one guy was a great question I'm a wider when I was ... you know you want to say that he\nNever really were afraid of any one that\nCame in the box or whatever but jak Clark and his heyday and his viciousness of swing [noise] um I always say in today's game you know Sean Carlos Stanton who seems like you can hit the ball you know those\nCable priest or we were a kid the shortstop dumped port going over the fan I'm a ... Clark was what like a\nI mean because of the viciousness of the ... when he was the only guy that I Would throw a pitch to and then I Would lose the ball in his swing so sometimes I wasn't you know if you make contact I didn't know where it was going off the bat which is very unusual and a ... at times it is as scared the bejesus out of me how\nTo tell you the truth and um but he is the one guy in the box you took up the whole box of as Paul ... near the lake and ah you know all he was trying to do is hit a ball six hundred feet off ya and um yeah so he's he's the guy or they could admit it\nBut if I if I'm being honest I didn't like to see him come into play\nCould you could you tell by the sound if it if you were given up a home run as soon as it left about\nYeah yeah yeah oh it's so funny that early in your career you know you're ... you know you're such a rule\nThat as soon as you throw it in there and the\nHitter makes great contract he kind of know it's a home run but you're just hoping with all that the ball stays in the ballpark and uh after about my third or fourth season I stopped looking\nBecause as soon as I Do the hitter um had hit it\nSo they knew it was out of the ballpark so it's called for another ...\nFrom the umpires but uh I I I I had a no hitter\nSeven six sending seven innings sorry and uh but the last out in the sixth inning in Philadelphia I'm I threw a pitch a\nTo Lance perished or capture and he had a ball strayed over my head I mean Gary cardio used to catch me in those days whenever I Would give up a home run he would have to stand up and then he would hang on his head and look\nDown and uh and so as soon as you get it\nSince I had a no hitter going I looked at as a kid and he stood up and put his head down and I was like how hard just stand at the no hitter so I look behind me to see what up all was going 'cause I was going to be the first hit and look you Wilson and centerfield caught it right before the fence and looked at me and he pointed\nI Gotcha and it was simple in around a you know if that the U.S he says\nI talk to Greg Maddox said tell me what the sound what's it sound like when you give up a home run he said two cars crashing\n[laughter] I I I you know I I Would say that it's just the total opposite me that when I gave up home runs it became the relief silent\nLike the the ball hitting the Baptists definitely sound of course but to me everything went like matrix silent like whatever reason as soon as I threw it\nAnd I knew it wasn't a good pitch and I could see the contract and the battery is going to get the ball on ... and you know all that stuff you know that it's a bad patch it's going to go along with all that it just became like silent\nFor me I got I got jak Clarkson won you nine Ninety five three homers\nYeah well that sounds right\nBut you know Rocky Mountain time I do\nWell or less than a as hitters in pictures will tell you you can only remember a kind of bad stuff you don't know if you're a member of you know you know um\nI I face so I think the founders x-ray so most of my career with Tim rains around Sandberg and I think I did well against them but I don't remember doing well against them I don't remember every single at that being a you know these guys were such game changer so\nMaybe because they were so good and maybe because their faces so well I'm you know there may be a better picture\nA good to talk to you running have fun with the Asian Yankees will be watching we appreciate your time as always\nThanks for the everything down to take her\nRun darling ... will be on TV as soon as I was covering ms mentioned eighty six when darling was there so I started covering them I think it was eighty four eighty five eighty six eighty seven maybe a little bit of eighty eight point went to the mother ship but a a darling was uh he he was always he went to jail\nYou know that they would always say and wrongdoing and he went to you and you sort of like Ryan pitch Patrick ...

Joe\nCommittee you know they think that they're probably gonna have they're going to be a little more lenient when it comes to these deep into players but I agree I'd be going for a strip check every time I Do ... to show you had the two best past Russia is in the game edge pass Russia's and what is their philosophy\nGo for the ball stripped shock and you've seen that with clue Mac every game so far he's had a strip Chuck\nI'm going to guess and usually never pass interference that they were really calling it and then all of a sudden they eased off the accelerator a couple of years ago it feels like that that's what they're going to do but I Do believe they have to start analyzing ... players for using their head as a weapon\nAnd cream hunt last night should have been flag

every night um or or to dinner but uh I think they certainly it would be blocking form and the you know that's the way of life um ah but\nAh I think they could get together and then we wouldn't be a problem\n[noise] a good luck have fun though this weekend around in the coming weeks and we'll talk to you soon I'm sure\nWell maybe I'll do for guys like me is that even though he has come in here is the gift that keeps on giving\nYeah I agree thank you add All right see they\nHad said to shed its Bert ... yeah there's always something going on with Pittsburgh and now you have a month period or a period of months where are you waiting for leaving on bill to come in is he going to be in shape does he have to get in shape\nHow are the Steelers gonna using when they get and what kind of season are you going to have by the time he gets there in among the apple\nCan't you see the story ending like next August with Lebanon bell firing his agent when he doesn't have a big deal off from anybody out there and he ... he just gave up eight million bucks to make a point\nI Wonder if he can make this money up because everybody's going to look at that next contract and and go okay are you going to get that big contract here\nPlus there's no guarantee us guaranteed money and then she hit this new contract whoever gives him this contract and it's going to be based on whose contract girlie contract loving Johnson's contract\nI guess I mean is that he could have girly now he was he's two years older\nUm I don't know about the mileage on him is he sitting out here and he's had suspensions ...\nIsn't the baggage worse though this guy has ... ... for a number of different reasons suspension a holdout a heat I don't think any teams and a clamor to break the bank for and it's just a twenty seven year old running back with issues I don't want to give you a five year\nDeal at twenty seven and you know I give me a three year deal\nBut I I don't ... and he's special he really is and I love watching him go back to Michigan State loved watching it but I just I I cringe a little bit when I think about that that man how much do I want to give you and you want to give that money to somebody who's going to be a leader on your team\nNow the dolphins gave that to a dummy can sue but that was a stupid contract you know Jay Jay ... is considered a leader a bond Miller leader\n... leader I think when you're spending that kind of money I'm asking for a little bit more than just I'm going to pay you some big time money there now the money he's going to get is not going to be comparable to some of those other deep into players that I mentioned in and the quarterbacks and even some of these wide receivers\nBut is he going to be the highest paid running back in ... it was worth it when we look back on it will be worth it for ... beyond bill I think really that's the uh the key here Adam in New York joined ...\nOh man first time caller a six five two sixty [noise]\nI think what the play clock if I'm not mistaken that's unofficial guide to why the head officially on a white had has an official clock that he's supposed to go by even if it goes to zero it's kind of like one second left\nSide I Know that's how they do it I ... for younger kids up here\nAnd I scream and yell at the the special time it's a play classical and he's like that's not the official clock I as a special time so maybe that's why him of his hero in a play golf I mean isn't it I mean he has one job to watch the quarterback and it was time clock can't do both\nKnow why ... why do you have the clock the clock on the field is not the official clock is that what you're saying\nYeah I don't think I I think it's a Fisher clock I knowing\nWhere week where I coach that's not the official clock the official at the plate that 'cause they don't trust the guy\nUp in the booth to keep the time or get it when I set the ball around the clock to start to play so that had official ... a play called clock on himself like he tells it almost like a the ten second call and basketball the guy just walk in there and how it all one second to second and it could be twenty four seconds Santa shock\nBut it's still it's not his ten seconds that what he's what he's ...\nYou know I don't know maybe we can get that you know get a thank you out of maybe we can get a hold of somebody with that but you had that play clock that that does help these teams but if it's not official\nSo what we saw last night on the field that that's not an official ... have you heard that before making woman I certainly have not that's crazy why wouldn't you have something that was the official like I don't I don't understand why it's not official I mean does it go from thirty down to zero\nIt's funny the play cock eyed ... seconds the officials jump in and crack to play cop clock all the time ... um but they don't usually come in and correct the thirty second car\nYeah I ... I've heard that the rest of the time on the field but that I thought was like the overall time not the between place\nBut that doesn't seem like it's that difficult ... to be able to just see you hit the reset and then you start the clock and that's it and why that wouldn't be official how about the person who's making an official why can't they also make it official on the field as well I confused\nBy the way Muslims might a complete the same pass five yards back in ... he was tearing them up at that point you might have\nBut but it it's just another example where we're looking at officiating and this year it just seems like you know these games are permeated by some shaky calls I thought Oakland and Cleveland there were bad calls on both sides\nYou know the Derek car fumble I mean come on like that quickly and you didn't see the ball out well the play didn't even look like it was stopped and then you're going to whistle it like that to me I I didn't get that yeah I'm a glum\nHis other social media and slow and how much we see I mean there must have been bad calls in the seventies eighties and nineties but we couldn't chew 'em up as much for the replay\nYeah social media is absolutely because it's real time and then people have an opinion and then whether it's true or not you've already stated your opinion and then people react to that and you know we're finding that out with these you know that does\nFirst down spot with the browns game when I saw it I said oh it's a first down and then when I looked at it again\nI was thinking is there enough evidence now that's not the official first down a marker either\nBut you know what we're led to believe that it that the you know hey that's where you have to get to for a first down\nAnd then when you don't get there and then all of a sudden or you do get there and they go no you didn't you were a couple of inches shorter like can we get that straight you know are we asking too much the clock is going to be official in the yellow marker is going to be official can't we do then\nI Will take a break last call for phone calls a day to pull results what we learn what's in store tomorrow we'll do all of that
