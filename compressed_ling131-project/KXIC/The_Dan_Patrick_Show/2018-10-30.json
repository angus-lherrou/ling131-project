Neal Sean and all your favorite artists\nBoth playing I harbor tunnel far from her home for one of my family ... calling from\nBrooklyn seven Seventy is from long grades in those day to day tab that keep you from being able to listen to Dan Patrick twenty four\nI Do think I find like in Raleigh I don't want Cleveland even though I have Baker Mayfield my former quarterback I Would hold out for Dallas if I thought Dallas who's going to be open and I had a better chance to succeed there\nYeah I'm a club Dallas they're very patient you know they haven't fired Jason Garrett that might be attractive to the next ... but just as a coach if you're looking at a job you're saying well I'm going to get a chance here you know and you have a lot of resources that GM problem that's a problem that you brought up\nFeels like you're just treading water they're like you're not you're not allowed to get out of the pool and maybe go off the high dive a little bit have some fun do a cannonball in Dallas like you're just you're in the water\nHere in the coaching water but you're not you know you gotta floating on and you're not going anywhere and I think\nThat would be the biggest concern I Would have there is Jerry Jerry is coaching this team in in his mind he's coaching and the GM as well I ... I don't want that because you know what in the last Twenty years\nHe's been the problem and you can't go in there and say All right I got a ... device on his on the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys manage great might be a dream job but uh it wouldn't be a dream job for me right now\nNot given the you know the owners if an owner stays out of the way and I really feel like the successful programs franchises the owners stays otherwise stays on the way in Pittsburgh stays out of the way with the New York giants are stays out of the way with the patriots for the most part for the most part I think\nI think Robert crafts gotten more involved because he felt like he had to be maybe the mediator he had to play the role Henry Kissinger here between Brady and below check\nBut for the most part and you let people do their job I liked to Jimmy ... the owner of the brown said you know I I guess I'll take the blame for what's happened here well that's been have you ... you brought in Hugh Jackson you kept you why why did you keep you Jackson in the first place\nYou're you're finally competitive in it feels like there was a little bit of momentum and you bring in taught Haley look as an outsider like me says man I Would this isn't gonna work\nIt's just not going to work with these personalities 'cause Todd Haley probably feels like I Know more football than you do I want to be the head coach who Jackson probably says you know what ... ... I'm Still the head coach listen to me the dysfunction going on in there and you're bringing back a guy who did not prove himself to be a head coach\nAnd then you're going to go yeah you know what let me give them another year you know maybe he wins a two or three games this year it's still no reason to have him back but if you're if you're going to bring in if you're going to draft a quarterback and put all your eggs in that basket\nThat you must bring in people who will make him better and to people who are going to get along with each other\nHow did you think that that was going to work out if I tell you in the pre season I don't see this working out you should do that too but we'll check in with a brown ...\nUh what's the question the glove and we're going to go it can we put that one up just for fun we have a lot of ... I ...\nI don't want to make Dallas open broke out now because that's not fair to Jason Garrett Cleveland's open um you know so if you do something Cleveland wise\nOkay how about it I mean question about quarterbacks about high tech quarterback\nIs this the James when simple question to James Winston but it's not just Seamus twins and he's not the only guy who's struggling in that position\nYeah I Know but he's going to be ... that's another quandary conundrum if you're Dirk cutter and you probably won't be back next year\nCan Ryan Fitzpatrick playing him keep your job James ... only twenty four are you worried James which didn't might play well enough that he keeps the job or orange the job and then you have to sign him up for next year\nWhich is that so weird because Tampa's good Tampa can be good\nI just think you don't have consistent played the quarterback position you know cause fitzpatrick can be unbelievable and then he controlled for picks Winston has shown signs up but he's just not the leader I think he's got talent obviously but at twenty four can you give up on twenty four\n\nAnd you have a head coach he was saying you know I ... I went to when I\nGot to win because if I don't you're not going to be there next year and there's a chance you still not there next year yeah boiling\nJamieson Winston has Seventy turnovers in forty eight members that are the averages that turnover and a half a game you know that's that's double what ... almost double what's expected\nYeah and that's good [noise] not good at on\nNBC Sunday night all eyes will be an Fox broom you got Aaron Rodgers against Tom Brady football night America at seven eastern kick off at eight twenty Sunday Night Football only on NBC and still drama with the Packers high Montgomery explains why he didn't take me I'm\nNot buying it and not buying it but\nYou know he he ... and you don't want was sad about this you know there are people had threats against his family like come on\nYou know he made a bad mistake he made a football mistake but let's not even you know this whole I'm going to threaten you we we've seen where threats have gone here recently in America let's let's not be doing that you might not be happy with time Montgomery with what he did but come on let's be smart about this\n\nMagic you could go to prison for something stupid like this they track you down you go to prison because you're going to threaten time Montgomery or his family because he didn't take me you're better than that you should be better than that you know ...\nIf your time on camera and you're asked by the media did you decide to obey the coaches what'd you say yes I'm Sorry I shouldn't have or would you cover it with well I kinda thought I was at the goal line and it was okay\nShe would you play time Montgomery this was his excuse as to why he didn't take in the in the end zone\nOr Iran's on our entire though [laughter] that was like\nOh why oh\nDon't you want to be retired\nAnd he kicked the return of oh\nSecond decision on I don't know if they're\nAs\nAs having a conversation with us when it off\nAnd I got you know what I\nWhat I Do or not the kind of an eye on the kind of person I Am\nOkay you made a mistake ... at first of all ... any any kick return it will tell you that once the ball is in the air and you start to see okay where am I running\nAnd it looked like he had no path of all you know this is the set up it ... it it almost felt like the return team route you know realize we're not going to be running it back then all of a sudden somebody says you know they may have a code word of you know he's taken it out\nBut there wasn't any path bare there wasn't any hey we're going to go up the middle here\nI mean maybe that's what he thought but\nOh you have to do is take you know four steps back in the ... instead of being right at the end zone or right and you know one foot in the ...\nBecause then it allows you hit the ball is not going to make it to the ... then you have to bring it out but it he didn't he didn't allow him self that option here\nUm and if the coach says do not bring it out and plus you know what when he says if I didn't fumble then we wouldn't be talking about it you still wasted time on the return\nBecause if you do let it you know have you you have a touch back roads you go to the twenty five in no time off the clock so it is a mistake any compounded the mistake you know ...\nAnd what else have you worked in Montgomery ... he was seen on the sideline I guess pouting and he threw his helmet 'cause he was taken out of the game a little earlier didn't like that he wasn't being used and then all of a sudden he goes out there and he tries to a tries to be here when we saw when\nI was so bad look it's a bad look all around and he made a mistake I'm you know Paul he said do you get rid of him I said I think he's too talented to get rid of but I don't know we'll see what happens here with the trade deadline\nI don't I Will take a break we'll check in with the Cleveland Browns what is next and is this a desirable job\nWill talk to a a browns reporter coming up next also a bill living student who covers a Cleveland for the last uh forty fifty years will join us on what's going on with not only the cabs and the browns Reggie Miller a little bit later on in Albert breeder the insider for the M M QB\nDot com he'll join us coming up as well Nineteen after the hour is is the damn Patrick show\nSleep number is Seventy five find your sleep number setting go in ask him about it\nJust said look I listened damned Patrick show and he talks about his sleep number what does that mean and you're going to find out what that mattress firmness means with the sleep number setting a Seventy five they had these sleep number three sixty smart beds they help everyone from parents to pro athletes improve their daily performance through proven quality sleep\nThat's a good question and I think for the browns you know vote to the last three games he had the Steelers game and the chargers game that really were kind of ugly performances\nAnd for this team it's such a young team and while we all know it's been brutal the last couple of years they've shown some signs of life and I think when John Dorsey and Jimmy Andy has them sat down and looked at everything I think they realize that\nA change had to be made and they obviously with both being head coach Hugh Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley I think they felt that the environment that was being created was not the right one for Baker Mayfield who is the franchise or the rest of this young team and so\nYou heard talked yesterday about ... internal discord and I think they just wanted to make sure this is an organization that is functioning I mean I've been there six years I've seen the regime has come and go I've seen in fighting in the past and I think John Dorsey there along with the housing is now they said no more of this we're not having it any more it's time for a change and I will say I think you Jackson\nIn many ways was dealt a very unfair hand at least in his first two years you know where he finished one in thirty one\nAnd I think that that albatross whether it was just or not was too big and too big for the fan base and too big for the team and so when you had that on top of what was going on in the building a with you entirely I think they just said you know what it's enough\nThat the priority number one is developing Baker Mayfield am this young team and we need to put them in the best environment possible going forward\nBut you have these two coaches tickets selfish approach here Hugh Jackson and Haley native I knew the tide Haley was going to be ... not going to work out they had to know inside even though he's agreed on your mind and you're bringing a mandate help bigger Mayfield\nYou also have to have two guys who get a long way when did this relationship get fracture or was it ever relationship\nYou know I think that's a that's a million dollar question Dan and I would say that in this business as you well know being around so many people in the NFL and even if you're a business in broadcasting there are so many egos involved and Hugh Jackson made it to the point that he was the head coach at the Cleveland Browns by being the NFL's assistant coach of the year\nAs an office of coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals back in two thousand Fifteen Todd Haley has presided over the number too often in the NFL for the last six years with the Pittsburgh Steelers so I Would imagine both of those guys would think hey I Know how to do this as well as anybody on the planet and I think that set up\nYou know it was difficult for a few laughs theory it's so much on its head coach who was the opposite corner and he was trying to hand hold the Sean Kaiser who was not ready to play through an entire season and I think this year they thought it would be a good idea to take some things off the plate but you could see I think from the beginning and even on hard knocks it you know this might be a tough\nA tough relationship to have go smoothly unless there's a you know without question success\nAnd I think when things started to go badly and I think the last three weeks we certainly saw the often regress\nA ... and in fact last week you know you go into the middle of the fourth quarter with minus one yards of office and the second half\nAnd the comments he made following the Tampa Bay game where he said he was going to get involved which were born out of frustration I think at that point you knew something had to give in and yesterday being in the building and Maria I I ran into Hugh who I Would consider a friend of mine and you know I I Will solve\nAwful for him but we were on the air doing Cleveland Browns daily at about one o seven when the first report came out about Todd Haley so ... yesterday I was kinda shocked I thought it might be an either or and they're going to clean one person out and try to go for but John Dorsey in the house and said no we've had enough and both guys out yesterday\nHow would try to be this job\nIt shouldn't be very attractive I think that anybody you know who would look at the recent history of the browns and coaches in and say to themselves man this\nYou know it seems like it at a job destined for failure but I think if you take a step back you've got a great football leader now in John Dorsey and you've got a great young roster you think about the most important positions in sports you've got your young quarterback and Baker Mayfield you've got arguably the best young past Russia and the league ... miles Garret who just set a franchise record\nFor the most ... through eight games of the year Denzel award is you're young lockdown corner who was looked great out of Ohio State he's the fourth pick overall you know\nEverywhere you look on the team at first and second tier players very few guys even into their fifth or sixth season season so you have a young roster with a lot of talent ... David the joke was an ascending player Larry Hogan job is having a great ear for you up front\nChabrel peppers is coming into his own so everywhere you look you have a very talented young roster that is going to be together\nThe nucleus of which will be together for at least three or four more years and you'd obviously like to extend those guys beyond that so I\nDo think it's an attractive job I think they're going to need somebody who can come in and be filled discipline oriented and focused on all the details and really the most important thing I think ultimately you need to bring somebody in here who is the right guy for Baker Mayfield\nI think you would agree we're seeing an absolute shift\nIn the way often says are running the national football league and it started with John McVeigh Andy Reid matinee now in Chicago with Carmichael is doing with Sean Payton down in New Orleans that's the future of the NFL and I think it will be important for the browns to get somebody that can put Baker Mayfield who was an ideal quarterback\nFor that style off it's the end of that kind of a system going forward\nShould be mentioned that Nathan was suspended for how many games where you suspended for\nA that would be eight games to laugh I Will be back on the sidelines for the Cincinnati Bengals game following Thanksgiving and for that I Will in fact to be thankful\nAnd you were suspended because\nI questioned the veracity of a call on the sidelines and I would say this I let my passion for this team and you know it's been very hard and you know of a passionate person Dan I let my passion for the team get the best of my judgment and and now I Am not doing the time for the crime\nWhat can't pay the dues flag you white ... who's Hispanic\nThat would've been worse I think if I had gotten flack I'd say that might have been a heck of a lot worse\nAnd who suspended you the NFL\nBut Brown's the brown\nOh oh okay do you think the NFL told told the browns to suspend you\nI I Am not in any position to\nCommunist [laughter] I don't want you to get in more trouble than we do to talk to you know the\nGreat talking with you guys as well and love the front row gentleman\nToy Nathan the girl who use the sun underway\nNathan are you still there yes okay it's a pedometer for your cat called the catwalk [laughter] you know I'm just\nSuch a dog I Am I'm very allergic to cats I so I Will not support anything and the cat field at might be a brilliant business idea but I mean think of a watchdog ... it makes you feel safe it's going to tell you the time it's gonna make you happy when you look at it I mean think about these things and that's that you got to the triumvirate right there that's the holy grail the trinity\nThank you thank you yeah see I thought he was a little harsh on pig then\nYeah I Know you want to do you want to treat this idea like it's a fire hydrant in to your dog and I just want except that I think I've come up with a brilliant idea\nI can be on one of those shows you know where you you know you're up your products\nRight\nOh man you can get the flex fuel guy to do it you'd be see yeah I can be QBC means who sham while those guys\nAre okay laugh now\nNeal guy\nGot a little too much energy covers the whole house and the stuff\nYou know the most it's a miracle product when he is like the one where he saw the Qunu and a half oh yeah that's my favorite I think that ever happened accidentally saw your canoe and a half this will put it back together what happened in uh I saw my canoeing that'll track oh don't worry no big deal\nYou\nKnow ... now here we go for it she says\nI mean we've got a picture of a watch with a dog on it I guess part of me\nDan I've checked on the website this is a very um\nIt just feels like a hard place as you you need\nSomebody who has command and respect has one and is an off and she'd minded guy\nThat's what you need if you're going to be fair to Baker Mayfield taking them number one overall and you want him to succeed then you have to put somebody in there like Mike McCarthy he would be the guy that I Would look at it and say you're not getting his you know Lincoln Riley\nYou're not getting him from Oklahoma I don't think yes we\nDid a young guy with the ... who's their quarterback which I Believe ... would you want to Sean McVeigh a young guy and said McCarthy who sort of been around ... young guys I Want to young off into coordinator okay that I\nI Want that guy who will you know to see the to the throne and become a head coach but I Want the young ... minded guy with Mike mccarthy I don't know if I can find both as a head coach cause you still have to have the option to coordinate and you know Sean McVeigh by all accounts as the off into coordinated there\nEveryone says get the next Sean regret it that's it yeah every book with\nThat because people didn't know shown McVeigh was going to succeed they're like you're going to hire that can I ask how young is well nobody's saying that any more Dan in Chicago joined just Hi Dan\nHow's it going good sir so we'll do a five ten to ... [noise]\nSo the name out for you guys young guy he was a passing coordinator for the Atlanta us all to the Superbowl Michael Moore is a passive court era down forty niners in San Francisco a young guy that the\nGel well was um you know Baker and if he can get Baker\nOn board take her to try to control the troops who get everyone on board to solve this young guy All right I Want to know what your thoughts were on it\nAll right well if he gets hired I Will give you credit Dan thank you for the phone\nCall here he could have just made that name up\nFor all I Know I'm hearing the floor is a hop around but is it has\nIts he isn't there Matt Lauer Flora who said tightened all kinds of corn air so this must be his brother was going to be legit guys right there on the floor at Central Michigan yeah ... is that what fever or ... or I Would say I thought about central is yeah I'm from Michigan to\nYeah triple [laughter] I watch the whole\nQuestion make love and I put up that top three quarterback yeah nice to be okay oh you want to talk let's how some real MBA here do they have to move back to a three point line it's taking\nOver the leaving home my gun there's just no other there's no other way to even conceivably win accept\nBomb threes how much farther I Can't move it farther almost on the sides of the court because you can't get your feet in there it's a lay up for the warriors okay but what do I do on the side on the side of the court that's got to be a ... unless I widen the court\nI guess maybe you have a longer at the top and shorter on the side yeah it sounds like Mike gundy or something but I just have a party in the vacuum [laughter] yes finally he wouldn't\nExtend the three point line because they would just adjust you remove the three point line if you want to change do you think if you move it\nBack make love and it's like when they say we're gonna tiger proof a golf course we make it longer but then you played into tigers hands by making it longer therefore I Know I took out you know thirty more golfers who couldn't handle the length\nRight All right so that you're right it would help the warriors but people are saying the game actually know exact saying this but at the game [laughter] way to make sure I mean the way it scoring way up\nThey love scoring all of these leagues they they all look at it and go how do we get more often soon here nobody who's tuning in to watch a great defense they're just not nobody's tuning in to watch you know the\nNext in under pat Riley play defense or the pistons you know that they're just not watching that it's all about show me highlights you know this is fun to watch your back and forth itch\nPinball you know the NFL all of it they they just want more often\nBy Lisa Lakers won counter decided well you know what we're not going to worry about that today [laughter] wow I mean come on [noise] wow yeah so you said it's so easy and everybody's doing it the Lakers and do it to shake that [noise]\nBut it's coming up next our we'll check in with a bill living in Cleveland Plain dealer columnist\nI would've thought span of twenty four hours you lose the head coach of the browns and the Cavaliers I'm Terry Frank Conan I don't leave my apartment just stay inside to her and so so ... it's going to join us trade deadline coming up [noise]\nHow did how did you get ready today probably took a shower did you come out your beard dollar shave club has everything you need to look feeling smell your best\nBe intense peppermint flavor of dollar shave clubs toothpaste will leave your mouth feeling refreshed and their beer oil keeps your whiskers nice and soft no matter what you do you can get a dollar shave club start are set for only five dollars after you started to shed product ship at regular price make sure you get yours today a dollar shave club dot com slash Patrick\nThat your starter sat at dollar shave club dot com slash Patrick\nBackyards looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask comb advice on what\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice now how much does it cost home advisors totally free to use plus you can reach customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free what's the website again home advisor dot com or just download the free home advisor at\nThis week's walk\nA rock and roll lovers in Sandy last one he joined me for a trip back to this week and rock and roll history\nLet's start back in Nineteen sixty nine were David Bowie appeared at a Halloween Night at the general Gordon and grapes in England the gig lasted about Fifteen minutes after ... space oddity to everyone's delight and then he tried to do on stage along with a huge book and he sat there and read poems and he was booed off stage\nAlso this week in Nineteen sixty nine Elvis Presley wants to number one on the U.

James happy\nLenny tennis is happening with Freddie Mercury\nThere's you're back\n[noise]\n\nYour morning as being the readings from long grades in those day to day talent that keeps you from being able to listen to Dan Patrick twenty four\nHours\nI don't think that there's any interest in Jamison says this is a unique in that sense and that there is there just isn't there isn't really a team out there that it's up the creek a form of as a quarterback position um unless that's where he considered Denver or the giants\nRight now I don't think either of those teams are out there looking for someone might say with uh I certainly think the ... to be open to moving Jay mess um maybe more so than some of the other big names in the Iraq surge shock jak are geysers system all calls\nUm but I just don't think that they're just sitting out there right now they're going to bring in the end given all the strings attached and and the money that he was making\n... ... the insider for him to be dot com and trying to figure this out of what happens and you know we we have teams even though we don't use the word tanking in the NFL\nOr it it feels like some teams are tanking would would you say that's fair assessment of are the giants tanking a raiders tanking\nWho else do you throw in there that we might yeah we're\nI mean I think the giants and the raiders are fair to say to some degree they are\nJust in that they're being honest with themselves about where their officers are you know part of the reason why does the raiders trade Kobe I'll back afraid of our group or is it yours Jon ... states they're going to be any could earn on a couple of years and so you know he was honest with himself without that\nYou know I asked the question of those guys are still going to be around work any threat and the answer was no the giants hadn't been honest with themselves about the raw sources choir they try to writing barracks overall\nGoing in and and overspend for a less Sacco I think now they are being honest with themselves about they sellers um you know so you are going to the games like indoors Jenkins Atlantic College out there I'm\nOver the next twelve hours or so and I I I think outside of those two I think one of the things that prevents you know say a Tampa or in Arizona\nFrom really you know\nBeing in that category where you say the same thing\nIs that there are there whose jobs are on the line um you know Steve ... is a guy in general I think they're really really good job of the box when he became GM about six or seven years ago I've been in a little bit of a soft lightly um and so you know is he going to be motivated to sell off pieces now\nFace the fact that he might be fighting for his job in the roster half show promise over the\nLast half of the season um you know the other one sample and here I think if you're looking at Tampa rationally say\nMaybe they the salary of the problem is the chase and light and they were caught are fighting for their jobs you know you know I think there are a couple of things that are legitimate light stripping down on the job and the giants have been in that category but there are other teams you looked at you say they're bad they shut the ballet\nWhere there are GM's or approaches are both fighting for their jobs\nAnd so yeah that would make them a little less less motivated to aggressively sell off pieces um again before four o'clock the\nNews lately on bell showing up at four O. one\nI don't know if it'll be for a while but I think it will be soon thereafter I'm you know you ... are getting to the point now where you're going to ask to needs so six inch towards free agency or you know who's going to have to work out some of the details\nOf how has re entry to the program is going to it's going to happen and there's going to be some awkwardness therapist on how the ... the occasion standpoint it probably some of his teammates out\nOver the last two months um yeah but I certainly think\nThe money aside um this is the worst scenario for the lobby on fell now\nYou know the concern for him but missing all this ... ... ... are concerned for him in ... and coming back was put more ... body now that James Connors proven himself you know it stands to reason but as far as going to use the tool ... platoon which will you know at least on paper help him\nOut but he had a free agency um and so you know I think he was walking back and do a good scenario if he can work out some of that awkward desolate celibacy basic coaches\nOr leave you with this already found the browns\nAnd the new head coach who is that Mike mccarthy\nYou know it's not a bad name it really isn't I mean the thing was so circle play put the Packers um and they don't make the playoffs this is\nThis is the point where they made a change go outside if you remember Tom so I got hired no five he kept my Sherman on board for a year and then moved on and and hired by a car if they've got to know first year gym before I go to or if they're now who could do the same sort of thing after this year\nAnd snipers car the will be the kind of higher that was sort of I get sick the circus out of Cleveland which is sort of what they need so\nThat makes sense I'll give you a name to watch it and that's that's that I was fake coach pat Campbell just filed at all that went away I you know I Know like the ... and it's been out there I think that there will be ... I'm from the ground in Lincoln Riley Campbell who northeast Ohio today that might be or a more\nMore realistic game forum a guy who is\nProving it as a good program builder if he can put it in NFL ready staff together I think he could wind up being attacked in large part because she's very very well thought of in the scouting circle that John Dorsey ... [noise]\nWhat else was he up before I had a NFL ... who told me about like he's the next like he would be a guy this awhile ago was when we see maybe Ohio State uh ... yeah okay All right yeah I'm here at night because I Know and they came up\nIf you have urban urban Meyer were to walk away okay I assume you're here to top it all at\nNASA ... Albert thank you I Know you're busy day thanks for joining us\nOr they stand\nA ... I was told that if you have urban Meyer you know they move on or he retires steps down whatever that that would be the guy to keep an eye on ...\nAnd this guy Matt Campbell Scotia Bowling Green mountain union who uh Toledo Rockets your rockets than new now Iowa State you know he took down the theme really that you know\nWhen you guys that they weren't good team you know you did\nYeah I called it now you did you were the first to call them that and I said that that kid I don't even remember the Maine but when I ... in some time in the next three years so whoever all ... states quarterback is he's going to when they're going to leave his name blank on the Heisman 'cause we don't know his name yeah you could just put it in right now right now just give me ...\nAll right I'm going to give you the Heisman right now she\nHad to go to break\nOkay yeah I'm gonna give you the Heisman like we've got to move on you take a break a bill Livingston Cleveland Plain dealer bill is seen it all\nIn Cleveland I don't know if he's seen this where you fire the cabs coach and the browns coach in a span of twenty four hours\nMaybe this is why bill went into retirement semi retirement we'll talk to him coming up Reggie Miller in an hour from now the greatness of clay Thompson and uh does this mean more than ever that the Lakers have to get ...\nHave to get Lakers lost again last night or chicken rake Seventeen apt to be our you're on the damn Patrick show [noise]\nDiscover card we love what they're doing you check things all the time you check your email social media discovers asking you what about ... something as important as your credit score well\nDiscover makes it quick and easy with their credit score card which is free for everyone even if you're not a customer\nYou can see your fight go credit score and other important credit information and then once you know your score you can check to see if your current credit card is the best fit for you learn more at discover dot com slash credit score card limitation supply that's discover dot com slash credit score card good luck [noise]\n[noise]\nOver your friend and I got it yep just a cleaning [noise] haven't been here for six months [noise]\nThey redid the lobby is Hank did go [noise]\nFamous lunar though right [noise]\nFour and a half die happy about that [noise] definitely [noise]\nAnd Seventy eight reviews waiting rooms are\nBoring make them exciting with movies TV a music front page E N T the new Eighteen unlimited in more premium plan gives you over thirty channels of live t._v. and entertainment Boehner's like HBO or Amazon Music unlimited band on limited wireless service at the times you need them most aging into more for your thing that's our thing\nAfter trying to get by ... may be limited to standard definition choice one out on service cotton subject to change restrictions apply to ... dot com slash amid\nThese days you can find just about anything on line but if you're looking to buy a car online shopping often leads to confusion but not anymore\nIntroducing troop price ring true car now you can know exactly what you pay for the car you want including fees and accessories and best of all you'll know if your true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people paid for that same car you want\nRespect former players and Louis Moore contemporaneous than Paul silos his first\nCoach as far as the brown situation or why now\n[noise] [noise] oh it's the by week [noise] um they're not you know I has\nHad been firing in hiring and firing so many guys that have been a revolving door and I I think he wanted to pledge some stability but it just wasn't happening with you I mean you know the browns have always been the most loved by the fans here\nAt sort of escapes me given the last Twenty years of why\nBut you know the Indians had been to a World Series and the Cavs had been to ... four straight finals and won a championship and the browns had had had discovered always the lowest in performance at had discovered the way to go to record lows\nI mean can you imagine a warning a guy with a one in thirty one record I Know keeping his job you know and he was three thirty six and one at a at the time he was finally fire\nBut that's why the inter office politics but why now\nBecause it's the by week Smith season thing that can you know do whatever they whatever magic they think they're going to do with with a\nAnd there's no man you know the rank wherever they well it's the browns you know but I Can't possibly defend keeping this guy with the record he had he never should have been brought that I agree I agree and you already thirty one\nIn ... I think a lot of people notice around the country but on January thirty one of this year it was happy to Jackson day because that's one\nReason why one way in thirty one on food\nYeah there you go Yeah Yup yup yup had his own very day just like Reggie Jackson had a month and baseball\nYeah I'm just trying to ... is this job desirable way which job is more desirable the browns or the cats\n[laughter] you know right now I might say the browns because Baker my field you know I I think Mayfield is going to be a really good player and I haven't really said that about\nMost of the other quarterbacks they've had I did have high hopes for Johnny Manziel and boy that was a that was a swing and miss 'em but you know I I Do think he he's considered to have been a very good\nPick around the league and and you know [noise]\nThey have they have a pretty good defense they they just they you know there was no ... there was no spirit around it was with Hugh and he was a buck passer and all you could get for 'em from him was platitudes and incredibly he threw a\nAs a a crow well under the bus separate ... ran for fifty nine yards and said\nWell anybody you you and I in any of us in the in the media room could could run through that whole and and you know lo que probably could've beat me easily but you know I think\nI could have taken anybody and all that cash their own ...\nBut you know it was it was just stupid to have done that and it really did offended crow well who made nice a nice a couple of weeks later but why would you do that\nYou know he was your best why did they trade high you know I Know they wanted to give ... more carries but ... is a tremendous shortage player why not have both guys I don't understand a lot of stuff they do\nThey have been terrible for Twenty years for a reason and just you know\nWith may feel maybe there's maybe there's some like finally\nYeah hopefully you get in a coach who has the respect and has proven success and you're getting an off into coordinator who is going to be able to get in ... or like Shon ... bay which aired off I I think we were never\nGoing to get a a a you're probably not going to get a head coach here a man Jeannie was one but you know why why would you take this job it's the most forlorn franchise in the league it'll it'll probably be another coordinator and you know hopefully one that uh is on the rise and they can get it done\nWell I don't know maybe I maybe I hold out hope I mentioned that maybe Mike mccarthy and the Packers separate a divorce oil and then he's got a relationship with John John Dorsey and maybe you know get a chance to work with it is one at thirty\nTwo jobs in the NFL now you know I I remember when when the Indians were awful in the in the eighties before or you know before the resident resurrection with the new ballpark a van O'Brian the executive vice presidents that said once this is the last stop before the desert\n... at Brown and are now\nA bill and hope a semi retirement is treating you will and thank you video and in fact I Do for having me as a long time but that's a bill Livingston semi retired man I'd make me want to come back I think\nThirty four years they're writing about Cleveland sports and the Cleveland Plain dealer [noise] but uh\nYou know the cap situation you know you can get one player that can turn things around you can't get one player that turn things around in Cleveland but you have to get one coach who can turn things around big difference there you know you can get a coach in there and Cleveland with the Cavaliers and get a good player a good draft pick and\nMaybe change your fortunes but the browns knee to a respected head coach and they needed you know bright often she'd mind to be able to help her Mayfield because you're doing a disservice to you know your draft\nPhilosophy you're going all in on a quarterback you must surround him it's rare when you see a quarterback who is good bordering on great\nWho doesn't have that around it I think you can draw some question marks there with the the Green Bay Packers with Mike mccarthy that you have Aaron Rodgers are they really taking advantage of Aaron Rodgers challenge and I don't think they are [noise] Aaron in Ohio joins is higher and what do you have for me today\n[noise] and they tell you my call through to forty\nYeah so you mentioned Jon Benet Campbell all those northeast Ohio voice how about another north east ally avoid it used to be the former head coach of Oklahoma bombs too [noise]\nYeah I saw his name floated out there to thank you and I I don't know I can eat it surprised a lot of people in Bob step down because\nYou know Oklahoma you got to build in formula there you're always going to be competing you're always going to be one of the league teams\nBut you know you get burned out maybe he'd come back to coach the rounds I I don't know\nThat you're going to have I think there'll be some surprise names and it may come down to somebody that you don't really know who takes that job eventually but if you bring them back to some kind of prominence any would happen to win\nI mean look at the cubs and the red Sox everybody said the same thing on the lovable losers with the cubs\nNow ... and you look at the red Sox\nYou know is Curt Schilling I remember when Curt Schilling said you know one of the reasons why I went there if you win they'll never forget you your immortalized not that that's why you take a job but somebody's going to somebody about just like the Cavaliers\nThey won a championship somebody who's going to be the coach of the Cleveland Browns in my lifetime who leads them to the super bowl\nGot I have to live a long time now yeah\nBy the rest of their color shelling said they may not invite you the reunion but you'll be immortalized out if you when they made on invite you to throw the first pitch at the twenty eighth team World Series\nIn Ohio joined ...\nId and thanks for taking my call sure um I mean one party\nTime right now I'm\nBeen listening to you every single played soccer ... only take one second ... the way that they moved it field goal extra point packing football I agree with that three point I'm\nJust like all these that we need to make it more challenging and I recommend ... either way than to link and the court\nWell they've talked about that I proposed that a while ago I wondered if they would raise the basket remember when dunks were and thanks for the phone call is a member we were worried about dunks ruining basketball everything was a dunk\nNobody cares about that anymore that's not a big deal anymore now we want to move the three point line an okay you're gonna have to widen the court I Believe or you're just going to say you can shoot a three in the corner but if you want to take it out I still think here helping Golden State\nLike who are the two two of the best long range not just three point shooters it Steph Curry and clay Thompson I mean tray young is going to benefit from that or you won't be penalize\nHow 'bout you remove a three point line then what happens who benefits the most if you don't have a three point\nLakers or the favorites [laughter] the favorites do you think an MBA if there's no three point line tomorrow just hypothetical\nUm [noise] I I I guess I'd have to find the worst shooting three point team\nOr the least shooting three pointing\nI'm guessing Golden State is still going to be very good even without the three point line yes bone\nWho do you think everyone in the most and least three point attempt in a league team team attempts\nYou'll get the most it's not the worse\nThe rockets were always the ones that were up there by the ... you know the warriors aren't even in the top Fifteen of three point attempts per game they're middle of the roads are Eighteen in three point attempt that makes attempts per game but the percentages third best Houston Rockets forty one point two three point in time for game is Boston up there\nNo Boston psych eleven Milwaukee Atlanta in Dallas on the top now ordered it landed would be on their least amount of three point attempts per game\nMemphis they're down there it's Indiana and Cleveland both at twenty two okay\nI saw were Kevin Love might be on for a month with an injured toe\n[noise] that might be one of the best NBA YouTube moments of all time the hawks bench when bird scored sixty hunted with Anna oh and then and then I think a couple of the players got fined by Mike for tele\n... I was in at a car enjoying car and I'm ... and I think they got fined like I don't know if it's five ... five hundred dollars 'cause they were falling off the\nBench went bird shipping do show off balance shots crazy shut birds even talking to the bench saying where do you want me to shoot\n[laughter]\nOh man oh speaking of shooting and then we'll get to make love and it's a big question here\nLuca ... became the third youngest player in league history the score at least thirty points and have eight rebounds to the game the only two players younger than ...\nLeBron James and Kevin Durant decent company they're Mick loving your question about Luca done shit [laughter]\nHow can you be Nineteen years old he plays like a thirty five year old veteran who he plays a dino Raj than his last year when it sounds like he does not look like the youngest player on the court he looks like the oldest player on the court\nHe's a bully east basically like totally developed I'm starting to wonder about these legends ... dominating the Slovenian league when he was twelve how do we know\nI I don't think he was ... well\nHe was he was a female all star and in sixth grade it was that well documented don't but he's a crazy ... do you think he's lying about his age\nI don't think so because I he's got a lot of people and falling for a long time his dad was a pro but he is completely uncharacteristic for an IT early fully developed has an old man game he's really really\nA guy who just think we cut him open and check out of the rings but he has psychiatry be able to tell how old is\nHe scored twenty points a game now you got to be happy every gets caught up\nIn your first step okay that's the big thing what kind of first step but he doesn't have a great first step I always tell people it's one thing to have a great first step I Want to know your last step is because\nTwo of the grapes of all time had an unbelievable last step and that is Jerry West ... when they put that last dribble down and their ability to go from the dribble and get up\nI'm to the quickest that I've ever seen so your first is very important but your last I Believe it's more important because you can catch if I have a great first step that's one thing but if I catch up to you what's your last step like in ... has a great last step\nAnd I know I don't even know if people follow that if scouts look for it but I Do because watch Jerry West Jerry West will ... extra hard it like a ... it'll be a a a he'll bounce it harder and then he'll be going up as the ball is being bound so you're you're catching it going up so it gives you a little bit more uh\nOf an advantage over your depend ... choose to do that as well yeah polling gotcha chip\nIn playing with a older kids at age seven he was playing with eleven year old club team in Slovenia ... that that was the Slovenian national player and a club player and at age eleven he was playing with a fourteen year old junior national team he wasn't eligible to play but he would practice with this team then joined them a year later in each while he's good\nI mentioned Tom Brady who's the best quarterback of all time you know what I'm going to save the ... and I because what shouldn't Tom Brady say and what did he say he was on W. E. ... makes his weekly appearance there and um\n[noise] you know they got the game coming up with the Packers in Aaron Rodgers so I'm sure that that's what the host were leading towards you know what Tom Brady say he's the best quarterback of all time\nUh now what do you say Aaron Rodgers is no I mean they were Rogers isn't the best quarterback of all time he might be the most talented quarterback of all time\nWhat a lot more ... this week about Aaron Rodgers [noise]\nThere's a really tone as they can make all the throws if somebody says who's better who who has more talent Rogers are Brady now who's the better quarterback coach who has more talent Aaron Rodgers or John Brady I'll hang up and listen Reggie Miller we're also joined us on the greatness of play Thompson that's coming up final hour here came Patrick show\nIf your car shopping you probably heard terms like MS our pie and voiceless price or dealer price but you know what they mean it's enough to confuse anybody but not anymore introducing troop price from true car it's a price it actually means something\nBecause it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including fees and accessories so no hidden fees\nBest of all you'll know if you're a true car price is competitive because true court shows you\nWhat other people pay for the same color you want is a true corn enjoy more confident car buying experience\nHose and I know you start with low because at Lowes pro se big on the supplies they use most right now\nSave even more often select concrete mix now thirty percent off when you buy in bulk plus save five percent on eligible purchases every day when you use your lows business credit account stopped by or visit most for ... dot com for detail so pro now that you know start with low minimum\nPurchase from ... credit offer subject credit approval Catholic mind that Democrat it offers losing fly us all night [noise]\n\nABC extending the first season of the Roseanne fit honors the network or during another episode it's any theories bringing it to eleven subtle episode falling the counters for me or the show last afford reviewers by the second episode\nThe twenty Eighteen Roseanne rebuild was cancelled they may after show start Roseanne Barr sent data racist tweets I think I think too much Kanye West encouraging black voters to leave the Democratic party the rapper ... hats and shirts that support the legs that short for black exit [noise]\nSlowly car Daschle and daughter truth Thompson already getting some stance in her passport to six months old joining the reality star\nAnd her sister Courtney car Daschle in on a trip to Bali clearly car Daschle and sharing photos from the trip on Instagram including one of the baby on an airplane true Thompson is car dashing first child with NBA players Tristan Thompson though no one\nFifty continuing he's paid with fellow rapper job rule by buying two hundred front row seat to one of the shows just to leave him empty he said to perform in Arlington, Texas in November sent revealing the prank in a sense deleted Instagram post that in general had been feuding for decades [noise]\nAcademy Award winning director ... del Toro working at a new Pinocchio movie he's directing an animated stop motion version of the classic Nineteen forty Disney movie for Netflix del Toro twenty Seventeen movie the shape of water won best picture at this year's Oscar is that the entertainment ...

working on shooting with them we have them shoot two feet behind the line so even if you moved to feedback shooting percentages will go down some\nBut part of the challenges in one of the reasons teams don't necessarily defend that far out is because you create so much space inside the three point line that it's going to be all after all\nI ... you have your question for Mark Cuban you brought this up ten minutes to go now you have a chance to say two of the owner of the Dallas Mavericks\nOkay you're looking woman you have a ... he he's like he's thirty five years old he's really Nineteen I

you\nJust get ridiculous stuff like that and you have the hardest part is to learn to say now\nHow long did it ... did you need to learn to say no\nUm it was pretty easy\nFor me [laughter] I I did have a hard time it at all\nI literally I probably have and\nYou know relatives that are on my quote unquote payroll um but I but I knew you know you know who your friends\nAre off the bat and you know if they're really friends you know which ones are having issues which ones are having financial problems and why and so I knew who needed help and I just said okay\nLet's just get this over with and you know you know it was five or ten thousand dollars or whatever and I'm like this is it\nRight you know the one case I did give a close friend two hundred fifty grand but I knew he would pay me back and and that was you know that was until two thousand and eight when his mortgage business clap so you know if if you know who your real friends are because\nYou already know which ones need help

that\nMore likely to not be with Golden State next year Kevin ...\nListening to ... comments post game you know I think everyone's saying I'll ... gone he wants his own team a is time for him to

Iraq\nIt pretty much ... minutes I could see him moving on but at the end of the day isn't it all about I mean this team could be like a a Celtics dynasty if they find a way to stick together but someone who's going to have to take\nA pay cut and clarity says he's taken him take a home town discount and Kevin Duran shouldn't take a hometown disc out so I I don't know if there's not enough money and the banks in in San Francisco to pay all these guys so I just don't see clay wanting to leave because he's being spoon fed right now\nYeah but you can go to the Lakers you couldn't you see that situation where the you know LeBron's says look come in and I got a bunch of pastors\nHere and we're going to make sure that you're you know you're getting your your shot\nI can see that to me I'll say it again winning trumps everything and he started the or five for thirties and I know I Know every now\nAnd goes crazy for fourteen and there were seven or eight in line with him struggling like that why go somewhere where the expectations would be much higher or right now you're playing behind staff Katie possibly\nBoogie if he comes back healthy and has the boogie that we know remember he was a the top center in the game before he went down so the expectations that would be higher if he went to the Lakers why not she'll have a lot to say oh it is it might turn tonight okay let me put fourteen threes I let me just chill out until his term\nIt feels like to rent would be the one to leave because he will cemented his legacy laugh and laugh and then he can have his own team or whatever he wants to do and they don't because\nYou don't want a lot of the reaction was last night read when Golden State was killing Chicago was you know what this is bad for basketball yeah like we're not letting all these great night with Golden State you know it's more of it it's a negative because you know what look at\nWhat the games yeah super teams now\nBut that's only way you're going to be the super team is building another super team and was players are going to commit to\nTrying to build the team I could see\nIf Kevin Durant wants to leave number one I Would leave the west coast and I could see Madison Square garden with his name written all over it he can be the marquee guy and in New York and new day if ... is comes back healthy and they can get possibly tiring and they I mean they're going to need two guys to go to New York with Katie\nI'm I could I could see that happening are weaker conference\nUm but once again at the end of the day I Will always Trump winning and right now those guys are playing basketball versus themselves barring major injury no one will be able to get a game possibly to off\nThe warrior's come playoff time if they're all healthy I mean staff now has backed the MVP staff are you kidding me man\nAre you kidding me this is crazy a\nThere are times though you watching and you forget the players on the team or you forget the dream on green is on the on the team yeah usually where we remember dream on on the team when it comes to the post season and then play has these nights like every you know five or six nights where you go oh that's right\nAnd that guy the fact that he thinks like catching shoot and and ... which is amazing Reggie he had the ball I think a little over Ninety a total of Ninety seconds last night mhm it just kept you shoot\nLet's let's revise your question when you ask the best three point shooter of all time how about the best\nCatch and shoot three point shooter I I Would argue lead put clay overstep as a bath catch and shoot clay over Allen\nI Am I put ... does\nAs Mary Mary good\nArea and Breyer's\nGood ... I mean\nCats in shoot be remembered ... or re was very good with the balance to\nLook at all and end handling so\nI'm different kinds of catching shoot\nIs clay or a cash and shoot three point shooters than you\n\nI Will plead the fifth okay I Want to you know what I'm going to do the Tom Brady a\nClay is arguably one of the greatest of all time and uh yeah I Would say I want I Want to do the Tom Brady\nNominate yourself okay yeah we're doing on the Tom\nMan I'd love to see it today it's like like Reggie at twenty eight in today's NBA game\n[laughter] I've had in my time and I loved it don't do this to me because then you're gonna get me all fired up and then I'm going to write my uh my mom who's in heaven and my dad who's in riverside I'm going to write them either really nasty no forget it onto\nEarly [laughter] okay All right so don't get me going awry hikers you saw and carry\nMan just imagine if you had like Fifteen minutes of work at night but the warriors ridge\nBall movement man movement yeah very unsafe that's why did you see the excitement of boogie cousins you know he gets thrown it gets thrown out of\nThe game in New York and they and they you know in the first quarter and then the excitement I see on his face on the bench like I Am a part of this team yeah although winning culture and that's all\nHe comes back he's run through brick walls for this team because he saw the un selfishness avoiding a step going crazy versus washed in three three quarters how they were all spoon feeding him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "30"}
