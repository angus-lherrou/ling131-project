W. dot org\n[noise] some people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling the thing is\n... which quarterback move do you think the browns regret the most\nThey passed on to Sean launching they passed on Carson went\nAnd they passed on teddy Bridgewater in a car that was twenty fourteen well but I don't know if they regret that\nAt the time we we had a story when they took me a job that those two guys looked really good early\nWell Bridgewater didn't want to go to Cleveland\nHe he said that when we had him on the show and he said thank God I they didn't draft me I didn't want to go there uh Derek car I was told from somebody and saw that they were taken Derek car and then all of a sudden they they passed on him but Carson one so I think will be the the big one yeah michelob\nIs it an option that hey everything's okay we got Baker maybe as a fourth option there that it all worked out the way it should have\nWell I don't think you're going to get them to say you don't want it Baker Mayfield okay but boy certainly would be nice to have Carson winds here I don't think anybody's going to tell you that\nYeah but I think becomes like a all pro then I think they'll they'll ... you know the the ... will be in the rearview mirror maybe\nAnd I think they found their guy when they better they better founded\n... how are these rookie quarterback by the way I felt like we were really into them and now it's kind of\nIt's the newness of it and then you see it and then you go okay wake me up when you take that next step when you get\nBetter and they're not good teams so you're watching the browns and you don't know how good Baker Mayfield is um you know Josh Rose and I don't think he's got the lowest completion percentage of any quarterback I think any starter\nBut you know this is it this is patients he got to have patience with all of this and we want it All right now in all sports like I got to have it right now I mean Jared golf was a bust right because we got to react gotta have an opinion got to have it right now I gotta see great this year\nAnd that's not the way it works not that position and any even if you show me greatness it can be false can be a mirage\nMean jak Prescott oh my God look at this\nRobert Griffin junior the third well we got our guy well look at this she's going to change the NFL and then all of a sudden\nSomething happens so that's why all of these quarterbacks let me see what happens when your team your line is good when when things are going well let me see how you play I can watch you play in your team's not doing well yes ...\nHow can you tell us to be patient with Patrick my homes is the best quarterback league golf is a perennial pro bowler and ... what a Super Bowl and in second years like second year these guys are visit your formula you when they're young quarterback\nI Know but if you're on a bad team that's one thing because ... not on a bad team of course in once was not on a bad team Patrick homes is done on a bad\nTeam so I don't know how good when Dallas was doing well ... was on a good team right now all of a sudden they struggle now all of a sudden I'm seeing a different tack Prescott dish on Watson you know you got a good team there\nSo in a fancy my home and say how come our guy can't be my home is that's not fair\nNo oh I you know homes is good once again it goes back to how many people how many teams missed on Patrick moms and if he's not with Kansas City at peace with buffalo or Arizona or Cleveland he's probably lumped in with these other guys\nDon't know how much better he is then these guys the rookie quarterback but at peace with the jets is he making magic here no\nHe's gonna be the same quarter back he's just not going to have the same time he's not going to have the same weapons so there are a lot a lot of things that factor in when you're trying to figure out what's going on with the rookie quarterbacks her second year quarterbacks here but if one of those are two of those marquee guys Kelsey entire week he'll get hurt\nThen let me see what you manufacture because then he might be at the level with these rookie quarterback mean Josh Allen in Buffalo come on you know the club\nUh you're kind of becoming a system to be a guy here I'm hearing a lot of ... ... talk\nBad system can be taught\nMe that is true of the DPJ show apple almost a quarter million of you guys have downloaded the deep you show up we've been talking to fans we wanted feedback you gave us feedback\nAnd the number one ... blasted feature is you want to do a download the deep you show pod cast directly from the apple listen to it off line or on line in a new feature\nYou could actually send us videos a meat Fridays song upload directly to the show after the ... still the best place to uh the live stream of the show catch up on daily interviews watched the exclusive content all new redesigned deep you show up downloaded today\nAt the app store so what's your question\nOkay we we have some other options as well I have a general question I can save it on which sport is gone overboard with all fence does MBAs on a record pace and the NFL's on a record pace do you want to see something to help out the defenses who was complaining\n\nWe were kind of the people were complaining about defense is being too hamstrung in the NFL early in the\n... well I I Know I'm I'm a voice in the wilderness here it just I ... I'd like to see great defensive players be able to be great\nUh you know it used to be the knock that I had on the national hockey league that you had all these great players or at least you thought they were but it was so deep bench of heavy then you go into these zones and all of a sudden you wouldn't somebody would say oh you gotta watch Peter Forsberg he's the best player in hockey and I go I watched him I don't get it\nHe I'm sure he's a great player you got all that great players be able to showcase their talents\nUm I I think that that was an issue with the NBA for a while not anymore with football not anymore\nA baseball you know became about the home runs you know you want this audience that you know people don't tuna way tune out from off it\nYou don't turn away from office you might tune in or stay tuned in when it's one nothing in the eighth because it can be tense but you know the first five innings you're going man is boring you know I like it because I grew up in that culture\nOf understanding you know a great pitching performance or small things that could lead to one run but that's what you're seeing with you know the world series\nThis year small things leading to a couple of wind shear are still waiting for word on JD Martinez if he's going to be available for tonight he tweaked his ankle and a base running maneuver and uh so I'm not sure if he's going to play or not\nBut they have over abundance a of a outfielders there so you got for outdoor there's maybe five guys for three positions there and I'm Alex Gore said that ... is not going to play second base\nBut that was a possibility that you put him in there because he came up as a middle in theater I Will take a break we'll talk to us Sean ... about the Texans he had something interesting to say on Twitter last night comparing the Texans to high school football in Houston which I think you'll be a little surprised that\nJohn Will join us coming up next your phone calls You're welcome age seven seven three D.

Batman hosted cascading it to a regional semi final and the blazers raise their record to forty two and three ... three\nBut Watson Dan makes it is is it different cat now\nAnd he brings excitement to it and it may start to shift but going into the game and there was no buzz leading up to this game um about the Texans and maybe it'll change\nIf I said you can have the future of ...\nOr shot Watson far more explosive the difference between the two is that Watson can carry a team like Rogers were Brady on his back for a month like a good hitter can when things are going well I think that needs everything around him to be good hence why they go out and get a guy like Cooper to try and wrap\nIt up and they I think that puts more pressure on him to be successful but I that's an easy one for me uh watching all the way he'll be an MVP and asleep before it's over\n... I guess define his style because he and I think a lot of times we look at you know African American quarterbacks and we talk about their athleticism he ... he plays a lie these he's not a runner in sort of a scramble or but how would you define his style\nAnd and I think that's a great point I think the people that label that is a disrespect of narrative to him because my number one trait for him as I think he's got through the roof football IQ and his best trait is and you watch them play in college you watch them play in the NFL when the lights of the brightest Alabama\nThursday Night Football coming off an injury he places best football so to me it's a guy who still learn the one of his weaknesses his biggest strength is he wants to be he's got this that the hero mentality that he's got to make every play\nAnd as you know the great quarterbacks at some point in time third and for if you can't get a good thought out of bounds will kick a vehicle or punt once he gets to that level there'll be no stopping and his his style of play is he's he's not a true pocket guy but he's not a true our appeal get on the edge guy\nWhich I like 'cause I never want to take away his strength but if I can crowd a little bit said hey man it's second eight it's the second quarter you don't need to run through four defensive players we need you on the field not the sideline once it crowded but he's an underrated guy from the pocket and he's starting to learn how to throw people open as opposed to wait until they're open\nHe thought it was a time when I was I think this guy special so it's only going to evolve more and more as he trusts the office of line and gets rid of the hero mentality of having to make every play\n... a former NFL quarterback hosted the ... show three to six PM on sports talk seven Ninety in Houston how much of a difference if any does ... Cooper make that cowboys office\nOn the surface down when it was one of the trade was first made I thought that the the raiders said fleece the cowboys and then you start to look around at some of the bodies that are drafted in the first round\nOr high picks like look on tread well dots and a core I call them and they think well is a first round or in the fifteenth Eighteenth pick who later it will allow for that pick for the cowboys is that better than a guy who was the first round pick at two really good\nSeasons when he first started out and I started to think well maybe maybe that's a fair trade a good trade for both I think it'll help Dan ... obviously their best receiver\nRight now the way to beat the cowboys is if you take Eliot away\nYou beat them for the most part offensively but I think just his reputation he drops balls but if he can elevate that and get back to the explosives he has a rookie it's an upgrade there's no question now it's going to be up to him and what kind of player he's going to be but the balls gotta stop hitting the ground when it hits his hands but I think it's a wise move and at first I thought now\nFirst riders too much but looking at it I think the cowboys needed which tells you they're trying to go all in because the NFC East is a is also wide open 'cause Philadelphia struggling as well\nMost likely to not be with their respective teams in two years ...\nTheir car\nTheir car it may not even take two years you know ... coming in and cleaning house in as we know and I have a lot of respect for ... is\nHe falls in love and out of love with player's income quarterbacks as much as anybody then he did it a Tampa he's done it in Oakland until he got rich Gannon and even in the broadcast booth so I think he gets impatient quickly\nAnd there's such different personalities now that doesn't mean it can't work but at my philosophy is if you're going to clean house and then clean it but if you think that their car can get you to February then then you keep him and he's got some things to do because he hasn't played as well as he did pre breaking the leg but\nYou know either I don't think there's any quick that's going to get paid because you've got to look out there and say well what's available free agency and who we draft\nJerry is going to pay back car already got his money I Would say there's a chance of both will be in their in their same place but if I had to pick one and gamble it I Would say that the raiders will move on from car before the cowboys move on from Prescott\nYou would know this as well as anybody I was talking about these younger quarterbacks and they come in ready to play but you know Patrick moms there were a lot of teams lotta scouts that missed on him and I said you know part of the success is where you are who you have with you how's the line\nHow's your head coach how's your off into coordinator and then what kind of talent do I have a round me at the skill positions if I put Patrick\nMore homes in Buffalo what is Patrick mom's doing in Buffalo\nLeaving his jaw dropping with some of his ability but they're not the the second best her best team in the AFC and then you make a great point and I firmly believe that somehow for a while there's no better\nTeacher slash coach when you're in your infancy of trying to learn\nWith patients but with aggressiveness and calling and what he wants to nanny read he couldn't have gone back when Ben Roethlisberger went to Pittsburgh down there really has passed bill attempted eleventh pick and here's a first round and you go to a team that it's the coverage not bear\nAnd he got to go on with a good team and it could have changed the course of his career look at Archie Manning great career always on bad teams then goes there's good team same\nWith my homes and and he got to a team that's got incredible weapons a quarter a coach that's willing to step out of the box and get comfortable being uncomfortable and turn it over to him and he got rid of a pro bowl quarterback to turn it over to the guy who started one game so I I Love this and you're right though the environment around you the creation of the players around you\nAnd what you're willing to do with them in Buffalo we wouldn't be talk and he wouldn't be the MVP at the midway point I can tell you that but we'd be saying potential and I could tell you this day and you know when you go into a movie theater and they say put your three D. glasses on\nThat small homes man you need to put on three D. glasses when you watch him he is not a system quarterback he's an all system quarterback and I got he's he's got the guts of a daytime burglar and I just love the way he plays and we're in for something special what the young quarterbacks misleading he's at the top of that list\nDid you play against Lawrence Taylor I did you did yes\nYes I'm old damned is that when you see your point when we were talking I played against it but not very good\nI I didn't need to ask that but but I I was talking to a you know the damage that when I covered the giants uh and I'm watching this detention Martin Lawrence Taylor\nTo be on the field to to watch him as opposed to TV like he's he's one of those guys were you watching you do that there's nobody like him that my son he just changed football there are certain guys say\nHe changed football and Lawrence Taylor was one of those guys and I know the battle jak was asked about ... somebody said could you could you compare ... Lawrence Taylor and you know ... uh no you know\nHere's how I could compare is max a great player that they both play football\nTackle football and then when we played against him and I think about my team in the water Minnesota didn't go to more Super Bowls and they had me on the roster but we have random and Daniel in and get very similar men both in the hall of fame on our left side and there are certain guys you mentioned Lawrence Taylor and Randy Moss was the same on the office of and where they literally\nYou your urine ate it down your leg when you had to play against them and Lawrence was one of those guys that you just you go into a game plan he'd use up so much time of your preparation because if he would have lined up in the parking lot during the game than we had to go out and lock it you know what I'm saying so he was special and Gary Zimmerman we'd have you know you get that guy is\nThose guys were always give alignment a hard time in the same was so good and they say hey you know it was coming down this week we've got ... we've got all the and he didn't get the great Gary's everybody to be the sweat\nRolling out his forehead analog Taylor was just that cat\nAnd you said no matter what you've got to show up he was he was one of those guys you look at you didn't want to look into the ice out in this kind of look away like a dog does when it's getting in trouble I think I'll\nTurn my she got going to stare at a NATO yeah he was he was he was special lecture db felt that same way when they had to line up against moss on a regular basis\nOh he's been a long time Red Sox fan ...\nGood to have you back on the show Sean thank you thank you all all up ... ... what do you call me back if the Astros or it'll have\nIt out [laughter] I'm sure if the Dodgers come back and take a you know three in a row here you're going to have Dodger gear on your daily ... Jersey on\nLet's go shopping [laughter] oh so you did they ask you about I think\nThat's a very uh we have some fun times\nHe he\nHe could have some fun first team all road trip right there\nI Will take a break we'll come back we'll settle on a pole question we got to play in the day is well we'll talk to Walter Payton son Jared Payton he covers the bears but a more importantly pole you saw that uh they were auctioning off his father's Porsche\nAnd we'll see what that's going forward it it it's going to be that's a turbo that's going to go big numbers here and you have the provenance that it's it's a ... do well we'll talk to Jared paid new joined is coming up top of the our phone calls as well this is the damn Patrick show [noise]\n\nWe're in the thick of the football season as you know I have to say that my tailgating game could use a little spark so instead of calling the same old place I'm stealing from triggers diverse playbook aboard fired recipes hundreds it'd be easy to follow recipes available for free at trigger grills dot com slash recipes or\nGuaranteed but there's no time to panic in this when does it mean all now they're the team to be another thing with what's going on with Houston I it feels like it's a panic move because I think Houston is looking at this roster and I mean Carmelo is you know he's\nHe's an edition I'm not going to say and nice addition let me let me see how this all sort of plays out I don't want to give you you know my opinion the first two games of the season and overreact like everybody else does\nI he's he's going downhill quickly\nBut can he provides you a little bit of a lift and he knows his role coming off the bench but if you're going to get Jimmy Butler now butler is not a three point shooting guy but he's a he's a really great all around player and he's off to a good start in Minnesota\nUm but you know he's going to want the ball Chris Paul wants to ball mellow wants to ball James Harden we know once the ball does this make you better\nAre there other pieces that you could have put in place that would have made you better to go up against Golden State did Jimmy Butler make you better going against Golden State that that's the you know the key to this and you're going to give up for first round pick I I'm not bothered by that\nI'm assuming that Houston is going to be good and you're given up to twenty and thirty twenty fifth twenty seven to pick okay\nAnd I use has got away now when Chris Paul at his age and you know your window is what three years\nSo if I'm bringing in Jimmy Butler candy be complementary piece to James Harden\nOr if I'm Minnesota I don't do this because you know you're going to be you're going to be getting pieces here you're getting your going to give up on this season if you get rid of butler with butler even though it has it's been a little dysfunctional it feels like\nBy the time you get these ... who knows if Carl Anthony towns in Andrew weekends are going to be there so if I get to draft picks over the next four years\nHow good are they going to be if they're going to be the twenty fifth or twenty seven pick I don't know if it helps Minnesota\nNow now it doesn't and in the future I don't know if it does either but Houston you're rolling the dice and I think that that's a telltale sign of\nThey take an inventory and they realize this team is not better than last year's team that had Golden State on the ropes it is a mean friday night or the alarm fire alarms off appears to be good okay well let's hear of meat Fridays song can we find one ...\nSmell and then grilled steak [noise]\n...

Porsche when he was going to auction it was being sold and it it might have been on the Internet\nOr ... and I I saw it after the fact and that would have been something pretty cool even though it wasn't you know a Porsche that I I liked that model like getting a turbo\nBeing home widow makers because you know the turbo as you know they could get squarely on you I mean it's a powerful car and I think their nickname was the way to make a bit of a nine thirty turbo Seventy nine\nI ... that's a great car to have but I Love the ... you know the early seventies Porsches apple\nYou said you would a hundred thousand and Walter's car yeah I have twenty seven dollars okay so it's one hundred thousand and twenty\nSeven dollars sounds good like right there yeah yeah but Oprah comes in and wants to buy holder Peyton scar then you know I got no shot you get a car and you get a caller you get a caller yeah now the big old comes in and then I got no shot there [laughter]\n[noise] and it's good\nBut if you're famous you don't want anybody that's why when people have been on an artwork they'll call in and have somebody bid for them you can show up where they go you know hey I'm going to get to that guy because then you think well he's got all this money I can just Jack up the prices here so you want to keep it quiet you don't want to let anybody know that you're interested in this\nBut um there'll be fun little bit of testosterone there once you start you know competing with somebody efforts again\nBeing as competitive as you want it's so easy just to raise your hand on hold up that little thing they give you a little paddle you don't even realize wait what am I just do and you can't take it back at that point I remember going to\nAn option then we it was just furniture it was like a antiques who was a mistake sue and I'm sitting there and I'd never done this before so I'm with my wife and she goes you know it may be a way we can see some things I said okay great\nFirst the first item is just a runner it's just a a [noise] it's just a piece of carpet like it's a rug to runner all of a sudden I put the damn paddling and my wife goes we don't need that\nAnd I go I Know I I\nI Can't help myself and I so I ended up buying this damn runner\nAnd my ... we still have it because my wife refuses to get rid of it because she knows that that is a reminder of you do stupid things sometimes I'm old enough to paddle I just I fell in love with holding up the damn battle I don't care what I was ... yup\nI'll do it hey we got a lamp you know but the\nNext thing you know than you are un I don't want to win\nI just wanted apple maybe well\nDown the road whenever this show and we have a live on TV auction of all the stuff in this room ... both rooms ... and just go step by step well I don't know if I could do that yeah you would like for things go can you can ... like your wife would never let you bring all this stuff all I Know I Know I I have\nTo find like a warehouse something where I could just put all this stuff I mean it's there's it's the best man cave in the world\nAnd hoarders aren't they don't have a history of selling a bunch of us knew the whole idea to collect as much as you possibly can\nAnd any time my wife says you've got to get rid of some stuff I always say uh and you wanted me to get rid of my Fifteen hundred albums\nYeah I got three hundred dollars for Fifteen hundred ... that was not a good day\nBut I think she might be representing your fourth Lou Holtz doll yeah maybe that but I got to Bob Knight Dole's into loop hole stalls but you know I didn't spend a lot and people gave me a couple of those things\nAll right we'll take a break um she got another meat Fridays song coming up for you a bill ... from the LA Times will join us we'll talk about not only\nA you know the Lakers last night I guess there's no need to panic now because there was apparently need to panic after the first three games but we'll also talk about

good luck [noise]\n\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nThe assistant coach and recruiter Curtis towns in is pleasant company but I Can't imagine that a single person in college basketball surprised his name came up Rosenberg continues to write\nSelf did not hired towns in in two thousand four to draw it plays in the final minute a big twelve games this isn't about a rogue assistant or a head coach who doesn't want to know\nIt's a business operation and bill self is the c._e._o. why should the c._e._o. skate\nThere's great points that are brought up here and I said this when it first came out you know there's a paper trail it's under your watch at your program\nWant somebody to give me some answers here yeah see\nSo are they talking about just NCAA sanctions or actual legal and see a sin sanctions\nBecause I didn't you know he's not the one that's committing the wire fraud now did he instructors assistant coach top recruiter to do it then I think he could have some legal hurdles here because they get into a like not what you know the way you can prove yeah kind of situation now you know ...\nOne thing you have to factor in though bill self thirty one wins last year thirty one wins the year before thirty three wins the year before and he's in the final four last year yeah nobody in that state wants and you know there is some well no they don't there's some sour Kansas fans who think bill self\nIs uh I could get a close but not get it done guy well no if I'm a Kansas fan I don't want to see him go\nBut if I'm the NC double A. I don't care how many when she had last year or the year before the year before that this is your this is what this guy does he use your top recruiter\nAnd ... he's ... he could go to jail because he committed conspiracy or wire fraud and\nHe sent money to a relative of one of their top recruits\nI haven't heard bill self say I cannot believe that was going on under my long term so disappointed I'm angry\nI got I I don't know if there's any of those statements attached to bill self here but how does bill self get off scot free here ah Bruce Pearl Bruce Pearl at Auburn\nUh he's next up where they are going to be looking to see what he knew who he knew what was going on or LSU is going to be involved in this as well so I Know coach case says this is a blip on the radar it shouldn't be a blip on the radar\nBecause if this is happening\nAnd your funneling money and you know when you think about it Adidas can do all of this sort of above board that you know that's not something that's in a sneaky behind the scenes hey Kansas was going to sign I Believe an eighty eighty four million dollar deal with indeed is\nLike this is big time money big time programs being time coaches\nAnd I was also wondering I you know is this a crime as soon as sports crime or is it a crime\nI Know that they're saying wire fraud and conspiracy and like the like the NC double a in the in the university is the one that was\nDefrauded ... and who is the victim of ...\nThat's what I'd like to know the families got money\nTeams God's will say wanted I so I ... I don't know if I can put you in jail for the\nNow I'm sure that you know obviously the legal east involved in this and wire fraud and conspiracy and all those things but if the University of yours are saying hey you know what it is that what they're saying make love and then it's the universities who\nWere the ones who are the victims here I guess if we were trying to parse it on this side of the glass and that's the best we can come up with the universities were defrauded they had to take these players on a false circumstance\nBut didn't they want these players crossing they benefit from the courses\nYou know say saying they they universities didn't know that these guys are getting illegal payments and if they had known they were getting illegal payments we would have never accepted them at the university so that's why oh wow not it they'd been duped\nAnd right we I didn't know that I didn't want this taught vibe recruit I mean I wanted them but not that way I wanted it honestly ... so it's wire fraud\nUse emails and phone yeah to conduct a scheme where they paid someone if they just handed the money and there is no communications that it wouldn't be wire fraud and we just be paying players so you wouldn't go to jail for that but the same exact act of buying a player but you don't use the phone or an email or some type of communication system\nI Know that this goes on and the shoe companies are the ones that have the money they have these relationships and this goes back to when sunny but Carol was Nike and had the brilliant idea to sign up these coaches\nBecause once you got the coaches then you've got access then all of a sudden the shoe companies are the ones running these programs and make no mistake about it\nSo much money involved in this and I can just hey who do you want me to get so it's not a booster your booster as a shoe company used to be you always had a booster you know a couple of guys you know they love to be the big man hey I which are going to take All right I'll write a check I'll get it\nNow it's the shoe company so it's it's it's almost right there in front of you\nAnd it's so close to you that you don't even notice it that's what's amazing but I there's no way you can have a guy who's been with you on your staff for over a decade you know what he does and then somehow you didn't know that this was going on\nIt's just like when Rick Pitino said hey I Know I didn't know somebody who's given this kid a hundred thousand dollars wait it's it's your program\nSo somebody has to sign off on a hundred thousand but Pitino gets fired and bill self is got the number one team of the country you know see\nThat's a long line of ah Pitino incidents the true but there could be a long line of bill self incidents to there aren't yet though no no no we're not all reading the detailed on yet of those things not yeah yes and we love\nIf you're a coach or you're involved in the college basketball history and nice three guys go to jail are you going to say something and say hey I think this is an injustice you should get the art is anybody going to come out and say this this stinks that these guys are taking the fall for an entire industry\nWell I don't know if colleges have coaches have to say this but I just think like somebody in the legal community is going okay wait a minute here remember the judge making this sound like a you know we're still living in the Nineteen fifties with the college athletics and the middle of the kids and ra ra ra and all that nonsense\nYou know this this is that's not what this is now\nYou know the judge made it sound like you know how dare these guys go rogue and spend this money on these basketball players they front of the universities\nNo university do a good job of doing that to themselves here but yeah Michael Rosenberg Sports Illustrated right\nBill ... skating here he's got the number one team of the country\n\nAnd it happens it's going to continue to happen it's just they find a different way to make it happen apple\nAnd the next guys know here's what I gotta do to paper yeah no emails no phone calls no tax just a bag of money like the good old days ... back in the old ... south western conference days then just drop a bag of money on your porch you can't get caught in the back of money you know\nYou know so she don't you feel like at some point then maybe people are wondering if the debit cards link to foreign accounts is a good idea\nI mean that's a ... bill is was just talking about like kids are getting debit cards that are linked to foreign accounts that they that that they're spending money right yeah I mean that's a whole paper trail right there but in the moment it's working it\nFive years ten years down the road they may find find out that we were doing this maybe but that's what's going on so if I give you and I give you an ATM card and there's an account and its offshore let's say I got I'm a sign you up or a hundred grand\nAnd nobody knows you didn't get a you know big lump sum and shot in your ... you know checking account it's just a here's your ATM card you know when you go and you get your books you know you get your school gear and a here's your ATM card\nAnd then you go and here's your code how about we do here in Jersey number like your number twenty two it's a two two two two and then you can't forget that Kenya Jimmy no you can't and you're just pulling on cash don't spend it don't\nDo anything extravagant do buy nice cars don't buy nice clothes you got walking around money you want to get mom's something\nWell it sounds like pretty good idea yeah probably the best one I ever heard the rumor is a school that\nNo names obviously one of the boosters owned riverboat casino and the players were told here's where you go here's when you go here's what table to go to you all do very well on your bats it's completely legal you know you can walk and walk out legal to a point in\nIf you're out all night legal legal from way\nIt's legal from a point that you could walk in anyone can the public can walk in and play play Twenty one play blackjack and when and legally I'm going to guess that rigging machine\n[laughter] you know I only illegally legal but hang often dealer to the naked eye yeah just kept making four hundred bucks to the craft table\nI ah I I had a guy that I knew ... played against him in the summer league and he said that he went on a recruiting trip to Kentucky and he went to the racetrack and\nIt was just you know what's your favorite number and so when you say what\nHis favorite number was with the horses and he um he ended up with a four fifty\nS L Mercedes [laughter] hey he drove them there's silver one summer into four fifty as an F. C. L. or S L a Mercedes so two seater and a member when he pulled up with that and I went whoa\nAny other throwing them no Pauli as they head coach I Would want to know you want to know yes\nOr would you ... like let's say on the assistant coach and you're the head coach Dana blank university I'm just bringing this recruits does a coach ask hey how you doing this fantastic work\nI don't think this is like a a manager saying to a pitcher hey I don't have to tell you to hit that guy you know what to do this is a situation where you're going to want to know how much somebody cost I'm guessing you know what are we in for which the relationship we have here\nI Can't imagine a head coach going hey whatever you do I don't want to know about it I just here to coach basketball you know if it's you know\nLike say once you start asking questions and you can't hide behind the ignorance after the fact if something ever comes out and you can say you didn't know because you were instructed your assistant coaches or you didn't ask any questions and you can just kind of\nHe said he didn't know it was already saying that whether you knew or not\nSo you're going to there's going to be you know is a plausible deniability I mean come on you're trying to tell me that you you know you're getting a guy that other schools want you know with the prices there's always somebody who let you know what the price is with a ... you know a lot of these kids you know see\nHow many times ... times can college coaches keep going back to that I had no idea I didn't like like this isn't something that's like happens rampant Lee in the industry is that some outlier where like whoa what happened to Kansas there that she's I don't know I don't know\nThe effort to do you think they have an actual budget players' names and to the maximum if they're willing to pay well this one will give this amount to this one will give the data job much will give him a little less ... I Hope\nYou didn't write it down and put it on the computer to put it that way but I'm going to guess you have a budget how much you're gonna spend you know is going to cost you a hundred thousand dollars but this little oval recruit you know with the number one you know their coaches who are on record saying ... somebody to to\nI see force that is too much money so do they have a salary cap and they're a Jimmy in Wisconsin joined genocide Jimmy what do you have for me\nOh I'm a big Jimmy for most skunks and I've got to meet the friday saw\nOh it's in a live version what is the song that a\nA it's a it's a take off for Johnny Cash Folsom Prison blues\nLet's go let's bring a Jimmy okay bestowed trained with us all your [noise]\nA trigger come and its role in on the grill I'm stuck in the juice city alive just stance or a\nOr a man or reading all just to ease is bra or you're the trigger ...\nAnd and those dining cars blurry and all my me and smoking cigars rural all the smokers and trigger ... or the boom ... come\n... you know ready yet to Jimmy in Wisconsin live version little Johnny cash although Jim yeah yeah well the most in prison ... train was yeah\nA James in Los Angeles hey James\n...

right a\nDuke if it's coach gay and do not do I think that things go on you\nKnow if improper benefits yeah it feels like every school to a certain degree and sometimes you may committed violation either you know you committed a violation but I'm not naive enough to if the greatest coach in basketball history John Wooden\n\nDidn't know what was going on that sounds surprising and as much as I Love John Wooden\nUm you know you got a guy who was no ... they knew that Samuel ... was handed out money getting players to go to UCLA I don't know who got paid how much they got paid but that was a well known secret not so secret\nIt you know it it might some do kids that you know some of the best players in the country\nOr they just go on there for the education they go on there just to get the national exposure they go in there to play for coach K\nMe need just apply logic to the central yeah see\nBut at this point couldn't they whether or not staying there for the education right\nThe education not important or not I I don't mean the education even shows you're just the exposure and its coach K and this is a fast track to start 'em for sure but you get exposure\nEverywhere now\nNot just Duke ... high on Williams and went to\nSyracuse is on national TV more often they're going to be featured a you know Carmelo went there in Syracuse New feature them if ah John Williamson went to Kansas UCLA Kevin Durant went to Texas and they feature Texas more\nTo like this is probably this is going to sound so naive but I feel like at a certain\nWhat's one of the biggest pressure hits you can have the biggest pressure appearances moments in all sports would be to hit a home run against Evan Cody bellows your does\nThat and he's on the bench to the world series gave one uh in the ...\nAnd I know what the numbers say but I just think he just figuring ... once you could have run into one or two the last couple of nights couldn't they I mean that that's my point and again I'm not I'm not saying that does it work did work over the course of the regular season because it does\nAnd it doesn't work in certain mattress but in shorts and a seven game series with good starting pitching\nIt just it just doesn't make any sense so yeah so it's a shame it's weird was saying well the Dodgers have a chance to because there isn't a play their best players\n[laughter] talking to build plants LA Times in around the horn joining us Dan Patrick show a four days ago I was seeing headlines that you know is it time for the Lakers to panic question mark and now that they want a couple of games in a row and they beat the nuggets who are going to be at one of the top teams in the west\nSo now what is this has been here\nOh I saw it last night Dan I saw the future it's a forward is up or seed I could see it now you know\nI was ready to say ... ... last week I like this team when the bond and play the same old sticky Lakers are horrible but no he's he seems to have had an impact day they they they they shared the ball at night but you guys in double figures they played the feds they hustle\nKobe Bryant was Arab selling his book so he was ... on the sidelines there uh and and it was it was a huge night and I think no and I think that show what it can be and again and again it is and then it's been more than a four or five seat but I think they can get there they beat a pretty good it's\nHim and they did it with a team effort they did it without ... out there so even even ... thought last night ... I thought has no place in the early returns seemed to me like he has really no place on his team even he seemed to fit in last night so I think maybe the bond Seventy they'll deliver on effect is starting to work at it it it can be may\nForesee that since I can smell it from last night\nBut you said ... fit in last night but when ... comes back and interim comes back it just feels like he gets pushed down the totem pole here and and I I don't know\nI Know I Know we have to see more of that you're right no you're right you got to see more of that but that he seemed to be like the extra piece that in my opinion last week I'm thinking they're going to trade this guy before before February because he just doesn't fit in there but if we can make it happen\nIf he can get these guys involved if we can figure out a way to get its base it on the floor with him and a ... again last night show\nWhat they could be in you know they came back early and they play defense so again I just think I think the the ceiling is is back to where it should be which is again a four or five seats\nLaunches dad we haven't heard much from him um I was wondering if there's a wonderful oh my God do I know but I don't say oh this is a coincidence is it ... it feels like there was no that was\nSet in the off season like magic said to you know lunch one to his dad you know here's the deal you know let's let's just be quiet when alleged for your son's future let's just be quiet\nNo now I think that happened last year and it didn't\nWork I think they even threatened the\nTrade and I even threaten the trade a kid at the dead and shut up and and now they've got work I think will work with LeBron James I think finally ... all of our ball or a ... bar yeah we are ball he's he okay she [laughter] I've almost full surround her yet she saw a guy who's\nActually bigger and more status and he is he didn't say Magic Johnson had this current status among you know among the sporting public to stand him down by the brawn does\nAnd I think the bronze presidents finally shut up all of already relies and then he got scared he said well maybe the Lakers don't have the guts to trade my son liberal short trade my son so I better keep my mouth shut so I think what bronze presence has had a wide range of the facts and one of them is to shut up all of our\nIf there was a fan vote on former Dodger wins the rams go into the super bowl or the Lakers go to the NBA final\nThat's a that's a good question however as we've seen during this postseason\nThe Dodger uh um attention has been enormous out here and people I think after Thirty years I think even casual Dodger fans are going crazy about the Dodgers a Dodgers I think they would anybody would take the pole would be a hundred and Ninety nine percent\nGet the former wins break that thirty year drought I think the rams are still kind of a new thing here\nAnd I think what brought as kind of a thing in progress but I think fans judging for the metrics or a newspaper or what people really want people responded to the Dodgers are overwhelmingly people are just so sick of the thirty years and the Dodgers are sick of hearing it I think the Dodgers that that that still the number one\nThing by our how craziest traffic going to be on Sunday in Los Angeles bill\nIt'll be like a Tuesday or Wednesday and every you know and you know and it will\nBe it'll be everyday out here I mean that's just that's just the way you're you're just the way it is\nI mean I think yeah and I would also everybody's talking about all the different sport events the only event the only two events that are going to get the big stuff or the coliseum ... Packers and the Dodgers you know Red Sox are the folks downtown or used to have the way that they have their back ways to get it at all that stuff so now it's a different everyday average\nBed to get it in a car right now we're down to do around the studio is going to be terrible it's terrible every day so\nA good way to bill have a great weekend thanks for spending time\nWith the thanks for having me see if\nThat's a bill ... LA Times and around the horn\nAnd Sunday is going to be he's right though that there are times when you're driving and you just go I I you know you look at your GPS and you're going by\nAnd then you keep thinking you're coming up on there's going to be an accident there like there's construction something and then it just volumes and can be two in the afternoon it can be one one at night one in the morning you know apple\nAnd whenever you were in Los Angeles and we work in a lot of great people at that directv will be like hey we're going out to get a you know little happy hour around six o'clock or and they go oh yeah we're at and we tell them the neighborhood we're going to get no no no I I Can't go all the way to there and then tried to make it back to my house I'll be up all night and it's uh you can't socialize with anybody unless they live three miles from me\nAnd even a at some point when we go to Los Angeles I was going to go over and see Petro said money but that's Burbank and where where we are I'd be going midday to Burbank and then I thought man can I get a helicopter\n[laughter] mine Hogan Tucson\nYeah and and so I was going to go over there and see those guys on their show and we're in marina del Rey and I'm thinking how long is it going to take me so I'm I'm I was factoring like Ninety minutes to get over there\nBut I thought you know maybe a helicopter that would be the the way to go about it but it's everyday life as for the nose right\nIt's it's one thing and we can all relate to that if something takes a long time to get somewhere because it's just that many miles away 'cause the distance but when something should take away the ten minutes and it takes like an hour and a half because that's five miles away it's beyond frustrating to sit there I Can't imagine you in traffic time\nI I ... mumbling cursing all kinds of things going on I couldn't imagine that like not very patient and I couldn't imagine that I have my Mountain Dew in my bedroom on shows on the line [noise]\nKeep in Los Angeles joined just keep what's on your mind today\n[noise] what um banning boy how are ya breaks\nCats I'm enjoying the tropic as we speak so reading from the gridlock grade [laughter] I uh I'm calling because you know I was listening to the at sea level a basketball conversation and\nYou know I think it's time we started asking ourselves if it's time to shift this conversation to [noise] a a place where we say\nIf it fits rule out to eat it if the amount of money being made enough to make us say it's time to start getting kids some sort of savings plan some sort of money to let them know that that money laid on their backs\nWhat's not just you know [noise] taken from them and the old oh you're getting an education and and we want to be you know this yesteryear idealism is gone I really think that's the ... that it's time to do that\nYeah it's just not going to happen Keith thanks for the phone call because no matter what if you're getting paid you're gonna there's still you know kids families are gonna want more money I never run into somebody and they go you know I Am so full of money I don't need any more\nIf you're getting paid and you have a chance to make even more if everybody's getting paid venue are going to have somebody to say now how do I get some of this elite talent I have to give them more money and there is no easy solution here\nNot at all Brandon ... before we take a break he branded\nTotally about a ah\nUK fan here so obviously pretty familiar with the one and done situation but the\nOne of the things that that people kind of forget it is an NBA role I mean I don't really like that yes you know the dog the to the the other way but I mean you know it is an NBA rule it I think that getting rid of that will solve a lot of this stuff 'cause I think it did it for a lot of it in the dark\nMore so and I was always gone on obviously but I'm a kind of feel getting rid of that would really really helping in let's say the Kentucky does to kind of help with one and done that actually offer lifetime scholarship to uh to all those players even if they leave that for one year so that's pretty cool yeah I'm\nA you know I Would love to have those kids if it doesn't work out thanks for the phone call Brian I'm that if you get a scholarship and you happen to leave early for the pros that they'll there's a window of you for you to come back and complete your degree if you want to", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "26"}
