these new than sports station eight hundred ... dot com and the ... heart radio ... every Wednesday will do it again on Thursday\n[noise] heart radio goes one on one with Carlos ... to talk about keeping his sound real\nYeah we know that from Buddy Guy and we have ... over the king [noise] to use the ways in like\n... days when he was on that level of town you know you got to say like you mean it and then and then you want to get us out because it comes from the limbs to comes from your fingers into ... is the sound that is beyond pedals against you know of\nIt might have a little bit [noise] but you don't want to use too many pills because this is like putting too much makeup and you can see your face you know [noise]\nAnd they used to Muslim [noise] most of the clan all run them was done you know [noise] you don't want to live like that because God gave you your own I date or your own individuality if so why would you want to mask [noise]\nKeep listening to heart radio for more Carlos Santana and all your favorite artists [noise]\nGet tax I see on your Amazon smart speaker just say Alexa played Hubbard tax icy heart radio it's up to\nMy heart radio goes one on one with ... talking about which party they consider to be innovative\nEven even so many of them is a weekend you know I Love his music I mean have suddenly they're hollow I Love with him and then the way\nIt was the oldest was shown us and I was at home to hundreds of years um yeah I was there anything on the radio and I was like what is the main thing I Love that was um Brianna say maybe some and I'm like whoa\nHe's listening to I heard radio for more of you to an all your favorite artist\nYou miss ... and Patrick show [noise]\nThat's a big mistake there I Believe everyone deserves a second chance we all are humidity we've all the mistakes\nWe did get over your radio take if once they should've done we send your child is you have you don't like you know watch we've comedy and dear to that a life\nYou got into the playoffs I don't know if they're saying look we got to put him in the playoffs 'cause we've got this lawsuit against us but you know it goes a little bit deeper there but when people know angel Hernandez who's going to um play the game it's a\n... a Twitter reacts and not kindly yes point\nSee see we've got his career salary he could afford this criticism even if he takes like a fifty thousand dollar and it's always going to get fined heat at its peak I think cc was making more than fifty thousand preventing well\nAlso keep in mind he lost five hundred thousand dollars is last star to the regular season remember where you only had to go a couple innings and then he got five hundred thousand dollar bonus but he got tossed from the game because he was protecting his uh his teammates\nAs he's thrown at a player with the Tampa Bay rays are good stuff good stuff [noise] uh no baseball no NFL tonight\nTimber wolves Jimmy Butler still wants to trade and why is this such a big deal\nAnd you know if if if I'm Minnesota why do I want to keep a guy who doesn't want to be here I got it it's still amazing just trade him right are you going to get value dollar ... dollar for dollar maybe not because\nThe Miami Heat know that he doesn't want to be there so what are you going to give him or we're not going to give you a full value Anthony\nDavis gets traded chances are you're going to get full value for Anthony Davis or best you can\nBut Anthony Davis I don't think wants to be a New Orleans long term I think he wants to be he wants to be in the spotlight I think Anthony Davis wants to have a coming out party\nAnd I think he wants to say I want to be in a big market I Want to show people on the best player in basketball and I think Anthony Davis has a chance this year of being the MVP\nAnd being the best player in basketball\nNow obviously has a chance but I think he has a great chance and he would be the guy that I Would say keep an eye on Anthony Davis might be the best player in the NBA and that's saying a lot because you know how I feel about LeBron James still I think Anthony Davis is right now I Want to\nEight to the brawn James because everything that he's capable of doing um any doesn't want to be a center anymore he wants to be a for\nIt's a you know he wants to be able to showcase his challenge but he's still got a couple of years there before he's able to uh unless they trade him oh my goodness Mick Lebanese putting on the\n... as far as I heard one coming up\nIs bad hot it's not that hot but there's definitely it's\nJust like the conditions are ripe for fire in here right now there's a lot of heat being thrown around it's not like in that contrarian take but it's pretty pretty hard to say one ... not pretty ...\nDavis is the second best player on her I think he is Younis harden no staff\nOh by the way by the way I Know there's look it's there's a lot of guys you can consider Katie Katie will probably be upset that you know he didn't get mentioned has won a uh but I think LeBron is still the best player in basketball the most valuable player in basketball\nBut I think Anthony Davis has a chance this is this is the year that he could have an MBP or if she were you just getting ... checked right they're a little bit jak\nIt's okay it's okay but I think Anthony Davis I think he now he's got new man I knew of Asian and he's gotten a bronze guys\nI don't know if he ends up in Los Angeles but it feels like wherever he goes next he's going to a big market that he wants to go with maybe the core for where it's Baltimore or Boston or Philly\nLA New York he's talked about the next two but you know he doesn't want to play center yeah probably at\nThis just a random speculation when you know Jimmy ... or watch out what if the Lakers got involved in this they've got a lot of extra guys a lot of extra bodies you could ... you\nKnow Minnesota's used to having a point guard who can't shoot you send a ball over there in in a couple\nOf other guys I could see Jimmy Butler ending up with a huge did ...\nSo if I got Jimmy Butler with Houston do I have a golden state's attention that would be interesting because\nYou know now I got I got mellow I got Chris Paul I got hard and and then you throw in Jimmy Butler\nI think I get golden state's attention there but I don't know if I don't think Jimmy Butler's the guy that you need for the Lakers because he's not a three point shooter it good player but I don't want to give up the younger younger guys yet\nThough ball you wouldn't know allowed the ball for well I don't know if I'm getting ... butler\nWill trade Lorenzo ball round draft pick for Jimmy ...\nYeah [laughter] yeah throw in wages yes we'd love it\nI was corrected yesterday by the way I Josh heart is might started to God I Love and Josh hard we used to it on the bandwagon yeah I\nDon't get it on the bandwagon with John Short so\nHe plays to and all those other guys play I'm confused who's the one who's nobody cares\nThere's no designate shows don't exist anymore on look around your point guard but he's not listed as a point guard so that he didn't get rid of that by the way I got a new video with James Harden coming up\n[noise] he's got a new move by the way\nNow they were playing against the Shanghai Sharks last night and you know when those two get together you throughout the records but hard it was unbelievable I think a million trees but our boy Jim or for debt I\nThink put up forty shots last night\nMan how jealousy you oh what a night\nForty shots [laughter] it's better than my honeymoon forty shot and see I don't I don't know if I click at the if I could write on forty shots\nIn a game that'd be better than a week [laughter] yeah like yeah I Do read too much it\nI Will take a break we'll come up with a poll question here uh a big pool question from what I'm told\nWho ... who is the one deciding it's a big pool question America oh America will or has [laughter]\nHopefully is this like the power of suggestion kind of thing if we always have a big pole question then after a little while people are going to be like no this is the one that matters is is a big pool question who came up with a big pool question are we have two of them one of them has to be big okay\nAll right well we're going to make it big or big ... big age we have plenty of the day started the day we'll get to your phone calls and uh as I mentioned David Roberts the Dodger manager joins is Matthew staffer to the lions and Michael Kay Yankee broadcaster all of that coming up here\nDamned Patrick show back after this sleep number did it again last night but then I've come to expect when I wake up\nAnd ... says you're just a different person kind of glow refreshed you're bouncing around and while the rest of us are just trying to kinda get our act together a little bit you got to ... well\nIt's because I don't take it for granted that great night sleep you know and more energy less brain fog I'm sharper better mood\nMore productive you could argue that but I Am I feel like these sleek number three sixty smart beds help everyone from parents to

than we're out of this pattern for quite some time look for a high to occur this morning into the mid to upper sixties of falling temperatures later today\nFrom the ... the newsroom I'm Justin Robert severe weather bringing tornadoes eastern Iowa yesterday Ross made a point as more on our top story this half hour there were several tornado warnings and a report of a tornado on the ground and Blair's town and the second tornado touchdown near Chelsea yesterday\nNo damage has been reported in areas that were under tornado warnings however farms that damage has been reported in Black Hawk county TV nine meteorologist Joe ... says an unstable atmosphere is producing conditions favorable for the development of severe weather\nI'm Ross ... well the latest forecast for the national weather service has the cedar river in Cedar Rapids cresting Sunday to revise sixteen point nine feet but this latest round of flood perhaps\nSay oh you play out west against these western conference teams but we're going to factor everybody's record together in Cleveland wouldn't have had an Cleveland's numbers even with LeBron playing in the west so it's not fair that I Would think the NFL would probably be the one since there's only sixteen regular season games what's the other hot poll question\nOkay I was watching basketball love story on ESPN last night and I was surprised by how much old time who was in there I saw about ten minutes on ... ball the most overrated play in the history of sports by the way\nThey were off by one point he sold the ball the guy would add to hurl forty foot jumper what's the deal it ... the ball but anyway my point was I think it's for the call it's a call which is awesome\nI don't know when all we\nDid is he chipped it and then I think it was like Casey Jones or somebody ... in in like he didn't do\nHarder how jak tipped it he didn't steal it he tipped the ball and then somebody else grabbed\nLarry Bird stole the ball and hit a cutting got bad that's maybe one of the more under rated plays double time\nThat's an amazing that that happened to get that it's OK by point was these guys are skinny they can make jewelry here we go look you know or when they ... they ... they don't dunk\nYeah I think today's players would would obviously destroy them it's a matter of training and everything yeah which sport has the biggest gap between performance in two thousand Eighteen and forty years ago Nineteen sixty eight basketball baseball where they're just throwing the ball hundred ten miles an hour\nAnd a half hour and I much beyond that fast but a lot of people on Twitter have me up golf is has been transformed probably equipment\nOr hockey a lot of people said the players are way way above what they used to be and the goal tending techniques are better says a lot of sports or better which sport is most radically different I think football is the front runner because of the size yeah\nSigns in speed I'm also the style of football now to what it was in the sixties or seventies\nWhat about baseball seems a bit much bigger players now than back then well\nYou had some big players back in the nineties\nAnd yeah I mean Haiti side to go down and yeah it's weird I have to go a little bit before that\nI think you had better baseball players because of the game required you to be a better baseball player now you can be one dimensional\nJune Carlo Stanton is one dimensional and we saw that one dimension can be and what it was there a new series me and he looked helpless at the plate and that goes back to what I've said before man\nWhen you're hitting home runs in their games in there in June or July and they really don't\nMean a whole lot but when it comes down to one at bat a pitch a situation that's the difference between moving on maybe forcing a game five maybe winning a World Series it'll come down to that\nThis year will come down to that small things\nWill decide it it it does in all these championships it's really rare when it doesn't come down to something that is microscopic or something that his attention to detail and I think that's the amazing part of it that we get caught up in all the fanfare all the highlights and then it can be something as simple as\nAn all sides an audible or it could be one yard the again it could be one you argued don't game\nIt could be a pitch that you make a pitch that you hit a pitch that you take a taken that you know an extra base you know hitting the cut off guy like just small things will decide and always decides championships McLuhan\nYeah the fact that ballot check I had practice that play against us that ended up being the interception by Malcolm Butler on the sea hawks and saw something and you're right I ... and last year soup all came down to little moments here and there could have gone either way great points yeah probably you're kind of ruining the\n... same baseball has regrets because of weightlifting and conditioning because back in the day pitchers didn't throw as hard so they can throw eight nine ten and an eight eight nine innings and have complete games come clean games don't have to happen anymore you'd think complete games would happen because the guys are in better shape\nBut no they'd form you'd see your ... star pictures would be more relevant in today's game if there was less weight lifting and all that stuff\nBut it's not as much of that as you were a pitcher now they're throwers right like we're amazed when you see somebody who is labeled a picture like oh my God oh so that's a picture like Clinton ... pitcher and he would be dominating and that it no matter what era\nI'm you know but you have these guys are a fast ball pitchers well you know in other arrows they'll do hit a fastball but it's the guys who were pitchers that are rare nowadays because we don't develop them\nIt's the guy at the plate is trying to hit a home run in the ... tried to strike you up it didn't used to be that way\nThere are guys who won the home run title hidden thirty five to forty home runs\nBut you had these pitchers who realize how do I get you out\nAnd and that's that's the difference Nolan Ryan would be great today Nolan Ryan would be a thrower but he had to learn to be a pitcher and he also had a great change up and curveball but he learned to be a pitcher Randy Johnson could throw at a hundred miles an hour Randy Johnson had to learn to be a pitcher\nThese guys now they just want to throw the ball really hard you know for ...\nAnd to your point on one dimensional players from a previous generations to now it's you know Paul O'Neil said at the other day and you can see mentioned many times these guys aren't embarrassed when they strike down a break all kinds of records hundred hundred and fifty times striking out as long as they hit a certain number of home runs by the end of the year they're okay with\nThat yeah it it used to be embarrassing if you struck out a hundred times guys would walk back to the dug out with their heads down like you were embarrassed when you struck out now these guys like yeah I don't know I look man that was a great cut\nYeah be struck out though yeah but I don't know I look man you look really they look bad you know tough apple\nI also think football's way worse because of the over conditioning every person in the field is an unbelievable shape back in the eighties there was there every team had one athlete that stood out like Earl Campbell or belief systems\nWhere he could take over a game where the running backs where the feature now because there's so many fast guys on defense there can't be start running backs anymore or they just breakaway backs\nWho blow people away the bow Jackson wouldn't exist today\nHe would not run for yeah it wouldn't happen there's too many other guys who are in similar condition above the game as\nChanges not because of the conditioning it's the they don't use a running back ... the passing\nRules are so easy there there's no reason to go let's concentrate on having a great running game\nI mean even Jacksonville trying to have a passing game with Blake portals granted Leonard ... been out but it I I'm just looking at these numbers you know Drew Brees is completing almost Seventy eight percent of his palaces\nTo a ton of Iowa is completing I think Seventy five percent of his passes\nYou know that these are all record setting numbers and it and nobody's really noticing this it's just like to hear here it is\nYeah by the way I I was shocked when I realized who breezes completing almost Seventy eight percent of the spouses yes\nIs some of this spread football I've been reading that college football's spread has come to the NFL it I feel like this defensive not caught up\nThe way they've spread out the field for receivers well\nI I think you're going to need innovation you're going to need Brighton deep friendship young bright deep and she'd mind to change the game\nBut we never talk about them we always talk about the ... and all those guys\nWell because often she's so far ahead of defense now somebody's got to come in and say All right what what kind of system can I create can you have a buddy Ryan type forty six defunds something that is different for these off inches and I think that's the next wave is you're going to try to get these guys who are innovators and I don't know where they are right now\nBut those are the people that I Would be searching out because the way these all kinds of numbers are I mean it's not slowing down anytime soon we'll talk of Matthew staffer to the winds about this and Drew Brees setting the all time record we uh we did the projections on Matthew Shepard\nI'm going to guess thirty eight thirty nine years of age at his current pace\nHe's going to be passing that market Seventy two that will breeze is going to get to eighty thousand probably but uh we'll talk to Matthew Stanford\nHe got to range before his brother he said here you're talking about how much you don't watch a little way much that's fine I'm cool with you I don't care what you watch or what you listen to or nothing\nLike that but hometown love you don't have to do me like that [laughter]\nLittle rover slow way oh\nGod it's good stuff you\nCan't make this up [laughter] little ain't going to have an Eli Manning song video\nUh all of a sudden you know little lane is Mike Wallace is sixty minutes here going in with the big interview the tough interview or who we are going to send in to do the interview with food and I'd say ... All right yeah see\nAnd now to make things even worse for Eli ... from ... by nature he said he likes to bench himself\nThe rap community is not on board right now with Eli Manning\nWhat's him an emphatic about this what's the matter is think about that either yes boy can play just call it said the giants has stuck with David whoa [noise] what's Criss crossing [laughter]\nAlthough I don't think they're considered wrap our they crisscross why not worthy\nI think yeah of course they weren't I one of them are not with us anymore not recipes like Chris across\nYeah of course cross will make you some of them around but they can't round like this that's kind of wrap isn't think that'd be a ... okay\nI don't think it sounded ... when you do [laughter] but but I I get it okay\nI think that's a little voice mail Jewish version of\nWhat I'm trying to him [laughter] I think that enough to make a good cross will make you OK daddy Mack will make him\nAnd I missed out on all that great music and just somehow that stuck by me\n\nNutty by nature that well then not even a nature not rap right yeah yeah of course yeah oh I missed out on that to ... you know me yeah OK I'm sort of got the tail end of that\nAnd I missed out on that's okay you know you got time to catch I Do yeah you can catch it is it's sort of like Breaking Bad and the wire that I can go back and started listening as me as well that for nothing but to get the uh Texas last night that said man nine inch nails is a good band as like ah yeah they're right on schedule [laughter] if you're in that when I'm watching nine in ... in Austin city limits twenty five\nYears after the fact but the train and raise miners band is what I was trying to say I got the ... check out this new Seinfeld show no I did not just came in I was watching\nTrent ...

I I have not\nBeen a stay away from that as much as I can but ah\nI I hear people talking to somebody about it sometimes but it's a long way off\nLike I said I mean he has to do it for such a long period of time there is not a great job of keeping himself healthy um you know has had really good teams around on the to throw the ball around and it's very receiver so it's it's a ... something that you know maybe someday happens horn made with those on foot or just for the crowd you know\nI've done the math for you by the way I got to say I got you around between thirty eight thirty nine years of age that that uh I've got you around that number just to let you know just in case somebody brings that up it does sound a little I don't know bragging do shoes or if you say yeah I did the math and I'm going to be thirty eight when I break the record so I\nI Know on the Internet that you did it you didn't you know I don't have like their practice but er I'll mark it on the calendar and you're not sure I get it done what\nDoes it say about the passing numbers now is it more about what the confidence quarterbacks we're doing or what the defense is not doing\nA I think it's a combination of both you know I think there's some really great quarterback play in the league right now I'm you know young guys the old guys I mean it's all over the place looked at my home is doing all the way up to you know drew and calm still planning a really high level so uh it's it's a really good\nArrow for quarterbacks I think in the NFL right now and at the same time um there are some things that uh you know probably you know helping the offices or feel a little bit more politic and I think it's for the better the game just because\nAll of it really is I tend to keep us safe keep guys play it for as long as they can which is ultimately what we all want to do you know we want to play this game as long as they can and have fun doing it\nBut also if you're looking at this the way the game is now too when you first came in how much of a difference is it for all offense and defense and your your opinion\n[noise] um I think it's changed quite a bit\nAh really it also raises um you know obviously I'm you know rules are different for defenders now than there were back in two thousand nine when I came in all the again at uh\nLike I said earlier I think it's for the right reasons and I think ah you know some of it is tough you know it's tough to officiate I think it's tough for certain guys that have played for a long time to kind of have to change the way they play the game um but I think it'll keep them safe keep us healthy people play on longer and then\nAll sorts of Leah schemes are constantly changing you know and some of these skilled players that are coming out now are just\nIncredible incredible athletes um big tall fast strong all of it so uh it's it's a really cool time to be playing in the NFL and I enjoy a player\nHe's Matthew Shepard the lion so they got the dolphins coming up on Sunday boomers science in question your leadership because you're not fiery around your teammates what's that mean\nI'm I'm not really sure a boomer is not like I said when I first you know that us about this I I haven't had boomer in the locker\nRoom yet so I don't know where he's getting that information from but\nUh you know I just I'm going to be myself and um you know who I Am to my teammates is different than who I Am to everybody else and I think that's the way it should be I think you know\nThe locker room for each of 'em were a football team for a reason because what we share of what we talk about is for us an assault late so uh that's kinda how I feel about it but you know everybody's got their own opinion I understand if you win games are there to say good things about you you losing will say bad things so I get it\nHow are the lunch how would you assess your ah your group here through the first five\nYeah you know I think up and down um you know we've had some really nice when the ... it's a\nYou know frankly we just did it play well and we've got to come out and for that every week this is the NFL we understand that that's the way it goes um but we've got to be as sensitive as we possibly can be and that's that's how you achieve you know long term success is just making sure that as a teen they're kept is that um you know we can only ...\nHave you sold a quarterback hit to the referees\nNovel why not not recently at least\nA everybody's everybody's still now I Know I'm just going to start their hook into centers and let them land on me and said we can\nDo but um so it's you know a itself so that's what I'm saying I mean I understand the rules have changed and uh you know it's you know it's tough to be at the center out there right now I get that you know it's a you gotta you gotta change the way you play and and I think it's tough to be a\nAn official as well it's happening so fast um you know they got to make splits a split second decision\nBut these guys come in and I I don't know where they can land I mean you saw the clay Matthews here it's like you know one I thought was a flag in one I didn't think was the flag and and it does happen in real time but I I just feel for the defense who players I don't think they know what they can and can't do any more\nI I get that there's no question and and I like you said one of the knee so it was correct and one of them felt was and and and that's officiating that's tough you know what I mean the thing is happening so fast\nIt got so many things to look at 'em you know how how long ago was the ball release you know how much of the way it lands on him I don't know what I mean that's a tough um I think you know the rule is intended for player safety and I understand that and I think that's a positive thing\nUm which got to find the best way to go about it and I think it'll you know it takes time but I think it'll work itself out [noise]\nI uh I had a problem with the uh the great uniforms just won't let you know like I said it publicly and I'm I Want to say to there was too much grain there Matthew\nOkay well a noted I Will say that I can do to get it said\nCan you do you have any say over how the uniformed us look do you have no\nNo I Wish I did but I did a um I just kind of where whatever's in my locker that they are out there and so I play gets so I'll let the guy upstairs know that uh you felt\nThat they do great and I also think that you know coach wearing has had backwards I mean I it's got to make up his mind it's either forward or backwards\n[noise] yeah I mean you're gonna have to take that up with him a fair number asleep in a a a flip flopper so uh I don't know [laughter]\nWe did go back in the pictures and I go look at Stanford he's got it back you know he's got an forward from all over the place but see your father now I think it's a hand forward now once you become a dad\nYeah that that turns it around for sure strictly a forward guy at the time or a moment but\nA lot of these photos [laughter]\nI I remember people question your leadership a quarterback who has had on backwards\nYes re big news was ill [laughter]\nDid you ah reach out to your your ah your good buddy ... showing congratulate him\nI have not yet I'm I Need to that's a great reminder thank you for making this show bad on\nThe radio but I Need to reach out to a ... it's great that I was lost in that uh you know obviously happy that they're moving on\nYour luck against the dolphins and we'll check back in with you run you around thirty eight thirty nine when you're ready to pass a Drew Brees when the old timers good thank you bought a house\nTogether and have a good ... I [noise] Matthew Stanford\nAmong the players old time at least a hundred career games one hundred career games played Matthew Shepard ranked second only to Drew Brees in career passing yards per game\nStafford is a two hundred and Seventy eight yard since where the average is Drew Brees average is two hundred eighty three almost two hundred and eighty four\nYou surprised at that number and sea breeze than Stafford Peyton\nManning let me see if there's any surprises here Peyton Manning Matt Ryan so they're all basically you know in the last few years with these quarterback Tom Brady center Kurt Warner is still in their Aaron Rodgers ... burger Carson Palmer is in the top ten\nOr eleven manning was number twelve Dan Marino is still in there and number eleven so a Moran moon\nTrent Green damned found but I'm Drew Brees mealtime leader but I'm looking at Stafford at age thirty he continues you know he's going to end up with the good Seventy thousand ...\nToday that Drew Brees the ways play right now like you said earlier you could push up way past Haiti\nI like that he said he was going to tell the people upstairs that I thought the uniforms were a little\nToo gray wouldn't it be great if you actually did a ... a a a guys come you can get some really important I'm damn Patrick thinks that the uniforms got a little too much grant him I could it wasn't silver he was gray\nA lot of gray yeah I just think you could have accented something with the grey like the Sox I ... I Can't have it like is that their color rush uniform make more than I think that his collar and I I mean is it do they have a lack of color rush uniform [noise] nice people\nI Will take a break the rock and Roll Hall of fame nominees are out will have the oh no\nOh no friends who just sent me mock headlines Red Sox Yankees\n... are\nAre you ... you're setting yourself up here you sure you want to do it\nIt's my birthday you guys aren't going to be too hard I mean if you don't find them hysterical or something or particularly climber I thought there's some good ones\nDo you really think we are going to be lenient because it's your birthday the jury's out Aaron Judge can't spark ...\nIs there oh no okay All right we're doing if you really don't know not as\nWell you just grim as when I said for she's got a mock headlines in what was your response\nVillage to shop for rock and Roll Hall of fame nominees back\n... back blink one eighty two\nAnd that's not the right left\nThat is not it's all I mean the list no no no no those are the soy and yet I don't know I don't care about the ... the the list is a man with one or two in\nA gay set out there so I don't know well okay we're supposed to head out the list is our Paul Paul settled it so it's death leopard\nEvil Janet Jackson ...

think\nLike deep Downey still had to prove a little bit on this big stage\nOr I don't think that it's a you know and that one particular game that's a moment where we decided to\nStart countries ... because of the rest a factor where there was a lot made of that um I I think the question of the procedure there's a bigger question and that's a question clay can answer but I think in that particular situation I don't think that\nI Do believe that he does he has proof but I Do think that there was a pride there's ego component that comes into it that wanted to uh you know pitch well and that's what he did\nBut it also ... and I know that the media makes a big deal out of this and I don't know how much is coincidence I don't know much how much is like that's just some pictures are wired differently when it comes to the post season and you were there with Curt Schilling I there is no better big game pitcher that we've seen in the last Twenty years than chilling\nThere was just something about that moment but as a manager how do you detect that if somebody has that or they're missing that\n[noise] well um I I you know what did I I I\nClaimed Tony Stark's policies are Twenty one starts or whatever it might be [noise] um so I Can't really go back in at less you'd every start but I Will say I would echo what you said about Curt shilling for me there there's that that ... know bigger\nGame pitched it I said uh the ability to prepare and execute the way that a show that um\nAnd and Clinton I think a part of it is um\nThe execution and I also think that just being able to use his entire pitch backs a flip the script just a little bit uh and I think that when change repairing a postseason a at times it calls for that you know because the preparation is so kind of fight to\nHow many chicken request have you received\nYou know what so and this and I'll see as I'm On a Milwaukee were flying out tomorrow after no I've got one check your request that's from my side of the tropical\nYouthful thing [laughter]\nWell wait you only had one ticket now that you mentioned is now you have you say you're going to have some new friends are going to say I hear you got some tickets\nFor ... or ... or the Iraq has caught up in sports that are taxes here for that park\n[laughter] did you watch the red Sox Yankees\nI did I did a a ... that took a club over there you know both of those guys are good friends quite as far as the\nBad pitchers that I got to coaches obviously that I'm close to focus on both sides are the red Sox that's a very off event for solo threw the ball well and I ended up being a lot closer than anyone expected but uh yeah that I think for me the best have what\nWe were talking about pitching strategy or managerial strategy with your pictures I also look at the certain teams are built for the regular season I thought the Yankees were built for the regular season they were fun to watch but when you need to manufacture that run when you need to get a guy on and get a guy overdue small things I just I didn't think the Yankees were wired that way\nAnd I know that you guys rely on the long ... as well eight home runs in the series against uh the Braves Thirteen to the Nineteen runs were driven in the home run\nAre are you worried that you were to self reliant on the home run\n[noise] well I I think that you're making a good point and that's the thing that you look at the red Sox and look at the Astros how they could kind of beat you in a lotta deploys authentically um but they can also pitch a but I think for us we can\nPitch to your point about to question about the off as we do walk a lot\nWe Homer are we to walk a lot and I think that you know a lot of it though is that what you can get guys on base and creates stress or ... or you know the one to hit that you're looking for chant political crooked number but I think that yeah we might not hit on\nA as well as other clubs or single but we do get guys off base\nOur today's baseball players better than going from Twenty years ago I Know better condition better athletes are they better baseball players than Twenty years ago\nUh we so you're talking about\nLet's look at it in two ways the position players side though I think they're I think they're stronger bigger stronger faster but I take a in a vacuum you are they better baseball players now uh [noise] and I think that the players Twenty years ago\nAt or clubs in fact they do a lot more things on a baseball field they were or it should with a you know they did a lot of their own scouting\nBy reading swings and study pitchers and keeping her own books on pitchers aware now there's so much information and guys are just rely on that it's at looking at a car and it's hanging a spot and he's not\nAdjusted during at fat\nOr making a judgment and at that as far as the box so um\nBut the pitching side you're talking about there is a lot of talent on your talk to your\nSeven six five six guys so Ninety five plus that ever the case or Twenty years ago so [noise] but as far as a position where certainly from it\nBut also I I look back in Randy Johnson could throw it as hard as anybody he had to learn to become a pitcher today's today's kids I don't think are are becoming pitchers\nI think there are throwers now you do have the exceptions and they do stand out because they're true pitchers I I think that's what's lost on this new generation of pitchers is to understand how to be a pitcher how to have the batter get himself out Maddox used to throw hard\nUh Nolan Ryan had to become a you know from a thrower to a pitcher\nAnd all of these guys had feels like and I think that's what's missing today these guys you just go give me the ball and throw it as hard as I can and to any Tommy John surgery\n[noise] well I I think that that's a little unfair and because I think that just because a lot of times where guys that have lost\nTheir just kind of put in the bucket of growers and there's a lot of guys that we can talk about that have lost got our pitcher and we saw one the other night kind of a setting on sale so\nAh and ... there's a lot of guys that serves or you know it goes on and on that guy's lost so I think a little bit that I don't think that that's completely fair\nAlright well I've been I've never known to be fair but you know I I'm the grumbled oh no\nI mean I hear you you're not the bad and I think your point is very fair I I Do but a lot of times people make that decision when that guy throws by any that he's ... he's pitch ability he can pitch and it kind of\nTakes away from the guys that do go hard but no you're definitely not a salty I Love you\nCould you steal a base right now to look\nOut for like not [laughter]\nOkay I just in case they you know that they may not you know but I Would say\n[laughter]\nI'd still awkward when I bring this up but a playoff share I don't know if it was voted on I think you were checking would ... Shaw and Turner the last time is it just assumed that uh I get a playoff share and\nHey you're going to tell you if they don't I don't you want if she doesn't go you're going to tap into my share\nAll right okay how much is that [laughter] where do we stand right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dan Patrick Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "10"}
