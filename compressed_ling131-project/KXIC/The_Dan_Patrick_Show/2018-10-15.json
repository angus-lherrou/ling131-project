I I think you know when John ruined is going hey you know what somebody wants to mark Cooper make me an offer here a clue Mac we're not going to keep it\nI ... I said it before and I feel like in two years I don't think Derek cars the quarterback for the Oakland Raiders I don't think so maybe sooner than that here is John grew in on the process of building a winner\nWe're gonna continue to build the team you know I've only been here for six or seven months you know we've got some some players hurt Carl Joseph hopefully kale can come back\nOh we lost some men today hopefully they can heal up and play as well I'm not gonna say anything other than that we know we've got a ways to go here\n[noise] yeah I think that this is sort of a palace coup the Johns coming in and then he's making all the moves here and you got a GM and Reggie McKenzie and at least ... right now in title but it feels like you know this is this is what John ... it's a two year period and I was told this when John came in that\nThat don't look at the Oakland is not going to be good this year and I thought well they got a little Mac and then you've got these mode and you got their car and I'm Ari Cooper and then all of a sudden\nYou don't have a little Mac and I'm Ari Cooper's injury prone and you know John is looking at what do I do and the next two years here to turn this roster ... around or over to what I Want in my making in my like it and it feels like that's what it's going to be grace period until because Oakland fans are going to be happy that you're still there\nAnd save her those moments and then when you go to Vegas I think John is going to have a different team ...\nAlthough the devil's advocate you know they might not have been ain't good with Cleo Mac and they got to first round was for him you know what if you actually go back to this mix up their own line is that maybe maybe it was the right move to just get rid of him and it could be but I mean look at ... but I don't think anybody should be surprised\nHere now and and people are surprised but Seattle played played well know Russell Wilson junior the third at a good game they're London with another treat gay\nI Want momentum is building up talent new momentum is building from London to get the Jacksonville Jaguars because if shot in ... the owner of the jags gets ... man\nAll bets are off they get Ninety thousand now all of a sudden ... it's it you know it's a hot ticket to get there there's there's numbers now that said that ... is looking at the I think it's gone up third three hundred per se\nSent the numbers with tickets and they sell them out and it's become a must see go to vent their and if you put another team there\nAs a permanent team and you're going to get eight games there I don't know at the NFL can do that to Jacksonville I you know who knows the NFL doesn't have a conscience so they might go ahead I'm Sorry about that Jacksonville hope you enjoyed it\nBut you know can you go six games there could you have two other teams host the games over there and have an eight games schedule but ... and there's momentum building 'cause these guys are always looking at how do we make more money where do we make more money you know their market that you don't incredibly well we're not going to have a team there\nChina NFL\nBig deal in China but I feel like they love what is American um whether it's fashion they love they love America and I think because of the NFL you've seen a little bit more of that now with the Chinese market [noise] what else do you have a global\nOkay you want to do do positive for a second you know we don't want to keep it all negative ad okay how about ...

get it but I had to learn how to add it\nIn a park is a little tougher screwball\nAh you know I'm going to learn how to hit it off about that\nDid you ... you played baseball with the film like a football mentality I Know you played football a little bit at Michigan State did you ever wonder what could have been if you stuck with football\nOf course I I Do know that I probably wouldn't last long because I really enjoy contact\nSo much football\nI remember when I got out of football is playing baseball initially she guys run out of ... man go for that extra five yards and\nI couldn't really understand that but years later it all makes sense ah you know I was a kind of like run 'em over a guy or out Ron I'm Guy that wasn't the smartest way to go about\nAlso I think I Would have done fine but if I didn't smart\nUp I don't think I played I played Seventeen years and the big leagues in uh in baseball on two world championships I don't think I could ever second guessed by by choice although I did enjoy football more baseball just by mentality wise\nWhat do you remember about the game Michigan State played against Notre Dame you started that game right\n[noise] uh I was one I mean I we played of four years or a\n... game I was ... yeah you're prayer\nWe don't we yeah we beat him down there and ah and by the golden dome and uh it was my first game I remember that a quarterback is Charlie baggage through a an interception got I got aired out for it because they said I ran the wrong fatter or which best\nGuess wicked [laughter] and uh\nAnd uh we watched the film so next day and it was apparent that I didn't and our office a coordinator says well we'll just move out of amongst us play right here and I took it as a rookie but you know it's a it's a great learning experience we ended up winning that's all I counted\nAnd uh we had a you know three more years after that we did not read them\nAnd uh the toughest defensive back I ever played against it was a guy named Luther Bradley you may remember Luther Bradley [noise] and uh I was going to hit golf balls this year at six am at a golf range as a young black then\nThey said how are you doing young man and he said I think I Know you I'm Luther Bradley\n[laughter] what [laughter] oh circle [laughter]\nI said you were pretty tough you said your bed yourself so you know I saw when he got his memories

you ...\nThanks guys good to talk to you\nKirk Gibson to time World Series champ a MVP an eighty eight tigers analyst for Fox Sports Detroit and the thirtieth anniversary of the world series game winning home run against\nThe Oakland A's that's cool but he kept to everything and uh I read a couple of articles on gimme gimme gimme was a no nonsense there are times when\nHe could be gruff a rude abrasive\nHe just he was he was wired differently now but he did play baseball with a football mentality and would have been a first round draft pick I Believe it's a wide receiver Michigan State is a very very talented athlete\nBut man you watched that swing in and he's he's right it's Hank Aaron and Mike Schmidt or two guys that I always noticed they just use their wrist to hit home runs\nYou don't find that too many times with guys now but if you go back and you watch Hank Aaron swing a bat his wrists were so strong and even Mike Schmidt that they just had to flick if they got that wrist it's gone\nAnd give me reaching out and flicking the wrist and as he said he knew it was gone I mean it looked like it was going to be a driller and just to be able to reach out get the angle for his wrist and then he knew what was coming great scouting apple\nIs Kirk Gibson sports immortality similar to late ... where they did other stuff they weren't just known for one thing they were good players like later had a good pro career at great college career gives them a a good pro career in baseball but he's got that one moment that can be shown anytime the Dodgers play in the playoffs\nAny World Series and you're going to see that for a hundred years truthfully would you rather\nHave ... Dale Murphy's career to chime in BP back to back in BP I think had three hundred Ninety eight home runs\nNever won the world series though but for two years was the best player in the game that might not be an apt analogy because giving was MVP one year and then won two World Series titles and then had that unbelievable moment that eighty four tigers team\nThat they were crazy great where they start out like thirty five and six\nWell aware that you only ... head of weird that's why you buy a grocer them man that's good study paying him ...\n\nCan be Halloween time are you guys wearing costumes there's your big lemon\nYes indeed okay fact there's been some steps taken and that is going to get weird\nOh okay for the following\nA nothing plan right now and I usually have all kinds of regular customs anywhere it goes back\nTo what I've said before years ago that I always worried that there'd be a serious story and I'd be dressed like an adult\nOr little ... and ... every time I watch the today show they get dressed up and do great jobs with their costumes but then you just hope that something doesn't happen where then what do you do\nYou change out of your ... you can do a serious sit down interview with somebody and you're just like Shrek\n[laughter] you know Matt and [laughter] you know ... a big story broke right now and you're sitting there wearing a Gombe outfit you just\n... and so I I Know that we can pick and choose what we want to cover but I worry that if something happened or somebody passed away and then you're there with a goofy costume on that's why I don't get dressed up but I was never a costume guy growing up\nDid you go and you were anything I Would get one of those black plastic ... a mask that would be\nDon't remember I think I had a like a Yogi Bear\nMask and that was it\nDid you go a pillow case for your candy or like a trash bag I went to look is yeah yeah that was the move or ... I saw a small town in the mid west outlawed um trick or treating for anyone over the age of twelve if they're either in high school or over the age of twelve it's illegal in a small town illegal illegal Yogi cited\nA rich recording do you think that's the cutoff eighth grade slash well we talked\nAbout this um if you're a teenager shouldn't be you'd be trick or treating think high schools to cut off you can't do it when you're a freshman in high school so if you're fourteen you shouldn't be able to go Thirteen well maybe it is is it\nTwelve Thirteen if you've ever shamed\nYeah but I don't think you can go I could have been trick or treat until out yeah twenty seven I if I had a saying if you've seen first she really had to stop blaming it now I I did I but come on and then they have a cat I'm haven't forgotten [laughter] I thought\nWe said when you became a teenager then you couldn't do it\nBecause there are times when somebody will show up to your daughter it'd be like a jerk trigger during the ... ah yeah guys pulled out some smokes a yo yo just put it in the background\n[laughter]\nI'm grant and North Carolina Hi grant way out for me today\nAnd first on longtime six

uh I have a quarter back then and you know we love our Iowa quarterbacks need Stanley Twenty one for thirty three three twenty six touchdowns for Iowa over Indiana\nShe know counter best and worst of the week in my best of the weekend or you know had doing weight and Kevin Hart have a sort of a little bit of a feud going on I think it's friendly but they're always talking trash to each other and but this weekend a Kevin Hart was playing a show in Miami I guess in Twain we'd present to them what the Jersey uh customize dirty but as a child\nI [laughter] yeah\nIt's all areas [laughter] [laughter] it's a little tiny period and he was it loose on it [laughter] so\nWhy do you watch the way in weight ... is like the whole game over this little tiny thing or it's great and my horse over the weekend was stupid West Virginia oh that's all right ... ... feet and came in wills are here yeah yeah\n... you're now in the Iowa State bandwagon oh my gosh you got your Heisman Trophy winner down the re would beat the Broncos [laughter]\nA\nCouple of phone calls here best and worst of the weekend ah the bill in Florida Hi Bill\nGood morning Dan I'm not really on today right great what do you have\nSix three a robust two Seventy five [laughter] [noise]\nMy best over the weekend sham Donald my worst of the weekend Sam Donald is not the quarterback for the New York giants\n[laughter] thank you bill yeah whenever Sam Darnell does well that's when giants fans go he could have been ours and they could have been recorded but\nIf if sake one Barclay continues to do what he's doing he could lead the league an all purpose yards\nAnd that's I think it only happened twice in NFL history where a rookie running back and Eric Dickerson and ... and James ah Jake in Wisconsin hey Jake\nPut up giving him on it and that sort of slightly ... played by us as being a little park all we kept on\nIt sounds like it Jake [laughter] it's a rough week I've been getting a break [laughter] I'm like well yeah\nIt was so much for forty five thousand channels just falls crazy and kind of gave away a little chewed which sucks but worse for the weekend so late they have to be a vote tomorrow night I Belong to Metallica effort needs a box or a little ... I got ... bucks affects affects back\nYeah but you don't you don't have to be there you choose to be like you make it sound like oh I have to be in limbo tonight\n[laughter] well I mean can the U.S [noise] so what would you edited would you rather watch ... or ... or would you rather be at all these other things\nOh man well I think that's where you have confidence in your team that they'll win and then that way you can take in the Packers foo fighters and Metallica\nThat would be what I Would do Matt in California I'm at ... about three to forty five [noise]\nBad would definitely be a the minute Troy getting it done to get the number of Nineteen undefeated Colorado\nThe worst absolute we're finding out the ah the is an ending injury to Puerto ... in which a and the er at the as well\nThey have a dynamic back who everybody focuses on their mobile quarterback so huge that use the running and both legs to Arpaio's let him make easy throws and build it around running game I I thought they were very creative and I thought they did a good job last night\nWhat happened to Jacksonville back to back weeks here\n[noise] you know I I think it's playing on the ... number one\nOr not having that home crowd noise that ... a little bit of weight from you and if the plan mobile quarterback or they cut you off on people that can sit in the pocket when they know you're going to be seven narrows the they have a lot of weapons to come after you but the fact that they didn't know where my house was going to be necessarily they didn't know where attack what's going to be\nThat slow their rest stop and as much as ... as he wants to think they've got great cover guys back there\nThere's a fence was built on the rush\nYeah I just you know and then jailing Ramsey who you know loves find in the microphone had nothing to say after refused to talk about\nAnything there and I and I just it it seems like it's a little tricky there which actually will know for net um you still have the Blake Bordeaux situation 'cause that's you know you're not sure what you're getting week to week uh we handle\nNot having foreign that really hurts play board all because they can't just like with the cowboys when you're going to play Dallas you're going to take away is they kill Eliot that's their game plan when you go into like Jacksonville you're going to take away Leonard form that unless he's not in it you know now all of sudden\nThey're saying different covers as you are seeing hate math Francois you got easy going along throws so not had a or another\nBut it puts a lot more pressure on on board and not think that's why we send you up and not performed on foreign that gets back they're able to pound the ball and everybody says okay we got to go back to stop the inside Iran games you'll see photos of put a better numbers\n[noise] he's Tony done gee NBC football night America hall of famer joining us damn Patrick show would you consider this is this out of the question that the jags would call the giants and just ask about Eli Manning given Tom Coughlin relationship with the lie what do you think of that possibility\n[noise] you know it I think they believe in Blake borders I really do I think they feel like when they got their formulas they they don't need a lot a calm called that might present that it might be a win win situation for both things you know it would help the giants out and it probably would help the ... so\nI'm just wondering about that because I\nLook at the AFC ... you know the NFC ... you've got the rams are great uh the saints are very good um who else would you throw in there and the NFC\nBut I think Minnesota as good a Green Bay has the potential to be a good one routes as as one hundred percent I'm healthy\nUm but again I I look at this leak away at school and now you got the playoffs and you got to be a dynamic you know that the Carolina Panthers get into the super bowl with a great day fats and spotty all fenced Seattle getting there with those great defenses Denver\nGetting there and winning it with a great defense I just don't see that happening any more I look at it sparks Mike Tomlin is a very good defense the coach knew England Bill Belichick is a very good defensive coach he's got his own advocate they've had says\nNah it said you know what we can't win that way and the more we've got to put all the money on all sense we've ... we've got to al ... and you're you're just saying it\nAll over and and I think that's what you have to do what you got to get a quarterback that can make plays and you've got to be able to put on the board if you want to be a contender and I just don't see that many dynamic all fences and the AFC\nWell with that being said with the baggage that lady on bell would bring into the Steelers do you need him if you're going to be one of those teams\nI think they do they're getting great play out it's kind of but he's still not late ... and the way their defense is\nThey're going to have to put up a ton of points if if they play the New England or kept his city we already saw that against Kansas City they could keep up with them scored New England will be the same way so they ... they need that extra kick in November and December ... to give them another weapon I think the native\nBut how do you usually Toni if he's only he's going to be counting his to choose as if to say hey here's a magical number I don't want to go above that because I Want to protect my body so I get another contract with another team like that\nYeah that that's the tough thing I I don't know that you can play with a guy who got at attitudes um it it just wouldn't be good it's a it's may ... author situation [noise] and and football so I don't know what you do but I think that they need to have a third of it is a chance\nBut would you want him if you're ... ... what do you maintain way\nThere's yeah but I don't know if it could even work\nYeah I still get the feeling he's going to be traded I and I mean maybe I'm naive on it I just it feels like even if he comes in and just going to be weird when he comes in because I don't know if he's going to sit out a game because he may not be interviewed may just say you know what I Want to play and then we won't know\nKnow that there there is somebody that that would take him and feel like he would ask just what they need to be that dynamic all fence so I I think that trade as a possibility\n[noise] John good to talk to you tell Rodney in the boys are I said hello and uh we'll talk lose All right we'll say that\nIt was one I'd stony done jeep up all night America now I just I still feel like the Steelers are going to move in but I don't I don't know what the asking price is we've been told that Buffalo's asking price for lead me on ... or a ... and ... on\nA continental tire coaches corner and brings you are only don't you know let me see ...\nIsn't the top part for the CEOs that now that you're playoff not play of eligible butts in the contention again\nYou need everybody guy and you don't have may not have the luxury to be able to train them [noise] you just have to eat it and pay and ... and he takes off on you\nBut I I just don't know what I'm getting my guess what I'm saying is like if they traded him in James Connor twist his ankle and the management in trouble\nBut what if and when you bring back maybe on bill and he twist his ankle and then he's done it's kind of apples and oranges to know you still got a ham yeah apples and oranges but Nick ... who is a bargain yeah\nWhen you consider any help you win the Superbowl lady on bill don't even want to be there next year\nSo how old is he going to be all those last eight nine games I ... I just can't see it if your whole logic is let me reduce the number of tattoos and yeah so I'm going to give up all this money then you come back now how many carries can we give you how many touches can we give you because\nThen he leaned illegal touches last year he has over four hundred so now I'm going to give him at least two hundred over the last nine games I I Can't imagine or ten games I just can't imagine where he's going to want to play and play hard for every one of those games\nAnd whenever he gets Nick dump is he really mixed up if he sits down\nIs he really sitting out if he doesn't ... like I I don't know it's there's a whole lot going on there I I don't know if I could trust him from a coaching standpoint teammate wise would be tough to but it feels like once you're on the field you're going to want to perform you hope but coaching wise\nYou know I don't want to be second guessing or eat you know first guessing\nAnd and you know I got a running back now he's not leaving on bell but nobody is but I Know that he comes in he plays hard and he's and he's you know he might be one dimensional but he's still had to ease had a couple of good games\nI don't know I Would probably stay that way and if I could squeeze out a couple of ... and I'd probably do that because he's not going to be there next year\nI Know you need him this year and the AFC is wide open\nA new Steelers could easily be the class but\nIf that even you know it was cool moment Ryan cheesier on the field or for the Bengals games because he had gotten injured they're against the Bengals says as a cool moment now yesterday I Will take a break last call for phone calls will get two of those coming up Dan Patrick Joe [noise]\n\n\nWe're in the thick of the football season as you know I have to say that my tailgating game could use a little spark so instead of calling the same old place I'm stealing from triggers diverse playbook aboard Byard recipes hundreds it'd be easy to follow recipes available for free at ... dot com slash recipes or\nGo to the trigger rap no need for a trick play just running up the middle with good old fashioned classics like pulled pork and brisket ribs and my favorite smuggling by the way\nIf you go to trigger girls dot com slash recipes you knew type and Dan Patrick in the search bar\nYou will find over a dozen D.
