of the shot out of ... that has the Eighteenth right talk guys at six and one for the year at three in one of the big cut west\nThis is ... ... ... at the office of light and set it points out how focus the players are at practice\nWe come out every day and I'm just keep trying to get better we know people are gonna try to stop her outside running game in a uh basically what we catch ideas and make it come down to us you know it's not what they're going to do it's what we do and I think that's what we've done a good job of a friend just keep going keep going to work in a just working on finishing blocks and getting their running back from space\nI old age the big ... allowed with six\nThree guys inside the three seen as they have done a good job is pushing people forward and uh when it comes down to the one on one block so you've got to make I think we've done a good job and I said just consistency and we know or how each other plays in the you know the feel the game and we just work well together a friend just need to keep a continue that going forward\nYou know ... ... ... you know during the early in the game they would they would kind of war and you and say\nHey be careful with moving the ball around like that you know we're gonna fly for something they do it a lot with the quarterbacks when they're in shock on and you see a moving their hands I've seen the referees go up to even Drew Brees a couple of nights ago and they said hey when you when you're calling for the heart count don't move your hands or I'm gonna call you for a false start\nYou know at this overshadowed a bigger problem with the cowboys and the conservative play calling Jason Garrett yeah I mean you have a time out you have time in your only squeezing off a couple of plays there I was surprised at that John what I mean it does he not have confidence index Prescott\n[noise] yeah I thought they wasted I mean I think they had the ball fifty two seconds um and and and maybe one or two time outs and you know they definitely could have taken a shot down field and\nYou know hey look let's throw throw one out of the back of the end zone if it's not there but let's let's at least stressed the defense maybe somebody slips maybe somebody's falls down so\nI think in that position you always want to take a shot um I think we've seen Jason Garrett get taken to task a couple of times already this year for being too conservative not going forward on Fort down earlier this year so I think that's just his coaching style\nUm I I think time management has not been his four to and I feel like every year we are talking about at least two or three games where they could have used their time a better a but even even before all that\nYou know I just I don't understand why is it is not more of an emphasis we can all week out because their defenses playing pretty good yeah and\nYou know there are all sorts of line has actually struggled this year in past protection and any of a sudden salon at a struggling to protect the the quarter back the way you give them confidence the way you give them some rhythm is just run the football and they refuse to do it\nA shot O'Hare of the NFL Network analyst former Superbowl champs with the giants the jags or a mess right now certainly in quarterback\nA Blake mortals getting benched Cody Kessler comes in this team that obviously had Superbowl aspirations are fighting in the locker room here can you solve is by bringing in another quarterback Colin Kaepernick maybe trading for Eli Manning is there a quick fix year for the Jacksonville jags\nNo no there's not really to be honest with the the biggest surprise of all is this deep is because they're healthy you know the often ... they've already gone through two left tackles camera and blue and the out against the patriots Josh Wells are back left tackle who came in and played well he got hurt\nThings are so bad they signed Eric flowers of all people and if you think about the injuries that the running backs they just trade it for Carlos Hyde on what a friday and\nI'm so things they're getting ravaged by injuries on on all fence and Blake morals is always kind of been the whipping boy down there for for when things go bad all sorts of Lee but this defense I mean I don't know what the world's going on with them\nBut but John and I said you were the GM and today you know we were what do we eight days away from the trade deadline how do you address your quarterbacking situation Jacksonville\nWell I don't I don't know that that's a quick fix and that's kind of why I'm saying if you as a franchise if the Jacksonville Jaguars are sitting there saying hey we need to go out and get a quarterback and that's going to fix our issues right now if they can't protect their quarterback so I don't care who it is back there um\nYou know if if you're struggling protect him and and they're on their third left tackle now um they they've been given up and they have been able to run the football very well too so [noise] you know the office is not clicking that they could certainly use a spark\nReach out to Eli Manning would you reach out to the giants [noise]\nYeah I mean I'm sure that there have I'm sure there's lots of conversations that go on but the tough thing for Jacksonville is what are you going to give up and\nAnd where are you going to give up anything [noise]\n[noise] right well you're gonna have to give up something if you want to if you want to trade for a quarterback like Eli Manning or or you know somebody that's going to come in and and provide you with some stability um\nBut I don't think that they're not giving up much they don't want to give up much to get ... [noise]\nBut I don't I don't think ... is done yet and I know everybody has kind of being him up too but um I don't think the giants are in any position to to trade him away either right now\nAnd you know if you if you want to go from the pan into the fire throw rookie quarterback behind the giants all friends of mine right now I'm so it's there there's a lot of ... I Know there's a lot of\nPeople that probably look at Jackson will say man there one quarter\nBack away from being a better team I don't look at him like that when I see what offensively that the way they got to change the game last year Dan\nWas they were in the heck out of the ball for net was getting twenty eight carries a game like boils was throwing the ball Seventeen times you know and then every once in a while it was a throw it to a tight in here and there at the end they played great defense they're not doing either one of those things so it to me it's not just about the quarterback\nWhat about Colin Kaepernick\n[noise] um [noise] I mean I don't know of calling cabinet wants to play football you know I mean I I've I've heard from a number of people that he'd been offered opportunities to come in and\nHe refuses to sign a one year deal I mean I I don't know all of the logistics um you know I I Know that there's got to be opportunities out there for somebody to to bring him in but\nUm you know I'll say this the last film that I was on call a cab brick when he was in San Francisco Blaine guy ever was playing better than him\nAnd that's the last memory that I have of him throwing the football the the inaccurate throws a yes he's athletic and he can run the football but um you know I I don't I don't know where he fits in the end of the passing game of any office right now\nI'll leave you with is the lady on bill situation a when you do think that he shows up in place for the student\n[noise] I thought he would have been there by now um you know even if you know look there's a lot of different ways to handle this I feel like you know certainly I Would have gone out on the by week at least gotten one paycheck you know even even even if you go in you know by a week if you take one of those paychecks and then\nYou know maybe you're trained a hamstring mysteriously in practice um and then you sit on the bench I don't know I mean maybe maybe he doesn't want to do that but\nIn the business side of this has gotten I mean it's gone on so much longer than I thought and I think his team\nIn West she's going to be a starter I just I just think it hurts the brand and it is a brand now I\nThink that he liked to be in a martyr um you know it's the older I get the better why was you know when you look back on what he was doing when he was doing it at the end of his playing days he wasn't great me lost out you know he lost his job to blame gathered and he hasn't played in a while I\nThink the fact that we're going to have some magic dust he's going to come back and he's going to be great uh I I think you'll be fun he'll make some place but I don't I don't think he's a great quarterback\nAnd I think with what he has in mind with the rest of his life the bigger picture it's not about playing football I don't think so David in South Carolina and he's thirty one a day but in South Carolina Hi David good morning what do you have\nA deep sea sworn into twenty [noise]\nThis is a week in Ohio State and blown out and second the\nPanthers cause weight in the fourth quarter comeback against the eagles\nAlright well thank you David the no need for a anything other than that a lot of people it was like the cowboys in Ohio State\nIt feels like that's part of you know somebody's best that the cowboys loss and or Ohio State lost I was going to read you something from pat forty who covers a college football for a Yahoo and he was talking about Ohio State and the column is what's wrong with Ohio State\nHe says in the face of adversity the buckeyes lacked poised they lacked resilience they lacked a plan B they lack daring they don't lose scratching and clawing they lose rolling over\nHe's right Ohio State didn't go down fighting in that game in my opinion\nThat fourth quarter and Purdue made plays I mean that was that's they're Super Bowl they have one of these wins it feels like you know every other decade and give them credit because this is Tina last eastern Michigan earlier in the year\nBut they they had momentum of Ohio State ran up numbers I Can't have my quarterback throwing Seventy times\nIt's not a record you want to encourage street said that during the game Herbie will join us in the final hour the show but Purdue getting the win and that's a big one I also I don't know anything other than what I'm telling you and what I see I Would be concerned about urban Meyer self he does not look healthy\nAnd I know there's been a lot on his mind a lot of things that happened earlier in the season prior to that started the season\nAnd its self inflicted but he doesn't look healthy\nAnd while I was watching in real time when he collapsed on the sidelines there and at the time I think they said oh I think he ran into a camera man\nYou know that there's a couple of weeks ago so I don't know I just I watched it and then I he just doesn't look healthy there but for food producers deserved to win in Ohio State a sort of rolled over yeah boy\nThat was a full field storming you looked at the stance about eight minutes after it was over and there was about four people left in the stands who decided not to Russia they tend to not have the fine for students rushing the field FCC does this conference by conference so produce got in trouble for Russia in the field oh I was thinking\nRight away I go on as soon as I saw it I'm going well that's worth a hundred thousand dollars going to go find me or do they deserve that fresh McLaughlin what poll question we're going with today\nOkay how did this one which headline is least surprising that Blake ... implodes in Jacksonville Jason Garrett will be criticized for his play calling\nAnd Patrick my home's rewrites the record book the rams are the last\nUndefeated team or that the bills have one of the Warsaw fences and you had a history literally it's a that's not an exaggeration which one would you not seeing coming into the season\nDid you see Bordeaux that's kinda the question\nUm\nI didn't know if it would be this bad where you get benched\nBecause I thought that you know the defense is good and although I didn't like the fact that they didn't have great skill position guys from towards wide receivers with foreign at back there you know that I mean that's\nThat really is the key when you run the football and you limit his throes to twenty or less than you are going to win games with the defense\nFor phone calls coming up Chris Weber on the Lakers rockets fight incurred street a little bit later on [noise]\nIf you've had a

I don't believe abstraction rushing out\nNow incumbent Republican governor there Kim Reynolds when asked to elaborate on what taxes he would do away with as governor credible said he'd do away with those for the wealthy\n... who are in the middle class at a low income categories of small businesses they're the ones that deserve a tax cuts all the governor's plans put all the money into the hands of big corporations and wealthy ... they don't need the tax cuts\nNo third candidate libertarian Jake Porter will face off against Reynolds and Hubble and the November ... election he wasn't invited to the debate because he didn't meet the standards for raising money in polling that debate sponsored by K W ... television in the quad cities and the great television stations in Iowa\nNew yeah\nDavid as young guys to come and play because of the second year plan it might be your best three point shooters so you know I can adjust to that as a coach I could take him out the game and see who else who else to step up so I don't see them making the playoffs however with all the bronze anything's possible on his team but I Do think they'll have to make a trait to get the shooter too\nBut that's what I Wonder if they get to a point where they're not playing well and I'm not going to say panic but you feel like you have to make a move and then they make a move but the ... now I I'm saying hey just enjoy this year\nDon't expect a lot just enjoy it I don't know if because it's the Lakers each LeBron and magic there and they go you know what we got to shake this up a little bit here and then you run that risk uh do you get rid of some of these younger kids and I'd be against that when you think\nWill be careful and you're making sense so you might lose fans around 'cause a ... that's that's what should happen you know mark asked me what ... what would be successful at his team this year I said it's armed with a barrage of age have already signed them the fans are back so issues you know\nIf this is a four year movie and you went to the championships out of it it doesn't matter when it comes but you mess up the whole thing when if you go out and panic maybe like they did go on to get out there Thomas in Cleveland you want that situation again so I agree\nWholeheartedly that was my point of emphasis let these young guys grow a brand new England\nWho's with these young guys get to be around the bronze for one whole year wait till next year what happens if they do go get a\nA Duran of co why you know someone like that so I'm I'm with you do not go out and trying to make sure that you uh get a nice free agent but Lincoln magic I'm sure there with that there used to criticism and fake criticism so hopefully they're going to end but again I'm a yeah I think it's just going to be tough but this team were there shooting in the way that\nIs kind of a talent or to make the\nPlayoffs there was a report over the weekend where there were there was chatter I guess a inside NBA with a GM or players saying that LeBron has lost a little bit of tread on the tires there\nHave you noticed anything about the brand that he's not leave you know the old the brawn he just an old Ron\nHe's in all the Bronx and uh oh the broad who's still top three in the NBA who's better than the Bronx\nSo better as relatives [laughter] I don't know who's better uh who will make my whole team better I don't know anyone that averages as many points and assist as he does a in a league right now the only one\nThat will James Harden\n... yeah but but he's not as efficient homes and and he handles\nThe ball a little bit too much so that I mean to rent to me is it still is the best score maybe that is going to be the best quarter to legalize same I still see curry but on the sense you know if it was just curry scene of card was on the Charlotte it'd be hard for him to stop all the brown and be that these has to stop or to the Bronx to be at the end so because of the size of knowledge\nI still say there's there's no one better but um it's just fifteenth yeah of course you're not going to jumpers high or is not going to you know in the west coast you run a lot more and so he needs younger players to help them take plays off like players doing there for your crime he just has never been\nA you know you just never been afforded that luxury and so um you know it's tough I I don't know anyone I Would say that's better than the brown but there are a lot of players I Would say definitely because they can do so much\nYou know we had Barkley I'm Barkley said the James Harden if he wanted to could average fifty a game\nI don't know about fifty but [noise] forty two to four to five he could definitely\nDo that I mean last night I was watching him I've never seen anything like it I mean Korea's so dynamic\nWhich is the and dribbling around and and doing you know it's best curly near little imitation stepping back hitting the crazy shot and turned around before it goes in our lives almost the opposite he's slow methodical you're going to use the ... he's going to attack their front for it they're going to say don't let 'em go left and then you're going to go right like five times\nYou're going to forget is going to go for the rest of the guys be such a great passer that little ugly Nineteen forty five lay up\nThat he does and then that left concerning like alleyoop at the same time\nAnd you don't know what then they'll come down to dunk or you so hard is one of my favorite players and I've been criticized for having to be one of my favorite players but I just don't know defensively has a big man\nHow you stop them I don't know how as a guard how you stop all these cars handles are incredible and yet he gets to the lives so much and that's what we don't realize he's the one man's house break so just the fact that he gets to the line he takes contact that he can get twelve to twenty free throws like oh you're definitely on\nIf he was in Charlotte he he could have is forty five on this team he could've but they wouldn't wouldn't allow shot up yeah definitely ... I was close to ...\nYeah it is amazing when you watch ... and there are certain players where you watch and you go I just don't get how they do it Steve Nash who was always that way that if you if you met Steve Nash you go how's that guy doing it\nAnd and and then you would see him in harden is like that with me too I just watch and I go I don't get I Know it's common and I can't do anything about it\n... just like a slow motion move right there's you know I used to say we're early jobs just give them a blindfold a cigarette you know in the playoffs because you have to defend the euro is you're at his ... his co workers so good I mean he's\nStrong too yeah the different body you know his body seems like he doesn't have a big show so he's not there must be as big shoulders and he's very quick easy doesn't have to be fast but he's so quick and explosive and you're right you know the play this\nComing to see it with your hand in his\nFace and it it really still does a lot\nOn this uh gee league a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars coming out of high school and the elite players which you've done it\n[noise] I I don't know I'm I have to think about that little bit more because see the good thing when I play like in high school you know ... those guys will come up to play against like Derrick Coleman and at\nA gym costs ... shut outs everybody's watching everybody there but there was like my G. leagues so I remember when I go to the story about Libya like fourteen and and we got the plague us a call ... those guys I remember\nIn ... I don't know about them and I'm just destroying as to where the fans after the game came over console loose and I remember going to lock the lights that was the best beat down never look we can I can actually should lay up all this guy could\nLose it was like playing against them was like okay this\nIs how good I Need to get this where I Need to do for next year and I don't know if it with a bunch of guys with my skill set four hundred and twenty five would make me do that I can go overseas and play against some great players and better competition I things about the competition not necessarily who's being babysat with you so I don't I don't know I\nI really don't know the answer to that costs yeah but I Do know that we're not play being able to play against the pros let me know how much further I had to go and I don't see these guys getting to play with the pros and the NBA team which is just as good guys overseas are running ... getting ready to try to um try to join a team as a free agent so I'm not sure about\nBut you could have come out of high school and gone to the NBA if he had that chance would your data bland\n[noise] while in this culture yes book coming out like as a sophomore it was the scariest thing over because I mean there's a long time ago this was what Ninety three foot since then like Ninety\nThree I was the first off more to go number one says magic\nIs Seventy nine so that's how long it had been shack wait until he was Julia Christian late into the best college player in in my in my\nSenior plan or my lifetime he waited two senior year so it was such a different culture that when when I left it felt really weird like you you ... you can go and you're ready but you don't belong and so you get to this age so yeah it's a day definitely as cultural change but back then uh\nThat that would have been that was unheard of even though again we were playing against the pros of high school we just didn't we didn't know that it was okay and therefore they never really popped into my mind but yeah I Would definitely go today if uh if I knew I was guaranteed to be a top seven pick\nCould eventually with his see Web thanks for joining us as

weren't you saw the scene after the game on a tire fan base on the field or those moments in college football on trying to get out of there I mean it was it's kind of what you would expect it it's like I'm\nGoing back to UT at the ghetto after the flyers just want a huge game you know and it's it's kind of scene makes college football so you they can\nAh they were they were obviously fired up about that big upset\nI mentioned it on this day a couple of years ago ... went against a Baker Mayfield I'm a home so I think through Seventy two times where do you know I I Know we look at the mall homes now and everybody goes oh I saw all of his greatness year do you remember the ... do you remember the first time you saw in the homes and what your reaction was\nYou know what I I I\nDo remember and I thought it was just another Texas Tech quarterback or in his sister was telling all around\nFifty sixty Seventy times and they really think much about it I I I I've I personally have a hard time\n... says tech\nAir raid quarterbacks and how they're going to fit in the NFL and to their credit NFL his ... is as we see with Kansas City\nLA um Chicago ... ... cases with gravy enduring when are we saying listen and becoming a little bit more like college football and it took about ... who grew up in the west coast off ... square him to recognize stingy the game\nAnd instead of saying just being on the west coast guy just by all sense he decides to tweak case is system\nTo his quarterback strengths and the rest is history I mean I I'm a I'm a bangles fan and I watched that game last night it was just felt bad for electric and try to defend the playmate cruise around homes but uh I would've never asked anybody could have ever told you\nPatch world is going to become what he is now a any NFL because it was so hard to predict how do these air raid quarterbacks transition\nInto the NFL where they're going to drop back seven steps in the pocket read the parents is you know and it's it's not many of them do well and and this guy obviously use is off to his tape brilliant career\nGood stuff for me and thanks for being honest about Patrick moms because now I'm hearing everybody going on I knew this guy was going to be great\nNo nobody knew it knowing that I mean\n... might have known it when he was a rookie because people saw with Kansas City was doing with their office but tell me that any difference between what he was doing and every single guy with the last eight or ten years in Texas Tech solve ...\nIt was ... he deserves a lot of credit for a special

opinion\nI think there would light to be honest with you I I'm a little surprised by some of the feedback within the league and in fact last night\nI went out to the clippers rockets game and caught up with doc rivers a little bit afterward and I wanted to get docks opinion on that question if if he thought it was light and if as a coach\nYou had any concern across the league that you know if if you put yourself in the players shoes are they still going to have the mentality of and nobody wants to fight mislead because it costs you so much money so I'm the one hand\nI Know it still costs you guys a lot of money but I feel as if the league is playing that card too much meaning you know they will they will tell the media like hey listen Chris last X amount brand and a lot of action out here it's a lot of money that\nThese guys make an incredible about and I think the player perspective more likely is All right if I have a problem in a game and I'm really upset with the guy now in my head like I'm probably going to get to games and I think maybe I'm okay with that because the students were really taken me off\nLike I you know that's where my head is that I think it could lead to more on the court stuff doctors agreed doc thought that they they essentially got it right and that uh you know they didn't need to go in the harder it is good for the league\nA man I don't know that you can almost depends on what comes next in a vacuum\nYes but you know and it made me think of that and this is maybe a rage is\nYou know and I'm not a U.S see guys apologize if I get any of the details wrong but like the McGregor you know can be a situation like like you know when you have controversy when you have over the top\nYou know stuff like this entertainment wise entertainment value speaking it's it's great for that entity because it draws interest I get in a you know a car yesterday that to just get a a lift ride to the arena and the guys talking to me about what happened everybody's talking about what happened so the NBA is front and center but you know if it does open that door\nTo more stuff like this then you have it becomes a turn off to a certain audience then business wise you are I think you end up taking a data a negative road\nI Know it's a small sample size but uh the product on the floor for the Lakers what do what do you like what concerns you\nI like the athleticism like\nUm you know the the tempo the it honestly is a guy who it's it's a lot of it's we're we almost in the media were afraid to use the word fun like I Can't ever admit that you're having a good time it is fun to watch the impact all abroad has on how their basketball players so I think that is\nEnjoyable because you already see the ripple effect that this president's\nAh put the you know what I Do like shooting an obvious problem ... going to be a problem\nLack of big men obviously a problem leaning on juvenile muggy\nWay too much I get into a veil credit for having carved out the career that he has at this point I mean the guy's got rings that guys now playing with rubber on that's fantastic but you know the other night in that game and you're you're looking at it and I'll tentatively I mean they were featuring ...\nNow I Know pretty routine and you know what are we looking at here and\nI'm and I'm not even trying to play that car to you know the he's not a punch line but look on the floor like what what we're we're featuring jail and then he's playing big minutes and then you know so that those are problems and there I think honestly in terms of the context of the season\nThis is this is just really a disaster for that right now when you're losing ... from the way they are and maybe getting off to a really tough start because when we would all debate about whether or not the Lakers were going to make the playoffs\nEverybody thought we were crazy for saying maybe they don't like what was the whole supply like you can't get off to a bad start in the western conference you can't recover like you can in the east and right now they're facing that kind of a prospect\nI'll leave me with this that sort of a few whispers there about the brawn James leaving Cleveland and maybe it was you know he'd lost a little trade off the tires ... and that kind of kicking him on the way out what do you make these whispers about Iran and is a abilities his talent level now\n[noise] um I mean that's just that's that's the league I mean that happens every time a guy heads for the exits are you know I'm not saying it you know the guy is is it an incredibly high level and\nYou know it's still the best playing the game and I think the other thing we're going to be looking at just all year long is is forget about how the cabs or the media might see a towel level it's out of his peers she has ... level and who's going to come join them next summer that's the number one thing he's got to find a way\nTo paint a pretty picture in LA to make sure that you know whoever I might be Anthony Davis\nYou know all the other usual suspects that might come next summer he's got to finish that job because if he doesn't it's going to be a lowly Laker experience and and you know and again the west is just so unforgiving that that he's got to get that part of the equation done\nBut don't you make it to you and how do they make I talked to Chris Weber about this story said\nYou you got to prevent yourself from overreacting if you're not playing greater you're on the outside of the playoff bubble\nAnd you make a deal I I wouldn't do anything this year unless I got somebody that I thought was going to help me big picture long term I don't want you know some band aid to come in to help me make the playoffs in the seventh seed or you got to plan stick with the plan and don't run that risk a do think that the lake\nErie out I mean I Would agree and I I think the list of guys\nWho would check both boxing is probably pretty short which is to say you know it would be part of long term plan but also something that you do right now I mean I there's I have no intel to indicate that they're in on the Jimmy butler stuff at all like\nYou know that type of a player conceivably would be the road you go out because you know you get an early crack at him as far as a prospective free agent like Paul George situation in Oklahoma City\nBut yeah you can't do any band aids at all of the season and they have the luxury which still amazes me\nThat not only did they get LeBron James but they got LeBron James coming in the door being very patient and sending the message to them that I don't want you to just go lose assets for the short term gain or the guy that I Wonder about and that there is already chatter about Islam into you know because you have teams around the league\nWho are now looking at him and say that we could really have to be part of our young core might be willing to give you something of value in return and you have to gauge\nThat value if a friend who's going to play most of the year\nA lot of those values going to go down then you've got to take that into consideration\nWhat if you said uh you know what we'll give you ... for Jay Jay Reddick straight up\nA I'm a I mean I Would think about it Jay Jay on the one hand you know father time it's something you gotta look at what Jay Jay's playing great but you know you see the way the Sixers had got away from him a little bit and you know to help mark ... tunnel along\nI guess I can have a ring guys in the back or do can shoot so I mean it doesn't make sense no
