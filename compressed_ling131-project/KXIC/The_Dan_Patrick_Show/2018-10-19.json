their fists all the time and say a tiger the integrity integrity [noise] nobody has been put out administrative leave nobody has been fired you know nothing's happened it's just a bunch of people saying hey you know nobody from the federal government has contacted us but we're really looking forward to great Caesar\nOr I don't really want to hear lectures from college it about a stranger sight or about what tech hurting me so it's really it's really laughable\nBut you got some names attached to this you know bill self his name attached to a twenty thousand dollar payment to recruit um normally coach it does it never gets to a head coach rare when it gets to a head coach it's almost like by accident had coaches named in something like this\nAh what John Williams shouldn't step dad a you know\nAllegedly asked for from Kansas so we like we are we going with this investigation and is anybody going to be put on probation or his eye on Williams ... ability and questioned it feels like there's there's a lot of money answered questions out there and I agree with you I don't know if anybody cares\nThey don't and there are a lot of unanswered questions a ton of 'em and I can tell you one thing they're not going to be answered\nThe seasons are part of it is because the government has asked the ... stand out as far as investigations are sharp but that doesn't mean individual schools can investigate the role players and and you know they're the truth is Dan ... there's there's really no way\nFor compliance to a ticket to the bottom of all this stuff um it's gotta be it's gotta be up to ... uh and and we're we're never going to get the answer is all this stuff all the all the players that are implicated right now are going to be long gone before this was ever subtle and and you know you can say\nLike what what more what a school needs to say hey we need to do something then then then evidence of their coach\nOr or or up an assistant coach putting out a wiretap\nAnd what do you do you need to be like CSI Miami to figure this out you don't it's it's clear not only what the implication is it's clear what this is it's ... whatever it is what it appears to be\nAnd I'm I'm just I'm surprised that we're getting all this nonsense about well you know the the\nThe federal government's not going to contact people in the middle of a trial that just as it happened so they're saying well we have a contract to get\nAs if the stuff that you know I was just this stuff doesn't matter it matters according to their rules and they say the rules are above everything that they believe in integrity and all this other stuff and you know the the ... made an announcement yesterday at ... at a state without a doubt type\n... coaches are revealed on wiretaps and its crickets out of Indianapolis then I'd find that I find that kind of hard to hard to stomach\n... bill is he is in college basketball enlist joining as I I'm just amazed at how much you know these um administrators educators terror about these kids from urban areas like we really really care about them only for one year\nInstead of saying if we really care and we wouldn't let them go right to the pros and you know then we wouldn't have these charade with college basketball but this comes down to I think it's just a billion dollar business and we need as many new and shiny toys as possible\nSo March Madness lives up to which building I mean does it come down to just add to the bottom line with a lot of this stuff here J.\nI think so but also down I think it goes deeper than that I think the ... were really like to see\nAll of the top prospects that are the quotes one and done not come to college at all so they can they can wash their hands of the whole thing\nAnd they can say we're about education where in my judgment if you're really about education Newark welcome everybody to college in and try to get them to do both to pursue their dream to be a professional and took it to get their education\nAnd you know that's what educate that's what true educators do\nAnd but all of this is being done in the name of money the NC double a will do whatever it takes so they do not have to pay that's all this is the there every argument as being tailored so they don't have to pay and none of it makes any sense\nAnd at a special like ... Schwartz is a terrific economist wrote a a an amazing article on debts and that sort of talked about how the ... all of us for all these years and they said move the goalposts Everytime record and under oath that I I think it's worth the read to to to\nIlluminate just how how bad these arguments are\nAre in favor of amateur it's which you know ... is does nothing for any athlete doesn't make them a better athlete that make up about a person doesn't make them better students we cared about education\nWe'd be incentivizing players to come to school in stay in school especially since the overwhelming majority of players in in college basketball or African American I I I think there is so I think there's a lot of things that are frankly shameful and the response as we have to there's\nA your former coach coach K.C Cole the investigation going on just a blip which I was I was really surprised than coach K would call it just a blip\nUh your reaction to that [noise]\nUh I Would differ with him on that I think it's far more than a blip or this has been going on for a long long time I think there's a lot of a lot of space between uplift\nAnd everybody was doing it I don't think uh I don't think anybody would argue that every single coaches doing it but uh but the idea that\nYou have the thirtieth best player in the country or thirtieth ranked player in the country getting a hundred thousand dollars a ticket a little and nobody else is getting that ah and that's just the ... I think is is uh uh I I Can't imagine that being true I I think anybody who's been around it\nUh would acknowledge that there's been cheating going on forever and at basketball and football I mean people seem to forget that\nYou know an agent paid Reggie Bush and you know camp knew there was there there's all kinds of cheating going out at football me one of the ways that it's being done now is with\nDebit cards with offshore or offshore accounts so they can't be traced this stuff is really sophisticated and uh and you know the government is trying to say that the the schools are victims when the school's coach isn't it a lot of these is this is not only know about it\nIn certain instances there in on it so I it's hard to imagine how they could be painted the victims and nobody really interesting to see what this jury does with that theory\nWait so these kids will get an ATM card\nAnd then they can take out money and that money is\nIs put in offshore so there is no trail\nYeah offshore accounts that's what I'm told I mean I don't I don't know uh you know I I'm not involved in that stuff but that's what I've been told over the years is that's the latest\nThing that's going on on the football aside and look you know I mean ... you know I've talked\nAbout the sport well we were in school you know posters were dishes Yani being part of the players by boosters now so it's become much more sophisticated now uh so it you know the answer all I could say well we really cleaned up the booster thing\nBut then they got on bad and the basketball side the shoe companies in grassroots basketball and all these things because the high school players and the college players are to the shoe companies more valuable than the crows they move more products on the pros do\nAnd so you know you eat and in football it\nIt's strange the mind to think that players are being paid at basketball and the the the sport that works it financially and basketball makes billions it but the sport that George said now everything's clean the last guy that the last guy that was caught cheating was camp to that at that Reggie Bush and everything else it's clear that that is laughable ... it's just not true\nYeah it's crazy I mean it it really is of of what it is and where it is and where it's going and I I just wonder is the clock ticking on the one and done is they're going to\nYeah but it's going to ... it's going to be in the next collective bargaining agreement so it'll be twenty two thousand Twenty one or two thousand and\nGoing onto you know so this is a nice stopgap you know the ... thing but the truth is Dan they're not going to put a limit on it so they're not going to make you stay in school for two or three years like they do it's football which is an old vestige but um ah what they're what will happen is you'll see players were classified like Marvin bag with or did last year and leave after one year anyway\nSo we're not going to be able to stop players after one year they'll just have a dozen or so may be more that take off but then you're going to have others that are gonna are going to blossom as freshmen and there will be gone after one year too but that's that's not going to eliminate the problem\nIs going to eliminate a few of the players and and that's the thing it's ... it's not problem solving\nIt's just player a movement of play a few players\nAnd what do you think of a brown would have been worse when the open market are going on like how are you\nTalking about like an under the table payment oh yeah\nOh a ton yeah but that's the thing down like that so so the monies flowing anyway and we're we're we develop this fiction that that we can stop the flow of money the multibillion dollar business and I always think about that movie ... park where the Jeff Goldblum character with with say\nLife finds a way and it's the same thing in this kind of business money fights away and you heard my my shop on this I mean if if this were really amateur\nWe wouldn't be selling his for billions of dollars like amateur sports don't make billions of dollars don't pay their coaches millions\nThis is professional not minor league it's major league and the only thing that is not professional ... is the Laker players are treated they they don't they don't have the same economic rights as the as the students they are going to school with who are allowed scholarships and whatever their talents combat in the marketplace it's it's really kind of a bizarre system but\nThe truth is like like we were saying before the fans don't care they just want their gates\nYou know it's like complex rail line that you know they don't care about how much coaches are paid up a tree line but they just want their games when they want their games they want to watch 'em they want to bet on them they want to enjoy them and they don't really care like I don't I didn't care whether the officials at the NFL got their pensions a few years ago I just wanted\nKnow they gossip all the time I got to do is find somebody you trust and then they'll say hey by the way best player on the board is Jason Tatum\nAnd I'm thinking if I Know then what is Philadelphia doing it Philadelphia really need more ...\nIf you had been ... did you like is she your your to guard that you gotta have or can I get a guy who can cover two or three different positions who can shoot came from a great program proved himself\nGreat work ethic and that's what was surprising about that\nMaybe they thought he was a compliment to him and he was going to be like to Steph Curry but then ... well that it turned out and shot yeah what yeah yeah\nIf you're going to have the complimentary Steph Curry you gotta have\nUp to outside show that I don't see him and it's like the data don't have the modern formula can they end up three points shooting to win the same with the Lakers don't you need that\nWell the Lakers though they don't have it this year but it's just this year that's why they\nDon't have it all boils down to just now with the Lakers\n'cause if you do that you're going to be disappointed look for growing you know they're going to be growing pains but look for growth here with this team and their style I don't know what their style is you want to do up tempo okay\nBut up temple usually means you're going to get open looks from three point range you don't have ... on three point shooters we know that so what is your game plan that's going to be the key for the Lakers sample\nGoing back back to the Sixers and mark helpful you remember last year we had on some reporters from Philly and they hinted that the team was covering per psychological issues that this guy had to have you been seeing a psychologist remember we covered this Fifteen Years ago with Rick and kill the star pitcher young pitcher who's Twenty years old and was the basically the rookie of the year as a pitcher\nFor the St Louis cardinals and then forgot how to pitch in and he was out of the game as a pitcher at what age\nTwenty one and he had to redo his career as a hitter and I think you feel sorry for anyone who it appears that could be more psychological and physical mark ... is riding\nWe've seen this with pictures before you go back to the blast to pitch for the pirates their guys Mackey ... couldn't throw the ball back from home plate to the pitcher's mound\nWhich was amazing couldn't trolling Jon Lester can't throw to first base he stopped trolling to first base he tried to bounce it I mean this happened and so I think I mean look at Charles Barkley got into his head and I played\nWith Barclay and people said how did you let Barclay beat you Barclay shutters Seventy nine in a celebrity ... shows a legitimate have been I shut an eighty one he shot a Seventy nine he beat me\nAnd then he got the ups now you know he'll shoot a Seventy nine on the front line but you know psychologically ... each you know that's a great\nLiterally gray area and that's between your ears and Marco folds forgot how to shoot or got hurt tried to you know needed a change of shot something but yeah I I he's there is an underdog quality to him but there was an underdog quality would Kwame Brown\nMichael all the candy great golden sometimes that number one overall pick there is an underdog field to them Tim Couch with the browns you know you were you looking you go now they got a long road or they're not as good as they should be you know David Carr getting crushed when he was playing quarterback so I I Do think you have\nSome sympathy even though you're the number one overall pick\nA ... that's a really good point I because I felt so bad for ... yeah you want and you know ... like you wanted them to do well\nLike you know certain guys and I think that more ... he's going to have to deal with this probably is entire career\nAnd I don't know how long that career is going to be I Will get phone calls coming up and a play of the day or we already gave you stay out of the day we got a few of those coming up Christians will\nJoin us we'll talk some football with him [noise] Denver's win last night at Arizona by thirty five points that's the

never got caught sleeping on there but thank you\nUh uh\nI I agree with her all as far as Marco also um you can't say I'm a kid gloves I mean I I don't remember the ... exactly but you remember it was a school she was quoted as saying like he's\nToo good for college basketball or something along those lines like Rick ... he'll never said I'm the best pitcher and the rotation Charles Berkeley unfair didn't say I'm the best sulfur alive it's just a weird situation I think the kid needs to figure it out soon I mean it could cost the Seventy Sixers season\nRight but I think your brand it well it was a young kid when he said and and if he did say that then All right he got humbled here he's getting humble he's getting embarrassed I Hope he finds you I Want to know how good he is\nAs a basketball fan I just want to know how it ... when he when he finds who shot and I pride myself on finding these guys early I came in\nProbably you know one or two games into their college season and I said I watch mark ... last night and he's the first round draft pick a that was based on what I saw only a couple of games there by Washington\nBut he lost something he lost his jump you know same thing with Trey young I think he put up forty against Portland and I'm Talking about you know university report like came in and I said man this guy is so much fun I don't know how good he is but he's fun so we do keep an eye on it it's not like I'm watching him now in the pros I saw him\nYou know he attacked in college and yeah they won nine games but you know I there's part of me that would like to find having find new shot\nI Can't imagine what that feeling is like where you lose it and then you don't know how to get it back and you're doing it on display like on a nightly basis and you can see him the defense is leaving him wide open\nIn his mind he's like I'm supposed to take it I'm supposed to make it and then he he can and\nCan't pull the trigger so it's frustrating to watch that any great player or the potential for greatness and not be able to fulfill that no matter how cocky he was in high school\nHe's struggling now and he's been humbled ... can get by and be an all star and not hit
