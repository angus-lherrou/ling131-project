video surrounding ... they're all in on him and they could win this weekend\nIn Atlanta oh boy if the if the Atlanta falls to one in five then I can see how they are not how they're not going to be

going to start\nLosing the games that they are shocking everybody by winning I don't know that might be a a ... the jets have a chance to be top five again if they fall flat\nAnd the other one is whoever was shortstop after Derek Jeter and ... came in and\nIt has been seamless\nAlso helps to have you know judge and Sanchez take some pressure off you but he's been terrific he's not going

to Coughlin in Jacksonville and wins is Super Bowl and gets protection that any he's got a players around them but they're all selfish\nThe on no leadership in there all the only one that humble humble person out there and ...\nAnd at least they've got him David thanks for the call that's what I said before when we walked through the entire scheduled didn't we where would they have put Sam Donaldson this season if they weren't going to start with him which they weren't going to do and I want to maybe\nBut they were they they knew they had a chance to win a game and used and against the team that are also started on two they were not going to put their just they were going to keep you lie in there then he wins that would've been after the the the last to New Orleans at one in three probably we're not going to throw Sam Donaldson first career start against the eagles\nAnd home right\nNow it's ... and that was certainly they weren't um pardon me that we're not going to throw him in Carolina\nA Carolina team coming off of a by week now against Caroline on the road none of that could still one in three is still a viable season right when he manning would they have thrown them

but the fact is the older you get\nPittsburgh was still probably might be better\nBecause he's more he's he's a little bit more mobile um but I've always liked being I think Ben is one of those quarterbacks that you know he he's taken the team to another level you had some great players rounding over the years um you know so he'll be another one that's that's argued about getting in um if\nIt's a quarterback driven leave it at the rules have changed over the years so I think we have to pump the brakes on Tuesday through we see this like this explosion and often as we do where so many points and yards or just given on a daily basis in that how terrible the hacking is gone\nIn the national football league's is crazy but with that being said I think we have to pump our breaks because where these receivers are just catching a ball so either the overprotected the quarterback so if we protect in the pocket the pocket they can throw they can do whatever they want to ... you can't land on 'em you don't know how to tackle him\nAnd I I think God Bless you\nKnow he's allergic to that event I saw I saw it on our ... also\nYou know to me I think we have the proper breaks of

during the by I think it'd be after the by um I Would love to see him come in I think he's a competitor and since James Harris put it out there already saying if you he's going to might come in and you know he should get like a you know a hamstring pool and\nI don't think you can do that I think he I think he's a competitor I think he's going to come in I think he's going to help that football team when some games they're not uh September team\nThey've always play ban of September for some reason you know under especially under Tomlin but October they play a little bit better I think they're going to win this game when they go on a road in Cincinnati they always play well in Cincinnati so I I think they're going to get back in the right track\nAnd it's Tom on the right guy for the

questions about what do you mean\nWell I mean just you know when you go back and watch Kansas City game they're playing a single high defense on the line a true covered three and they're not touching the slot players meaning are curl flat players not standing near rerouting the number two player to get the number one player who's a two to one read corner\nOpportunity to get back there like ...

weekend but talking about a possibly wearing a bigger bulkier knee brace on that and they said he hopes not the goals were the same race you are last week um\nBut we'll see it's a big question mark goes like he's going to be limited he's not going to be as mobile as he is on Monday but the playing San Francisco there ten point favorites so he shouldn't have\nTo do to modern Monday Night football so you know I Know that uh this is not the way that tests and wit and blogging trip\nAre going to try and want it to happen is by the Green Bay would they'd love to lay it on ... on San Francisco
