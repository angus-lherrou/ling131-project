Griffin and how he thought that the way people were talking about whatever mental demons he was dealing with was awful because he is a veteran had been dealing with that stuff himself and Rick spiel man who was invited to that of a session by Jay Glazer was here in town for the Vikings\nOne week after he was sent home and hospitalized raised his hand he said that's my player let's talk about it

beaten Brady right\nI Will figure that out do no no I'm just I'm you're asking for a specific answer okay I ... is there a bills quarterback who was beaten Brady multiple\nTimes I don't think so has or anybody who's beaten Tom Brady multiple times who's the only quarterback to have done it\nAlready is twenty eight and three against buffalo\nIn division\nIn division I would just off the top of my head and the only quarterback who probably a beat and Tom Brady multiple times are named Chad Pennington Sanchez Mark Sanchez\nUm the dolphins\nHas tanning all even done it\n... that is now you're tasks or rich I was in show researcher while we would matriculate our way through the rundown leading to max Greenfield what else do you have over there Chris cower in the last quarter back to beat

that doesn't count I mean like the full fourth quarter hole full Monty\nI bet you there's you can't even come up with a second hand of quarterbacks and ... and Chad Pennington I bet I bet Pennington did it I saw this last night pretty cool Kobe Bryant and jazz by the way one might have been with the jets in one might have been with my well Miami's a year that Chad Pennington took him to the\nPlay offs was when ... year yeah I'm going to get off his bandwagon\nTo me what you're doing a Kobe Bryant on Jimmy Kimmel last night talked possible Lakers come back if they keep losing in general with the Lakers have to lose for you to honor tire frantic come back\n[noise]\n\nAnd we got this funny you think about it right [laughter] oh and fall off and you will think about it [laughter]\nOh in five years you know he told\nAs you know rich eyes into that mode um it was you know Kobe Bryant exclusively told the rich ... and show that he finds that whole concept of asking former players who have retired whether they want to come back offensive because it shows that they don't have anything else going on in their minds\nAnd that's why he's he's going for the Iraq\nThey could probably use them to shoot threes and [laughter]\nAnd I was just having fun with Jimmy can just having to find out whether tonight and Boston can be a factor game to the world series clear cold and windy tonight at

characters and it's\nBeen so much fun yeah and ... what's it been like would Cedric the entertainer many as you point out I mean he goes way back here in Los Angeles he knows everybody and yet he really\nIs like oh he really is a legend\nAnd just knows everybody and and has so many of his people like Ray Lewis came by this that the other day and like there's this one all these like people that
