game five okay not many people saw it coming we certainly didn't in the stands and as you recounted Chris last our buck and\nA small it's we're not expecting weighed Miley who pitched so well in game two to come back on the old short rest and face one batter that was it\nCody Ballenger lefty on lefty to start the game and that was the end of it and I guess counsel was hoping that the rest of the line up would be so right handed heavy that it would leave the Dodgers so analytic\nCentric flat footed it seemed like a game of analytics cat and mouse I'd never seen anything like that before immediately I emailed\n... rich eyes in show researcher with the following questions last time somebody face just one batter\nIn a playoff game and done and\nAs it was announced during the game during the broadcast and some folks in the stands were already assuming it that Miley was just going to start game six and this just was him throwing on his off day for one game during his bullpen session\nIn the bullpen to warm up to phase one battering game five course has anybody started a game five in a game six of a playoff series is that ever happened before because to me it wreaked of

outs never seen that before last starting pitcher to record zero out to the postseason game allied or against the Braves the allowed five runs in game six have been Ninety nine ... an out\nJohnny ... is the only other pitcher in major league baseball history to start a postseason game and face only one batter and be done\nBut he actually that's an actual act that that's recorded it was one third of an ending Quito struck out the first batter of game one of the twenty twelve an LDS for the reds and then left the game with back spasms so it wasn't some sort of strategic analytic game of cat and mouse\n\nMiley became a second pitcher in major league baseball history to start his postseason career with three consecutive scoreless starts\nBecause that counts as one huh right\nLast one to do that was Christine Matthews sending nine [laughter]\nDies but here is the old James that I was thinking about and looking for\n[noise]\nHas anybody ever started game five in game six of the postseason series as Wade Miley is about to do the answer is yes\nThe only other pitcher to do it the first picture to start back to back postseason games and it was a game five in game six George Bernard shaw did it\nIn the Nineteen thirty World Series seven shutout in game five complete game in game six that's your old ...\n[laughter] [laughter] in terms of\nA pitcher just to start consecutive games and the same postseason series\nJust to start waiting Miley is about to become the six you ready for the other ones the afro mentioned George Bernard shaw\nThe Philadelphia is George Bernard shaw not only did it in game five and six of the Nineteen thirty World Series he did it in the Nineteen twenty nine World Series games two and three\nChristine Matthews and did it for the New York giants and the

I Am but here's here's here's here's where it is here okay 'cause I'm I'm a diehard guy I'm watching these games no matter what and you know I Do do a lot of hand wringing about what's good for baseball or not or what have you that's that's\nTo me it it it's the first instance I've ever seen of an analytics game of cat and mouse\nBeing played with the starting pitcher for one batter or you know what I'm saying like at least we've seen a cat and mouse analytics for reliever starting a game for one inning I mean we've seen that and I it it was me nuts because I always went to a game\nLooking at who's the starting pitcher and it would be the starting pitcher match up to me would be something that excited me as a young fan and maybe that's just me 'cause\nI was really into it before to me it's just now it's now it's got no knock now I'm I'm playing a game of cat and mouse\nWith my opposing manager because I Know my opposing managers probably done when I'm done prior to the game which is that at a table with eight people with their slide rules in their MIT um you know a degrees\nAnd their booklets and they're thick\nYou know a loosely binders to figure out what's the best way to get through the first two innings because then they're going to turn to line up over and it could be ... to ... ... it's got out of hand it's gotten totally out of hand and to me October's about the Frankie ... brains\nAnd I don't know if they get analytics out of the game\nThan a man I Know and that sermon\nI and I am I Am word for word with you and and I'm watching the these games right I've watched them all and it's your heart's beat non every pitch I'm like you do I like white Miley coming after one pitch no do I like all the pitching changes but I find myself I've watched every pitch of every inning of both of the series right now and it's it's\nFor a ... fan it's great but I I look at it this way and maybe I Am maybe the ... the eye of the left the dock but I look at this Dodgers team\nAnd there are really good team they they the problem with the national league was\nThey had the Dodgers put the bed in July and they just let them keep going and keep going the diamond backs let them back in and the Rockies let them back in and you know what they are they hang around and they hang around I just wish this and I know it won't happen but\nI just wish I don't know I Can't do this like analytically to back this up but I Wish they would stick with the line up and let it go because they have some really good players David freezes hit off of why these in his career next month the head off of left these in his career I get it I think that it surprised me the most\nIn the Dodgers brewer series\nIs I I just I amazed at how well these young brewer relief pitchers Woodruff\nBurns have thrown under a lot of pressure I mean these guys aren't coming into games where the brewers are winning six to one and the fifth inning these guys are come like yesterday would rip I mean he's come that's basically starting a game\nAnd he did that is what it was yesterday and these\nGuys are ... these are guys that when the season started weren't even on the stratosphere for in their plans as far as at the big league level\nTo me I'm just I just want to see guys um\n[noise] you know there's this human element there is a human element going on that that that when you're just Yankee starter after one batter\nYou just look up and we could be sitting here wringing our hands all over it but you know I'm I'm Still going to watch games are six and seven on the ... um ... let me just turn the page back to the ... the U.S will do for a second okay and there'll be network on the inside report [noise]\nUh there's no way Joe West could tell in real time jogging from where he's jogging\nWhether that ball was over the fence or not he has no chance right\nNot not just deal with no umpire could unless you are standing against the right field foul ball even with it like looking at the field of play and would be the only way you could determine that ball was in play or going to be a home run a great so what do you think\n[noise] I think it is I think without a doubt and and I know that they were this okay what the average field or what there is no doubt in my mind that if those stands work five feet further back ... catches the ball I agree there's there's no\nDoubt in my mind he catches that ball and then I've had people say well that's ... well that's who it was okay it wasn't Jim Rice\nIt it was neat was ... it was\nPut out a doubt one of the top athletic guys in baseball there's no question he would've you're caught that ball now there's a there's a train of thought that says well his glove let's closing as the ball is getting their his glove was closing because there were like five arms reaching to try to get the ball I mean\nI agree with you I don't know I think the call was the right call rich because I think he catches the ball I Do and the raging debate is what's it out of this\nOf play which is almost fair game for the fans to make the catch and I understand that too I mean this one you're talking about one that like you could see it both ways\nBut I Know a lot of astro fans are that that's not the reason that they lost that game they're they're really pitching was awful last night that they had lots of chances to win that game and blow that game open that game was not decided on\nThat home run every my PIN all we're ... we're not talking about this if the Astros held on to any one of the two leads that they read after that play I mean that was ... or ... or ... tend to to make that great catch in what way ...\nYou know what rich I was thinking last night I Can't remember as I said earlier Nineteen eighty six was my rookie year [noise] I Can't remember a better more athletic ground covering outfield and those two guys those three guys\nI went to a game for in the stadium\nAnd I'm telling you there were a couple of balls that the I was sitting like field level that those they were also where the gap in ... and that and\nAnd Bradley they ran balls down and just made it look easy there is that there is without a doubt there isn't an outfield even close comparable to those guys right now those three guys are there there are three center field there's that are playing left center right there that\nGood acting bats is the best athlete in the sport you know obviously you could put trout in that mix to maybe who's the best athlete you played with\nYour ... probably the best athlete that I probably played with all around was probably Robin ... as far as he could do everything and make it look easy the best athlete that I ever saw play and I'm thoroughly convinced\nIt boat Jackson would've stopped just the baseball yeah he would have been a hall of famer and baseball and rich that guy went from Nineteen eighty seven you could have told him Nineteen eighty eight you could have told him you're throwing the breaking ball he would have swung at it that bounce four times Nineteen eighty nine the switch went off and do Jackson was obese he was the best\nPlayer for a short period I think though Jackson would have went down as one of the best outfielder slash players that play baseball if he didn't get hurt\nYeah that that a moment I'm with the all star game with Ronald Reagan in the booth off of Rick Rochelle on them and I know that\nThat game I was watching it in the bullpen yes you were I was that was the all star game in Anaheim\nWhen no money when everyone was hoping he would do it expecting those are the greatest moments in baseball for me or any sport is when you're hoping and expecting and then it's ... it succeeded exactly what was that like for you to to to watch to beat her dad was incredible\nI uh my best below Jackson story earlier that season we were playing in Kansas City and I got bought into a game in the eighth inning and he was on third base so I was going to come in to get the last out in the eight and then it's the night\nAnd Charlie O'Brian was the catcher rich and I remember him saying and the first better at the better I was facing was George Brett and Charlie said to me hey you know the ball gets away you're told that bragging about don't be afraid I'll block it just makes you cover oh I said\nCome home that water is not my I'm In a way of bone [laughter] of her own mug their chance that that they\nHave been to the prime Bosworth of metal on\nMetal Dempsey about took ripped from one batter's box to the other [laughter]\nSo I'm going to be the next ... the I can tell you the\nLast one for you then what do you think the world series is going to look like who wins the next ah games here in the ... [laughter]\nI I just think that the Dodgers they just they had a ... they they've they've been put away to bed too many times and you know what they are like that ... that won't go away I think the Dodgers win game six and I think the red Sox are going to I think it's going to be Dodgers Red Sox I really do\nWell Brockman you're loving that were used to go to Red Sox fan right here in the Los Angeles studios you know but yeah Houston's defending champ they can easily rattle off three straight wins yo yo what's amazing\nThough as we touched on earlier hundred and eight when team and yet I Would ... I was if I would've never in a million years thought that it would be free one Red Sox going into the game I never had a million years thought the red Sox will be up three one going into game five and\nDavid Price goes tonight 'cause sale is still too weak from a an illness right to go\nAnd we think about this rich there were up three games to one and Chris sales but non existent really I mean Chris Sale you're you're if you're a Red Sox fan of your baseball fan of say the red Sox are going to win two games to two games that sales starts he's the best pitcher in the game but it's got a real good shot after that and not so sure\nWell less one for what's with Ken ... is he he's missing his spots he's not he's not even in the area code what's going on with him\nOr he has no field for his breaking ball right now so he's at one pitch guy they're all geared to look for that fast ball they're not missing it I\nOf his illness in game six right ... and then of all the game seven if you need a hands on deck right I think we'd we'd sign up for that if you would have told me that before that series damn straight you would have art so here's because typically home with the call apparently where he fell out of his chair calling the final out\nAfter the rice\nFail Fannie\nI just went head over heels in my chair [laughter] wow what a catch by angel Ben intending unbelievable want to play in the red Sox leader series three games to one [laughter]\nIt's okay\nIt's unbelievable back I well I'll be ... that got me out of my chair\nWhen he married yeah what an incredible gray cause the game's over if he doesn't grab it yeah it goes by I mean you could a short hop it and it was love to have but you're assuming that goes by your top student his glove that they're they're going in extras that's for sure and bases clearly I Love her how to\nFace hurt an inch that after last night he was going to either be at second base or the ... so they're not as good of a team if he's the d._a. ...\nYou should take this usual table I'm loving it used to I'm loving it and I don't know that the I shouldn't say you take one Red Sox you take this it's it should be over and take it when the serious oh yeah oh yeah and it's another thing too is police ... said last hour\nThe Dodgers swing from their heels I mean he's right Turner's like the only one out there who's got it seems and approach Cody Ballenger to\nTurn it over to hit you again yesterday\nThat guy's an on base machine to hit again yesterday yesterday broken Garrett including crucial ones as well but everyone else months to use swinging from his heels everybody ... you know it's always got and his ... he got that hit and as he got that hit yesterday\nAt a perfect view right up the first base line east ... did they show the replay of him running up the first based on on Fox ... an hour all cashed he ran it catchy as the ball goes through a\nBeginning ended because I I forget what was that maybe it was a month she got thrown out between second and third he ran he\nThey they uh they got 'em going too far for second or third otherwise it could have attacked I'm more runs ... was running with his back to first base you know giving sort of like I guess that that either are you not entertained look or the he was kind of poking fun of what Lorenzo king does which was you know\nWith his hands like right\nWages showman madly is I mean he delivers Yankees Red Sox would be I mean I'm\nForty slipped Red Sox Dodgers would be ...\nAnd we're already looking at the tickets are ready to get their ticket

it's unfortunate were not get a chance to watch them play such a dynamic where\nAll the way I mean is appalled George told the undefeated ESPN's the undefeated quote he would have been in a Lakers uniform had he not got traded\nFrom Indiana to Oklahoma City quote it was fifty fifty on deciding what I wanted to come back home or if it was smarter to be in the situation I Am now but it wasn't overstated I wanted to play in LA that's where I Want it to go\nHave that trade never went down I Would have played one more year an Indian been in a Lakers you know there aren't\n[noise] I don't think that they do that and I mean what a what does that matter more thanks Thanks Paul George I mean you're on Oklahoma City you chose to say\nOr shows to say but I got said if he had not been traded to Oklahoma City would never have had the opportunity to fall in love with Oklahoma City I don't know how many people sit in the city of Indianapolis saying you know what I Wonder what it'll be like to play in Oklahoma City\nOr live in Oklahoma City it's just I don't know what to do with that information just seems disrespectful to Indiana to Oklahoma because they want everything worked out for a reason he had a chance to play with LeBron freaking James\nAnd didn't okay\nAnd now we'll see what happens yeah and so here's this big story that's coming out right now the G League or they're
