[laughter] okay now that the stories of the season obviously are the teams that are in first place right um and the the kid in Kansas City Patrick mom's is caught the entire nation's fan so you've got Drew Brees finally\nI'm On a path to winning MVP award it seems and get it [noise]\nUm you've got what the rams are doing right here it ain't no so the best least discussed story of the first half of the season is the emergence of James Garner and his story\nAnd how it's even being overshadowed by the fact that loving on bell might be the most discussed running back in Pittsburgh\nBut we all know what James Garner has done on this field although you may not know exactly based on the numbers of what he's pulled off\nBut his story coming from uh Pittsburgh you played college in Pittsburgh and he had Hodgkin's lymphoma was announced in December of Fifteen he had his last chemo and may have sixteen when he also announced on Twitter that he was cancer free and he's been standing there watching let me ... play football\nAnd now he has a chance and all he has done is just perform better than levy on bell is ever performed in the first eight weeks of the season and it's not just loving on bell\nJames counter last week with a career high hundred and forty six rushing yards and twenty four carry any at sixty six receiving a career high two hundred and twelve scrimmage orange he's got four games now with at least a hundred and ten on the ground into rushing touchdowns the season that's the most such games in a single season in steel as history [noise]\nAnd he's taught for the most rushing touchdowns non biased dealers player in the first seven games with season since Nineteen fifty only Franco Harris has had more than that so here if levy on belt this might be a successful hold out for him because he wanted to do two things he wanted to make a point\nAnd I think he thinks he's made it despite what the Steelers record might be is how valuable he might be\nA bought on top of it he wants to save it stars guess what he comes back there is no way you just get [noise]\nThe ball rolling bell he's going to have your time with James Garner and it's a matter of fact just let James kind of keep running a ball and maybe have let me on bell just supplement um until you get what you want to Pittsburgh ... third down back\nJames Carter is the best least discuss story of the first half of the season here started down down so now I think Todd girlie is the first half MVP and we're going to give that award out tomorrow and I know that prime was here yesterday and he backed up and echoed what most Johnston\nSaid when he called into the show is that it's Drew Brees and you cannot argue that\nYou can argue that don't think my argument for Todd early is the following there ain't no [noise]\nThat's number one you got to go with the team or the best record in my mind and who's the best player on that team despite what Jared golf it's doing\nIs Todd girlie what this guy is doing is unbelievably scored a touchdown and eleven straight games that's the longest active streak in the NFL second most touchdowns from scrimmage in the first eight games in NFL history Fifteen behind only Jim\nAnd as he showed at the end of the game much to the dismay of particular gamblers and fantasy owners of of Todd early he is situation only aware and brilliant\nHe made the right move by not scoring and I know if he scored and the extra point it would've been nine but the extra points not guaranteed in the NFL anymore smart move don't let the ball back and Aaron Rodgers hands he situation really brilliant\nHe's smart he's tough he is dynamic he's the MVP three weeks\nForced to write my favorite part of the week [noise]\nRich going to get the hot\nI've been here before the Cleveland Browns [laughter] last year I said they were taking in the top five a already ... they had to pick that up I don't want them to pick since on\nThis year I started the season by saying [noise]\nThat they would not picking the top ten [noise]\nDown that they had a you know wins entering the second half of the season and now they have nobody\nWho has been a veteran play color and the national football league to call the often just huge accidents done it has gone Todd ... gone Freddie Kitchens [noise] called plays in a week for the pre season in that all important victory over Jake Rudolph and the lions [noise]\nWho the hell knows that this is going to look like on the offensive side of the ball [noise]\nThey've got a lunatic who's now [noise] they're [noise] interim head coach [noise]\nGregg Williams is nuts people [laughter]\nAnd that's why the browns are going to win half of their remaining games he was in the interim rain [laughter]\nThis guy [laughter] hey cut down down collide from Toronto [noise]\nThere's no fifty five yard line here I'll tell you what Gregg Williams the particular brand of crazy\nI've met him he knows football you know defense and he knows that there's no actual way that they should be winning football games with their current construct but that's why I Believe in him he's just going to rile it up\nTheir home against Kansas City in Atlanta they gotta buy week then they're at Cincinnati asks used in home for Carolina at Denver home for Cincinnati at Baltimore [noise]\nWatching when half just because he's nuts and this whole situation is get get turned upside down just because [noise]\nMy first foot down out take ... take a just cause [noise] [laughter] [laughter] wow All right [noise]\nGregg Williams I'll tell you what man I mean we know is not we watched our knock I Know he's just fermenting is is a goatee clearly I'm telling you minds of tips I'm telling you\nKnow bounties in all seriousness though Freddie Kitchens I'm I asked around okay he's comes from\nArizona and he's going to run like a Bruce Erian style and often which means there are deep and he's got the how fun is not going to be with Baker may feel\nThey have like for like we've been saying the whole time they have a lot of weapons and good players on all says oh remove the dysfunction on the off chance of side\nAdd a full dose of crazy overall\nEquals foreign ... board for that so I'm back at my play because six nine and what might not have him in the top ten of the draft going on it but oh man well let's see how this works out\nOkay when we come back it's a tonight or we get the first college football a court yet uh so we're\nGoing to get Alabama Clemson Notre Dame and LSU for the college football playoff courts that we're going to get that tonight and I'm sure Michigan in Georgia in Oklahoma and Ohio State will be right behind it and I'll tell you I'll reiterate it again just for Bruce Feldman okay case you didn't hear it\nThe first time he told Alabama should absolutely lose to LSU do it a void that stupid insignificant conference championship game\nConference championship games are only there to fat and somebody's wallet\nAnd put a bullet in the best chance your comfort has to sending somebody into the final four that's it\nIt's gotten to that point so until they expand ... eight teams and give an automatic bid to whoever wins or conference championship games they're meaningless they're useless games\nPlay in London until after their bike so it gives them time to be true for eight\nOr that pretty much get some ... week five ...\nTwelve they have their life\nAnd then take it one step at a time you're ... you're right now you're going to buy after you play you were saying it come off or by to go in there\nSure so it after your game say on a Sunday is travel to London without had days to practice\nGood times you know Dan that just players would absolutely revolt they're there by weeks of thereby weeks there there there there by weeks or to get fresh and refresh not to go on some sort of European Vacation you know and and that's that's the ... and and look even if what you have a proposed\nA is adopted and works it still if a team in London hosts let's say a team in London hosts a a a wild card\nGame I'm In a in\nThe playoffs then a team would have to go from week Seventeen to London they would probably go right away just to get their body clocks associated\nBut then that team advances and then let's just say that they would have to play a a team like say the Los Angeles chargers the next week and the AFC because just doing the jaguars will be the team going to London\nThen they got to go to the west coast\nAnd play a game and six seven days I I that's just not workable it is not worth thanks for the call that an an I'm telling you I mean the ... one of the players\nOn the uh on I Want to see which one but a a really good player on one of the teams came up to me and said if there's no way they'd be able to do it no way they'd be able to do it and and\nAgain both teams arrived friday mornings which means they slept on a plane Thursday night can you do you sleep on planes overnight I kind of deal yeah even if you even if you take a little bit of a a a an aide to put you to sleep sure\n... Campbell and Fletcher Cox both told me they don't sleep on planes you know why 'cause they're humongous human beings not ... make plans eats ... I asked ... campus where to this where does this come up to him\n... I mean when you lay out the bad where does it come up to him and he pointed to just above the knee oh OK these guys are huge\nThey there's no way to there's no way to work at what they can do and what I think they're gonna do and again I I you know I hear from France now you know the London game it just doesn't mean that much to him well it means that means a lot to the people or I'm telling you there's a lot of ex pats there and you know um and fans really love it\nThey really do Suzie or didn't go to a game my wife she came out there's you know she didn't go to the game uh she was hanging with a friend in London but she wanted to hear the call so she jumped into a pub oh no oh okay she jumped into it\nProbably hear the call 'cause they were using our call for a guy sports and\nThey're using it locally she jumps into a pub and it's still an eagles fans and she's just like go to the game they're like no we didn't have tickets we just wanted to come here and support the team and hang in London [noise] that's cool\nSo I mean there is some value to the NFL and to the teams I just don't think you can base of teen and thought that maybe Jacksonville play their games in London but what\nWould you still have a base in Jacksonville so they could straddled both worlds I just don't know how that works I Do not know\nWhat I think certainly now that shot Conn took his name out of the running to buy when we stayed out I think that's kind of off the table now right\nYou know I mean it it I was told that he may because again the you know there is no home team in ...\nExcept for the national team okay the three lines play their national games and went blended obviously there's other events that are held there right so I'm BFA owns the stadium and I think that people were really upset that they would sell it to a private individual\nSo they viewed his ... his hostile he removed it\n'cause he sensed it doesn't want to be hostile I but since I got is that I think they're going to come back around and knock on ... door when they're ready did you talk to Mr kind of not seeing her I did not see him soon as he rented a Jeffrey Laurie shopping\n[laughter] that could happen at the Kennedy alright alright everyone was there I mean it was really great it\nReally was a terrific weekend I just don't know how team would work there any NFL\nOddly enough Jeff who already felt hats in London [laughter]\nDiscover card things all the time like your email or social media discover asks what about checking something as important as your credit score will\nDiscover makes it quick and easy with their credit score card which is free for everyone even if you're not a customer so so your credit score and other important credit information and once you know your score you should check to see if your current credit card is the best fit for you\nLearn more discovered don't dot ... a pardon me discovered dot com slash credit score card discovered dot com slash credit score card limitations apply will take a break and I'm Bruce Feldman we uh we assume will join us that's next year on the rich I wasn't sure\n\nHow fast they shout exist box march [noise]\nCapital one is building a better bank one that feels an ax nothing like a typical back it's why they're reimagining banking and building something completely different\nThey offer accounts with no fees or minimums they also offer one of the best savings rates in America and you can open a capital one account from anywhere in five minutes capital one this is banking re imagined open an account today inexperienced banking re imagined for yourself capital one\nWhat's in your wallet capital one at a\nBackyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask ... home what\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice but how much does it cost home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download the free home advisor ...\nOn this episode of the world shorter sitcom like Cassie\nI say it's inside it counts what's inside my now KFC can be stricken V. ten basic chicken too large mashed potatoes and or biscuit for an again and I\nAre under twenty dollars that's what really matters is pretty incredible what chicken you can teach you about life [noise] anyways and failing\nBack upstairs has actually I think that the time and money your business than can be attracted that talent people's you're off and that attracted employee workforce once in office that has ... enacted they are standing desk solution be creating active where they were employees happier healthier and more productive\nProducts requiring little to no family income which had thirty days rich began the\nBrown on their product and ask dot com slash media ...

I'll be honest you know I'm a more well versed on his week to week me too and the last three weeks she hasn't really been much of a factor he was great in that game against Dallas\nHe was terrific in that game against Dallas but Marvin Lewis I mean Margaret Margaret Jones in ... that kid golladay he is very rarely special so maybe they got somebody that's going to just step up and go on tape spot they don't want to pay Golden Gate at the end of the year ... third round selection form and fulfilling nice job\nNice job I Wonder if that means that that that Pittsburgh said we're not we're not

just haven't gotten over that hump\nWould you do it in the world to me would you want to keep a Machado if you're the Dodgers\nThey get bigger and my aunt and you've got young shortstop I don't know if you need to spend the the the big though I don't know what his salary is going to dictate we'd be hurting where from two three four hundred million dollars for Bryce harbors and McDonald's the money's crazy to me right I don't know but um\nThere are finding jobs and go out there and and I have a few teams but if I'm the Dodgers of course seekers healthy you have a young that short stop that uh I'm sure it has a high ceiling\nOkay what if the Yankees what moves do you make this off season Kevin Muller\nNow that that that's where it gets interesting right obviously there have been Machado there's only a handful of themes that can afford those I mean I'm a child I\nKnow why would they are look I Know Deanie grigorian has got the arm surgery and they'd have no idea but ...\nWhy would they do that I mean I I Am I'm no idea why they would do that they needed ... gonna be a starter is he is he going to pitch I mean that makes no sense to me\nThat's the only makes sense because there are one of the organizations that have the big though so anybody that's a big price to link for the Yankees maybe it or not and we can say that because they want the Dodgers Billy the Yankees Red Sox\nAre you know couldn't afford a big crisis [laughter] Hi player like Machado it's just who need them so that's where it becomes interesting\nEspecially with rice farmers available I mean we're

Shaw through ... and got a lemon strike outs in game one of the world series\nLast year man come on\nHer ... got a better postseason track record than David Price now many rings I doubt now that is in a conversation under that you are deserving of having which is why I'm saying David Price\nDespite this guy go ahead played Dave that our friends are from a couple of weeks ago you don't have this at the ready Mike now I mean you got to have it ready just drop it any time to quit I Want him to retire on by now admit that around now admits every penny right worth every penny say it\nSaid a word worth every penny just one you a World Series\nCome on dude I'm On his here and there are a lot of money he sees me Steve ... game five it's priced appear said to 'em runs and game of cat but I guess\nI I thought they should have been ... and ... he made up for all the bad stuff I never see another bad thing about him he can go down the street ...\nEvery penny and every one money here forums not your money and I understand that your money banks say\nYeah I'd rather have them in the postseason clean person okay if you really believe that you take it again next year next year you take it again you you have a game on starting choice game seven starting choice\nIs crystal healthy you know you it's I'm giving you the choices of what ... ... ... a price yeah give me David Price\n[laughter] proven what the result is [noise] look claiming Curtis on nine one one miles an hour anymore and you saw what those pictures did what the Red Sox hitters did to him they had him four hundred feet\n... and those are the fact of the case boys\nI don't want the Yankees to chase a three hundred million dollar player they've already got money tied into John Carlos ... who on occasion when it was chips were down he did not do which the pure stood\nWhen the chips were down he did not do what Brock halted when the chips were down he did not do what Jackie Bradley junior did and you put all three of those guys together than even make half as much\nAs what John Carlos that may not even close okay so that's all I'm saying the two thousand and Eighteen champions or the red Sox for a reason and the Nineteen Ninety eight Yankees course six games better than these Red Sox in terms of wins\nHad Scott brochures when the MVP okay had Paul O'Neil in right field we can go on and on and on and all those kids that they brought up were making a lot of money at all at that time when they went on that run stay away from the big ticket don't want it don't need it\nGet me somebody who can throw better than sunny gray yep one picture get me somebody who's going to be more consistent than to knock out so you can actually use him with confidence get me somebody who can throw like Severino but last into the seventh or eighth inning get me that guy\nWhat's on your news update Chris when we come back we're going to hear from Tom Brady about the upcoming Sunday\nAnd that job at a that Michael Jordan of all people jumping on the route on Sunday Night Football that's coming up next year on the ... and show here\nUm I could see him getting some interest I mean those are those are names that kind of jump out at me the other one is a little bit of a wild card is Jeff ... who is a really good often serve coach at Purdue they obviously\nThey drilled Ohio State a couple of weeks ago the stock is high\nI think what could they could complicate it is if people have always thought he was gonna end up with the Louisville head coach from their body betrayed I was having a disastrous year if Louisville can find a way to get out from under his buyout if they can find a reason to fire him for cause they're going to go after jak rom hard it's just a matter of can they get out of that contract 'cause I don't think they can afford to buy 'em out\nAmazing how that turns so fast with um our Jackson going pro uh raising how fast\nYeah never scandal with the idea above him that you know it's no secret of a trend is not exactly the most warm and fuzzy like a boy so now it's going bad and a lot of this stuff 'cause it was blown up in a space is not a lot of people and by the train those corner\nAll right ah Bruce Albany or Fox Sports and the athletic uh here on the show tonight we get our first a college football rankings no surprise is gonna be it's gonna be Alabama Clemson or didn't even know as you correct\nProbably that clumps of Notre Dame peace ... I'm Sorry the LSU Notre Dame part of that could be flipped but um I I think that's going to be the top for when you look at at a Alabama doesn't have a lot of great wins but just the eyeball test they've been destroying people and so I think people have a lot of confidence in them\nBut the the reason why it's flipped is just because they they'd want Notre Dame to play Alabama if 'cause they they actually treated as if is if the playoffs are we starting today so it was that yeah the reason why they'd flip it\nUm I think the part could be because yes beating Michigan is looking like a really good when but unless you just really from\nThe good Georgia team beat him by twenty LSU has I think\nSome more impressive ones but they do have a last minute to get sick at Florida team in a tough place to play but you look at it they they you know we have to ... Mississippi State who I think will be somewhere in the top twenty five or certainly blowout Georgia they want on the road at Auburn which is which is a good way and so I could see LSU maybe number three\nUm but you never know I mean look look at this point\nPump the brakes on it it doesn't really matter at this point it matters I think it would matter probably the most for it is it gives you a picture on what they get UCF\nBecause every year the playoff committee makeup changes so it's hard to read too much into what they think from year to year what they really value but I think for the people looking I go out UCS one twenty in a row Scott trusted a really good job I mean the reality is their schedule has been ... so far\nAnd the committee ... usually\nThe one thing it's been kind of consistent with them\nOr at least the most consistent factors if you haven't really played anybody even if you have a zero in the in the last column they may not be inclined to to treat\nYou so well and it's just they're they're scheduled to this point\nIs not good and I could see them not being in the top twelve at this\nPoint now Bruce what I'm about to say I realized comes from the realm in our business as a heartache okay I I understand it but I'm going to pause it to you and I posited to Joel clout on this program last week because the conference championship games I think are useless and I think Alabama proved it last year where they didn't even playing ... and then one at all so\nWhy wouldn't it be who've Alabama to lose to LSU this weekend at LSU in a close one\nJust to avoid having to play the conference championship game let let LSU trying the Georgia and then sit back and make the final four anyway because they're going to win out if they said much they they went out I noticed is opposing a lot but why wouldn't it be benefit Alabama to do that and have that happen\nI mean in theory it probably would in the ... other than the fact that what is a loss do for the confidence of some of these younger players 'cause we're talking about you know it's not just to quit and Williams and the tops and there's they've had young stars emerge in a big way uh I think\n... I think makes saving be able to handle young confidence I think I think he's looking he's looking for these guys to get a battered around themselves now obviously doesn't want to lose\nBut you know he he he wants to avoid the rat poison to use this phrase so let them let them out and let them get humbled\nAnd there is no way that the committee no matter how much they might hand wringing over schedule there is no way\nA one loss Alabama losing at LSU was their only last gets held on to the final four I don't think there's anything on his greener especially of two has got that trophy in the case I don't think that not all he's going to happen a lot\nI think you're right I mean I think you're right I don't think Nick Saban wants to know to do that but\nI think you're right look there's a probably a realistic shot that its LSU loses clothes and keep in mind they're missing the best line backer and college football for the first half Devon White if they lose close and then went at Texas a and M. and there are tending to\nA especially with Georgia comes into the SEC title game and and plays Alabama's tough there's a chance you could have a tendency to LSU team\nTo not be the fourth team in the playoffs that\nNow I Would I Would have if Michigan wins out and gets a chance to do to him and his only won last a Notre Dame which has now many losses that would be an absolute abomination bruise and that's what again Michigan for me and I'm I'm but there's so much more to be played this game against Penn State there's the Ohio State game in the horseshoe which\nWe all know is I don't even want to go there\nBut if Michigan wins out\nThey've got to put it on the line against the Wisconsin or an ... or North West ... already I mean from what from what possible purpose would the Big Ten championship game exist except to put a dagger in the heart of their team's best shot\nAt winning a national championship it makes no sense the way this is all set up he'd sell\nBass amp word that it makes\nOnly sense to give eight teams an automatic beds for the conference championship game so it seemed like northwestern Wisconsin could still play themselves in and but he's Cinderella at least at least losing ... in a conference camp to a game of a team like that you get a shot to the team that wins\nRight yeah I I think look as they very flawed system and for a lot of the reasons your point now I I don't think that's a bad idea five ... five\nOr automatic beds and then three at large is the the part that's challenging to that is the schedule gets longer you'll hear some of that then it's like okay do do we really want to have a\nConference title games conference championships bringing a lot of money for those schools so you know they got to figure something out with that but I think there's going to be some push to expand ate at some point I just think for there's too many conferences that are feeling like they're going to get squeezed the pie twelve is going to get squeezed this year and\nIt's not a stretch to think the big twelve could get squeezed because now Notre Dame is undefeated potentially even of Notre Dame is eleven and Warner\nAnd let's say nor David loses to northwestern this week and I'm beach USC in Syracuse\nGonna feel like they get snapped a thorough eleven everyone and so there's a lot of stuff to be sorted out never mind all the that UCF slash Houston's or you'll feel like they don't have any realistic hope no matter what they do um\nYou know I could see there'd be a momentum to go to a but right now this is the system we got and it ... it leaves it into this like for a while people thought this debate stuff\nWas a good thing about college football I don't think it's good I think it's I think people talk about the sport anyway they don't need us to have these kind of kind of nonsensical", "show_name": "Rich Eisen", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "30"}
