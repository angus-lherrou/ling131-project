Leonard for that we were gonna handed to him or not the case andme even mid October is a little too early end of October that's when you can start to look at this and go okay I think I've got this figured out in Ohio State quarterback Twain Haskins was looking great until Purdue\nUm we'll Greer West Virginia Oregon's Justin Herbert you know it feels like this is ... ... if he can put up crazy numbers in Oklahoma stays in the title picture or in the playoff picture then he's got a chance to steal this because to uh doesn't play in the second half\nBut it might be the best player it used to you know they ... part of the factors would be a best player on the best team or the the quarter back on the best team\nYou know Gino traumatic one it wasn't the best player on his own team he's acknowledged that but they gave it to him because he was the quarterback and it uh the you know you didn't deserve it but that happens sometimes yeah part\nTo almost needs a close game that he pulled out against LSU this weekend where you know is it true challenge she's not just waxing and yes the club\nI I saw this on Twitter his touched down the interception differential twenty five to nothing for two\nAnd a kind of emerged twenty five to three\nWhile those three picks costs Oklahoma too you know I just think perception wise calories that Oklahoma\nEverybody puts up monstrous numbers are nobody does it Alabama\nIs to uh uh NFL prospect oh yeah Michael Vick that too they're comparing him to okay but how come ...

I mean ... ...\nBut we're in the day and age to bomb now we're uh everybody has an edgy trigger finger at the managerial position the minute the lineups turned over for a third time against him it's kind of gotten\nA little out of hand bomb I'm Wondering where you sit on this whole analytics where we saw a starter pitch to one batter in game five of an L. C. S. leading to the rarity of a game five games six daughter back to back it just seems and this has gotten a little bit much where do you well I actually\nLiked that because that was a strategic move that was a move to have the Dodgers set up their line up one way or for a lefty Miley and then pull Miley out and counsel intended to use him in game six all along um so I kinda liked that I thought that was a cool\nChest build what we are seeing though is a guy pitching extremely well he gives up a blue single\nIn the fifth inning\nNow we're starting the third time through the line up what's we better go to the bullpen right and I weighed Miley I don't know that he has a victory in the postseason buddy had several days where he pitched into the ...\nNeeded one more out or to to qualify for the victory had pitched extremely well but nope nope you front enough pitches we've got to the bullpen and you have to say that overall worked for council because they got as far as game seven against the Dodgers\nAre we going to see at some point maybe even a swing the pendulum back worse one one team just going to build a tons of ... and just go for I mean in that regard\nIt just seems that the one that now that this genie is out of the bottle or where everybody's got a guy's you can throw Ninety five Ninety six in the bullpen that starters are insignificant in major league baseball playoffs\nWell I think the fair assessment is that over the course of the regular season you can't do what you're able to do in the postseason in terms of use of the bullpen\nUm because you get days off mixed in any series a so it's a little bit different than during the regular season here's the advantage of the regular season of pitchers that can go deep into games not necessarily pitching twenty plus complete games like Bob Gibson Sandy Koufax for someone like that\nBut at least go deep into games it isn't just that the best starting pitcher should be effective enough\nBut it saves your bullpen and if you're that bullpen dependent it isn't just starters who can wear down its relievers who can wear it down or get injured during the course of a season show when someone goes seven or eight innings\nThe advantage of that is hey maybe he hung around long enough for us to build a big enough lead that we don't have\nTo go to ... we don't have to go to our closer we give them an extra day ever asked all that stuff has a domino effect over the course of a season and there are some teams like let's say Houston even though they got beaten and five by\nThe red Sox Houston has such a deep quality starting rotation that well certainly they wanted to bolster their bullpen and they did with some moves uh during the season\nYou're always going to want to have a good bullpen but they were live very very heavily on their starters because they're so good so I I think you you can't one size does not fit all you got a manager coach according to your personnel\nFew more minutes left with Bob Costas smarter than we know works World Series coverage from Fenway Park at Dodger Stadium including ... tonight airing\nLaw before and after every game I I just can't get enough adjusting Turner Bob when you see a statistic um that says\nOn base percentage within minimum Seventy five at bat in the postseason in history and it goes Garrett Ruth Turner that is just unbelievable the guy is it just wears people out and he used to really went\nWhen he is healthy he wears people out\nAnd although some of the analytics guys say there's no such thing as clutch hitting this guy has come through in so many clutch situations that are\nI remain convinced that he's a guy you want at the plate in fact I asked Dave Roberts that question earlier in the playoffs I said if you had a single guy to pick and an eighth or ninth ending situation at the plate\nNo matter right handed left handed pitcher who's the one guy and he said you know we have a lot of guys who I trust in that situation but my one guy is Justin Turner\nAnd the thing that I Would like to see rich you know you see all these match ups every newspaper or a\nWeb site will have matchups ... bats versus go Cody Ballenger or whatever it may be but the big match up is who's beard as\nWarm Justin Turner's Craig chemicals and they're both you know it was a sort of orange juice read this you know they could stand side by side almost be siblings yeah I'd like to I'd like someone to take a tape measure and and subtly argument\nWell I mean we might find out in the ninth inning of some of these games bomb don't you think the beard on beer match up would be\nQuite something where the game on the line that's exactly right you know I mean the classic\nThat could actually happen before I let you go what's your favorite uh your favorite story about the two venues\nFenway Park in Dodger Stadium take your pick\nIf you want to go through your mental rolodex of uh where you you just have this certain memory Fenway and a certain memory of Dodger Stadium two of the older venues in a league where everybody's got their brand spanking new stadium with luxury suite and boxes et cetera et cetera or this is neat this is a neat well the Dodgers one\nIs easy for me because I was part of the broadcast team in game one in Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd I was in the corner of the Dodgers dug out when Kirk Gibson hit his home run I was ready to jump out on the field and interview somebody no matter the outcome of the game and I saw Gibson come limping up the tunnel on and ... and to the dugout when no one expected them to play he wasn't even introduced before the game he wasn't even in uniform he was on the trainers table\nUntil late in the game so I saw that whole thing unfold and I think most people still view that as one of the most\nDramatic almost theatrical moments in baseball history so I've had to pick one Dodger Stadium moment it would be game one in Nineteen eighty\nEight well let me ... more into that though so you're in you're in the dugout you're you you're listening to broadcast your hearing van and all of a sudden you look and you suddenly ... Gibson in uniform and you saw the\nNot at not exactly here's here's the way it happened back then I mean it seems almost quaint back then broadcasters were not allowed to be in the dugout during the game now\nEverybody's might they do in game interviews Rogers and players and whatnot but then technically I was breaking the rules but I didn't wanna hiding in the tunnel and not be able to see the game so I stick to the very\nEdge of the dog out and I'm perched there endless ... sees me\nAnd I always knew with Tommy none of this had any malice it's just to Tommie was so Tommy starts screaming to his guys look it's bleeping cost us even bleep and NBC thinks the bleeping game is over they don't give us any bleeping chance\n[laughter] and I try to suppress by laughter but\nThey they liked me well enough to let me stay there even though is breaking the rules so now I hear is it like in the eighth inning I hear a\nSound from down the tunnel where there's a batting cage so I walked down to investigate and there is ... and with a ball boy who was putting balls on a tea and he's hitting balls off the tea and he's grunting in pain with each swing and it's at that point\nThat I get on the eye of the to Mike Weissmann in John Phillip Holly in the truck and I say let vintage oh no that gifts and has put his uniform on\nTaking practice wings I don't know what that means but I guess he could pinch hit and that's what happened\nOh so what about your Fenway memory\n[laughter] you know I wasn't there I was watching on TV but\nThe Carlton Fisk home run in Nineteen Seventy five is still an extraordinary Fenway moment or the Dave Roberts stolen base and what led to a in two thousand for when they were on the brink of defeat against the seemingly invincible Mariano Rivera and what that led to\nAn Roberts himself tells them very interesting story he wears number thirty in honor of Maury\nBut again the the the Lakers just you could see they have a lot of work to do no one where everybody is on the floor\nTheir transition de France is lacking they're not interested in playing ... they they that right there I think their interest I Know what you're saying but right they're they're\nThey're still so much more to go with an understanding who has the ability to shoot a three and\nCover that guy cover them\nSwitching that they're they're having trouble switching you could see all of it\nIs ... is special\nMen do I love watching Josh shark play basketball he is really really good and last night with no ... they almost one of the damn game\nI just have too many parts that are so young and talented that they that how how are they going to lose more than me when I other than just that it's going to take time it really is just going to take time with LeBron there\nAnd I never want to have their fun with Kobe wouldn't have missed the the free rat heroin I mean you're already hearing that sort of hay on here in Los Angeles\nShack one of the shack with us but he was good though liquor is their own three to five and they're heading down the road and it's no big deal and I always say that I'm really bad enough they are really talented team\nA and bought

a big three last night was Alonzo Alonzo made a victory last night it was ... it was so much fun to watch and nobody was ... was the last time you talking about Lakers basketball game three of the season\nWhere everybody's focused on what the Lakers are up to\n... it's been a while it's been about\nTheir games game too massive brawl game three one ... forty right I Know and\nGame one was mostly to cause it was in Portland and that was the first opening night and there's LeBron and the Lakers uniform but still it's still it's still strange for me to say it really weird\nEndings wearing short
