yesterday on their face down\nI don't have a problem with a trade I have a problem with how he handled the trade I have a problem with guys go back to the locker room and checking their phones and find out that I'm already Cooper's been pulled off the field has been traded\nAnd John says I'm going to talk of the guys tomorrow that's not the world we live in anymore right yeah not ten years ago these guys know about these things immediately talks to a reporter any comments on the trade\nPrior to talking to the team I just don't think that's a good way to do business and maybe he'll realize slowly but surely how quickly these things get out\nYeah and Jay Kaiser was on the show this week and he said he had reported that ... Bari Cooper was on the trading bloc two weeks ago and John groove and finally denied ... said that's how he knew it was true [laughter]\nThat's all we know when ... comes out and said I don't see us making anymore move yeah definitely not the quarterback I don't know how you can believe him\nOh yeah I mean for sure you got to be thinking their cars on the tray block look there's never been a successful NFL franchise if there is a disconnect between the head coach and the quarterback you've never seen it\nYou've never you you've never ever seen a fractured relationship between a head coach and a quarterback be successful so that is the relationship they have right now it is clearly a fractured relationship so how this team doesn't move on from Derek ... I don't know how you do that\nI don't I don't know that that particular relationship is fractured I still I I don't know if it's the two of them I'm not sure if it's fractured yet I also don't believe that that Derrick car has lost the locker room I don't know I mean we heard Lee Smith come to his defense slug guys give me a mentally yeah yeah yeah it's\nUm I I think there's a lot of leave their and their car and I think the big question would be\nWhere do you put him in the hierarchy of NFL quarterback now he makes twenty five million dollars a year when he signed that deal for a minute he was the highest paid quarterback and football that is obviously since been eclipse\nTwenty five million dollars a year in three years is going to be the going rate for mid tier short NFL quarterback for one for twenty yeah I I think he's still a he\nTied for six I think believes in terms of being highest paid quarterback in the NFL but where if you do trade Derek ... a what do you get for their car and be what what's a good fit the first two teams that come to mind obviously or the Jacksonville Jaguars\nAnd the New York football giants yeah um I I Would I think he could thrive in both those places big brother David obviously a backup to Eli or with the giants in his is highly thought of that organization is there another team that you could see him going to where he could kind of fit right in and maybe be the missing piece to the puzzle\nBoy that's tough 'cause there's a lot of great young quarterbacks to you know what I mean ... um so yeah if you gotta if you've got to stand Arnold or whatever you ... it's not like you're not making a move to go get her doesn't make any sense I Will say this I think his his contract is pretty friendly which I think will actually aid in the trade process as well\nSo you're right you know twenty five million for a quarterback of of that nature of that class\n... and plus it's still a pretty team friendly deal as well I don't know\nIf he is very little guaranteed money that's what I'm saying after the seat either one of your team friendly uh\nThing yeah guys you know you mentioned Jacksonville there they kind of have their own quarterback\nSituation going on right now by portals obviously badge to last week for ... cat for now they're taking on an eagles team\nIn London and you're wondering what's gonna happen could ... get benched again could could he be on the move a class Campbell talk yesterday said you know I look into his eyes light up and I see the competitor nobody's tougher on himself than black he loves the game wants to do well he understands take away the turnovers\nAnd this is a different ball game he's focused\nHe's working hard hopefully we get on the road here and make some good things happen do things like ... is the future and Jackson\nI first of all I Love the fact that ... if you take away the turnovers yeah OK bell [laughter] look if you take away all of that place they only have one place that schools [laughter] that's just not the case you know what I mean\nWell I Do I think he's a future in Jacksonville no the question is they're up against the cap what do you do it because he has a very team Flynn friendly contrast very as well a sign that through your dealer like Nineteen million or ... I think it's even less I I think it's sixteen Seventeen million I Believe it was like three years forty five million right um that's a very team friendly\nI here's here's the thing they decided that Blake bored holes in their mind was as good as any of the quarterbacks coming out in this year's draft and they they felt like\nA specifically I think that uh Sam Donaldson for like we kind of already have a sand Arnold type quarterback right here why why don't we roll with him I Would hope that wasn't the evaluation and do you miss them completely missed the boat\nIf your if your the jags what about a guy like run fitzpatrick this year\nIf you that window is so small that championship window is tiny and that that is already slipping away that's not why not make a trade give him two weeks to get up to speed the natural\nI think we're counting option too I mean you talked about them to Arnold I think ... absolutely an option for them as well if they wanted to make that trade a lot of people throwing around teddy Bridgewater seemed to\nWell Bridgewater is are stuck between taste them hill and you know what I mean breeze is going to play for another few years that would be a good one ... ... if they could win on that if they traded a third round rapidly for Bridgewater so that they ... they could get a ... a second round for ... I just don't know if you get that right now proper\nYeah I don't know guys we've got to wrap this up with a quick baseball note couple managerial hires this week the twins announced they're bringing Rocco Bob deli as their next manager he spent the last four seasons as a coach for down in Tampa only thirty seven years old he'll be the youngest manager and the majors and this week the angels hired a new man replacing\nMy social bread Austin is the new angels manager\nThirty seven years old the youngest\nYou're in major league baseball ... thirty one the youngest head coach in NFL history when Kevin was also hired at thirty thirty one and it costs Shanahan what thirty seven thirty eight we have a lot of the atom gates I think is right around forty\n... negative that navies around anymore you know and run around or or around forty um I I like this influx of a new fresh blood and fresh talent and these young coordinators are gonna air it out\nWell it's fresh thought too I mean that's the thing you know what I mean so you're getting a whole brand new way of\nThinking about football now they've got to dig capillaries\nYoung Aaron Boone can't be older than what forty to forty three uh with the Yankees\nIt's it's interesting because so long especially in the NBA this just drove me nuts the ... that would come around and get three four jobs yeah unbelievable I Am actually blanking right now he was the head coach Kevin O'Neill\nKevin Kevin Kevin O'Neill has bounced around from college the NBA coach the Toronto Raptors coach USC ah coached at Tennessee when I was there and outside of a run to the sweet sixteen Marquette there was no sustainable success at any level for Kevin O'Neill yep he kept kept getting jobs\n... the old the old boy network in the NFL something they've talked about for a long time I don't think it's dead but certainly you see the success of a guy like ... and it opens the doors for the guys like ... percent and a new young fresh blood to come in I thought ... might be that guy with the Tennessee Titans as you know\nDo the Tennessee Titans preseason games uh got a chance to visit with well Flora lot in the titans got off that fast start three in one and\nThen they fall into the abyss and lost ran around yeah but I mean even when they got three in one it was ugly yeah it was a very ugly they didn't look good offensively all year\nWe have a lot of enough I'll talk to get to with Charles Davis my my buddy there with the titans games on that number two team at Fox with Kevin Burke heart\nI'm actually I Believe he is going to be working with Kenny Albert coming up calling the Redskins giants game because Burkhart is busy with a little thing called the world series on Fox or associate he's going to be coming up we're going to be catching up with him on everything that is NFL Brian when horses we mentioned earlier going to be here to talk ... Braun\nWarriors co why whatever else are we deemed fit all maybe\nAll NBA all the time so very much looking forward to that James code Dan Halley here filling in for rich eyes in on the rich eyes and show we had a lot of show left to man can't wait to keep it going to go\nAll right ah how about the two thousand Nineteen Honda Odyssey there are so many aspects to this car but I Love especially being a dad as you are James Coe a ... you you have the uh the cap and watch it the camera night vision system okay you know kids\nIn cars are one of the more difficult scenarios especially with young kids and it's just everything makes it easy when you have a minivan\nOur circuits are poli who's starting Center for the chargers in two thousand and sixteen\nI Believe so rotating group there to help a rookie guard who relies on standard\nAnd make sure you wind up correctly hears walking scheme here's what's going on and he's got three guys that he's already played next to that doesn't help at all\n... of it you know they put a bunch of money and to him as a free agent he was hurt last week but truthfully he's going to get benched anyway they're making a move to Greco and right tackle we know that they try to air flowers we know that didn't work they tried to shop and no one wanted to take him they caught him and get up in Jacksonville\nAnd you're starting you know Chad Wheeler right tackle not drafted free agent\nSo yeah that's a long way\nOn the real issue\nFor them but it's happening all different places and now\nA team that they hoped would contend you can tell by this week with the trading of Eli Apple the trading of snacks Harris than that there are open for business that way and even John Barrow who owns the team probably said this past week at the owners meeting yeah this is not going to be a quick fix rebuilt to stop so here we are\nJames go downhill a on the richer than show we go to Charles Davis the Charles Davis joining us as well hey Charles can you talk about what the mood might be with New York man because again you talked about a team that you know struggled to win a game or that their trading away some of their best players I mean I was absolutely floored\nThat they traded away snacks 'cause again I mean I I Know they've been given up some yards on the ground but still everyone recognizes snacks is one of the best defensive players they got on that team to trade them away for for what they got to I think it was a fifth of my own pick I I was blown away by that and I'm sure that does not sit well with the current players on that team\nWell you so you probably have seen the tweets from Lynn Collins is you know the divine ... who's in Detroit now play with the giants was like\nYeah hey [laughter] it it was going to go to sleep rough you know [laughter] so you know I'm sure\nThe players aren't happy because snacks is pretty popular there but go back and look at the number of places percentage of plays James okay and that's and that's going to tell you a big reason we're about what's going on yeah she's one of the elite runners\nOffenders in the game but he's not playing that much or nearly what you would expect him to be applying\nVoted they're still not stopping the run you know ... and that's what he's supposed to be there to to solidify right\nIn the last but not least that no one's going to talk about he's got a very unwieldy contract ... and for them to make a move to get better they had to get there they got to get rid of some of that Detroit which still has designed like day to get it in the NFC North Korea don't want to take it off the elevated yet not totally\nWell what if they've been really bad at this year round being known yeah and Matt and Matt Patricia has\nBeen around as a defensive coordinator what his\nTeam throughout caught big guys inside who can stop the run and help them out everywhere else he's got to look at a stack Harris and as as an investment and that to get things going\nFor his his new program and Detroit so it makes sense for both sides in a lot of ways\nEspecially when you're in one in six they're going to be other players are going to talk about your age are yet to read it\nI mean I'm stuck getting ready to nor is Jake and keeps popping up right I'm Olivier Vernon name pops up although I don't see that one is coming because the way the contractors structure so I'd be a real surprise and of course the conversation is\nWhen do they actually make a move with Eli because last year ... regime as you guys remember they drafted David ... to get out of Colorado throughout they decide they need to see\nLate they need to see another quarterback late in the season so they ... and kill the streak of two hundred and ten straight stars\nBut you know he was very proud of\nThey start you know so that so the first one you sit down and you have your heart conversation with your your veteran quarterback we're going nowhere this is what we want to do and I'm sure they could have come up with a pretty good deal with him I really think that I think when they said we're going to venture for dino Smith that went right out the window [laughter]\nThat's right yeah we had to\nShip with a plan and and Gino Smith is not a plan you've got tape Andrea knows that you've seen him in the league find out if you're a rookie can play\nThis year they drafted Colorado force rocket out a rich but he's been an active every game so behind the scenes they have to start ramping up in deciding if they're going to play him which I think they have to because they pass and every quarter pack in last year's draft they got to find out after I got into vestments wild letter\nBefore they go into next year drought so when do they pull the plug on Eli when do they have this conversation I think behind closed doors are the people who run the team or having\nThat conversation I think this week's game is probably after it's over that conversation ramps up into high gear\nNow I think you're probably right and you have ... who you said it's been an active and then you also have Alex Tenney\nNo no they they come on [laughter]\nThat's out there you\nCharles [laughter] ...\n[laughter] out here but we saw Alex ten minutes from my\nPoint he's not he's not an NFL caliber quarter meaning let me finish do you have any like any kind of really a good trick shot artist I\nHad I had to throw it in because every time I say Alex candy people look at me funny and especially when I'm back home in the north east and they go away and I go way played at Monmouth and they go oh yeah yeah yeah basketball sit on my\n[laughter] no mine mine [laughter] in the north east\nWell he played a mom lives in ... was it Richmond certainly not a big time a power five programmed by any stretch of the imagination ... one\nOne double A. versus division to a little different might be just maybe are they to mom to yeah anyway\nBut in any in any event it's been interesting to watch and I hate it for you lie because one thing about him when everybody can criticize this and criticize that that guy's answered the bell\n... every time and we always\nTalk about quarterbacking consistency guys showing up\nToughness you know people might not think of ... an all time tough guy how many NFL quarterbacks answered the bell sixteen games a year and year out it's hard to do\nAnd I think he's doing he paid the price Charles for that I feel like you can't even move around he he's already\nThree thirty seven and was never great over to where and when you become thirty seven movie you've been there [laughter] you\nNeed that officers line to be better you need things to to to go well they were hoping Barclay and the draft choice of Barkley I don't think you can criticize it in terms of production\nBut they were hoping he would make you officers lined better he would help you lie out the problem is if you've done it to such an extent that maybe the ball is in getting down to feel as much as they walk and I know what I Would look at me and go abroad you stand in the pocket\nDrive around [laughter] basically that\nThat's that's where I could run into everybody wants to push it down steel ... remember what it takes to push it down for you and they don't have that to a great extent right now\nHe could end up saying that even the production meaning um oh yeah I think he probably will yeah\nI I Want to ask you about a friend of yours somebody who you coach with at Pacific I Believe\nI'm an actor and no not Hugh oh a John John ... and uh you go way back when John grew newer friends with John grew in John ... is having a relative of it what what what is your what is your take on what is going on in Oakland right now\nI really wish I had a good take on it\nOne of the things that you have with friends and I know it's different in our business because sometimes because of our friendships we get more stuff than others but I'm the pikes over you know I'm not writing for living I'm not breaking stories for a living that sort of the deal\nSo I'm able to take my friendship with John and keep it right there ... like don't ask in these sorts of things when we talk we don't have those types of conversation so everything I'm about to say All right I'm saying as a person who's observing\nAs an analyst as a person who's watching the league I don't know what's going on there I I like to know what the plan is I'd like to know what's happening the giants are now telling us that they're rebuilding right with the moves that they're making\nThat point that can take as the Oakland said we're going to rebuild now it's been jarring because you're rebuilding getting rid of ... approaches prime yet you're getting on her mark Cooper who's supposed to be a thousand dark receiver and he's had consistency a quarterback so don't know what's happened to bear\nAnd right on down the line and this was a team that and just like the giants they were in the playoffs two years ago so we didn't think it was a huge ... and ... and they change over but both of these teams in two years' time have ... or decided to turn over the roster so it's a very interesting look at it\nJust put it this way I don't know where Oakland's playing next year because\nThey don't have the least for Oakland right now I'm not sure Oakland wants them back for next year but they will go on to Las Vegas with an entirely new book\nYeah no I I don't think there's any question\nAnd three first round picks and this year's draft which they need to hit or\nWould they got hit on all of them right after you were to you know in every single one in Cleveland\nLast two years ago never when Cleveland that the three first round picks I Would say that they've hit on that yeah you know if you look back All right miles Garrett Dodger broke peppers David in joke I think all three of those are hits and then they supplemented it this year with Baker Mayfield is Denzel or you can't say that the brown didn't draft good players\nAre before we let you go Charles and thank you so much for coming on I I I really appreciated um your face lift ... little inside baseball in terms of you out and calling games um you've been doing a far longer than I have been one of the\nAlso this week in Nineteen sixty six the beach boys good vibrations made its debut on the U.

another guy\nYou know if you believe in yourself you know I mean if you if you think you can perform in Little Rock and you have that ...\nThought Jim bay I'm was upset or you know I write when he was saying that he was actually laughing as he said it you know a bronco tweeted\nA the quote that was making the roundabout Jim am saying LeBron did a nice job helping his client oh they're big mad with the crying faithful bronze said Jim am respond and fed not me I'm happy for him I Wish him the bass\nGood man that's good I think you're right I had I had read the the quote\nYou just hear the quote and you know Jim ... personality and you write that he's just being snarky true and kind of upset but no I mean look at the ... of all people understand what the system and what how college basketball as working these days it's just\nThat's the argument right and you go to the ... you can play in front of a thousand people if that and you're playing against grown asked men how how are you actually improving and getting better or you go to do Kentucky Kansas big school twenty thousand national TV every single game\nTo get yourself ready for the NBA at I don't know what the answer there I think I Would go to the college route it just seems it seems better 'cause it maybe that's what we always have known and what's always been dark but\nYou know again it's just if I think if you didn't have to worry about the financial side of it hundred percent I Do that because what Dan just said which is you know you get that national exposure\nBut if you got real life problems in in in a hundred grand will go a long way to fix some of those problems I just don't I mean I just don't know how you can cause you can always go back to college man that that's my thing you know you can always go back to college not to play ball but to get an education um but\nBut again for these one unknown guys it's not about the education not only in the long view you\nYou cannot compete with the exposure and the TV Time you get when you go play for a top program and if you ... if you went to games in the NC double a tournament like you suddenly you're coming out but how many people knew tray young was\nBefore he did what he did it Oklahoma yeah that's true you know an Internet yah yah he's on the cover of Sports Illustrated\nBut I mean how many players are I mean how pathetic yeah I didn't know what you're not getting that and it's a hundred percent because of what Dan said he got that exposure\nBut again I think that's a bit of a lottery ticket man and if if it's a question of do I bet on myself like you say or do I just take the guaranteed money and again you're Eighteen years old Seventeen years old give me that guaranteed well\nPart of the problem this is rich Paul says a ... in this whole scenario is that it is a a broken system where these guys aren't allowed to go directly from high school to the NBA like we've seen before now that could eventually change at some point but that's why they did a the\nRestructuring of the deal with the G League to make it so you could make over a hundred thousand dollars if your kid coming out of high school\nMan let me just say this I think there's a middle ground here and I think if if the colleges don't want to pay that's fine but let these do pick up endorsement deals let these guys do commercials let these guys make appearance fees let them make money outside of this college go and not have that negatively impact him I think that's a good middle ground and that is something they absolutely need to explore\nYeah I just where do you draw like ... what do you pay a starter versus the sixth man how do you know there's so many\nBut let me outside companies figure that out you don't need to let the school's figure that I'm saying you know keep it if you want to keep it quote unquote cure for the schools where they're not going to pay the guy that's fine but let them pursue outside ventures\nI I think there are certain things you could allow them to to market or profit off of I just think once you open up Pandora's box and you start paying these players\nThan they are all the sudden professional athletes and there is absolutely no need to go to ... you're not you're not doing anything outside of worrying about how you're gonna get your next paycheck and let's not forget that these guys actually do get stipends it's not like it used to be right where they get four or five thousand dollars a semester and they get\nHousing and they get so it's not like they don't get nothing yeah you know I'm\nYou know we we we tend to forget about that though that that is a discussion that we could fill a three hour show on whether to pay college players or not they certainly they bring in a lot of money especially the college football programs for the team so uh we're\nGoing to find out what Brian when worst thinks about all this and just a few minutes ESPN insider been covered LeBron's seemingly forever a way we're right it'd be she's pretty crazy right yeah uh since his days playing high school basketball in Akron James code Dana Eli filling in for rich eyes and we're going to be back with a win wars in just a couple of minutes\nOne hundred million dollars they're going to remember him when she had [laughter]\nAnd do it I Know that that's what he does the off season and then I I'm not denying in that but let's remember what the main thing is here\nBut it's not I don't want to get too deep into like looking at a standings and asking about the raptors or the boxer or they're not going to by the way I I I think you're going to be a very good team or Tim connelly's on a great job putting that squad together what are the women two or three biggest stories\nThat you are going to be keeping an eye on as we go through the season in the association\nOf to me um there's two players that I'm watching very closely and their and their teams one is why Leonard\nUm I think the rafters are awesome uh this is it ... and I and I I'm very aware because I have covered the raptors very closely over the last four years I Am very worried that\nPeople have said the raptors are often in the past and then they have not been awesome when it mattered [noise] um I think this team is a different level and I think it's because of collide collide conjunction with the fact that LeBron is no longer really the main for as much as people want to talk about\nThe Celtics and the and the Seventy Sixers both of whom I highly respect amongst the three teams the raptors have the best player ... um and the team with the best player\nWins a lot of the time and you know what happens with the raptors in what's called why\nAgain this is going to define a little bit of the balance of power in the NBA and then I looked at the New Orleans couch in finance and he thinks I'm Anthony Davis has got it he has he has arrived\nHe's had his awakening he knows his power or we see this with great players at the top of their game of the game and the NBA um sometimes it happens in their fourth year happens in there a Pierre Anthony Davis is in his seventies here and he has got it he is he is understood\nAnd uh he has grown basically into an MBA adult she understands how he and manipulate games or we can control games how he can raise the level of games that his teammates\nHe as figure it out in the last year and watching him play now and watching him lead his teammates and figure out how to do things to take care of his teammates\nAnd and raise his teammates up is very rewarding to see him graduate to that and how far this pelicans team does this year and that if he can carry them you know he can do something might get them to the conference finals\nAre and how that will impact or his future they're both of those situations are are going to be fascinating to watch not just for the season but what happens in the future with ...\nJames go downhill here of filling in on the rich are then show joined by a\nRight wing or say can you talk about the situation there in Minnesota you know I'm fascinated by because Jimmy Butler obviously you know making waves\nUm I have you heard anything there in regards to you know trades possibly and also what to trickle down effect does that have on on maybe a hot seat or or doesn't get any hotter for somebody like ... I went to that\nHome opener last week um and I've never seen anything like it a first off I'm Jimmy was getting booth to start and and\nAnd the pay chance at the end [laughter]\nGot booed louder than than Jimmy ... dead and even though the wolves won the game it seems to me that everybody on the walls is in a bad mood except your\nUm me is like he's enjoying this I mean he\nI talk to them after the game is like I Love being the villain and I know that that's something people say like kind of think he does um\nYou know what the what we are if if this is still some sort of weird stand off if we get to like late January um uh we'll see if that's different but I tell you I've seen a lot of things in the NBA the last two decades I've never quite seen\nSomething like that because we see trade the man's contingency trade demands an ultimately will continue to see players get their wish a lot of times when they want to be traded violently think\nAt the end of the day Jimmy Buffett will be on their team next year if not sooner\nBut I've never seen a guy who's willing to embrace the fallout normally this is\nSomething that a player has to soldier through and has to deal with um you know sort of the burden of breaking himself free as if he's going through some sort of got lent some sort of a trial um Jimmy is doing it with a smile and if it's bothering him he's doing a wonderful job of hiding it and it's certainly not showing in his play\nWho's the most likely to end up in LA with LeBron next year\nI don't have a good read on that because the Lakers have a couple of things going against them and the free agency session number one a handful of these guys who are going to be available I'm already have championships a co why clay Thompson I'm under rant\nThey don't need to link up with the Bronx to win\nAnd that's something that you would for you know liked to have that in your pocket secondly I'm the Lakers or the great advantages of being in LA is that it's such a desirable place to be in fact\nI Would argue that the LA and never in the history of the NBA has LA then more desirable for players to live a when I first started covering the league Fifteen sixteen years ago a lot of players lived in Atlanta a lot of players lived in Orlando in Miami\nI'm In New York now the in almost the entire NBA spends their summer either in Los Angeles or the surrounding areas or San Diego and so it's never been more than a bigger drop but here's the thing the clippers or if they're too and the clippers have kept space and the clippers are no longer a laughing stock\nAnd both New York teams are going to be in the market as well both and that's in that 'cause I Know you'd say well why would anybody go play for then that's when they could play the Lakers well you know it may be playing with the broad isn't as desirable I'm as it may be was five years ago because he's older now and\nAnd you know there's other options for the Lakers have to have to fight up hill little but that said interesting enjoy great advantages over just about just about every team you know the daily papers are going to have a thirty five or forty million and kept states next year I doubt that they're going to be able to get in [laughter]\nI don't play with the Lakers I don't want to stay safe ooh hoo but uh I I don't\nThink it's a guarantee that the Lakers get a major ... next year and that is why they're not going after Paul George and then even with the lesson learned\nHaving knocked off Paul George knocked going after Hawaii Leonard to me is a serious decision now a year from now they could be sitting there with LeBron and Duran together oil abroad Nikolai together or LeBron James he bought their together and we could be saying well they're waiting it out is done fantastic because now they have both stars and all their young players\nBut they've taken a significant gamble with a guy in the brawn James who doesn't have time on his side and this crime\nWell then this is the last one wrong question all eyes because I Know that's basically your life is is LeBron on on a constant basis I contend that the move to come to LA and not at a significant piece in this first year tells me that LeBron\nIs content with knowing that he may never win another championship and he's thinking so much about his post basketball career in post basketball life that the importance of those other things right now are almost on par with the next four years of his basketball ... am I crazy\nI think he had a bunch of flawed choices last summer\nHe could have stayed in Cleveland that team is obviously sort of turn the corner and passage prime and we have several teams are you know rising are attached to challenge them [noise]\nUm he could have gone to Houston but there was no clean white for him to get there and they would have been some issues on sharing it and everything plus I don't really\nKnow if he was all excited about living in Houston\nI'm he could've gone to Philadelphia where he may have been immediately able to win a championship but again I don't know if his family was no connection to Philadelphia was interested in doing that\nUm and then he would have you know that he had Los Angeles where his family absolutely love to be get a lot of different business opportunities but the team with farther away those other teams\nUm it was all a bunch of flawed choices and so he went with a choice that I think\nShe could live with not winning a championship then which is to be in Los Angeles and so if he doesn't win again it will be in a place where he can enjoy being at the very least and looking in the future I still think knowing LeBron\nHe still wants to win he still not conceding anything that said I Do think it's interesting that after years after four or five years of people trying to make space jam with him he's finally going to make the movie\nIn the summer that looks like he's not going to be in the final so the first time in my life I think there is some connection or what his along with his outlook is short term for the Lakers\nAre certainly everything he's touching right now off the court is is turning the gold gold may Ryan went or sick he's so much for the time I Know time is valuable you're one of the best in the business we really appreciate the inside my front\nTake care guys have a good that\nI was ... when there is a interesting insight on the brown and the rest of the NBA and I think\nA ... in terms of liberal situation he's right there really wasn't one clear cut choice for him to go to um in terms of winning another championship lifestyle the longevity you gotta wait take all those things into account uh and that's how it sounds like he agrees with with my son is\nA lot you know again I I don't think the uh you know he's not putting winning above all else that is clear right you know what I mean so yeah I think you know in a way I think you're right there but ... minutes it's awfully tough I'm\nI actually am surprised he didn't choose Philadelphia because they've got a good set up over there so if you want to do and that's probably good place to go that", "show_name": "Rich Eisen",
