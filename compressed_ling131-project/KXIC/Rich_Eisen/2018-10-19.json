Robinson\nJamal Crawford is great I Love Jamal Crawford I I Love watching him come off the bench and he had a couple of seasons one of the average twenty points and he I mean he could just light up a Orlando Woolridge at a pretty good run\nScoring the Getty I'd have to look more closely comments that average Seventeen Again\nOr his career clip Robinson is not eligible on two fronts the only played for five teams and he wants to be an all star team\nNot eligible for art okay well how did that slip by I ...\nI got him was six teams did he play for somebody twice could be but that does it that was that okay wait I got Seventy Sixers bullets cabs kings Lakers nuts is that the other problem to that's the other one the guy who is in the Malone trade\nClip promising to play for Portland or we we must be diverse dares to clip Robin ... private yeah there's a clear promise you know average Seventeen points a game yesterday\nBut I feel like nothing says journey even more than playing for the same team multiple [laughter] hell here at the very definition of a yeah we got this guy back again\nJoan Crawford might be the best journeyman an NBA history 'cause he's played for the bulls clippers hawks Knicks timber wolves blazers warriors\nAnd six men year helps your case enemies you couldn't start any\nOh he average right at Fifteen points right at fifty well that might go down with the

incarnation of the country and it was just continued after just two years in Nineteen sixty fourth\nList yesterday on the radio show\nNo interference shall be allowed when a field or reaches over a fence railing rope ... into a stand to catch a ball growing up in New York City only Yankee game it was always know football's into saying somebody's reaching you do not let the field to go get that baseball\nSo um that's what's coming up on the show a for for two or four which is the number to dial I've got four downs let's do four times\nHere down here we go\nDown here's my for my for downs prior to week seven I'm In bulk um and the first down comes off of last night's Thursday night game with the cardinals with an absolute blowout loss at home [noise] and turn the music is a little bit if you look at it and then um [noise] and then I saw\nShannon sharks tweet last night I don't usually start my Ford announced this way but Shannon sharp tweeted out last night that Peterson ask for a trade you're better than this and deserve a chance to compete for title [noise]\nMeaning Patrick Peterson [noise] I saw that I'm trying to put two and two together [noise] and my buddy stone street he put this he puts his being my bonnet if you will just a few days ago after the chiefs couldn't stop a couldn't catch a cold basically stop a cold [noise] against the patriots [noise]\nHe put this in my head about Patrick Peterson the chief should make a trade for Patrick Peterson [noise]\nInteresting you know when the chiefs are missing Patrick Peterson [noise]\nYou know what and it might cost them and the cardinals will probably sit there and say you know what we cannot [noise] admit we're rebuilding but guess what you're rebuilding [noise]\nYou're rebuilding Byron laugh which is now your new on friendship coordinator you may be terrific but you just you just\nYou just can't you're all kinds of coordinator in week seven you've got a rookie quarterback you've got an offensive line that hasn't been a walk in both today [noise]\nIf you just a minute maybe seven weeks ago that you're rebuilding in a way or you're you're not ready to win championships right now it would be helpful [noise]\nMaybe you get a lot from the chiefs and if you're the chiefs you give a lot right now this is an iron that is hot and you strike well that is hot and the two thousand Eighteen season is a potential Super Bowl winning season [noise]\nAnd ... seasons change and years change and you have a chance to win it this year [noise]\nAnd you could put Patrick Peterson your secondary I have no idea what it would take to make happen but the chief should be knocking on the cardinals door to make it half what do you think of to around her I don't know the chiefs berries not walking through that door where the heel injury coming off of an Achilles\nIf I'm the chiefs to I'm calling Steve ... saying let's talk certainly with the trade deadline and a couple of weeks and [noise]\nPay the ravens defense it's another to eat that I saw this week somebody tweeted out that the defenses are horrible and the national football league all defenses are horrible and Eric ... responded not all\n[noise] because the ravens defense is no joke the ravens defense is first and points per game first in total yards pregame first in a given waste first second in passing yards per game [noise]\nThey're awesome they sat markets marry out eleven times last week and a lot of people when you hear about the ravens having the best defense and the national football league there's the yeah bought\nBuffalo Denver at home at Cincinnati Cincinnati is got to really quality op eds at Pittsburgh at Tennessee well even if you think that those aren't serious tests on the road\nHere come the same coming off of by week the ravens have a chance to cram themselves on defense this week and the ravens defense ranked second the ravens as all the ravens deep bench at home this season eight point five points were game have you ever now [noise]\nNow you know the saints can do that with almost almost get that when one touchdown and to point diversion [noise]\nSo I Can't wait to see this one here's a great step forward to the ravens ranked second point that parental the season behind only the rams the rams are plus Seventy eight point differential the ravens are plus Seventy ... they have a chance to be ground themselves this week that second here's third\nDownfall okay\nYour Detroit Lions are coming off a by week as well and it is time to stop sleeping on the Detroit Lions love that the Detroit Lions are at Miami taken on ... and I can come out and say that they will not poll a um bears this weekend I don't think [noise]\nAnd then the Detroit Lions are holding for Seattle they have to ... games in division at Minnesota at Chicago [noise]\nIf they get through that with three wins let's say they get through it would just too but if they get three wins and they're out there they can get them their home for ... home for Chicago on Thanksgiving a home for the rams they can make some hay here and I know a lot of just giving you some teams that have some quality records [noise]\nBut the lions don't sleep on um they've got a really good on science they're they're running games only going to get better and do your job scheme that big coaches brought in usually gets better as a season goes along [noise]\nI Want it made them my hot take plank fourth down saying you're going to win their lines are going to win the NFC North but I still think the powers are going to do it that's why I didn't do that okay so I save the fourth down for a different\nAlright I guess my favorite part of the week hot K plank ... okay [noise]\nIt is [noise]\nIn the beginning they believe in the Dallas Cowboys but I watch their defense jailing Smith ... is ball and now\nHe's going to start throwing himself and defensive player of the year [noise]\nTerritorial he keeps falling out like this ... and the Dallas Cowboys defense is following him and making plays the Dallas Cowboys have a huge road game this week against the Washington Redskins if they win this one [noise]\nThey would be sitting\nIn first place in the NFC East at foreign three\nI Know the Philadelphia Eagles are still sitting there but here me out the Dallas Cowboys would be foreign three going into it by with a Monday Night home game against Tennessee a Sunday night or Philadelphia and I listen to this Atlanta to home three home dates in a row [noise]\nMore ... apathetic Leno eleven [noise] three on dates in her role as a matter of fact there four out of their last six is at home and their two road games are at Indianapolis in the last game of the year at the New York giants when it's could be all way over for that [noise]\nHome for Washington home for New Orleans home for Philadelphia at Indianapolis home for Tampa at the giants the Dallas Cowboys they go into the by we could force\nEarly career has never been a perimeter shooter um hottest holiday it back in with Ron do gone I mean that's that to me is a big wait and see what what they're going to get out of their back\nAnd have the timber wolves a survived the Jimmy butler stormy here because after the game he was talking about well now let's just trying to figure out how to win ballgames did they did they get through whatever seemed to be tearing that team apart\nOne we can go from our conversation now Chris\nYeah I I think they've I don't know if it got through might be a little strong but\nI I think they've the tensions then relieved to some degree um within that team and a lot of rich I always thought and I said this for the last month this was always the most likely scenario for this team because Tom typically do is just not going to make it deal\nThat doesn't get him back\nMaybe not equal value but eighty five Ninety cents on the complicated by the time too but it wants to wait at all costs and he doesn't care about locker room tension he doesn't care about dealing with issues with ownership he did that in Chicago\nFor the better part of three or four years at the end of his run there he doesn't care about anything that doesn't have to do with helping him win basketball game so I was somebody comes up with a massive opportunity butler I think can be brothers that is that\nSo there to stay even pass next February even pass the trade deadline or does something that still premature to even discuss right now\nA little premature but the issue with butler from what what I was told from a few people was always been money and his belief that there wasn't going to be\nA five year max contract waiting for him kind of at the end of the season I mean that's what what he assumes he's going to get look I don't blame any team for not wanting to give ... bought there are those that many years at that many dollars you know butler at some point is\nYou're going to be paying for past performance gimme bother his body I don't think he's going to make it all the way through\nA five year deal at least not playing it this kind of level so you have to kind of upset\nWhen you're thinking about this guy how many years in by going to get this skinny bought the before we start to see some kinda declined to two years three years can we get the four years this is the conversation on some front office people have had\nAs they prepare for the summer of two thousand Nineteen so if if the devil is willing to pay Jimmy Butler I think he'd stay in Minnesota I'm just not so sure the economics are therefore I'm there\nChris Mannix two more minutes left for the Yahoo Sports a columnist and host of Yahoo Sports NBA podcast year\nOn the rich eyes and show and tonight Boston Toronto so that's an issue when ... first taste of this uh eastern conference top of the top of the food chain combination here and then golden state's in Utah a which has all sorts of ... up and comers obviously with Donovan Mitchell leading the charge\n'em which do you think has the opportunity most to to knock off or the other one it's all said and done Toronto against Boston or Utah I Know I'm Talking about a a dynastic team and Golden State but do you think they've got the the right stuff potentially hear Chris\nYou know I I think Iran is a bigger threat to Boston than Utah is the Golden State I mean the two games the Celtics played against the raptors last these they just got club in Toronto or lost both his games by an average in Nineteen point um that\nYou know people don't talk often enough about the raptors bench because there's not a lot of sexy names there but you know guys like ... or Jana nobody and frankly in the late governor right these guys can play and these guys are young they're athletic they've are still play multiple positions you collide Leonard into that mix\nYou got something there that this ... this is a great slate of gay not to get you get ... about the games\nThemselves but the great to game tonight because I think this is in eastern conference bottles preview with the Celtics and the and the raptors I think it could be a western ... preview with the jazz and the wars I mean\n... continuity rich and the NBA feuds\nAnd the jazz did the smartest thing they possibly could they didn't go out there and try to find some kind of silver bullets high player that makes sense for what they need they resigned their guys and they're continuing to grow they've got maybe the best developmental program in the entire NBA Quinn Snyder is brilliant that went to the gym is a tremendous uh evaluated her\nUp young talent they have kept their core together for a few years now and if Donald Mitchell keep the sending I think this team is going to be neck and neck with Houston that number to see\nIt in the west so you think uh what are the odds we see Gracie now and just put a foot in front of Steph Curry tonight wouldn't that just really awesome Chris I said I don't think they\nTolerate that in Utah all that well I wouldn't go over as as as I Know the Snyder stat pretty well I don't go over all that\n... or do I mean it's all due to ... and plus ESPN my pay money to see that I think the caller's point would probably put money on the lawns of would you please do that Grayson\nHey look you remembered summer league racing Alan RT mix it up a couple of times I mean he's that's right he's got talking on his back and he knows it too I Would also wonder I mean how much is great now and really going to be in the regular season rotation early on that for me\nAnd the gene league announcement yesterday Kris uh that they're going to offer a buck twenty five to one and done players and give them an opportunity to be exposed to NBA infrastructure rather than being one and done it the collegiate level how much did the NBA have to do with that\n[noise] well I mean the NBA has everything to do with with what the Julie does and and look they had been exploring the you know that they're not they're tired of the one and done stuff that they want to change that looking for ways to\nAh make its you know more palatable for these guys to come out but not necessarily come out and uh and come into the NBA I still rich\nI don't know if it's going to make that much of a difference I I just think you know there's too many kids that\nYou know go out and you know I was twelve and Thirteen year olds watching Duke in Kentucky and the final four and even if they don't want to stay for years and don't give a damn about college itself they want that experience I I just think for one year it's it's gonna be too if you're not going to get enough takers to make it really relevant but rich\nIf you're like takes dying lambs and for example\nIf I didn't want to go to college a hundred and twenty five grand wouldn't make that much of a different didn't get a sneaker deal it probably pay him ahead of time you know mid six figures if not more\nUh because these guys want to get into you know there's die on Williamson team and be part of his NBA future so to me for the top tier guys money it never really been the big issue they they just want at least I think they want that that major college experience one season\n[noise] crushed appreciate the time man you you did the the uh the family gamble today we were in an interview by my wife and now me I think my children the only people to answer questions posed by me and my wife today that's about it yeah I mean you\nWant me to to talk to your kids I can face\nTime of year how much do you charge for babysitting crushed her ma\nI mean it goes up because you're out in ... in the west coast and I'm I'm dealing with a nice fall weather in the northeast right\nNow okay well actually it would be easy because just put the Celtics on for the kids to do ... I\nI Do I tell you what I Do is an east coaster I don't want to be up every night watching LeBron the Lakers\nOf the time but you I'd rather not be involved in in the ... like that and you're in the coin flip in your investments if you get six to eight percent a year that's good\nGambling ...\nDidn't even ask me what dog bingo as you know I have no idea what Doug bingo is like a bingo board but instead of B.\nTwelve the it's a bed Lincoln terrier golden retriever\nAnd you're going to mean you've got a board of of of dog breeds that's you're bored and you're pulling out yes wow yes stumped bingo I did that during the second quarter of last night's Thursday Night Football game away from everybody I crushed it [laughter]\nWhat did you meet your your five year old and my seven year old [laughter]\nYes what'd you get the pug for the you know\nA middle was my middle was the right in the middle aboard\nChild show the ... you know and they and my kids argue over which board they can get they want the board with the Dalmatian they want the board with a golden retriever that's the law by the way it's great anybody out there you want to have if you want to get something for your kids by the way it's amazing\nIt's amazing ah let's go to let's go to Ken in Boulder, Colorado what's going on Ken\nNewell rich how are you a long time listener first time caller fantastic think Conan Last\nNight I was watching uh I was watching for professional games that wants I\nIt I was watching the avalanche I was watching the Broncos I was watching the Sixers and I was watching a baseball game and uh you know I was thinking\nAbout hockey is the play offs everything gets more attention to the playoffs same thing in baseball baseball love the playoffs intensity ramps up pitching is better [noise] uh\nBut baseball I feel is losing its role and see and I was thinking one way that we can get that back is all about the hockey playoffs is that the intensity picks up you've got a lot of teams in people really interested especially those teams that make it what if baseball cut this season say twenty five games ...\nAnd ... started the playoffs in September doubled the amount of teams that got in\nPassively gave the division winners of buy in a in a first five game series I think that would include a lot more cities get the excitement built up and some of those cities interesting uh it would take the focus off of the pre season and\nPut it back on some of the head of races ... ... you're going to get better baseball in in in in September you going to have a lot of good games but let me ask you this question can help make baseball a little more relevant\nTo the problem is is that means what teams like the Phillies would have gotten in a or or I'm just going off the top of my head here outside the age than the mariners would have gone to end up going to have some\nTeams that get in that aren't going to go anywhere but Tampa but you know that gives the fans something something to cheer about either you know even if you're not going to get the big ratings in those first series but you're going to expand the amount of people have watching\nThat can appreciate the call thanks very much call back it's Ken in Boulder, Colorado interesting songwriter Boulder, Colorado\nHome of ah the gummy ... that would bring you the ideas like that right [laughter] now suggesting that is with tens of doing the spare time but I don't I don't I don't know how so what would that\nBe September would be best if three Ceres Vesta five series between the mariners and the Yankees\nWhat are you going to play a hundred and forty five games here you there's an idea about ... idea of it would be good as September with all those call ups were suddenly there's forty people and suddenly it doesn't matter if you throw your bullpen fifty million times and the night because you've got rod more arms coming up\nFrom double layer AAA because it's all over yeah but that could become an August call up now and then I don't want to see those call ups anymore it it it changes the game change when you play you play a certain way from from April all the way through September woman in September when an October\nIt's kinda strange that you're allowed to do that\nAre posed brought you bought a Honda Odyssey to perfect mini van for any family man with a

your tired too much ... guess what here's your wish sit there and watch and the third quarter on the fourth quarter and as a matter of fact you know what can happen is James counters the hot and in labs you stand there when your helmet\nThat could ... entirely happened and what would that happen right there what would that would that mean\nThat just make the stewardess better it is all reason why I'm not all in on the Steelers just yet and one does he come back but the by week we can actually put that aside for a week yeah\nHe's not there okay I mentioned earlier carnal fire to see my McCoy promoted a bar in the left which Josh Rosen injured his tail and their last offensive play last night by the way in\nCase you're wondering how things can get worse for the Arizona Cardinals is that Rosen can't go\nWhen the season is toast and they need him to start getting some wraps right and practice and they need him to get game experience and then how does it get worse is that they have to activate\nSam Bradford who gets a ... ton of money if he plays in his active for a certain amount of games I guess he's got to be active for eleven of the games\nAnd so they're the activating ... basically putting them out there was an Airbus ... because they don't want to pay him right extra five million bucks but that's how things get worse for the Arizona Cardinals\nYeah ... birth than

at six o'clock at night\nI'm just wondering why you know I Know that Fox pays a ton of money and they want to put games in prime time\nBut how many kids do you mean that that little boy that we saw last night celebrating the red Sox win in Houston obviously was passed is bedtime last night but how many kids just you know are going to be passing out in the middle of the fourth or fifth inning of a World Series game of their beloved socks\nAnd I understand that you know you've got to win prime time and ratings mean everything in dollars or are important but what does it matter if you've got a whole generation of people who are sleeping through your most important games and Red Sox games routinely go or every four hours they go forever\nSo some of these games are going to be ending is eleven thirty at night way later on in a white guy again one of the some so look one of these games is on a Saturday\nSo why can't they start that game in the afternoon\nWhy can't I mean there was a two o'clock game here in Los Angeles just this past week it was amazing the beautiful day in LA why can't they start that game it's at four o'clock five o'clock um Milwaukee time\nOn a Saturday and and and baseball just would have to go head to head against however the college football after regional college football coverage\nNow the Sunday game is going against a um the Sunday Night Football game coming up this week or next pardon me next week I mean ... uh see with that is that's also October twenty eight Packers are out here playing the rams\nSo yeah\nIt's you know the the ... that's not something I'd given that week a liaison to the week eight Sunday Night Football game\nIs New Orleans at Minnesota who monster game and how about this let me see if they're playing on a Monday is an off night so they're ... they're they're they're breathing a sigh of relief his New England is that buffalo so an actual patriot game would have been playing\nOr against the world series but no they're not going against Monday Night football so it's going to be New Orleans against Minnesota versus game five of the world series\nSo they're willing to go head to head up against Sunday Night Football but\nI don't understand what's the point of Saturday Night World Series game they want to win and prime time I guess I don't know I mean just give give give the east coast a little bit of a break October's longer sports viewing I'll tell you that these 'cause there's a lot there's a lotta tired people in the Boston area right now watching these Red Sox games\nAre a for for two forwards number down when we come back can't wait to chat with John McClain a calling us from Houston wonder what the hangover is right now in Houston but the Astros big Texans game coming up this week in Jacksonville the rockets here in Los Angeles uh taking on the Lakers clippers and the Lakers is going to be in the Bronx first home game\nHere in Los Angeles that's coming up next on the rich eyes and show\nZip recruiter dot com slash dash is the smartest way to hire when I say that I mean the zipper critter dot com you put your job right there ... or the powerful matching technology goes right to work\n'cause ... they're matching technologies scans thousands of resumes for you find the right people for you with the ride experience for you and I'm like them to apply for your job\nSo you don't have to go through all of these resume you don't have to go through all the hard work all you got to do just posted jobs ... dot com and that is why zipper critters rated number one\nScore from one while I'm assuming the cowboys took care of or any plays at below Brian ... on a sheet that includes number for trying to run it in from the one right I mean when you think that\nThose were she couldn't find a receiver and he took off and that's where he got hurt this last game ... ran twice he said well we had a more conservative game plan with my running but watching it has to be smarter with a ball he's got to get\nRid of it quicker they worked on that all we can practice will see against Jacksonville Jaguars sect them fourteen times into games last year\n... Campbell had six\nI Would imagine he's a base that wants to faced\nMatching so and it seems like Jay Jay wants all the way back John is that a fair assessment\nDalia Ritchie has been great he looks like he did in two thousand Fifteen when he won his last defensive player the year award sex tackles for laws quarterback kids force phone bills he's been great and every era we saw every in every area and we saw it and the second half of the opener\nAgainst New England when he started to look like is all self and now\nHe's back to getting the double teams by the tackles the guards and uh they need other players take up the slack but he's been tremendous fun to watch it yeah he's probably one of the few defensive players I've ever watched did not watch the ball but watch him because he's just been so\nExtraordinary through the years and after knowing what he went through the last two years I'm really happy for\nWell John McLean Houston Chronicle you're on the rich I was in show and having seen what we did see this past Sunday night between homes chiefs Brady patriots what were you might see from the ravens against New Orleans this week one is a viable ceiling for the Houston Texans in two thousand Eighteen\nSee south which I thought was going to be a lot better is mediocre again I think the quarterback none of the quarterbacks playing well except Andrew Luck but he's got nothing around it but that was the other three quarterbacks I think the one that turns around going to be the one that wins the division that could be\n... he had one of the best games of his career against a Texans last year in Jacksonville when genetic beyond cloudy calling trash and so now he's back home I expect ... to play well against the Texans\n... and you saw the cowboys the a couple of weeks ago right there in your home state of Texas what do you think their viability is moving forward and twenty eight team\nI was stunned rich when I saw the Texans shut down the cowboys up and it's just totally shut down as he killed Eliot and then Dallas puts up forty on Jacksonville which has just made the jaguars even\nMore armory going into this game Sunday but anybody looks like right now other than the giants win the NFC East and I picked the cowboys this year like a pick the eagles last year and right now still think they got a chance\nIn a now let's move on to the rockets or you're in Los Angeles this weekend they are going to be first up for LeBron and a purple and gold right here in LA that was a quite a beat down they suffered an opening not against New Orleans what is the expectation levels for the rockets that is\nA nice way to put it down at a because it was actually a lot worse they were playing that a Toyotas center next door to\nMe and it may bark and they're glad that the Astros were planning because they just got a blender rated so it might be good that they're out their expectations here of course are very odd they edit Carmelo\nAnthony to go with James Harden and Chris Paul ... mother pieces but I got off to a bad start but people here still think it's gonna be the rockets and the warriors and the and the western finals again\nSo what do you think they are going to do though John [laughter] I think with all\nThat talent with the new pieces they brought in they needed I think they I don't know rich I was stunned they got beat that bad but they got too many good players Dan ... good coach they shoot those threes like crazy I think there'll be right there behind the warriors\nWell I mean when it all comes down to they lost justice Dallek who is the the pose a defensive guru for this team and that's switching defense that we saw work so well against Golden State until Crist balls hamstring gave away is that any genuine concern for you\nThat it's too early to say that they made remarkable improvement on defense he even got James art and to play defense last to which people\nDidn't know it could and I think I haven't Chris Paul there he's been a tremendous leader and they brought in a couple of players who are defensive specialist but you never know when you lose somebody what the impact is going to be on the team but I think they're still got so much talent there's no way they're not going to be right there at the end\nAll right now or is there any ... on your your hall of fame radar John what's your best guess now that we're midway through the season coming up obviously we're going to be having a new class coming in the ... branch is is in this mix for the first time it's pretty exciting on that front how do you how do you see that coming\nDown so happy for Gail and pat bowl and of course a deal I've known forever like you as I grew up in Waco, Texas Dallas Cowboys fan out started hearing about him in Nineteen sixty with text ram it Tom Landry and\nNo one out much gills Mitt to the game is in bad loans and so I haven't two contributors this year I think is just tremendous\nSo what do you think when it all comes down to it with players who might get in like we\nGot locks like chip Bailey Tony Gonzalez and there's one more and I can't remember who it is I see three locks on there's a rash\nI think I'd read is one of the\nRate is another lock and so that makes it tough for the guys who are holdovers but I I Know this rich it gets harder and harder every year because of all the talent that's not just coming out the first time eligible but the guys that are worth a year in and year out\nAnd unless we increase the ballot which we're not going to do it's I feel so bad for those who have to wait but it's so many of learned the never give up hope\nWhy not increased about uh you'd have to talk to all find bosses on that one that's way above my\nPay grade you would you are as part of a selection committee would the members of the selection committee ... like that would\nI can only speak for myself but knowing that many guys are ... that are not in not just the modern Arab seniors I'd love to increase it not as many as the college basketball hall of fame or they had like there's so many can't fit their names and a paragraph so I I Would love to see us at more\nCars I mean when you think about John I'm you know and we are broadcasting right now you straight into Canton, Ohio a on our ah affiliate W. H. B. C. or out there\nUm look and there's just for over a handful over three hundred men in the history of the national football league on which there's fifty three that play every single week for thirty two teams\nI don't think it would dilute the the sport and or that room if you add one or two more every single year I agree\nWith you hundred percent one thing I'd like to see in this came up awake and created a contributor category there was a talk about putting coaches and a contributing category because it's hard for coaches get in when they're going against players and so I Wish they were\nContributors and then we'd be able to get more coaches and they're\nNow I just don't know if you wear this John before I let you go\nYou know since you're you're a man right there in the Gulf south I ask weighed Philips when I saw him for the Thursday Night Football game a few weeks ago was rams throwback\nI asked him I'm like can't you wear a bum Philips led I mean can't we get a ten gallon hat and made by Nike or something like that and he said he would reach out to do something like that don't you think you should do something\nI think he definitely should do that he's got a lot of his dad's cowboy ... big jackets bomb used to wearing when it was cold and you know he's got boots so yeah I'd love to see just put it this way Philips do this son of bomb\nYes what's your favorite bumped Philip story before I left", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Rich Eisen", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "19"}
