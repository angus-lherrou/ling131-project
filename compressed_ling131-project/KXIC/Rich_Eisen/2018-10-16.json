{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "To Ninety five million dollars they they paid him\nAfter he played the entire offseason very well\nNow look you lie manning does not look like a franchise quarterback anymore certainly not in this system the most dynamic player on the field through the first six weeks in the season is without question steak one Barclay there's a whole conversation with Sam Darnell now having the jets at three and three after two solid weeks against Denver and Indianapolis at home\nToo by the way a teams that have a combined three wins same as the jets they're all talking about how Darnell does the second coming of Joe name is how he lies washed up and how sake won despite how good he is looked is the wrong pick for the giants\nPatch Sherman says he still believes in Ely everyone now goes up to John Barrow who is the uh I guess the guy in charge of football for the giants uh ownership structure\nAnd John ... said of oh del I Wish she would create the headlines biased play on the field as opposed to what he says and what he does off the field I think he needs to do a little more playing and a little less talking\n...\nLet's see how oh del takes that\nNow I don't know who's talking to a hotel if he is watching this show or hearing it or my two cents matters at all I Would say take it as it is intended a man who is page Ninety five million dollars on a contract that you want to make every last\nPenny and he is essentially the man who's writing your checks that's it and if you want out then I Will be seeing you more on ESPN\nIf that's what you want to do if you really want out of New York where do you want to go you want to come here to Los Angeles\nSpotlight will be a little less bright me honest with you\nThere's not a lot of long time listeners first time caller is burning up the phone lines from a rancho ... around here when you're driving around it's not\nAs intense trust me I've know both situations maybe that would be the best\nSpot for him if he really wants to if he really wants to get outta there than what I'm going to see him more and more often yelling at water cooler or you know air coolers and and talking out of school so we'll see the next few weeks does he really want to be a New Yorker not because he owner is flat out called him out\nAnd he has a right to do it after everything that went on he decided to say okay let's go and give you damn near a hundred million dollars on a contract that you're young enough to be able to earn every last penny if everything works in New York City\nWhere winning leads to you know NFL commercials and head and shoulders commercials and just ask Justin talk looking what stranded with his New York victories you Dick Clark now\nYou know a guy from a small school in Texas nobody ever heard of when he got drafted look at them now he's everywhere\nSo that's why that the phrase of uh you can make it there you can make it anywhere right now he's not making any lamenting ... he was asked about Eli Manning and ... had this to say about ...\nI think when you're one in five but generally generally means that everybody needs to play better so he's not alone I still we still believe in him but everybody needs to do their jobs in order for us to be successful in right now that's not happening I Know he's the punching bag right now but a lot of guys need to play better when you're one in five\nThat's true too but when he says that he needs to play better\nAnd he says that ... the right guy and get them into the right guy to me that is a tacit green light that\nIf things don't go any better\nGo ahead and make the switch that's the way I read it\nBut once you make the switch you can't go back you can't do what they did last year I I I I don't think\nYou can go back now but if you don't think the line is any good while you're going to put that kid from Richmond out their right to be thrown into the NFC East crucible I think this is going to be ... to eat it if that's the if that's the case and that would be a damn shame\nIf it's the line I don't know what it is everybody who is ... ... anybody who knows scouting in this business and knows quarterback play that I text with and talk with say if you give him time and you're given line of scrimmage ability to go ahead if you if you let him at the line a scrimmage audible like the Manning's do he's still fine\nScheme blocking altogether it's just not working they got to figure it out and they got to figure it out fast\n\nA four four too old for rich number to do here but you

talented running back and this is a damn shame and that\nYou should also pick up you know no no no I Know that but we we you know I don't mean to go to Syria now and I mean view too many things as if they're not human beings that they're actually fantasy players and\nYou know and that's what's most important to us but he's a really talented player and we've got paid got paid so at least there's that and that's why running backs want to get paid your is coming in week one he gets up in the word is it's not that serious\nYeah you what I'm back to miss as much time and he had he missed a monthly comes back and then he gets hurt and he's done\nWhat a falcon season this has meant I mean oh my gosh\nYeah to make matters worse uh that fifty seven year or the mad Brian kicked injured his hamstring on the play or to end the game are you serious yeah he's out or this week falcons signed Georgia to Vicki oh the ... or ... or so he's going to kick this week for Atlanta\n[noise]\n[noise] but the falcons they they have to be looking around with what you know of who they piss off where everyone's getting hurt him as I used to happen to the chargers I Know I'm you know I Know that's why I didn't bring up with Philip in the first hour like boy your your team's pretty healthy [laughter]\nYeah your team's pretty healthy Phillip ... what do you think those are your thoughts and talk about how healthier team is\nA Cooper cup got carded off this uh last week and then he stoning hack right but he's going to miss at least this week Sean McVeigh said so they're there by the forty

meat down there I ... what\nElse uh some big college football news okay Ohio State number two this week\nUh Nick both say you know it's been out most of the year within abdominal or injury had surgery on it he's going to withdraw from Ohio State or he's going to fit his season's done got to focus on rehabbing and get ready for the NFL Draft a lot of people have him top defensive player if not the number one overall pick\nWhen he went down and you had a surgery I texted rear I'm like I I I think you you just so less than ... votes to this girl and gray and he's like no he'll come back you probably wants to play in the Michigan game or whatever\n... this day is that folks visit\nWe are now seeing a situation again we don't know how serious it is or not\nSo I I might be talking out of uh the wrong end here but I'll still say\nHow many times you hear well this player that player because they're not playing for the national title they're just going to shut down no reason to risk getting a ballgame or whatever right\nThis kid's got a chance playing the national title game ... and the way to make the national title game is to win out now there's two teams in Michigan that they play the rest of the way that's going to be of significance\nThere at Michigan State home from Michigan a whole bunch of Buckeye friends would say there's a Michigan is not a a an issue fine at Michigan State certainly an issue\nIs not returning free those won't return for the Big Ten gay championship game and Ohio State there he'll be in\nHe'll be rooting them on getting ready for the ...\n... so many people are saying right now he is number one numeral who know\nYeah the Ohio State statement on this is actually kind of funny uh they started it with the Ohio State football program will no longer realized the talents on the football field of all American defensive and Nick both\nOkay [laughter] ... urban Meyer had quote I was hopeful the nickel to be able to return to play again for us extremely difficult emotional decision for him and his family wish him well\nYeah he's so good he is very good guess what you know how that affects the Ohio State defensive line marginally and they're all they're really loaded [laughter] you know and yeah that's how good they are\nNot so good they are\nOf course him being there just would put them in a different stratosphere\nYou owe more on down there yeah quick NBA note next open up tomorrow your next rich against the hawk do forcing is right there ... according to end vaguely ESPN dot com are pushing us will reportedly be restricted free agent ... off season next unable to reach a contract extension with him\nHe can be restricted which means he can sign an offer sheet somewhere else in the next can match\nI Will hopefully they'll fix that whatever's going on says Dale fix\nBut then again I'm Out your app I like watching them I Hope they win\nSeason opens tonight to game six right Celtics thunder warriors\nOkay ah when we come back mark Ingram has Sixers Celtics thunder warriors it's a double dip on TNT this evening creams in Studio tomorrow by the way ... Abdul Jabbar in Studio day before the bronze takes the court in a purple and gold in Portland\nAnd then uh it's used in here in town Saturday Saturday Night in the downtown hoops still Joe nice kick up a OKC a mark Ingram the saints are evil due to win for me I'm not going to lock\n[laughter] outcome areas back this week that's coming up next year on the ... and show\n\nThe rich guy says [noise] download show dot com\nRich eyes in here for like stream if you're like most of us you've got to balance on your credit cards in a higher interest rate than you'd like\nWhy not turn those balances into one monthly payment at a lower fixed\nInterest rate start saving money and that's where like string comes in like stream offers credit card consolidation loans from six point one for a PR with auto pay you can get a loan from five thousand to one hundred thousand dollars and you can even get your funds\nTo be able to witness it I'm On the failed him on a Monday Night game a in a fashion that he did on a long touchdown pass it was only right through race are working such a great personal such a great teammate\nAre the most down or possible individually me he just quit for so much work day in and day out so for him to be able to reach their mouth on a charm a passing yards leader NFL history it on their super excited heavy deserves it and he's the best ever do it so yeah I'm a I'm a Drew Brees advocate\nWell much has made marketing room about Alabama or sending pro ready kids to the next level what did you when you came out of Alabama uh learn or glean as a rookie from Drew Brees that you still carry today\nWill be a professional just how to come and they prepare yourself day in day out to be the best you can be for the he was just in there every single morning I see him you know you try to get there early and he's in there and watch it so I'm already um he ...\nBefore practice he he'd go out to every single read um you know Eros on air team wraps\nHe just showed you how to be\nA pro he showed you how to take care of your body or anything we needed to know man you just look for ... he lives with all the um great veteran that I had\nAround me you know other guys like will live Ron Harper last lower markers close to Atlanta or just do a number of guys who you know that were veterans that kind of showed me the way Medicare door and when we were both rookies land and uh it was just a blessing to have guys like that who are prominent grow fraud\nAnd I've been able to grow to drill for eight years and a pre said they've got more than anything because like you said man he just he just shows you how to be a pro he\nI'm leading by example if you need this he's always encouraging he's always positive\nUh never never never negative towards a team or towards any situation so there's a blessing to be able to have when I brought quarterback for my career\nAnd so uh what what give me your favorite story of him in a huddle whether it's a comeback or just a a a really pressurized play where he came in and did something really gonna gimme gimme your favorite brief story if you have one\nLast year and there's a million jewelry stories live but I remember one time uh [laughter] I remember when or if he dropped dead\nMan he saw that must have been with the communication or the potential 'cause we have somebody come scot free lenses below drew up a little drew up and uh we all try to pick him up his his lip\nWas blamed for a says liberals blame but like\nLess play I he was a man he was a frustrated his lip was still buddy he called the play and I was able to do a sport touchdown the next drug but it just shows like the ... he had custody of him you know just for your team to blow up protection and you get blow it up the franchise\nTo be a guy who we know we can ... we know we can't let him get sacked I think the first to tighten up maybe like three years ago but I think Iraq ...\nFree off the glue drew a lip bleed or you\nKnow it was right and um you know he got back when I huddle card to play for us and I was able to get a first down and up and goes for a touchdown on that drive so just the grid we know that he has led as it is sad mobile and when your quarterback\nIs the believer in his mouth was laid out his lip still call it a place to live with a focus will still be able to put his ... have success I think that just says a lot about his character of how tough years left but I mean thousands Drew Brees stories a duck that we can talk about for four\nHours I bet so have you ever um ... in a quiet moment brought up with mix saving being a national champion and Heisman Trophy winner of Alabama having the standing to ask Nick Saban what happened in Miami why he and Drew Brees didn't connect their ... I'd\nI'd ... I'd never talk to a I've never talked to several about that man I never have but ah I think that's going to be on my short list without ... since you bring a I'm a I'm a I have to press him about the situation\nYeah well I mean how do how do you know you\nWill ... that's about to say I was like I I Know I'm I'm not mad that it didn't\nWork out of out of work you know Alabama wouldn't be what it is to say you know nor the names on the same kind of worked out for the party but [laughter] right I mean it's a win win a lot and I got to enjoy\nThe fruits of both of them so I'm excited about that you know I got the because\nThe ... they didn't get groceries and you know I got to go to Alabama because you know possibly grass college football coach ever and then I got to get drafted a science where you know I've got to play with no probably best quarterback ever play the game so I get to enjoy the fruits of both of decisions so I'm I'm I'm happy about that a\nFew more minutes left here with mark in your mind the rich eyes and show a so is it safe to say to uh get your husband vote this year my\nTour pillows legit has has a vote that dude is ridiculous you know he he only think he'd play more than two and a half\nQuarter and he tried to hide in the front runner\nWe're asking around here for ... a front runner has ever had the second most snaps at quarterback on his team were wondering about\nThat I highly doubt that that there is no way right\nIt's it's unbelievable normal no but he's not normal he's not normal really mark I mean I admit\nI he's the ball is so beautiful and then then there's the rest of the game I mean he's unbelievable you\nYou could just tell you know he was very polished come out of high school as far as passing the ball man or you can just tell him he's growing and he's learning every single game which is in trouble for the rest of the you know instead\nOf life so roe tied and grow to\nTrim role too [laughter]\nSo ah last thing for you here I Want to I Want to delve into your relationship with Alvin ... here because you guys are are sharing football's a you're back to your back in the mix and he was a bell account for the team for four games than nine tons of is what is your relationship like with him\nWell that's like my little brother man ever since he came out last year he was just you know he was humble down or if he needed to learn he he was willing to learn are willing to do whatever it took to you know be the best he could be and he didn't think he knew everything he didn't put like using title he\nHe just doesn't work man or we just developed a friendship developed a relationship develop the bond he went to Alabama so I knew him for men try you know uh he transferred to a tendency of course but you know he ... he's a crash some type of guy\nYou know he's he's one of us um even though he didn't say I'm so we have that relationship but we just cool man we don't have any animosity we want to see each other do well we want to see each other have great success and we want to do a you know things that I've never been there will be the ... you know every play in the league\nAnd we just keep pushing each other that way man competition breeds acts with and we compete but we're ... we compete ... each other but we also support each other so I think that's really healthy as a\nYou know were appreciative of each other's college and how about how we go about each other or how about how we go about each day and work in and putting ourselves up position to help this team win games last oh that's my ... and that's my do for like ...\nWho is the whose idea what has it been to do a post game interviews together like you did last Monday we\nDated together when I hear one game I think we both had you know pretty good game and we just did it you know we are lockers or right by each\nOther all the time and I think we're about getting drafted both already at the same time and the flow of media was right there and we just kinda\nStarted it then you know I think it was like the fifth fourth or fifth game last year fifth or sixth game last year we started doing it and we just been doing it like that ... percent of our our doctors are right by each other and usually finish and getting ready around the science power or\nOne of the group when the crowd of of media comes over we just say hey man you know it's time for our interview\nAnd ice who leans in touches though who leads there we'll get to the first answer in in that usually\nIt kind of just depends on how to gain weight you know if he went for like two hundred scrimmage yard and three CDs\nI get the first time I had no honey Iraqi artist\nWho rushed me to eat I might get the first question but you know it doesn't really matter um it's all good manned up my guy\nHad ... and his takes him he'll get an is now I mean ice in prayer coming somebody\n[laughter] what a what hold her once the nickname given that again\nPay some true hey somebody you know some or anything [laughter] I\nAm I [laughter] that's great I mean that that is that yeah I think\nHe's the man he's the man we love running that read option with him in the game you know we let it\nI Know I Wish you'd left in the hands of Alan ... last last time 'cause I'm a little yeah yeah yeah he hid it hadn't been outpost you either I don't know if that's brought up an hour\nA yeah any
