that ...\nI was talking about the ... there were many fights where when I did fight um I didn't sleep a for a very long time word didn't sleep for the morning because you were traveling going crazy I'm your energy is still your buzzing I'm it it it's an emotional thing it's a\nIt's a thing that you train many months for many years four and a when you win or lose I'm ... years still kind of taking it all in and um you know\nI had been has never been a part of a huge event like that corner has been a part of the huge fights obviously the may whether one was a historic um Habib had never been part of a spectacle like that and I think you know he let us emotions get the better of\nAnd a vat overshadowed about itself right which overshadowed together to me burying the lead of UFC two

aftermath is here we're we're hearing Dana White saying that it titled could be stripped charity might not be ... uh Conor McGregor is not\nPress charges which to me I think is proof that their he wants to remind you had already tweeted about it because I Know is how difficult it was this this fight was to set up because of his own legal problems because of the Dolly being thrown at us yeah so what do you think happens here\nWell again it's one thing throwing the Dolly at a bus it's outside of you know outside of a fight this will happen during a fight that was overseen by the new a lot of states led a commission and\nThey're probably not going to tolerate something like that so I Would imagine some kind of hefty fine is going to be levied a beep and his team I Am and perhaps it Connor as well\nUm you do see Conor hitting one of the members of of beeps team who was coming over to actually find him so in a way he was defending himself I'm not saying that he was in the right at all both teams or or at fault here um but\nI don't think stripping the belt is necessary I think could be should uh keep the belt I I Do think there will probably some kind of find 'em there and and again I was talking about emotions running Hi\nThis is something I'm not shocked about but at the same time if you're going to do that you have to also be prepared for the repercussions I'm and I'm sure he'll he'll be paying some kind of a\nA check okay and they just because we won't hold you to it and if you're wrong Iran yeah\nJust grown daughter to board and give me a date for the ... oh okay I'm

back to the post daily news days right that's how that's how learning New Years already two years are you aware the reason why the Yankees have won in the playoffs\nIsn't because of anything that you witnessed on the field it's because my audio executive ... was working in a specific booth\nAt Fox and that is what has been the a ... if you will for the Yankees are you worried that Michael is that made it to the New York area at all\nWell see I grew up with my brother tar and uh I Do\nBelieve that to be true yes they're both very positive Yankee ... I really believe\nThat that guy Michael there you go yeah 'cause my ... from New Jersey and Michael proceeding on where you see on where you were you in the booth on friday night though\nYes I was when I left before the game and did not watch it all I did not watch the game\nOh no see my hair because once we're up I got to if I don't watch them from the beginning I don't watch it I gotta sit off what do you think about ... ...\nIt's it's it's dreadful is whether this\nSpat effort to ban effort high turn that on after ... after the home run I turned it on a terrible effort and absolutely terrible effort but I I guess you will you be like where are you gonna be the way we're going to be tonight I'm going to ... oh my oh\nMichael do you have to have anybody on the Michael Kay show works on the show who is an absolute a warm wonderful human being who also just happens to be a complete liar all the time you have anybody like that on your staff [noise]\nAt all wow\nUm we've got the war and wonderful human being but that's straight out lie usually it's one of the other but both is very unusual\nIt is unusual 'cause it's false my which by the wife is a lie that was [laughter]\nI've proven more than ... unless it's because the thing that it's not alive you believe it is asked Michael about David Price and I was even worse than your risk of dying asking this question wow ... ... I think he's October choke artist of all time\nI guess the Yankees I Can't figure it out I I you know how how can you be that bad against one team and be a really top flight victory against everybody else it's just amazing I I don't know if they could use them in a series again there's talk about you know we talked about the both an earlier\nThat they're going to use an adult and tonight well good luck I mean can you imagine when it comes in\nAnd by the way rich you haven't been here a while at the stadium yeah\nThis is really developed into a top flight one of the top three home field advantage is that all baseball\nIs amazing because the new stadium you know did not have that feeling to a ... when did that happened last year that that happened last year you know\nWhat had happened everybody doesn't everybody forgets is but I forget nothing rich nice to ...\nThousand Fifteen wild card game against the ashes it was so loud it was louder than it was in two thousand nine World Series but unfortunately title shut it down as you did if\nThey couldn't get a hit off of him and couldn't get a run but that was a day they were loaded for bear that's what for some reason it just changed last year it was really unbelievable and the game against the aid from the very beginning and then judge hitting home runs just you know made it up for grabs so it's a very very good place for the Yankees supplied\nMost ... I mean Stanton ... got like that Jesse Garfield swing right now Michael you know what I mean like a where he he might yank went out and then the next time he'll just take three pitches and then just go sit down it's kind of feast or famine with him from what it looks at him\nI mean he's it can either carry a team for months and ... twelve Fifteen home runs ...\nOr you could strike out an awful lot you know so after you hit the homerun in the eighth grade I said okay now I could take a deep breath and to finish the last the last week of the season hitting well I thought that this should be started something with that at first game while that was tough but that Chile is easier to strike out a lot a lot almost\n... case tonight something unexplainable happens you know my ... and the Fox booth ... that's your answer okay just know that well\nMy just please give a hug party\nWill surely will okay take care of mark Michael enjoy the day Mark I'm never coming out of no no no I said mark on what I said I don't know what happened\nTo come home and I talk twenty hours yesterday give me a break I Love your Michael or Rob a bank that could be as Michael Kay ... real Mike okay\n[noise] okay [noise] things happen\nIn Damon price comes in the game the oh night just hootenanny Abraham going to smash [laughter]\nI'm gonna rip it off the wall who do you have to get any left these out because the Yankees lineup is going to be just dominated by left he certainly if our inhibits can't go tonight\nYou'll get you'll get\nI mean we don't I don't know I I Will I'll be honest with you I don't even think the Yankees have that they just put their guys and that's it they won't be any they won't be dominated by left he says ... I could not be more wrong maybe don't we don't have any way that you know it will be gardener\nAs a lefty and ...\nAs a lefty and then everyone else is going to go out there and have all the ... touch a hundred and he's nasty and they'd be like well you know it could be could be one of those boys can be just flame throwing tonight and first pitch just went under way in a in Cleveland, Ohio\nBetween the Astros does any Indians\nIndians trying to stave off elimination first pitch just went down we'll keep an eye on all that go to the phone lines and folks have been hanging on for quite some time here on the program a Nathan right here in Los Angeles what's going on Nathan\n[laughter] well I got another overreaction for you want to lay on the ... [noise] well I'm going to get myself to carry out of if the chiefs eight to pass next week mhm that both the chiefs and the rams will be undefeated when they mean\nAnd regular that said that when we got eleven I thought you were going to go just straight for the super bowl who um which obviously we're now down but nothing since they play each other week eleven so after this Kansas City is home for Cincinnati in Denver at Cleveland\nHome for Arizona okay hold on a second Nathan you're halfway home um and then the rams\nThe biggest test for the rams as a science I Believe\nWhile they're at Denver than there at San Francisco home for Green Bay at New Orleans home for Seattle man at the rams were undefeated walking into that building Nathan I Will I Will you call back and well I Know you're more regular than between now and a month and a half from now that would be amazing Jody hang up on them like\nSo you were done by the way out right but just one of the home run\nBy like two feet fees on fire he is truly unbelievable and that's the most dangerous part about the Astros this year is the fact that\nOut to be might not be their best hitter and Springer who as we all know had a dynamic dynamite October last year might not be the most college player anymore and that Korea might\nNot be their biggest bopper on the infield anymore holy crap this kid it in this case for men to who by the way like your current shortstop where's number\nTwo on behalf of the guy who\nHas a an effect on tonight's ... Red Sox proceeding or is he a number twenty seven sit there in the lineup is he he's been dormant ... he said not really\nYeah much at all they've gotten a couple of hits just singles\nFrom Stanton was he feast he wasn't feast or famine in in Miami\nThey have only one current ranked team left on their schedule NC State Florida State ... Boston College Duke in South Carolina and match it\nLet's say they go undefeated who'd they play in the ACC Championship game do you think Chris look that up you don't buy C. C. championship and just get that all I Want all this information in a row right here because this is what it's going to come down to 'cause once again Alabama Georgia don't play each other and that's absurd it's absurd how does he\nSeems not play each other every year Michigan and Ohio State find a way to play each other every year Alabama and Georgia should figure that\nOne out yup which once every three years it seems like\n... probably play Miami okay so let's say Clemson runs the table\nAnd then Notre Dame runs their table too because they just be from the way it looks right now the toughest\nThe toughest remaining opponent on their docket with the exception one which say of Syracuse now they just lost a pet I now I don't know how the heck that ... on the road but they they they play Pittsburgh next at home than maybe than at Northwestern\nWhich just knocked off Michigan State\nHome for Florida State home for Syracuse at USC\nNotre Dame runs that table as we all know their independent they're not forced to play these Koch Khamenei stupid\nUseless conference championship games because they are ... stupid useless\nGreat Laufer I understand so\nGeorgia and Alabama will be forced to do so one would think correct will see them in the S. E. C. championship game yeah Georgia correct LSU coming out this weekend so let's just walk me through this year yes\nSo let's say everybody who's currently one through five goes undefeated man includes the Ohio State university heaven forbid beating my alma mater\nAgain and then they're forced to go play the ... Big Ten championship game against say Wisconsin\nPut her on the line to see if they could be you know lose lose that one but let's just assume Ohio State runs the table is Notre Dame undefeated getting over a one loss Alabama or Georgia team that's one loss is against the other\nThat's coming down the pike\nThey probably do\nNotre Dame so Alabama plays Georgia the whole country is watching on CBS and it comes down to an overtime and it's tight it's incredible and both teams are drawing blood to it actually is forced to throw a passing the fourth quarter\nAnd it's one of those at the whole country is watching and is captured captivated by Alabama beats Georgia saying overtime\nYou ever heard of that one for her the vice versa\nYou're going to tell me Alabama oh one loss Alabama team is told thanks for playing Notre Dame gets to go audio you did no way\nNo names and national team I'm aware of that are ratings big big ratings from because nothing to do in reading share it was oh it does oh I Know it does it does get one Alabama's going to just be a giant rating sucking noise no no no George Orwell to oh yeah no one's gonna wanna watch Georgia played football come on\nThat's what I what I mean is it that that's not in the equation here it's not like Notre Dame is a bigger drawing either one of those two schools come on come on\nIf it's a close game I could I mean I can get one last but if\nYou know Georgia blows out are going to go join Alabama vice versa I'm giving you the scenario Georgia Beach Alabama in a squeaker Nick Saban go play go play the cotton ball\nYeah thanks though who thinks that that's common if Notre Dame undefeated there and I agree you can't just say that the that's the way over to Notre Dame gas over one long there there's no computers anymore Alabama ... who wants to\nSend them why would that happened when one guy one last year one loss Alabama team got in they need money has to play the ... stupid useless championship game and guess who won at all that I mentioned Alabama team that's why they're in\nSo they wouldn't get it over and over again you give note I mean if they lose in the championship game Notre Dame having beaten my school ah my alma mater Stamford Virginia Tech\nReally\nI don't doubt that I I kind of everybody like Joe everybody so but when push comes to shove and it's the first week of December\n'cause he's the one I Want you just remember your certainties right now the up and down ... we might coordinating producers been tripping over the last minute absolutely is going to happen remember your\nConfident certainty because it won't be that feeling that him and put up a Twitter pull you won't be feeling that\nI bet you I bet you this I bet you a one loss S. E. C. team might bounce Clemson and not an undefeated Notre Dame in undefeated Clemson gets bounced because of the euro that they the rock that they pulled the last year when they won a championship two

like man that's just fun and then I Would do stand up and people would laugh for\nThirty five minutes to forty five minutes of a Ninety minutes show a bat and five hundred not too bad day and then I

in holiday blow up he must have called you up like the proudest for pop of all time right now my dad enjoyed\nThat I didn't look soft out there yeah I think you have to him off you sized him up and you took him\nTo be I did get drug tested or next day the hundred percent true yeah that was where no random drug test started happening yeah that was when I got excited but that was not a size up operation\nThat was a blind school funding and not I was running as fast as I could have my eyes closed and I just so happened to run into the tracks and I feel bad for that guy is anytime attack happens it looks like that his name there's get smeared all over the Internet\nAnd it's a real shame it's great for me a real shame for him you post ... somebody ... right in front of the main big ass head do or say come home come and games Indianapolis where it was awesome\nIs absolutely awesome [laughter]\nAll right we'll take a break pat McAfee professional baseball player a is here on the rich eyes and show a when we come back with you and um\nWhat else what what's on the news update that you have over there are going to hear from though do back on his comment so that was bad and that ... during things up jail or anything is a threat from England and Sean McVeigh I just I Want to run through all for that guy I Want to get your two cents on\nThe ... the church bell ... from that man the horse that an inch oh my gosh a pat McAfee I pat McAfee show on Twitter easier on the rich shots and show [noise]\nLet's talk a little bit about true car right now with your prize from your car you can avoid the confusion you encounter on line by getting a great price you can count on before you even visit a dealership true cars going to show you what other people pay for the call that you want in your area you're going to get a big number wow do you go on through car pat\nYou could have been number yup how pissed would you be if you show up and that ... that car doesn't exist\nI Would be furious gang catfish by a car\nCorrect I never thought about it that way and I've done a\nTon of these true car reads um so you show up to your true car certify dealer with Vin number the car exist you know what other people pay for the car you want in your area and you know exactly the price that you should pay because it's all included everything\nUh invoice fees everything you want is right in there and on average costs users save over three thousand dollars\nI didn't like he did he did position himself as a leader saying that if if that's the reason why team comes together ...\nUh that's where he basically ... yeah ... ... what do you mean by so again just what do you think happens in a locker room who who would walk just just again you're not in there yeah I have no idea if if something like that it happened in the ... locker room who would have walked up to that receiver and said something\nSome vets right so it takes the vets but when it's one of the vets doing it it's kind of difficult right cause they'll do is now made man for the giants he's a rich guy there he's a veteran they're so whenever you have one of the veterans kind of doing that doesn't really lead the way for the younger guys\nSo it's would have to be a veteran it would happen to be like in Eli Manning who would have to go to them hey\nI heard what you said about us her about the team we can't do that publicly that's in the house you know at least until after the season's over\nBecause not winning football games and the NFL is hard enough dealing with drama with their highest paid player who is a little bit traumatic if you think about the dramatic civil do back him to begin with but they just got I'm rich they just and everything like that now you got to deal with a little bit of heightened Real Housewives type situation happening in there\nI just think it was a dumb move they got a lot of clicks for ESPN I assume\nBut it's also gonna there's going to be some feelings hurt in the locker and medicine which isn't good never good\nPet McAfee here as part of ... news update that rules on with Jay and Jay talking\nTo to McManus have ESPN dot com not happy with the white calling yesterday quote obviously want to be able to run the ball early and start that rhythm early in the beginning of the game if I remember correctly we had maybe three carries at the end of the first quarter\nWith the office of line we have on this team running the ball like that doesn't make sense to me oh everybody's\nGone out into neo brown ... brown was upset about not getting enough sleep ... upset because he's not getting twenty touching the game which I think it did yesterday they had to throw that got Jay Jay coming out and I think the thing is is when the NFL gets as big as it is which is what you by the way are a big part of by the way to pressure you should go ahead and take that stuff it in your belt buckle\nAnd run with it with the NFL is huge so everything that happens it's in a fishbowl\nEvery single comment nowadays is taken\nFor what it said and then run with it and it's\nIt's just such an interesting situation 'cause I don't want to say back in my day like I'm an old man but everything is handled in house almost until the season's over at least like I went after a GM after he got fired because he was a bum\nI got one out and right yeah and but during I never want it during the season would never do because it's just added drama and I'm way too low on the totem pole to be doing any of that it's always like uh be who you can afford to beat type situation but right now drama seems to be the common denominator with every NFL team\nI'm going to go off on a couple of tangents here Greeks and did you think he was right for talking about the football I mean if she championship\nGame that was such a ... I mean we lost by fifty I think it was just saying why oh why oh situation\nWho knows if anything was with the ball is I don't get the feeling I only have the cables but the fact that they beat us by fifty and then it got blown outta proportion this whole thing that happened and I just I think if you ask any player on the culture we we're kind of embarrassed to be a part of the whole thing or name kept getting brought up every single time I was brought up\nBut I just\nI didn't agree with a lot that that GM did to be honest a lot of things whether it was handling people handling situations he just was he was a mom was like a robot wasn't an actual human didn't really think much so that I Would say I disagree\nAnd is it not or it might not ... am I mistaken or am I not correct a dry fumbled and became a pretty big fumble not in that game hunter ... fumble and then talk about not getting tough\nOut here in LA I think you get to see it there isn't a lot of self awareness\nIn the world in LA is the home I I don't know I'm not going to walk on the lack of self awareness capital of the world Trade Center yeah you know one of these birds scooters you got to keep your head on us soil\nNear the best for your time and nobody paid attention but self awareness seems to be at an all time low in this society that we're already what else you got fired and a little one injury recap here Greg
