Glen Weldon ... you don't write their mandate\nThank you sir got a great idea for a follow up question to your ... and then I've got a comment about that followed poll question is what is the worst free agent signing of all time\nWe were discussing that too [laughter] fortunately Dionne might be both [laughter] come on now [laughter]\nBut you guys the greatest free agent signing an all time is one that you do not have is a choice which was the first whatever Curt Flood\nYeah I mean clearly if he doesn't take major league baseball the core we're not talking about any of these other guy\nAnd that's why I think Marvin Miller should be in the baseball hall of fame and museum in Cooperstown New York to one by on another one of them are happen you\nTalk of it that that guy had one of the most ... between and not directly to compare it by one could make the argument or between him and Jackie Robinson those two men had the greatest impact for perhaps I professional sports in the history\nWhen Marvin Miller being the union chief and of course Curt Flood being the guy to Winfrey agency for the first time for them I Will be player what your other thought you said you want to throw out there going oh you don't want\nTo know why it was so she asked I really appreciate especially especially for a bell guy that you take baseball seriously\nAnd I'm a huge baseball this year NATO I think it is the greatest game that we have it it's still the national pastime because in order to watch you gotta lotta pass a lot of time but I Love baseball I Love what it represents in the history of the country\nAre you have to do is watch Ken Burns is a documentary on baseball you get a sense of that but as opposed to other shows that will go nameless that procedure show\nThat just

thanks called back call back again and just again uh I I feel like I Need to have an annotated a review of ... call right there are ... is a ... for getting on ocean okay\nAnd Marvin Miller is the baseball union chief who should be in the hall of fame but I don't think he is ... because he did for players cost owners so much money in the labor strife that ah that they went through I don't think you'll ever\nGet in there which should be a damn shame\nWhere's free agent signing an all time David press\nA [noise]\nBy the way we we touched on something we never really followed up on yesterday which is\nThe athlete that is the loved by the the rival of the team and the fan base yeah of the team that he plays for hate them the most\nBecause Red Sox fans you despise David Price right now though fans love him the other ones that have somebody like came up he lived for the life of the giants don't hate him out there were two that that came up\nCutler for the ... and the Packers yeah JR Smith for the cabs and the warriors\nOn which Aerosmith beat the warriors one year\nYeah but he's just outlet and lead them out of that one blunder Cutler for shore is why staff of great one\nAre you ready to do for down here on the rich on this show a prior to her original many dogs here we go\nOkay here or down for now [noise] okay ah as\nYou know from this chair I've been I've been very critical of the Dallas Cowboys this year then right believe them I don't believe in them [noise] but after seeing Sunday Night Football [noise]\nWilling to say this gentleman\nFrom your Notre Dame funding Irish poor kid who blew out his knee and horrible bowl game\nJust before he was going to be a top five pick 'em when he went down in the heat I Believe against the Ohio State [noise] Jerry Jones draft him in the second round anyway hoping that he could turn into something and what he has turned into he's a bona fide sideline to sideline\nBased on the line backer [noise]\nFor a team that plays differently on defense over the years because Shawn league can stay healthy [noise] he is now the leader of the fence and\nHe's somebody who the cowboys are going to follow and\nWith his ability to play defense and that these ... these physical and no job they laid around the Sean Watson who might still be in the cold tub now and It's Tuesday and they played Sunday night [noise]\nThe way the rest of the divisions working out right now if the cowboys can just figure out how to score more points on the road they win this division [noise]\nDays when this division [noise]\nThe way to jam and Smith is playing on the fence [noise]\nAll they got to do is figure out how to score points on the road don't go scoreless in the first quarter of the three straight weeks where the roadway and there's less three row games [noise] if they can get up on top on the road they can win this division I firmly believe it and I love the way the kids playing that's first down\nDown [noise] okay\nSo the raiders are down twenty three this week uh it's the third quarter but good for them good news is is there on the one yard line [noise]\nAnd I got Martian Lynch and they've got a quarterback who has\nWhen he signed for all the money in the world [noise] that he wasn't going to throw on the one yard line with Marshall much behind them [noise] because he just wants to and football games that is what Derek car said and lo and behold [noise]\nPlay actions of Martian Lynch interception in the end zone [noise]\nAnd I absolutely as somebody who doesn't usually do this [noise] I screamed an expletive at the TV screen [noise] I actually did that when my kids weren't home [laughter]\nBut I think I gave voice to the entire raider nation and sea hawk nation wheels somebody hands football to Mars Sean Lynch on one side [noise]\nFor somebody to\nAnd I had a zero of the rich as his show research staff of one [noise] look it up [noise] since she was not getting the ball on the one yard line in that Super Bowl [noise]\nMarsh Sean Lynch\nHas only gotten five one yard touchdown runs just five in this league that's it [noise]\nAnd [noise] that ranks twenty four\nFrom the NFL now you didn't play two thousand sixteen [noise] set it out [noise]\nWhat Garret blunt leads the league in the last four years with one yard touchdown runs with Eighteen [noise] second place is the guy who got it on a one yard line this past Sunday [noise] three straight time [noise]\nBecause Shawn McVeigh was going to get the ball in the end zone and this is the guy with all different options disposal all

thousand five\nIn the end of night one\n[noise] remember it was a two day draft the two thousand five draft at the very end a third round selection before they turn the lights off on Radio City Music Hall and went home Mike Shanahan went ahead and drafted Maurice ... and it was\nA it was a\nTrading places moment turn the machines back on I mean we just we came back on the air and we totally ripped
