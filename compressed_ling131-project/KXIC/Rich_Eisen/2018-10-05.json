bell\nIs they miss him and every single time anybody says well the Steelers miss living on building answers like well he doesn't play defense\nWhen he does is allows you to go point for point better with the team that you can't stop on defense and what it does also is maybe get you to scores up on that team that needs to go point for point when you\nAnd it gives you the confidence that you are definitely better than the team that's in front of you in a same way that James Caan or despite his talent and despite his story despite his art does not provide\nI think I'm just speaking truth right

angel work that out next year but he thought about how he didn't want to start over again somewhere else with a new team has envision his number eleven and the Celtics were after who go\nThere you go but if I'm not mistaken Kyrie Irving has taken a stance on something\nAnd has been adamant about it for quite some time only to recently apologize for the stance\nCorrect that's true yeah last last week he wanted a what if his impending free agency is just another version has come a wagon if it would be like to add ...

Ridley come in and grab touchdowns and certainly if you're not winning right did you ever have that with often\nI'm not really you know it because I knew every time he stepped on a field he was going to make me better\nAnd by making me better it I'd make the next person better and then we are better as a team and we went in which is the most important thing winning\nYou're going to get that I mean this is a passing the you know you can bring anybody on here it's a passing football they mhm they won't points scored defenses are still out in their own way they want to stop ... stop people I mean look in Kansas City right now in the rams are the two best teams in the game\nKansas City a little bit shaky on defense but the rams got studs on defense eating you know with Donald and sue and the two corners or even to leaves out but\nThen you bring that often so long with Jared golf is doing with girlie off they got so many weapons Patrick homes is tearing a league up I mean this was a kid that that I think that he was going to be the player he's going to be I think Andy readers just giving him the keys and said just drive the car\nAnd you got to cheat out there and you've got Samy walk ins and it's not like cream hunts having the game you know the\nThe season he had last year so far but you bring him along and again there are hard to stop with ... back there so uh someone's gotta give\nDid you hear what jailing Ramsey how to say about the cheetah\nDespite what he wants to turn them into a like a little\nNo role on on a minute let's let's let's get a that somebody up the um for for Andre reader know\nThis was jailing Ramsey yesterday okay uh talking about ... when asked about the match up with Ramsey and hill coming up this weekend 'cause we're ... to say\nHe is good for what he does receive a you know he made off road as a reserve specialists or his ... year he wants to Provo as this [noise] [noise] oh [noise]\nThis year's a I'm a ... am officers that were\n[noise] a lot of our city versus [noise]\nWow [noise]\nI think jail and has been saying that kinda stuff ever since he came in late and obviously he's if not the best corner Italy's top five ... uh you know when I played with Dionne and brought what's in all those guys they just didn't have that kind of mentality I mean the I might have talked a little bit and I think jailing backs that up\nBut I think he\nWhen he hears himself talk that hypes him up more and and of course media loves that kind of thing ... any love they love talking when he played ... two weeks ago uh every\nGood corner wants to be on their best player ... and good corner great corner and wants to be on their best player and that's ... this week\nSo ... and he's a return specialist address heard is true that laundry but he's all her specialists to where I just heard how do you think the return specialist is handling that information a hundred probably a lot of retirees that it's not too happy\nAbout that but again everybody loves talking this is this is a he just wants somebody to talk back at them and again he's probably the top corner league and he backs that up but it's good for media and I think\nOh I Know what the trust me by the way I I think the football gone assures him I'm sure if he were sitting here he talked about you well interestingly enough he sat behind being added NFL Honors this past year how was that a lot of reminded them of what the seating chart looked like [laughter] oh you are in front of him yes [laughter]\nOh yes I don't know how much longer I Will be but no yeah oh yeah so I I think it's going to be a great match I mean this weekend's games are going to be awesome ... anti retail um\nDo you think that the locker room or the Andy Reid is going to try and feed now an irate based on ... and he's not that kind of cut she's that she's going to take that bait who is the who is the best trash talker\nWhen you were plant you know what I again I talk about it's just such a different game I never there's nobody actually talk trash come on really I never really had a guy at talk trash you know like constantly\nYou know maybe sometimes a you know today is going to be one of these days you know it's gonna be a long day and I was like yeah today is going to be a long day for you too so that all the way it went yeah that was it I I think the respect factor and I I'm sure these guys respect each other I Hope they do hope they do because if you don't respect somebody you're gonna\nYou're gonna get burned up quick and I just didn't I can just can't tell you one guy\nKid I can say believe me that's not ... not garbage that's that's not even recycling that's not even light light and the first line of which didn't nobody trash talk on your team and all all we had a bunch of guys who trashed okay now there we go who isn't yeah well you know they're all those guys they they were Bruce Thurman biscuit\nYeah uh Darryl tally all the defense of guys that are most trash talk so there were no defenders that we'd be talking trash to use that now that I remember you know that really kind of was in my head and I couldn't you know do what I wanted a duck\nAndrea read here pro Football Hall of fame or the richest and show what do you think of Josh Allen the current state of the bills\nGreat kid a quick story I met him at the drought this year and\nUh we're all in a room all the you know the top Fifteen sixteen or twenty guys being drafted a or the first day in Roger Goodell and Jim Brown and you had a bunch of other players Steve out water were just kind of just\nBringing these kids into and say hey this is what you're getting into Kate is now what you did and passes are you going to handle yourself as a professional and it was just like meet and greet and all and it's ironic that I really gravitated to Josh Allen right away and we ended up picking him a second I say we don't have the bills pick them\nSeven to pick and he wanted to know what what was what's buffalo like a light is crazy crazy as friends in in in the NFL and so did you get picked by us You're you're coming into a\nA a serious fan base that loves their team that wants to win and that's when you come in there and I teach you got to that's the mentality you got to have you got to have a winning mentality 'cause we haven't won in a while we haven't been in the playoffs and you know we're in the playoffs last year the first time\nIn Seventeen years so uh and then we end up picking them and I'm I'm just\nProud of him because\nIt's not that he doesn't have a lot to work with Sean McDermott\nIs a great coach is a good coach but he's got a lot of young guys this is a young football team and they're just trying to feel themselves out the you know put all this together and it's it's tough for me and with with a young squad\nBut two weeks ago he showed that he's a leader you have confidence and they just got to get everybody around him to play better yeah I mean that just came out of nowhere yeah I Know that he would yeah he's flying over people and jumping over buildings and stuff like that has that was pretty good Anthony bar past anybody yeah diving into end zones I think that really showed\nNot only what kind of player he could be but it just showed that team right there on that get in that game going into Minnesota and beat in Minnesota who was in NFC championship last year that okay I Want this to be my team\nAnd um\nYou know we'll see what happens so you just got to be on they they all got to be together no worse than\nThe Audrey read foundation helping under privileged children reach their full potential and become responsible contributors to their communities for the last eight years established Neal any time what's the read with read eighty free program here\nIt's it's a national literacy program that uh uh started about a year and a half ago three boys and Girls Club America I'm I'm a boys and Girls Club kid I I grew up in the clubs and\nAlong with ... a J. lo and Shaq we're all club kids and I go around doing speech for them across the country and ah\nIt's ironic that as a kid I mean when I went home at night I didn't have ... you know my mom and dad read to me and reading is so important that you want to tell these kids I Love to exercise\nSe I Will say this survey I think you and I as exciting as this is for either one of\nThose land for second here yeah [noise] I Can't\nDispute\nThe Astros being the prohibitive favorite to go back to the world yeah I'm kind of way that you know I'm like yeah they just top to bottom they're just so complete and\nThe crazy thing is despite how nuts that band box of a state he may have\nCan get I think they're better on the road\nThey just love quieting the crowd they love and then last year they didn't last year in Yankee Stadium they couldn't get one\nSo\nThat said I I just can't imagine that are are aren't aren't appreciably better than they were last year they're all pretty I think they are they all four teams or even Josh Donald sins addition to the Indians\nCould be a difference maker if she is the bringing Iran refused to bring her of right now but that I mean the Yankees lined up top to bottom sent you guys had too many home runs than she has been eight inches hits eight and saying it didn't lane\nEven without guard but it is a heck of a playoff matchup\nIt's interesting for players have already at a home run in their first career postseason game that was John Carlos ... first career postseason game yeah by the way\nChris Davis Christian yell at you max Muncie crazy and just in terms of just in the two to one format and he's with a bomb in mind keep this in mind as there is the first pitch about to be thrown in Houston and keep us in mind about\nWhat happened last night and what could happen between the Yankees and Red Sox in the history of a five game series with the two to one format teams that win game one at home have gone on and when the series twenty seven thirty six times we do the math you hear on the rich as surely Seventy five percent of the time\n\nThat food yeah they have good thing or in the booth and I'm like okay they might you know John ... recording are due to just got in my ear ... what do you think Marilyn's\nFans are sitting there thinking\nYell at ... ... is so good and Stanton playing for the Yankees\nWere you you you know violence and should be upset and they I think they had every right to be\nOnly owner came in and said I'm not paying any an another dime off at us I don't think I cover for Derek Jeter when I say that but the owner that took over the Marlins is known for his business practices elsewhere right of taking something\nAnd then taking it apart or or they didn't have to tell that ownership group\nThat is true so\nMajor league baseball didn't have to approve them as owner ... no ... it's too bad [noise] All right Jeff Garland is making his way to the studio\nUm Conor McGregor everybody what a press conference that one [laughter] so so uh Habib shows up\nAnd and your honor doesn't at the same time right kind of good because they were the ... ability could have been particularly ugly Vatican two high I I just don't watch the the usual hyper not something I Want to Rio with these guys but I think there is there's true bad blood between the two of them will ...\nKnows more than most and he's come a long way from having his press pass taken away you get right Kay\nUh arrow in Hawaii or from the worldwide leader in sports this is awesome because reading is really making Iraq out of his career right now uh he's covering for ESPN and the ... being UFC two twenty nine so he's going to be joining us next\nUh and the next hour Jeff Garland who's three in one bears are off who's cubs needed to win just once\nThis week at home and they'd be still plane and they couldn't he's here and we've got some great start bench cuts for him because he loves playing start bench and we beat them and fancy last week I don't know if I Want to bring that up because of the name of his team is unmentionable into\nWhat's coming they have no idea what I'm going to do is they have no idea how I feel about this man but she's not ... not some kind of joke\nAnd at that moment I was like holy smokes is there's no one around us right now this is legit so that's when I realized that this thing really runs the sound a ... it's it's as personal as the debt\nAnd then that makes this with McGregor coming back when we thought after the money may weather stuff you might never come back the fact that he's back against this opponent under these circumstances is it the biggest part in the history of USA Today\nSo that's a great question will only truly be able to gauge that\nAfter the fat when you talk about you know the pay per view numbers in a way to saying three million I don't see how that's possible I mean the the the the biggest the highest selling pay per view up until this point is one point six million buys that controversy the PS two in August of two thousand sixteen\nUh three million almost doubling it is is an absurd number I'm I I Do believe that can get to two million which would obviously be a record\nUm it it it feels like a big deal in Vegas on this Friday you know late morning\nUm but I Will admit that it doesn't quite feel like some of his other big big Vegas fights and that's only because it costs a lot of money for the Irish people from all the way to Vegas for his earlier fight cheered when he was really rising up the ladder I think there was super excited but now they almost take this run for granted um but\nMake no mistake about it nothing compares to Connor feisty atmosphere second to none and it's really just great to have you back doing what he's\nBest that you know when he did the boxing than reminded me of when Jordan wants to play for the White Sox yeah it was cool for a minute but you want to see 'em back doing what he's best that and now we have Connor back doing what he's done\nA couple more minutes left without ... from Las Vegas Nevada a prior to UFC two twenty nine continuing on with the the main about here uh what's playing this out Conor McGregor loses what happens do you think\nHonestly it's not that big of a deal I mean if he gets completely mall one sided deep down yeah you know he takes a a a blower too says stock if you will to ego but\nThe sport you know ... ... says don't mean as much as in boxing boxing you lose one fight and it takes you like ten more to get back to where I work in a mate fans have short term memories I mean just witnessed the fact that when ... lost to make the as they used to one Ninety six\nThe way he handled the laws actually made them more popular than ever I mean look the also enough that he is coming off a last going into this fight that the\nWeather in something you thought well versed in but still\nHe hasn't won since November of two thousand sixteen and an any you know combat sports match so I I don't\nThink it's that big a deal or the carnival Geiger business is booming he just watches on whiskey buying\nUh he he he just resigned with Reebok yesterday's manager told me for a deal north of five million dollars he just resigned with monster energy in one of their highest paid deals so\nNothing is going to affect this man to man ended up in jail I just wanted Dolly at a bus and injuries from fighters and somehow he became more popular afterwards he he can do no wrong at this point\nOkay what if he wins do you think is his last fight\nOh my gosh oh no last fight you know there's this funny narrative that oh he made too much money against the Floyd they'll never come back and this and that like\nI mean first of all destroyed was making you know hundreds of millions of dollars for years and he kept coming back born in fact it looks like it's going to come back from war again though LeBron James Kevin to rent the craziest guys make\nMillions of dollars and they keep coming back for more and yes I Know they're not getting punched in the face the counter is a very competitive guy and he is obsessed with making the most amount of money possible and I think he realizes that the way to make the most amount of money possible right now is to fight\nAnd he genuinely enjoy the you know towards the end of the first you have to run if you will in November of two thousand sixty and it seems like it seems to me like the media and solve the pre fight obligation forgetting to him and now she doesn't see a genuinely happy to be back he had his son with him um who's a little\nFor a year old his partner is pregnant within their second child and he just seems to be able to get done very little media going into the fight but he just seems to be happy to be back and enjoy the ride once again so I Would be shocked that this is watched by win or lose\nAll right so a couple more questions for you Ariel ... a favor for going to be\nBut he he gave her because he's twenty six alone will last around in his career he's never lost around in training according to his head coach heavier Mendez or he is dominant and what he is that that is what Connor is\nNot so good at and that is wrestling and its cardio is phenomenal as well he's able to keep going and going and going I mean he has amazing pays he's\nInsanely dominant on the ground and people think that if he's able to get caught her to the ground and keep them there is going to be um you know it's going to be a long night for Conor ... grew up in August on in the mountains or with with that with very little but if you a sense the wrestling out of the credit check\nIf you type in on YouTube I don't know if you've ever seen this um if you type in a decent amount metal and bear there's footage of the seven year old ... somebody made off wrestling the bear a kid you not wrestling up there and actually getting the better of the ... there is no joke\nNothing of air and and the people surrounding them and cheering them on that the way this guy grew up with\nThe hell is this is Leo DiCaprio Tom Hardy movie or I mean what what are you\nAre you watching it I
