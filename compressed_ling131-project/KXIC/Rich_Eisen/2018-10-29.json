the season we had him\nAgainst Baltimore a couple of weeks ago um and uh they they did some things that nobody had down to Baltimore up until that point in Baltimore had not allowed to a second half touchdown all season long um and and with the game on the line New Orleans was able to sustain to drive through touchdowns the end of the beginning of the fourth quarter [noise] um\n... they're not the team that we used to think they weren't when it was ... and in the ass in game ... uh with mark Ingram a quick Kamara\nA ... this is a very unique very dynamic team and they really stressed defenses and then that defense\nHas been really the reason that the New Orleans I always had to be so good offensively it was it was always a shootout they're always trying to keep pace with their opponents because their defense you know wouldn't hold up would that defense is is vastly improved and maybe a stumble they had the first couple of weeks or they've gotten that wrecked they'd gotten that remedy a dentist Allen's group is playing very very well it it's a very good front\nAh they've got young secondary but they're they're playing well uh\nI I'm interested to see that match it I think that's you know that's that's gonna be the great match up a you know it's it's one of the best rush defenses in the league going against talked early ah and then the rams can stretch it the same with the same skin with a run in the past and then how does that secondary match up against the receiver ...\nThis is the un Sanders dog into three time Super Bowl champion Daryl moose Johnson rich

everybody likes my homes um you know if people are talking about early and and those are guys that are having a great year but I'm always a fan of the body of work and one of the things that we learned doing one of our saints games\nIs that Drew Brees has never been the league MVP he's been runner up three times a I think it's to a to a manning to Rogers\nUm and possibly to early last year um but he's never won the league MVP he's done everything else\nUm his body work throughout his career are coming back from that possible career ending injury and and and doing what he's done a I I just think it would be a shame I think the consistency that he has shown a throughout his career or you know what he is meant to that same franchise\nUm it's funny when people talk about the system I'm In New Orleans you know that well the system is Greece that's why it works here\nUh when he leaves there's going to be a huge transition into that next ended that next face so I I just think that the season he's happy right now if he continues on this pace and and what he's done throughout his career\nI really don't see anybody else that you can give it to besides Drew Brees Patrick the homeless having a great season it's his first season it as as a starter um I I don't even know if if uh\nYou know he has a season like this ever again but but to me it's it's it's based on the body work by Drew Brees\nAt the end of Seventy seven percent passion of completion percentage which is\nUnbelievable what would why made one interception on the year\n... that is unbelievable man\nIt it it's phenomenal to watch them play um I mean he he raised eyebrows when he stepped to the political science record last year at what almost Seventy two and he's five percentage points higher than that this year\nUm it it's amazing I I you know I've watched good quarterback way you know we've got you and I were both west or you know you've been blessed to be\nAround a number of good ones and one time in Dallas you know Troy was considered one of the most accurate passers yes in the game at that time and\nTo watch the way that drew a attacks that defense or it it is absolutely remarkable even working off the standard that I'm used to ...\nYeah it could be the NFC championship preview it really could be this weekend\nAnd I cited I'm excited to see it moves I Love you man I appreciate you you keep on dressing and doing what you do you you are a treat to listen to your your tree to know your overall good do and I'm Glad to say I play would moose Johnson man\nBy the team I look forward to our lunch they got your man God\nBless you move you take good care that is a stand up guy\nThat is a guy who worked his butt off for everything that he has sharpened his skills that I had no idea that he even had aspirations of being a play by play most really never talked a lot\nYou just got the job done so well nasty yeah so when you see him mature into the role of color commentator color commentator you most\nIt so and but he's always been a consistent good person and I love him for that you guys are really all in on Drew Brees huh\nDrew Brees as well because he's a player's player man you know I understand I'm old school to write about the new breed them with the homes I Love what he's doing but Drew Brees man I mean we can't take that for granted one pick eight weeks Seventy seven percent completion percentage how can we take for granted\nIt's unbelievable what he's accomplished you know offer came to\nKim Kim is coming on he's not getting talked about he's coming on strong cameras coming on really strong right now but those other guys have been doing it since game one man's since we want more homes girlie breeze been doing this as we won I ain't even mentioned Brady\nAnd they're just kind of humming along right and I didn't mention Rogers hadn't even mention it but they can be in that debate is will backers are three three in one so you had when I got away you get in this race and he got away and that's what you're saying\nDon't you agree you have to win win them they pay you have to be on a winning team if to me the reason your team is winning\nWell I think all these guys of the reason we wouldn't even mentioned Green Bay the ones we're in Rogers when Tom ready to leave 'em knowing that I'm going to check pumped I'm checking out I'm leaving the room I'm Out okay I'm Out of their\nDrew Brees if he ever leaves the New Orleans I'm pretty sure Sean Payton is going to because you're not paying them want to be associated with the lowest Drew Brees now just because you know it's not going to work right so we all are attached to those particular players in the body of work they present\nOr Drew Brees is phenomenal man I I watch them practice this year when my high school team with through New Orleans and we stopped and we practice at their facility and then we watch them practice and go about their business it was portrayed in motion\nIn seeing my kids and my son who's a spring quarterbacks either way Drew Brees goes about his job it was unbelievable\nYeah thirty nine years old yeah you have done yet it's still going to still get that

[noise] my two cents\n... schools and we got a few minutes left let's go to big al and Alabama he wants your thoughts on Florida State and the future of the program the guy doing\nOkay what's going on ... and I just want to stay for the Florida State fans out there you know they rode in last year\nOr ... you know we'll ha in Alabama put that thumping on and it's been downhill for members can't should go for that game on it's just been like a toilet flush Florida State all the way into the whole Miami's taking over the south\nOr they're getting all the good players and I just don't see no future for Florida State or not at Clemson is on top\nUm but I Would say that and then I Would ask the on who was one of my favorite players of all time in football I followed the college entered in that fell\nDown with one Tom say led with his career deion Sanders was measuring stick for athletic ability I Would like to stay on a one was like to play football down and I'll hang up the messages that thank you\nThank you for all that you see it happen but it was right ... it was wrong\nBut be about was like a dad away from home the spiritual\nSide of him was so comforting it was so assuring I'm also Mickey Andrews probably the best coach I ever play for my life\nHe was a defensive coordinator who was so successful it was unbelievable like when he did for the university was so profiled and it was home away from home so the parents would interest wholeheartedly the coaches that were in place to raise their kids to make sure they they become men\nIn those vital stages of their life Florida State\n... ... everything goes to a cycle except Alabama all these college is going to say Alabama wouldn't Alabama thing what in the nineties or something like barely sit down at the same as the unbelievable man I mean what what he's doing is it's just it's ridiculous man\n... ridiculous everything goes to a cycle Florida State is cycling right now and I think the on the train up once they get all this garbage out of the door they're going to train up you're right yeah I mean it's gone\nSouth every ... in the Alabama last last year because they sustain tremendous injuries jumble Fisher jumped ship and left the too big and better things brighter future a lot of money which I Can't blame for that\nBut this uh this school is trending a Miami I don't think that a class of Florida whatsoever don't forget about central Florida\nNo forget about those types of school South Florida don't forget about it but I use some of the other schools that are making noise as as well and are below state we just have so many different colleges in our state that so many kids are purged um how many calls you do you have in Alabama but it's really good\nTo glimpse it was this document the Auburn\nI mean I'm In ... South Carolina yeah how many\nSchools really in the state did a really good we have a multiplicity of schools that are purging all the players so if we only had three schools in the state oh my God could you imagine what it would be and then everybody's coming to our state the project kids so so that's the problem\nI'm having good ...

probably the best running back in the gang running wise catching a ball was picking up blitz is the physicality and what he brings to the table is no way a professional sports should allow their best
