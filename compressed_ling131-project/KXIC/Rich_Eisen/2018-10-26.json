capsules\nMay fellow sports fans are Danny west that I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history I start back in Nineteen sixty four for the famous wrong way run the Vikings Jim Marshall picks up a fumble Enron sixty six yards in the wrong direction\nFor safety still to this day it is the NFL's number one blooper [noise] this week in Nineteen Seventy the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers plead their first home game losing to the San Diego rockets one ten ten Ninety nine\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one Texas Stadium opened the Dallas Cowboys beat the New England patriots forty four to Twenty one stadiums unique roof structure covers all of a siege unless the playing field so to the elements it was often said that the whole on the roof was designed to allows God to watch his team play yeah\nLike God's the cowboys fan this week in Nineteen Ninety event or Holyfield knocked out James buster Douglas fir the heavyweight boxing title is weak in Nineteen Ninety three the NFL announced a new expansion team the Carolina Panthers\nWill be in Charlotte and they will begin playing in Nineteen Ninety five and this week in the year two thousand the Monday Night miracle occurred\nDown thirty to seven at the end of the third quarter the New York jets pull together and improbable comeback with poor touchdowns in a field goal in the fourth quarter eventually defeating the Miami Dolphins forty ... thirty seven in overtime at your high hard radio weekends for each time capsule\nOff him is yesterday on there right now\nThe unhealthy James go here on the joys and showed ... joining us\nIt might craziness is to be a little bit of Madison Bumgarner in Walker view there's\nNo one in the NFL as untouchable for for first John picks no one no one now I wouldn't say this is Andy Reid was offered for first round picks\nFor Patrick more homes now he might have done it in July sure probably wouldn't probably would have done it the day before the season sure now this conversation this discussion is kind of skewed by the fact that we're at week eight\nSo if you were to trade a quarterback and by the way the quarterback is likely the player that you would trade for for ones you don't trade the quarterback week gate if your team is any good because you're taking the season at that point\nBut if the Packers were offered for number ones for Aaron Rodgers there's three to one one they're likely I don't know can they win the division sure maybe they have a tough schedule coming up so\nTough tough\nI remember there is no owner there's mark Murphy would they trade him for four number one it's not the flipside of that is would any NFL team reasonably offer for number ones for anyone and I don't think the answer is yes\nI mean if I went to pick a team that needs a quarterback picketing many New York giants the New York football giants at that and I said\nFor four number one picks you can have\nOne quarterback pick a quarterback any quarterback but let's do ... Aaron Rodgers yeah and what thirty two\nI think so okay when did Gettleman\nWould he do that thirty four year old there and ready for tough one injury prone hate to say if he's a warrior but has had some injuries assert okay for number one what do you do it if you're the Packers\nYeah if you're the Packers you absolutely do it yes you do mhm what about Patrick mom's the giants do not give up for for Patrick\nBecause the sample size isn't big enough as much as I Love Patrick my homes the sample size isn't big enough what do they six into\nFive into sort of a shift tones fix them on their six and one okay there's six and one he started eight NFL games he's been amazing he's going to start as night this week\nAnd the third against the Broncos a third of his career starts after this week will come against the Denver Broncos\nA good team a good defense at least but I don't know that anybody gets up for number one for Patrick more homes no running back is going to get four number one's Coolio Mack got a bounty\nHerschel Walker was three number one's the different age Joey Galloway to number one different age the fact that the the ... got a number one for I'm Ari Cooper stunning\nBut from the cowboys perspective it kind of makes sense it kinda makes sense you're hoping your your your number one pick is in the lower half of the first round\nOmari Cooper is only twenty four years old comparison\nCalvin really is going to soon turned twenty four Omari Cooper is only twenty four years to ... seasons behind them yes he's had to drop sees the last couple of years that the the problem here for the cowboys as you get them on the fifth year option next year but then you have to pay him\nSammy Watkins just got sixteen million I don't know why and how but he got sixteen million like send me a lot but that's a lot of coin are you willing to pay a Mari Cooper a long term deal if the conversation begins at sixteen million\nWho ... it's a lot of cash cowboys don't have to worry about it this year\nBut they could worry about it in the off season if he does well heading the fifth year option\nAnyway I digress\nJulio Jones was traded on draft day for five players to first round pick and on paper that day the trade look good for the browns as a browns fan I I didn't mind the trade of the time\nI really didn't\nGreg literally on the second round started his career wells wide receiver that that obviously didn't work out Phil Taylor big runs stuffing defensive end or defensive tackle rather at the point\nI'm didn't mind the trade of the time in retrospect it didn't work at the moment it looked OK who's the most untraceable defensive player I Know we talk about quarterbacks that you know they've gone to the biggest bounty what about what about on defense ... was traded\nYou could say Jay Jay but Jay Jay who looked amazing last night and is back his back but it's a long history of the injuries are ... years though it didn't really know a long history of injuries ... von Miller but they drafted his replacement and Bradley job so he is not ...\nHe's not\nNow Bradley Chubb just had his boss out game against the rams with three sacks hadn't done a lot since then but he's a rookie will give him time but they just drafted his replacement so he is already in the system\nThere who is the most on tradable defensive player that is a great question\nI'd say Aaron Donald right now is the best defensive player in football I'm biased I work for the rams full disclosure okay now yet for sex most recently last week he is here's the most amazing sad about Aaron Donald last week I was last week or or or for the season\nWas who they play last week again the niners writers okay Arun Donald's a\nTackles in the run game last week averaged one point\nFive yards behind the line of scrimmage other words Matt Brita re most are those guys weren't even getting to the line and hitting a wall they were getting hit in the backfield every time they carry the ball\nAaron Donald is basically on block couple safer hold that's how good he is right now but would you give up\nAnd you inherit the contract as well would you give up for number one for Aaron Donald and the answer is no in all likelihood I'm Sorry Aaron you'd probably admitted to is there an NFL player\nAid for for too old for rich a four four tool for rich and rich Isaac show on Twitter at Andrews is certainly out on Twitter is there an NFL player for whom you would give up\nFor ones you know what I'll make it easier to one and two two's to one's into twos for who for what is rocky waters one said anybody also as you consider that relies a trade deadline is four o'clock\nAnd where else you know so now I I think similar last year I think that's kind of much ado about nothing to do a kind of fun to kick around regardless\nYou mention San Brad for what about like Thai rod Taylor Ryan Fitzpatrick those veteran quarterbacks any interest in those guys\nYeah I mean you know Colorado worried about what the jaguars but um and do they want to pay a million dollars for a starter who you know was not playing well and then got you know benched after an injury\nAnd they beat last year in the playoffs\nYeah and that's the other thing is they've seen it firsthand look up and not\nBeing good so you know why I that's a problem that you know they've seen border with like good they've invested so much of their rights paying him so why would that make sense and then it's Patrick you know you can like apps and a quarter back injury I don't see where he would end up going I really don't\nRight now backing up James Winston by the way Ryan Griffin is the answer to who's third on the buccaneers quarter back up the truck when we were talking about this yesterday and you said and I'll just make it easy for you here that you don't think the bills are going to trade with Sean McCoy\nNow he's in concussion protocol now don't know if he clears and gets on the field Monday but he has an extra day they play the patriots on on ESPN\nHe's thirty e and like why wouldn't the bills be actively trying to trade them\nAbout you know the way it's been explained to me is yes I mean obviously he is Thirty years old but um he's looked good he's been a really good in the locker room they believe he's going to be on the next year and you know\nThey can laugh about that all you want but we've seen teams turnaround from one year to the next in football probably more so than any other sport ended with Patrick Peterson you know why would the cardinal trade Patrick ... show and and they're good next year he's going to help the part of the solution um so they believe Shay is going to be on the team next year\nI'm and that that's the case then you know maybe you get a second round or somebody probably trade and I think they would probably do that or anything um but I just don't think that's happening so I don't think you're going anywhere\nAnd many team most teams wouldn't give up a second round pick for a thirty year old running back and I'm not trying to write ages to your I'm forty four But Frank Gore is an anomaly what we use our last night oh how old are you think I was\nYounger she she\nReally thinks Powell a yeah I just had a birthday I'm I'm really ugly or I'm a\n... year old [noise] this is Ian Rapaport or or end up on that word inside or want to go back to the Patrick Peterson because he had a statement released a statement on Wednesday yeah I'm frustrated but I'm here now you reported last Thursday on the network there you'd spoken like a bit we'll he's he's not getting traded you were adamant about that you quoted bid well this wasn't like a\nYou know a deep conversation he had a quote he's not getting traded basically\nThe ... not happening did Patrick Peterson\nAfter the issue that did he issued that same and only because he wanted out and they told them forget about it and so he just said I guess I got to put this to bed because they're not going to do what I Want\nYeah okay now I mean it was also a conversation where I think they tried to kind of sway shame and\n... you know let him understand that um things are going to be a little different going forward and you know some discussion of some improvement I mean there was there was definitely conversations um I just think um\nYou know it was it was very clear the whole time he was not getting trade I Know there was interest I Know his cousin was out there ... teams they want us to play for he was never getting traded so the only way to get\nIn front of it for him was to meet with the owner and embrace the reality which is how you're going to be there going forward\nWas his desire to leave in any way a reflection of the mood in the locker room under new head coach deep Wilkes\nI have not heard that I mean I Know Peterson is frustrated but I have not heard that about ... other players I mean obviously there are losing show now like everyone's running around doing jumping jacks or whatever but um I've not heard specifically anything about the coach I mean there's\nYou know that that we've got some issues I mean they got a lot of first responders or not in the field um they\nGot you know they got old real quick um they have a lot of problems so you know I I have not hurt specifically any players say that it's the coaching staff or for sure\nMy ride coming up I'm thirty four past the hour this is Ian Rapaport our NFL Network insider on may ... sitting in for rich who lives in London at his back on Tuesday the boys have golden corral Dion Sanders hosts the show\nOn Monday one to talk about the browns real quick it's what we will we don't we know that she had one only one game and two years into this year he was I mean not the hot seat from day number one obviously here but\nThis past week or two ... I've been really interesting he he they lose again another heartbreak her\nAnd then he comes out and Tampa Sunday and says he may take play calling away\nFrom Todd Haley there's a report on Twitter from the browns flagship station\nFrom their reporter who covers the team every day Sunday night that says there's more and more frustration basically stay tuned and side has alum endorsing didn't say they said it but he's saying they are more frustrated and then he comes out and says I didn't really mean to say what I said was just the heat of the moment\nBeen taught Haley plays nice yesterday you and I talked about the seat getting warmer\nYesterday on NFL Network and then they get the Steelers on Sunday I Know that I'm kind of making award salad here but but could this be his final game if it goes really badly Sunday in Pittsburgh\nI mean I think you know at this point in the NFL it's hard to really anything out ever um so you know we'll see how it plays out I think the frustration feel um the issues are real you know the fact that\nUh the quarterback had played well at the beginning and hasn't recently is I think frustrating to some um you know if you're going to be the coach next year the team I think you know it's hard to believe\nUm so yeah I mean if if it goes real badly um I think we'll be paying pretty close attention and Cleveland\nAll right here's here's my sixty four thousand dollar question which former head coach now way coordinator would get the interim job\nAnd my guess would be tied Haley rather than Craig\nWell even though he arrived in Williams defenses performing far better than Todd Haley's often [noise]\nYes\nWhy\nWell I'm you know I think there's ... and not for everyone and no\nYou know and you kind of look at the landscape of the the franchise which way it's going um brought some new coaches in ... one of them um my senses if something happened\nThat would probably want to start fresh or rather than you know give great Williams had coaching opportunity or I Would say I'm pretty strong in that view um so I Would I Would definitely be surprised if they made a move and it was Gregg Williams taking over\nReal quick Hugo crews who is a down judge he is the official though was fired yesterday or news\nCame out yesterday that he was fired for missing what was a blatant Russell old coon full start weeks six for the chargers that led to end up very played Tyra Williams touchdown pass from Philip Rivers and this is in essence\nUnprecedented that we fire an official mid season\nIt is actually unprecedented yeah um and you know it's not for\nOne play I think that was pretty clear we talked about it on TV some it was for a over the length of is you know last several games sees it as whatever and you know honestly it's good to see some accountability it's good to see you don't want to see someone lose their job but um\nWhen officials make bad calls it affects games and people do lose your jobs because games um so\nYeah I mean it didn't it the headline was was you know pretty catchy but it wasn't an official losing his job because of a bad call this is clearly a series of bad calls um and but yeah definitely nowhere in an interesting and\nWho is on your podcast this week\nUh we had\nScariest will enter the costs of potential defensive ... years awesome awesome\nAnd could narrow Paterson who are too big touched down to the patriots season including return last week and get a pretty awesome special teams you know he was entertaining\nAnd Andrew I be issue this is this the international goes down we'll get rich ... is going to call back riches walking the streets of London\nI'll let you know we'll get him back I mean rich of all people should know\nI Know we're in Atlanta landline ... area and he's\nHe's back or we got we got your back ... yeah okay hold on where you left me button Hi\nCarlos Hyde I I think whatever ales Jackson goes off and I think Carlos Hyde as the guy that they feel can play the for natural that they've been missing and uh and and hopefully keep the keep the uh the eagles are fenced off the field I think that's their their key to victory here\nSo I was talking to Kurt a\nOn Tina first look we painted Wednesday full disclosure aired yesterday before Kurt out there to\nMeet you guys in London and I said who is going to talk of the most because you guys have done a couple of her soul games Kurt to enrich that he was going to talk the most\nIs that right that's what he does it hurt is going to top the most he said that on the TV\nIs that right you don't really he doesn't really off

or might tilt to follow um who else is in that game the fact is they don't have anyone to throw two\nThat's a big issue [laughter] am although the Vikings last week said Sam Donald looked cold do you notice that when you hear the old like temperature was yes that he look cold and didn't want to be they're interesting now what's the weather in Chicago this week\nAnybody know probably probably windy\nI I have no idea I'm typing in now and ... ... maybe some rain surely them kind of windows\nOkay it's going to be fifty or you making that up no no no you know fifties maybe some rent fifty and maybe some right and and the bears loaded day they admitted this week I'm ... admitted this week that no clue Mac is not healthy he was clearly affected by that ankle and the bears have a\nFair is that a mixture Missy down field throwing the football issue with others great NFL Films audio last week were built bell a check and you you might have seen this on my up on the network on Showtime inside the NFL or build bell check was ah was over talking to the defense one of those classic ... leaning over trying to the bench moments where he said\nHe's not going to beat us with his arm he's only going to beat us with his legs\nThat the issue now with Trump escape you go back and look at I I'm not saying he threw nine touchdown passes by accident\nInto games he has had his moments mad negative gets a lot of credit for scheming guys open\nAnd some of those throws or like like big twelve defenses we're going damn those guys were wide open it [laughter] right right right so\nInteresting to see what Casey Rogers what Todd Bowles do here with Mitch ...\nAnother big game or in the AFC West Broncos that chief brown because it can be without Royce Freeman rolled out with an ankle injury [noise] All right\nThis is the second time in four weeks these two teams played this is the third time in nine career starts to ... homes\nGets to face the Broncos this game is that arrowhead and all the first one they played on Monday Night was a very close game was the first real test we thought from homes where you had to win the game the fourth quarter at the end I I honestly think there's going to\nBe a blow up I think this could be a\nBad blow out and I could be wrong but\nIf it is and we're talking about Vance Joseph on\nMonday I must tell you is getting hand on Monday but\nIf this game to get out of hand\nIf Vance shows of as the same looked at Marvin Lewis had last week on Sunday night which has got like ... how do we stop this guy\nThen\nWho knows stay tuned as I Believe somebody said one of the ... what is the imaginary a line on this game\nA temple is wow all time favorite thing to me that ... ... and then as we mentioned are threats show or there's enough above the big ... come out of that Texans wives who were well for who\nHad a huge game a tours ACL will be out for the rest of the season now looking at the Texans have not won five straight have you been surprised how they've been able to turn their season\nAround yeah because after three games I think people were whispering in Houston is this the end of bill O'Brian which was somewhat unfair because his quarterback was coming off a mid season ACL\nFrom last year but there was nothing that look right about that team in the first three games Jay Jay ... didn't have a second if I recall the first two or even maybe three they didn't look\nRight now they look\nRight and the willful or lost his huge ... but they have three home games remaining in the division\nIt is in the middle east winnable division let's say the eagles beat the jaguars this week not predicting it but let's say that happens\nTheir leaders even more comfortable in that division after beating them in Jacksonville last week already with that game in hand there they what happened we point out remember we're jaguars one week one right right okay so they've split 'em\nYeah now they're not in the patriots class\nThey are not I don't even think in the three two one Steelers class they are certainly not in the chiefs class they are the AFC South wouldn't be winter and I don't see them going far in January but it's still October yeah\nKind of interesting question they got to admit it and it is the south and if the east\nTo weakest divisions which division winner goes further in the playoffs\nLike ASC south NFC\nEast so potentially Houston or or Washington or watching the eagles get their CEOs I [noise]\nI I Would say that Sean Watson factor gives them the ability to meet anybody\nWhen you have to Sean Watson running around making plays and when you have\nToday being cloudy and Jay Jay ... chasing your quarterback and those are all three game changing players in the postseason where at any point in the game they can make a wild play and totally flip the field and changed the game so because of that\nI Would say one of those teams ... I I'm not going to go down the Alex Smith doesn't win the playoffs road but\nWhat the Redskins if they get there\nYou're assuming Adrian Peterson knock on something stays healthy the rest of the year\nWas hope he does he's not getting any younger I I'm not so sold on the Redskins by the way you want to look at fascinating numbers look at sake one Barclay through seven career games Adrian Peterson through seven career games\nThey are almost identical to the digit kind of numbers like that you're making a face\nNo no I'm just I mean they've on drugs is a fantastic player but they're still the argument there of if they should have taken Sam Darnell\nOkay can we get over this here for a second let let let's there is no way you can judge the giants draft will say Kwan Barclay Intille you look at their two thousand Nineteen draft or their two thousand Eighteen offseason into Nineteen right into Nineteen that is they're Nineteen off season\nAnd see how it where they get a quarterback because fast forwarding let's go next September and whomever they take in the first round whether it's some kid out of Oregon or who knows where or a free agent orange frayed but let's say next September we can confidently say\nAnd some people think that they won't be able to but let's say that they find their quarterback next year\nWell then they have the quarterback and say Kwan Barclay\nThere are two parts to this equation now if the giants fail miserably to get their quarterback next year\nThen we have an issue but nobody can watch sake one Barclay and say he was a bad pick I think Sam Darnell is going to be assigned quarterback\nDon't know yet about Josh Allen don't know yet about Josh Rosen but the early returns on same darnel or good yes they would love to have him but you can't watch sake won Barclay and say we should have passed on this guy no he's dynamic but was he the right pick\nTell me next year\nWith Sam Donald right now and no say Kwan Barclay how much better than one in six is this team any idea probably maybe maybe maybe ... maybe two and five and a three and four no sorry that much happier prominent okay and a three and four would you be that much happier from it\nYou know I'm going to ask me to ask\n... Hawkins for ... for a wide receiver and star of the Tomahawk podcast Andrew\nRockets straight ahead that was Chris Rock and with the news I made ... sitting in for rich this is the rich and show\nThe rich I download try and show dot com\nIf you've ever driven past the snowy vineyards by I Ninety you've probably wondered whose idea was to grow grapes there\nBatman was eh from Wales bull and it took more than twenty two thousand seedlings of grapes to invent the Concord grapes\nA tough fruit that could thrive in cold winters it was either that or moving to Florida and you can for about a twenty two thousand attempts that wasn't really an option for a man whose last name was bowl the world's top us anti opposite ends Welch as tough as grapes\nI Would give a went out for their car\nAlligator one out I I don't know if I Would give to one\nUm maybe one or two because we have seen their car at like a a ... at its highest level I mean he when he got hurt that that great things and he was having a plate with twenty Fifteen\nHe would have been the MVP bright and would you give up a first round pick for VP I Would I just because there's so many crafts and I played in Cleveland that we've at first round quarterback got the first row quarterback that didn't work out not this quarter yeah first round players that weren't even on a team within\nTwo and three so I don't want to say I value of a first round pick\nBut it does depend on what coach it at all it does depend on what GM that is to be able to maximize given that up and being able to build around them if you give up too many first routers or you give up too much you kind of handicap yourself and not being able to get the value added that player that you're looking for 'em because you're you're playing with a shorter deck\nA perfect example Cory Coleman two dozen sixteen first round pick is already going\nThat exactly I mean it happened it's unfortunate um but\nYou know first round fixing it and having that kind of inventory in GOP compensation doesn't matter if you can't pick the right guy\nExactly what you what the raiders now have to do they have five first run picks coming up in the next two seasons All right speaking of ... I Am not listen to the full episode yet but I saw the thing you guys tweeted out\nYou tell the Cody Kessler\nTo realm prior [laughter] story because Connie Kessler came in last week from lake mortals and like you actually better than Blake mortals but now he is back to being the number two and ... and still the guy at least for now as they go to London but you were Cody Kessler teammate\nCody Kessler a was a rookie and twenty six Sunni I Believe was drafted I mean I think that year we had\nTwo three yeah dodged my town and we had a you know a ... see that quarterback the guy was bringing from time to time long story short when a gang somebody gets hurt the next guy gets hurt and somehow it's\nCody started college rookie ever played before the game plan going in was not for him to play you know and so he gets really really nervous so the point that you know he has a ticket any rats\nKurt ... and for people that I don't ... third string quarterback base and they don't do anything all week because the first guy takes all the rest of the starters in practice and then the second team guy\nTakes the scouting wrapped it gets to starting deep into the third string guy literally just thrilled for like a a period of practice and then he doesn't do anything for the rest of the week\nSo here we are with this guy is about to go in and having not taking any wraps he's a rookie still trying to get the opposite though and it was later in the game so I think someone with a guy with a black guy throwing me we have to rail prior on the Ross who is now playing out there and you're like hey let's put in the pie that they go to corral pride if they keep saying\nWe need you to go start taking some snaps I'm so and so is her and I think you've got to go in a quarterback\nAnd drill prior looks at him and he says I'm not going in and they're like what\nIt was like yeah you don't pay me enough to play quarterback I'm receiver now if you want me to play quarterback is is that a conversation we should ask but I'm a wide receiver that's the end of it and everybody's mouth was got on the floor all the students are laughing because we understood it really is true is right if you want to play quarterback that's a that's a higher price\nEncoded Kessler had to go in I don't know if he ended up going I think Josh McKenna I may have liked to talk to that rubs some some special sauce on the show the going back in but a language and go through but it was the funniest thing I've ever\nWell I don't know if I was going to go there but let's go there is that why a drill prior has had trouble hanging on to a job since he turned out and looked at me at the time they're pretty darn good free agent contract to stay with the browns\nYou know it's a gamble it's a gamble I don't know if it's it's the reason why is that trouble I think more than anything it's like you know it it's a different world to be able to\nTo transition from a quarterback as well where I was the first off\nThere's one of two thousand athletes that would ever be able to do it and happened to be one of those guys but in that you don't change your mentality as all of a quarterback right so this ... so what do you think is a big contract what'd you think is a great deal looks different from a receiver perspective to a quarterback perspective\nOr even like what's your command is in a rural what's your what's your role is in a room on a gene is it just different and it's not something\nThat I don't think he'd be we used to\nUm because you study when he will be playing wide receiver\nIt would be make a suggestion is on what to ask the throwing the goal line or he will be telling us what the attack would want to do or the tractor running back and to take and I'm like yes you are flooding in your mind was information you no longer lead me\nThat that does not matter anymore stop looking at it stopped looking at what the D. and don't stop looking at with a lot of factors to do it this is all you need to focus all but again he's been taught his whole life to do it that way and it's hard to turn off and on the field and off the field\nIn rock and one last thing when asked about the rams no one here in LA 'cause we have better things to worry about right now is thinking about them going undefeated because the last four games are lab right now the next four games rather Green Bay\nAt New Orleans Seattle at home and in Kansas City on the road in Mexico city but\nShouldn't we be thinking about them going undefeated do you think they have a legit shot [noise]\nI think there are incredible and I can't say that I watch them and I think they're going to be able to run the table you know I I liked it and they have an incredible collection of players Shaun the varied as an incredible job of getting the most out of those guys with so many different personalities and a lack of ... that\nI don't think a lot of coaches would even be able to have a control on but because on it so I think you maximize what they have but I don't think that they're going to feed it it's just\nIt's so hard in today's NFL when I get that they're super talented um is it every week never know who's been a problem that we're going to have a great game at the beauty of professional football so not especially that did early in the season I'm not prepared to say that they could say\nAll right my laughing allowed you guys were debate and you enjoy Thomas last week who had more coach swag thirty something coach swag between Sean McVeigh in Kyle Shanahan did we ever ever decide on a winter\nI don't know the ... that is what I mean we're a little biased towards cow because\nSee the flag on TV weed out the the behind the flag we've seen the dude Dan we've the other guys celebrate crackdown recorded lately which is\nHeavily little way [noise] um so we're a little biased towards the sand and say but I did this year I'm ready for the flight not too long ago and thought to myself I've never seen a head goes with that kind of flack in my life so we don't advocate on it by shorts and a half but the ... in the air\nAlright well McVeigh got last week but that is worth ... hands on dealing with a full deck there are those injuries and sandbags go Andrew ... Tomahawk pod cast downloaded now watch them as well and Snapchat on sports center as well through ESPN we appreciate you picking up the phone my friend enjoy your football weekend\nOf course that bigger then talk to\nYou got ... truly do about podcast check it out that go to catch their stories amazing is that about Cody actually it's it's about drought prior just go right [laughter] yeah no way\nNo chance I ain't going in for get about it\nAnd then by the way I don't think the rams are going to run the table I don't think it's right for them to necessarily want to run the table that said you want to win every week no one wants to lose no one in that building is even talking about it yet worth thinking about it because the next four games are that tough\nI mean they are they they have Aaron Rodgers this week I think that when this week I I don't think this one look this one is certainly a challenge but this isn't the one that scares me the most ... then you go to New Orleans at the one okay and back story\nTaking behind the curtain if you go back and watch the preseason game week for the pre season I say we because I'm part of the broadcast for the rams pre season we were in New Orleans\nTo play the saints and Sean Payton kind of ... up in the pre season\nThat was the thing\nHe he was going on inside kick in the ... like in the fourth quarter up he was he was making the rams like re kick in the fourth quarter when they were ... penalties when everyone just wants to get out of there and trim your roster the next day\nThey there was a little bit of really like it is this stuff going on\nLike beyond gamesmanship and and this isn't necessarily this isn't to like inside football stuff Nate Burleson tonight and they and I did the game on CBS to here in Los Angeles\nIn this is on our on on the air we're up we're both up there and both going\nWhat is going on here like this is the fourth preseason game stop it like you have members of your first team defense on the field with like a minute remaining in the second quarter like well what's what's going on your anyway\nKeep that in mind next week so they have the saints next week then you have a the Seahawks back here Seahawks played 'em pretty tough in Seattle and then you have the game of the year\nThere there is no doubt about the game of the year right now it's that week eleven game that the Monday Night in Mexico city\nAt altitude right that\nThe game of the year right there and other ramps have off after that game thereby weakest Thanksgiving week which is fantastic it perfectly time by for the holidays and to get healthy for the stretch run but if they somehow go this for game gauntlet then you look at the back half\nNone of those games scare you at Chicago home for Philly at Arizona about silly here two years in a row by the way and then at say a home for San Francisco which is the week's Seventeen game for the second consecutive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Rich Eisen", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "26"}
