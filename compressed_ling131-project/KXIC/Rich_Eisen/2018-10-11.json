I could give him that that's for sure but but no ... hit people in their ... and it defensively\nThey're hitting people in the mouth says five weeks by absolutely I have a battery that has surprised me they are physical and they're going to hurt you absolutely know that going into a week against the Dallas Cowboys I don't recall the last time I could say something like\nThat it's been it's been a while it's been a long time it's been it's been I don't think it's been in the last three decades that when you have to be their identity it could be but I feel like we're certainly not fully there yet right to where you know you're going to really rest on that defense to win games and I obviously the last game that's\nWhat Garret did and we lost um\nBut you know life he didn't go forward on fourth he rested on the defense and at the in\nIn in ... it didn't work out right and I and then I get it like\nYou know he has great zinc you know he's pounding it and he's doing a fantastic job um but I I I don't see 'em I don't see them you know stepping out and being a great team I'm ... ... the way we are currently constructed um I really feel like a\nTony Romo played a bigger role\nIn I'm In ... acts of gross I feel like cutting me while I feel like he was really helping helping him with weeds and understanding how to make\nIn game adjustments um his his knowledge of the game and I think I I feel like we kinda see that on CBS when he's you know as a as a as a commentator he really kind of understands what's about to happen and the and the plays that that should be run 'em I feel like that on the sideline for deck\nHas been lost and his ability to make in game adjustments um it's not happening\nYou're saying Cooper rushed does not offer that from the two number to hold on I ... I'm I'm not seeing it [laughter] it's an interesting analysis of what's going on with the Dallas Cowboys I'm now you're fired up I imagine if LeBron coming to town so you're a Laker fan from all the years have you been living out here in\nLiving out here I didn't really watch basketball as a kid when I was in New York so um I didn't really get into it until I moved out here and if you're gonna move out here and you know the Lakers were Showtime and definitely not ... it was amazing um you know a lot of the guys\nAnd or your kid working on these shows right and you were going to be all for absolutely yeah I Would go to the form I ... I was really really good friends with Dr Jerry Buss\nUm and we would sit up in his box um as a young man\nAnd and hung out with him and the family and are still friends with Jeanie Buss and and so a a huge you know lover of our Lakers squad and and I get how a lot of Kobe fans were losing their minds you know like you can't have the enemy come on now but I think it's ridiculous it is ridiculous ridiculous look\nYou know come into the NBA and players change teams okay and there are very few home grown stars anymore okay we're not going to have\nThe kid growing up in Englewood who's now going to be the number one basketball player in the NBA playing for the Lakers were going to have to go out and get other players by the way wilt Chamberlain didn't play with us his whole career I'm a Kareem Abdul Jabbar didn't play with us Sharon shack didn't play with us the entire time so let's get over that\nUm we've got the greatest player on the planet earth playing for the Lakers now let's let's get behind them we've got a great young squat I feel like magic and Lincoln did a great job of bringing in this season\nSome players that can teach the un squad how to kinda get it done and also be a contender I don't think the Lakers are winning the championship this year but once we get that next max player I think we have a shot\nA ... a barrel I'm Glad you have that attitude because when I heard Laker fans out here saying liberal on common here infringing on Kobe's tr Phillies gums or but it's not\nIt's like Crimea river over having\nGenerational talent and write generational talent jail up here either by acquisition after free agency\nCrimea river I Would take LeBron James in a Knicks uniform even though I've sworn off that team as far as the owner and I and you had to be kidding me absolutely and even if LeBron and his three plus one deal that he's given the lingers here\nEven if let's just let's give them half of those years a championship let's just do that right which is that you never know\nShe's still way behind Kobe and the amount of rings and in terms of what he's done else it's just you it's you can't even compare problem is is that the logic is counterproductive\nRight so we don't want the best player in LA because we don't want to win any more championships\nAnd west on Kobe's wins right make absolutely no sense at all Leslie instead let's just love ours right yes\nBut we're flip cars right about his kid it doesn't make any sense like if you want to win go out and get the best players possible Ron is the best player on planet earth I'm going to do with the brunt on my team and and root for him versus let's root for some other guy because I Want to remember Coby Coby ... not\nPicking up a basketball and he's not putting it through a hoop again Laker fans let's get past\nIt let's move on to a little brown era at last love it\nI Love it [noise] we've got a great team can him and magic is doing a fantastic\nJob I just by the way I just feel like you're sitting on the set of America's funniest home videos which is a great show and you do a great job of it deep down you want to pop off about the Laker fans you want to pop off of off the cowboys and you don't you I feel like you're getting this opportunity and I'll sit and just sitting here with you and\n\nLike I got to get out to the war like come on you know you go\nGet it right All right let's split down the road here what what is your a handicap\nOr right now I'm a to handicap two and a cat a mind the lowest I've ever been I I was a plus too at one point you're on your own to the crowd was given spoke to the court you're likely while here's this here's ... I'm going to hand it back to you don't need I don't worry don't get it I'll get it back from you know but uh I Love\nThis game I'm actually an ambassador for the PGA Tour champions um and so for me this game brings me happiness on a daily basis I mean whether it's actually playing thinking about it I wake up every morning and I think about the game of golf I practice three things in the shower every morning\n... am I putting stroke and my ship it well first of all ... hours there are no clothes [laughter] okay I don't really get that serious 'cause you slip and fall and Bush but but um but just the technique and the feel of it because I always say the ball always just simply\nGets in the way of the club you're not hitting a ball the ball is in the way of your of your swing so if you're a swing is solid and the ball just gets in a way and goes where it's supposed\nTo go see now are staying and I would love to just don't think like that [laughter]\nI don't have that you know golf makes me happy for various reasons okay 'cause I like being outside right I like just being able to tap out a little bit although my friends always rag on me for having my phone a little bit too handy right okay All right I'm just sitting around me man okay you get a lot going on I Do\nSo but you know I I I I Love the camaraderie of it mhm [noise]\nBut so much else of it frustrates the hell out of me I Wish I could just say I the golf makes me so happy you know what\nWhat I you know so I I actually coach my wife right and most guys would typically be like a there was no way that we're going down that road right fantastic\nIt works out great when she started playing golf she was a shooting in the high one thirties uh within six months she was shooting in the low nineties and the reality to me is is that because you have to start over sometimes right people we hold on to our past\n... a lot as human beings you have to decide do I want to be better or do I want to be mediocre right now and not get worse to get better you have to get worse\nYou've got to break it all down and you've got to start all over and then you had to learn the proper technique based on your body and your natural ability you know I see people all the time one oh look at all I Want to emulate Jason days swing", "show_name": "Rich Eisen", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "11"}
