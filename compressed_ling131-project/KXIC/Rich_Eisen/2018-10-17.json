the thanks thanks are the most part when we come back Chris Weber calls end to talk about last night's warriors sees an opening victory what he thinks of Jimmy Butler's gamut to either get traded or meshes team together we'll ask him the whole question\nUh that we've been asking all show long which is the team that has the best chance to prevent the warriors for making another ring the ...\nRockets the Lakers or the Celtics that's coming up next year on the rich eyes and show\nLet's talk about light stream if you're like most of us you've got to balance on your credit card you know higher interest rate than you would like and why not turn those balances into one monthly payments at a lower interest rate and start saving money and doing it with a card like light stream when a group like light streams\nThat make sure that you understand\nThat if you got good credit you deserve a great interest rate and no feeds and their division of sun trust bank one of the ... largest financial institutions in this country so you can have complete peace of mind and my listeners and viewers can save even more with an additional interest rate discount on top of light streams already low rates\nCredit card condolence consolidation loans from six point one four percent a PR with auto pay\nBut what are your aspirations if you're in Minnesota clear to make the playoffs for the championship or just to get to the cemetery\nIn January I Hope you don't have to try to fight a team that families\nTweeting out like it's just not a good situation like it's almost like starting to marriage off you know after you both tried to kill each other and then you you may crash so that was always going to work what we did last night that doesn't matter you know I mean like where where do you go from here\nI I don't know I don't you know I was always the guy that had tried to help control the locker room for me if we were friends like I never to talk a little football go for it I didn't like out of office of lines that are living on bill I don't\nI never got on the guy for getting his money never you can always go get your money is not a family they'll trade you like I was at a time with them all go get your money\nOkay that's one thing but to\nTalk about us and they want to come back in the locker room and then to tell stories to the media\nAbout being all that I have that I'm gonna see you in the locker room so I I think that you you know or maybe you know maybe they're you know it's a different than that better man than them\nAll the men to the company for them to be with you go and competitive in the locker which I don't I don't see how this worked at all\nAnd they're in San Antonio tonight they open up in San Antonio tonight I mean we'll see how it goes and we'll see if Jimmy bottlers dare I mean ... it really I I haven't seen anything quite like it and and when he leaves\nRace what about what are they going to say like now what pressures that you put on cat like what President you could always add don't get me wrong at the end of the day if I'm a Minnesota fan and butler just traded maybe he helped our team more than any coach any GM anyone could because\nWhat he said about these guys who is going to link within their whole career until they prove it and so maybe this is the fire that you need to started under them but you can't have that guy around all the time after you start to fire ... yeah\nWe have Chris Weber here on the rich eyes and she'll sorry I thought you were done uh Chris Weber here on the rich eyes and show 'em\nYou're making your way to Portland that's going to be a heck of a moment when obviously they remember Paul Allen before that game and then it's gonna be LeBron coming out any Lakers uniform what is deemed realistic expectation do you think for the brown and his first year with the Lakers Chris Weber\nWell this is you know a a I think the only one that agrees with me here is Charles Barkley thought I Know he's right a lot but then again he's been ethically\nWrong so I don't know a history but this is my thing\nAnd and I I just hope fans really understand is so let me start by saying this\nIs the Lakers make the playoffs no one will appreciate how great the brown is\nThis will be one of his best accomplish because this is the west coast asking him to win twenty more games\nIn a conference where teams are so good veteran teams\nAnd he has a team of newcomers this first year we saw that he could win a championship in um Miami is for sure how hard is that once you get guys to go that we've seen that with a lot of different teams but yes he makes his players better yes he is one of the smartest players one of the greatest player ever to play he's going to energize\nThat community but I still see them move being next year because I just have a couple of questions beside him who's going to shoot three pointers\n... I guess heart right on and on and it's definitely not lawns all off the top of my head not Rondo\nBut they're down three we dealt with the liberal who's going to shoot the reporter right ... that's all I Want to\nKnow who's going to want to quit smoking fill it up I mean a while\nSo now we depend on the second your power forward okay\nI'm just throwing these names on there I don't know\nYeah I'm I'm with you I'm just you know that's not the same value in ... uh you know the Mike Miller ... you know we got hit a for eight in the finals of ray Allen I I'm just saying that with patents recipient kinda with this team that they have now and I liked the players that they have it\nDoesn't seem like they have the skill sets to win in the west and of course you know ... by man and a magic my manager said probably will make trades and\nHelp the team but as the team stance today before their first game I Do not see how they're going to make the playoffs in the rough west with a new team and I just don't think they have a good show there was I think it's too many ball handlers and now she's\nNot even in the eighth and final playoff spot with LeBron I mean that would be based on last year standings the Lakers would have to be plus twelve plus twelve in the wind column to get to the aid and final playoff spot if everything stings from last right and this year\nAnd based on based on that than Denver a who lost by one game I think is going to be a top four teams you got to give them ten ... or you know you've got to take San Antonio into consideration so I Do think there's a chance with injuries and things like that but you know when you go to Denver\nOr out and and then on Wednesday in Portland or on a Thursday goes back to back skewed but there's more traveling on the west coast uh as I'm sure many people I Wish that you know when you travel it used to go from Toronto the Cleveland an hour and a half hour flight\nOr you go to Texas after LA again last three and a half hours you know it's just a it's just all the the little ... intangibles along with teammates and along with guys that the ground being the best penetrate early game get into the lane is getting double and triple teams when he kicks it out you still got to knock the shot that\nYou can say what you what about ... those guys but they did not go shots now that I'm interested to see who's going to step up and knock them down because I Love random England but he's a slasher um you know I see all slashes if I Want to see besides the brown who can consistently blocked out after a few\nMinutes left with Chris Weber Turner Sports fresh off the ... a game with Marvin Golden State last night so\nOur question is which team do you think is going to bad the best chance to prevent the warriors from winning and also we included the Lakers are small throw that one out ... based on your last answer Celtics or rockets or ... or or other Chris which one of those things\nNow I Do think the brown is good enough I noticed\nSounds kind of crazy I don't know if he's going to be I don't know if this to be good enough to get to the playoffs but they can be a couple of teams in the seven ... seven game series where they can concentrate on that um the plants have to adjust so they have time they could do that every day I don't think they can and I think\nMaybe he was the uh because uh because he used to do the same coffers are arguably you could say who's there could have won it last year with a healthy cruise Paul I just think rather lose a ... of a low to\nI think there's too much for them [laughter] but uh in the west coast they shut a record for threes last year they love that totally style to play Othello as ... as opposed to prove that you could probably got paid you should be happy and and I just see a boost in a a fear that the\nLast one for your ... is a your honorary captain see for Jim ...
