right now\nJust for giving them a truck discovers going to give a new car members a one year anniversary gift of matching\nA for a guy that um that has had to go through so much like he has so uh you know that was tough\nI think for us we we realized on the field could we have to put this behind as we can't we can't be uh he'll let the the negativity creep into the rest of this game and um so I mean I think for us to be able to push past that\nAnd to win the way we did was it was huge but again we we hated for Tyler it's or something\nYou never want to see so did Marvin pull you altogether or did somebody say something you say something before everybody got back out there\nThat you know at that point in the huddle it's like you know obviously it sucks for him but we we've got to keep going you know the the game still has to go on so we've got to get our mind right and uh\nIt didn't happen right after it happened we went three now and then they blocked upon so it didn't it didn't work out just in but uh you know we we kinda got it back at the end the game and um they were able to to win it\nAndy Dalton bangles quarterback here on the rich eyes and show three in one getting set to take on the three in one dolphins let's talk about your ah your foundation and your trip to buffalo this a pre season\nAnd you getting a standing ovation from the fans there that I'm sure part was again still the fact that your touchdown pass to Tyler Boyd eliminated the ravens and was to help that the bills needed to make the playoffs last year but\nUh it seemed to me that it was it was a standing ovation for you and you back at them for the money that was raised just the the outpouring of love you you you received from bills fans I'm Wondering where where\nWhere you stood on that ovation there and\nYou know it's just it's such a crazy story um the fact that\nYou know we threw touched that through touchdown pass that\nKnocked off the ravens that's what we were thinking at that point okay well now the ravens aren't making we weren't thinking anything about buffalo Cape buffalo then then next thing you know someone donate swat foundation from buffalo saying thank you\nAnd for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars later over Fifteen thousand or donors I mean it's\nSo crazy so for ah my wife and I we felt like you know it's our duty to give back to buffalo so I'm now ... it was cool how it all lying you know got kind of had it had it all planned out that\nUm you know he was going to give it a preseason game in Buffalo so made it so it wasn't a regular season game so made it a whole lot easier to\nUh do everything that we did we went and made a donation to a hospital and then to walk on the field and a opposing stadium and get a standing ovation is not something that happens often so uh it's pretty crazy pretty surreal and\nUm I mean it was definitely a a cooling in special moment that uh it had to south thankful those fans were that we got them in the playoffs but for us we are so thankful for all the money that they were able to give to our foundation because we're gonna be able to help they'll make the children and their families with it\nYeah the Roswell park Cancer Center angel fund was the a recipient of of the dollars in in western\nNew York there and you visited the center of the day before the preseason game correct\nCorrect yeah I didn't think that um I didn't think that that was going to be able to to go is actually I'm a it was actually the day of the game and so I had a little time in the morning of\nThe day of yeah so again it it was good that has a pre season games are the things where uh you know a little more relaxed but\nUm yeah I was able to go that morning I didn't think I was going to be able to but our schedule worked out where I was able to make it over there for a little bit and uh just uh you know make the donation just to say thank you for for all the money that they gave us\nIt's just that you're right it is an amazing story it some ... ... ... and again the the ovation um I think was just everybody kind of giving everybody a round of applause that that obviously it was meant something football wise but lives were changed\nThrough that um that somebody thought let's let's let's let's make something special for an adult and then his family through the foundation I Love that Andy it's it you can't make that up\nYeah I think it just shows the power of sports and um how many people that can impact and\nUh especially when when you use it for good they can or it can make an impact on so many people and so I think it's like a crazy story awesome story it's one of those things that you never think it's going to happen to you or your you know is one of those stories that you see it as like oh man that's awesome but now everything is going to happen to you and so we just happen to be on the receiving\nEnd of it and then just a again this story that's unfolding at the corner post point of of the bangles season three in one after that when Drake Kirkpatrick who's been on the show many times was saying afterwards that the teams fighting for each other standing up for each other believing in each other in previous years we haven't\nHad that would you agree with that assessment [noise]\nYeah I think are definitely this year that's that's the case I think for\nFor us as there's been no quitting this team and uh we're finding ways to win however however it needs to be done that felt like this past week that the last team that had the ball was going to win and so you know fortunately we were the the score was seven seconds left so um yeah I definitely agree with that statement and\nThat you get guys are definitely plan for each other\nIn terms of past years haven't had that what do you think he means by that\nYeah it's it's hard to say uh you know I think that's something that he said I'm not necessarily saying that but um yeah I think this year we we definitely have that\nOK taken out in the Miami Dolphins this weekend Andy Dalton reprieve ... joining the program thanks very much will chat again soon yeah you got extra\nGot that Sandy don't pretty much has every record of TCU now three in one for the Cincinnati Bengals right here in the ... and show [noise] [noise] yeah I mean there's two games this um [noise] Sunday featuring both teams having above five hundred records\nYou've got the three in one dolphins at the three in one bangles and you've got three in one jaguars at the foreigner chiefs and would let him for an ad out I mean you saw the Broncos were able to move the ball on the ground\nAnd this is the this is going to be the so called test that was a road test for the patch or all last week big test and now the home test against the\nI guess you could say this is the best defense in the asking\nJaguars yeah there's all over the last thing so they kind of Russian of the show and I know that but they don't have to gain their way to the quarterback they can just put four sets of hands in the dirt they got guys in the back and who can\nKeep down the ... and the ... near the bottom and the league and we see with Jacksonville is without

send off to a a show that it's been on for for six years you know you do I think the audience will feel some sense of of um\nResolve to it it's it's I I'm I'm such a I Can't believe what the writers pulled off you know when you think about the fact that we were two episodes in with Kevin ... when when they put us on hold there\nAnd what they were able to pull off in three months ... and all Thirteen were pretty much done and then the completely rewrite a season in three months\nSo that's what I that's why I Do remember that you were two episodes in when Kevin Spacey had\nKnown was pulled off the cast it they still do\nAs an actor and everybody else you go back to whatever you're doing or whatever you had to do\nYeah every month while but the writers can yeah I mean what rewrote the final season of house of cards yeah\nAnd it happened in in stages right we all went home um I was home when it happened uh happened midday and Robin was there and she said let's finish today and the whole crew said they were like you guys can go home and they write let's finish our day and they all said and finished the day\nAnd then we were on on on on ideas and there was a lot of uncertainty but Robin and myself and you know Netflix and Marcy everyone was just like we gotta\nWe gotta finish this and it was just sort of like OK but how you know so that was three months of sort of figuring out how we can do it and how they could bring that conclusion for the fans and\nAnd you know that was the first streaming show on Netflix is the first original content show and I think everyone's just say well we gotta finish [laughter] we we have\nTo it so I I 'cause I was going to say that Michael Kelly here on the rich are the joke that\nYou know the ultimate compliment to house of cards is when

incredible\nI don't know if anyone's ever going to see it again it's going to be incredible you know I I knew you could feel it on set\nThe writing was so good to directing was so that the acting was listening credible I had never been surrounded by ... such a group of fine actors at that time in my career and it was just we all knew it mhm but it was the unknown was Netflix money and I wonder\nI mean how are they going to watch it very you know\nAnd and and now it's just second nature and you're on as an Amazon show a Jack Ryan with John ... who\nIs a diehard patriot found yet um 'cause funnier on my podcasts with my wife yesterday and she's a die hard patriot fan and uh she was making fun of my jet fandom without revealing her patriot found them yet and I'm like guess what teams you

is but he told me something uh we were just together a birthday party a few nights ago\nAnd he said you know what I'm going to stop talking because [laughter]\nI've decided 'cause he was like he was

you know\nI don't know man I'm good luck you know so we used a after the game he he was he was pretty cool he throws one around and then and then he's like you know I'm just playing but then he told
