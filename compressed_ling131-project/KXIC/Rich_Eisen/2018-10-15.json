Seventy nine joined Franco and Jerome in that department\nAnd he he should have had more the out of touch down that was ruled down at the one yard line that Tomlin did not challenge\nBecause he'd already challenged earlier in the game and I guess he figured that if he didn't challenge this and it's done it the one half yard line they're going to get in any way and why not challenge why why run the risk of losing your final challenge of the game and guess\nWhat he didn't challenge they didn't get in there to settle for three and that would absolutely been talked about today of Big Bend in San Antonio brown and what a lot of people think is effect like later in the game at the end of the game\nBut that's why I Can't buy the Steelers yet until this scenario gets handled and maybe they just ship let me just ship 'em out yeah James kind of let them out what is the endgame here from Michael Toner no\nI don't know like I say let the and come back and then they just key Sean him and so they're not paying any way if the eagles are calling form ship them out\n\nWhen does the trade deadline or it's the thirtieth is a couple of days after their game with Cleveland after the by that they're on right now what's going on in Tampa would they fire\nA K so obviously Tampa's defenses horrendous are given out four hundred and forty yards per game the most points per game\nLast in the league or fired Mike Smith he he might not met is a gotten the biggie to day they were last and yards allowed last year and obviously sameness and\nFormer coach of the yeah in Atlanta fired after losing almost like a Super Bowl I mean that is just that is man that's where I ...
