Hernandez then yeah it's in the bag\nA four four to four inches the number to down here on the show at sneaking a phone call here before it gets Charlie Steiner here on the program a man in El Paso Texas you were here on the rich as the shorts out many first in for a socializing\nDid mine through how is that going on in your mind today sir\nOh well I'm a ... it was like among over after yesterday's loss and aren't even drink [noise]\nYeah yeah well that is that right there but I Want to I Want to be a bigger Yankee fan I Want to say first of all a congratulations to to Mr Brooklyn in the Senate little Red Sox tank manning uh let's see what happens next round and\nI honestly I mean I Want it as much as I Want to point fingers and mentions Danny being a ... I mean we needed this cat and that was carrying the team when judge was hurt or know who this guy was out last night in the last couple of nights\nSerino for some reason turned into the parish of a couple of years ago ... games I don't know what happened there and sitting on his hands picked any he's out on the team that even wearing a Jersey I don't know if he was trying to tap into ... wearing a sweater I don't know what happens or\nManny I appreciate the call I'll be honest with you I I mean I Know it's stupid and it's a waste of energy and it doesn't matter who put the ... just put 'em on\nIt's called tradition ... maybe\nThey're selling stuff for it that's his way of communicating with the old guy the young kids are numbered as he actually I don't even know man\n\nI don't even know but if he wins it's just like great good job you're you're you're you're taking a tradition rich franchise and you're you're young it up well done man good job you where do you want to wear when you lose put the ... and where's your binder\nWhere ... you know what I mean ... got holes that the red Sox found\nThey learn how to ... they knew how to picture maybe that's part of Nineteen games you see a guy I don't know I don't know\nBut as you said last night ... and that was the one certain\nDay of the ninth inning Stanton was coming up and he was striking out if your first two guys get on that strike that was huge huge one of the advance to have what if he had a bench those runners certainly with that and how about this okay I'm going to um I'm going to go here is that Charlie out here so it\nWhy not bond with\nThat huge large expanse if Stan ... second in first base yeah why don't we ain't gonna finally figure this out you got the pitcher who is in a lather when his right arm perch okay\nLike hanging out he's got there's just no way with him falling off the mound\nThat they're expecting ... obviously Stanton is the big pop\nOr you want to hit the three run home run and tie it and people will be with bone and if we popped it up near what the hell are you doing but the red Sox are giving them an entire right side of the infield\nOnce somebody gonna ever take advantage of that toilet on base turn a line up over keep going twenty five million reasons why you can't but\n\nI Know my glasses or twenty twenty hindsight on that one but somebody at some point in a playoff game is going to have the whole side of an infielder wide open 'cause we're in this crazy ass world we're starting poor so\nThey took him out of the game I thought that was the biggest gift from the baseball gods to go to that too I Know now you're you're the red Sox relievers backed up when well Alex Cora\nBut this whole sense that even in a single line up a third time through in the baseball playoffs anymore is\nNuts you know in throne sixty five pitches what the hell do five innings I wanted to I wanted one morning at a ... he was pitching great when are\nWhen you're going to be this pendulum swing back to the good old days of playing your\nGut and just sticking with the guys and do your thing and take what you're given right and what you're given is a guy with sixty five pitches let him go\nWhat Stanton is given an and it's not just I Know this is the ninth inning but other times you see it in the fourth fifth inning get on base you see the amount of pressure that gets placed on every body when somebody gets on base in October apply the pressure\nI think that everything needs to lead the part we're going to see the horses in game one lander sales are both go deep and the game\n[noise] we have seen that before Charlie Steiner good to see you sir how are you in the morning\nI'm railing against the analytic a structure or your brother or you you're with me right you're playing to win a day and I fall into that freedom I'm just all these weird like you were ... you know and I followed your beard them plus he was trying to get around [laughter]\nCharlie Steiner my longtime friend uh the man who is going to be calling the Dodgers actions are on the radio as he has done and also on television as he has done for so many years Charlie Steiner broadcaster extraordinary and the man who bring a brought the school of broadcasting to\nBradley University correct thank you you are welcome Charlie Steiner here on the rich eyes and show when we impose a week coming up next month I look ... look we're gonna talk Dodgers and syllabus\nWildly when we come back here I dropped the words syllabus\nSleep number the sleep number bed that he's in my house gives me such a great night sleep it's not funny it's not funny when you don't get sleep as we all know my sleep number setting sixty my wife says Seventy nine out of ten couples disagree on mattress permits for good reason right but you can set your side of the bed so it's just right for both of you okay\nNew beds are so smart they sent your every move in automatically adjust to you keeping you sleeping comfortably throughout the night and if you're wondering why your favorite NFL player might be blowing up this year than in previous years because they're getting a great new a great night sleep\nAs sleep number is the official sleeping wellness partner of the national football league come in during the fall sale and save one hundred dollars\nOn the queen sleep number three sixty seat too smart but now only eight Ninety nine you'll only find sleep number at one of their five hundred and fifty sleep number stores nationwide and they will take care of you so viciously number dot com slash eyes and to find a one year as you and tell them the rich eyes and show censored Charlie Steiner when we come back\n[laughter] [laughter]\nFox Sports ... rich eyes and hear\nJust want her soccer tournament or team wants to get pizza and your on driving duty now if you're driving the Honda Odyssey with room for up to age\nThere's nothing to worry about available magic slide seats let you easily maneuver the second row accommodating almost every one then there's the available Honda sensing that'll help stop your car and keep you on the road that way her teammates parents can feel it east to\nVisit your local Honda dealer to check out the Honda Odyssey it\nTo get quality time than they are in pretty good shape scorn early Charlie\nStarting here on the rich eyes and show how as a Kennedy Jansen it does appear over the last couple of outings that the Jansen from last year is returned would you agree with that will find out together\nYou know it's been it's been a rug in year for kindly a but securing the final out in Atlanta the other night was was a big deal\nAnd again the nice thing now is disregard the previous hundred and sixty something games\nThey don't count anymore ballots a seven game series and Don Zimmer legendary would tell Joe tore once you get to this point in the season you win one inning at a time when you go to the next inning and then by the end of the night you've got a nine and a tapestry um and I think so\nIf the Dodgers are able to get to him mhm uh why not\nIt seems it's it's amazing you know you brought that up with ... and what he said it's just too old guys old school guys saying something it seems now though with the analytics world that going from eating to inning means starting\nYour bullpen and or making sure your started doesn't see the ... the line up for a third straight Tom regardless\nScore and regardless of pitch count it seems that it's just gotten a little bit over the hobby has skewed ... what is your perspective on that I ... a lot of it\nDepends on how the team is constructed and again I think the Dodgers have a better rotation than Milwaukee has I think their strength is the back end of their bullpen\n[noise] uh and how you get to the ninth inning is depended upon how you have peace your team together okay if if\nOne of the reasons why the Dodgers beat Atlanta was at ... Shaw when seven or seven or eight innings or he would always yeah and and so did you\nAnd and so if you are effective that way then fine ah I don't\nKnow that Craig council is as confident in his rotation ...\nAs as a Dave is in his uh but he has every reason to be confident with his both at the end of the day you're just look at the numbers how to get there you know they object to the games really simple beat the other guy but by at least a raw fish [laughter] I'd have to do it and then you add\nRight I mean we had our rentals on yesterday and he said that with David Robertson is Dodger line up that they essentially are all fungible with the exception of Justin Turner\nAnd ... that those two guys go to the they go to the stadium everyday knowing there and everyone else looks at their phone he says to see if he's getting they're getting attacked from from management saying you're out today or your end today\nI think it took a while in September for all of that to come together in a kudos to Andrew and far on it for free ... and they realized at the end of August\nIt was going to be a one month sprint to the finish line or and then they went out and got the phrase it already gotten Machado and Ryan ... they had to be Colorado which they did buy one\nGame game one sixty three so now here we are into the post season David Freese had a big hit or the other night and freezes a postseason hero two thousand eleven\nAnd they'll see us a MVP in the world series MVP he knows the big situation um Madsen came in the other night bases loaded one out and retired the next two and that basically ended the game and Machado is one of the top five or ten talents and the game so\nYou've got these people who now it took a while for them to understand how this these interchangeable parts were going to work and my sense is about the middle of September ... finally they all kind of bought in okay this is this is how it's going this is how it's happening\nAnd this is how ultimately it is working and I think ... I don't think there was any one given day where the Dodgers suddenly turned on the switch and okay and I'm followed me to freedom [laughter] if I can you ... you may uh but it it it was it was a gradual thing and then about the middle of September ... ten\nGame road trip up three in Colorado a\nOr is it Arizona I forget that the three in Cincinnati and finished up with fourth\nAnd in a St Louis and then after a Sunday night game we had three with Colorado it was in that period of time attend game road trip we won six out of ten and then after the road trip and that Sunday night game\nWe swept Colorado three straight at that point I got the sense that uh yeah this team is really coagulating coming together\nCharlie center here on the rich eyes and show a and the Honda insider report a few more minutes left with you sir you got a good nuke or story now that you're going to see him over the next several days weeks you you've been around some of the all time great ones\nGermany he's the only one on earth calls me ... boy Jersey Boy\nI don't know why but again he is one of the American treasures I ... have you know he was a guest on Johnny Carson more than any other guests I heard that he really was the number one Bob euchre than anybody else that\n[noise] and he he he has natural comedic timing and we had dinner few years back\nIn Milwaukee mentioned that um\nAnd I asked him about it and he said you know when he was playing he used to go to like catch a rising star or whatever the comedy joints word in New York and he would\nQuietly to stand up now I just like open Mike night there's Bob you're much you know you have Bob euchre wasn't Bobby euchre yet right but you sit with him\nWhether it's dinner visiting in the booth for a few minutes doesn't hobnobbing he is is naturally funny as any human being I've ever been around\nAnd it's a big moment for the brewers and he's I mean he's he's doing interviews after the game too I Love seeing if he's you could see like he's really pride full about what's happening with the words right now you\nKnow it it's so right yes this is he is the absolute hometown hero and there's nothing not to love about Bob ... yeah\nAnd that'll be a ... I'm I'm looking forward to this and I'll see you you take it\nThere they wouldn't be a Wednesday news update we didn't hear from Ben Roethlisberger saying few too many sentences then he probably should [laughter] then was asked about love beyond doubt coming back and what that means for James Caan are okay\nWell the good thing I'm not going to try to make that decision\nUm I ... what I Would say is um I don't think that James I don't it before the monks Joe fighting the grand later on one of the best as we all understand and agree on that\nBut what do you understand that he doesn't need it and he said the right things and and he should younger guy with a veteran off of welfare adamant but\nWhen when when later on in fact I'm no way shape or form James just say okay I'm going to back when you need me you're ... if I was wondering I I Will watch for I'm James to get as much running began because we've seen some great things from him in all phases the football\nHall [laughter] I Can't wait for levy on building come back and walk that's why you said you know hey there was shifted you remember that would be an overreaction Monday subject was ships rotted in Pittsburgh the threat\nThat's an overreaction I'm not ready to say that you know when ... comes back [noise] hey look this is what happens when you see the stage you allow somebody to succeed you also allow a locker room to rally around them and you allow somebody like Ben Roethlisberger to say\nIt's a good thing about the coach but bought\nIt goes on and says something that will now allow us to give it more oxygen that went beyond belt comes back he says he's going to lobby James Connor and James shouldn't say the right thing\nHe should come out and say I want my touches and guess what levy on bell doesn't want too much tread being put on the tire now there's a guy that has proven I can save you that tread labs\nSo its fourth quarter game on the line run around the ten minute mark you sit there with your helmet in your hand\nEye property say loving on bell will not like that\nHe doesn't want a treadmill and putting on the ... he doesn't want the Steelers to pound them into the ground because he's about to go try and make some long term money well guess what\nBe careful what you wish for because now the students could basically say we're sharing\nI don't know if he's going to like that so cute the following okay to the following may could make a make make a note because you know like predicting and I like being smart and I like giving you something to think about and I like being right\n[noise] so maybe not in that order 'em let me on bell comes back\nAnd everyone's going to start going a locker rooms James what do you think then you said that haven't you lobby ... okay wait for that\nAnd what that might bring an end gender and maybe you should come back before the Cleveland game because that's something that he can go ahead and prove that he's the difference maker that will be we age but he would be happening to come back for trade deadline\nSo let's say he comes back we nine home pretend city okay onto apartment that's Cleveland Pittsburgh a week nine I'm at Baltimore\n[noise] okay labs after the game a James Connor was in their towards the end ... bell saying I Need my touches\nThat's common oh baby\nGod Bless my town and the job that he has had ... speaking of that trade deadline Las Vegas chimed in an ... bell will be after that trade behind hits your the eagles are clubhouse favorite\nFollowed by the Steelers two to one box to box Vikings five to one raider six doing dolphin seven to one not going to the Vikings\nI mean they've gotten most dominant cooks layer was about to fall off the end and the box and the raiders and the dolphins being the the the odds on favorite right there is exactly why living on bell says I don't want to be traded I Want to stay where um where where where I Am\nBecause at least this one you will be relevant in a lead up to his walk off potentially even making the super bowl run\nYou know if the eagles want to get them I'm sure he'll be like sold but to go to Tampa\n\nInteresting the jets aren't on there I guess maybe the jets are on on their cars aircrew well is averaging twenty nine thousand yards to touch it last week\nYeah right okay so this is pretty hilarious LeBron James talking to the scrum Lakers practice yesterday talking about or what his kids drink with dinner\n[noise]\n[noise] really\nSort of drugs [laughter]\nMom's over you know\nThat was like read for dinner and the James household\nWow in California so okay\nHe went to that ... well he's he's holding but hold on a second he's kidding but I'm I'm I'm just going to interpret this having\nYounger children in my house ten seven and five um it was funny the other day my my oldest son's then uh when he saw was wearing my daily daily shirt that they gave me for Hanukkah last year talking about the beer commercials on the ... on on TV he's like\nI Swear to you he went Kavanaugh do like beer dead [laughter] and I'm like\nDo you ever see me drink a beer [laughter] what am I drink and he goes wine so he sees me and she writes drinking wine on occasion they'll get curious and I'm like do you want to step\nIt's not like I'm getting them hammered or anything like sure sure sure so Zan has had a sip of wind okay Ann Cooper has a couple of years ago when we were on vacation I had some vodka\nAnd I will handed it to then I have a video of him taking a sip of vodka I mean that's happened now you're modeling okay

fish but I've got this tasty one project veal guy guy more Kevin\nAnother thing that ... Bronner I have a comment [laughter]\nI think they know oh yeah yeah and and lastly\nUh Derek Lewis one of the heroes of you after un tuned in on twenty nine over the weekend that look here's the deal\nHaven't epic knockout have an ethic\nPost fight in rang interview with Joe Rogan just get a title shot it's been announced data white USC to thirty November third in New York City Derek Lewis and Daniel ... basing off\nDC and deal with a championship okay see I thought that was oh my God he gains a half million dollars in Instagram fall half million people and Instagram followers that was that was Rogan last question about a title fight he had a I Know IBM and says none of what he said his mentioned\nBut now we can't even believe that he needed to get on the exercise bike there he just guardian need do cardio hopefully he's working on his cardio a waitlist how to fight next month\nDo we do we get Derek Lewis on the show\nI mean I think we can disapprove tape and three days [laughter]\nI think I\nUnderstand QC situation either way again for Joe Rogan to be told\nWhy he asked him why he took his pants off and then he basically said that his manhood needed was\nA mayor rating out was hot okay and then for ... to respond to understand what that is really the next level genius all men understand it's really ... well no no I Am still do respond that way in Rhode Island like yeah yeah\nAttached to that task I understand that project got good to see you Nicole how are you been sir\nUm well my camera now on camera okay with the ... you're caught him I'm One of the worst uh potters in the world itself do I might have just hit the first one you\nMight have you did oh come on look at you your image while you're she needs to refer to ... that's the route to for three that'll get you in the hall of fame as well\nTo some of them golf I played in about a year and a half because you're hardworking mash yeah and also uh I'm In ... tigers ex wife so we just sort of way from the [laughter]\nAnd they were like you want to be in that movie with Chris wherever and Shaq and Lisa Lesley and Nate Robinson and Reggie Miller and I was like yeah I Want to I Want to hang out with all of those needs all\nAnd I want to talk smack and I want to like you know 'cause I was at the ... I was at the ... I was a Knicks fan growing up I was at the Knicks Pacers games\nI was at that game on Reggie went off on spy on why in the next yeah all of New York yeah I was there and I was like you know a kid ... watching my dreams crumble in front of me sort of be on the bench as the opposing coach watching Reggie try to try to heat up and not and not hitting some theories\nAnd just the Mac in a way it was so fun and that was you know this was this that was last summer carry the traded just gone down it was a fascinating time to be around someone who was\nSo deeply at the center of his above the basketball universe and\nAnd and and then and then for me just being able to hang out with Shaq I mean I'm sure you've hung out with a ...\nHe is he is there are certain people you're like well you're so talented so you get to you know people are interested in what you have to say but there he's deeply charismatic like there's something about that guy and he was really sweet and nice and would happily chat with me or a chat with the PA or whoever he just was\nRemarkable he really is as I Know I mean I mean he's ... he's one of my favorite people have gotten a maintenance because yeah me too\nI I really like he's also like\nHe scaled up like twenty five percent you know you can like scale of photo you drag the corner and it just like makes it like the same he's scaled up version of a regular size person and I think is is that like I think it's a duty who's been that large his whole life right is trying to figure out how to put a room at ease\nFrom the day from like probably the age of ten on and and he's got an incredibly\nGood interesting that's an interesting way to look at it and the crow here on the show so did you give Reggie the satisfaction of telling him that you were in a house yet moment\nI did and he got a real kick out yeah why did you feed that these you know it was sort of like I was like a you know it you know for me it was just like I got I got to be honest the man I was at that game and he was like oh do you know for him it's a pleasant memories [laughter]\nI don't know if I drop the same on Patrick a downside reviewing I'd probably leave him alone or but it you know I it was it was really fun and I get to play a little ball I mean not well but I get to play a little bit with those guys and now you\nDid do that 'cause I Know you played high school basketball yeah did you really get out there and yeah we pick up\nIn the end of the movie we get in the game in in real and ah and but we got in there and we had some free play and I have like a ... a breakaway lay up and and and Kyrie wanted to block it and he didn't get it\nAnd I was like a score you know I basically I mean I just sat score to uncover it would be extending it but but then I was like All right I'm feeling good let's go play some day and I tried to de up Kyrie and um that might have been a mistake or\nIn across you over you know I didn't fall down I take I take I take great solace in like he didn't break my ankle I didn't fall down he ... he did manage to get buy me a\nDown economy I'm\nJust maybe okay but um it was so fun it was great I mean it's just like it was just a dream to be able to get on the court with those guys and and even to play with them but to just be on the court when you are at when you see what they're doing because then we had all these others who are all like college players who were all the extras and other guys\n... when you're that close to those folks watching them play and then watching like\nKyrie you know you watch them do like labs you watch the spin he's putting on things he's doing some scientific like geometry stuff that's unbelievable and you're watching like Lisa Lesley watch him and you're watching these ... like learn from each other a was really cool and Chris Weber in this movie is Larry up hilarious\nHe is so funny in this movie and that was he was another guy for me 'cause I you know I came up watching that that fab five team was\nYeah she gave me a ... glow wow so that must have been I watch you know how you watch a sporting a documentaries ... over again\nEvery time I Hope that he doesn't call the time I Know he does every time he does it every time by but it's it's a shame that that is what obviously you know ... gets brought up because of what he has done since then and how we handle that ... yeah and he
