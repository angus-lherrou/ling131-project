and we went off to the Philippines revolution torn Philippines and we shot platoon\nAnd it felt like you were at work\nOr I did a three week boot camp I'm In revolution torn manila ... and then we started shooting the film largely in sequence which is unheard of so as people's characters died they left\nAnd so that started out eight times three is twenty four so it started out with twenty four of us um and then by the end of it there's three or four of us left and that that ah diminishes how much the actors have to act\nBecause everyone is gone you don't have to act like they're gone they're gone and so the lens suffers if you can reduce the pro funded he of ally in front of the lens\nIt it experiences that is good acting and so the way all of her set it up the arc of people's stay in the Philippines\nWas dictated by when you die in the script and because you shot it almost chronologically as you die you left\nAnd so the actors who are left at the end of the film of\nThe those long faces and that and that fear in people's eyes because there was a a threatened to every Thursday because the president did not have the military in her back pocket a woman named Korea

to this day he nailed that one\nAlternative tours any toward that film out of his stardom I remember when we got home the base hit and what people were experiences as a as a war movie was top gun which was kind of a Reagan error celebration of\nOf of mechanical war and that's not what we shot and so when we got home and top gun was the big kid\nYou know we we largely concluded that that would wasted about four months of our lives and then it turns out that all over it's going to release it at Christmas and nothing says critical my platoon there's nothing says Christmas like full moon\nAnd

Maryland left the Atlantic coast conference it's it's home for so many years and and the place where so many of its fans um identified with they have their rivals they they knew who they were they won the national championship under Gary Williams they had a football program\nOn her another ... that they can be proud of\nThey've left for the Big Ten because they were so financially strapped they said that they needed they essentially needed the money and I would argue that\nWhen they left the Big Ten they they've lost their identity they've lost their way\nI'm not saying that the move to the Big Ten um\nKilled Jordan McNair but I think you can stitched together a line of thinking that they needed to make decisions based on financial realities\nUm and that put them in a position where a DJ dark and character\nIs running a program in which it's own administration that infighting it's not overseeing the program properly\nUm they're chasing in their own division and the Big Ten Ohio State Penn State and Michigan which realistically they had no business fighting with a on a week to week or your air bases in the sport of football they don't have the facilities they don't have the money\nThey don't have a history they don't have the tradition to keep up with that with that a lot um and then you get\nTo a point where if they read they can't\nFire you take ... um the buyout as north of ... million and and that for the University of Maryland athletics department at this point is\nA lot of money Kevin Plank fodder under our her and a former Maryland football player could write that check if he wanted to tell me that Kevin plant was not on board with the dark and being out and must have been on board with Kate there can be eating in or he would get a coach at Maryland anymore no\nKidding wow so that's the money aspect of it Barry ... of the Washington Post columnist younger which on the show so what\nWhat happens now bearing I mean uh the pleasure couple of players walked out were seen on on social media they do not accept him as their coach\nOh and there's going to be a demonstration on campus or a wall is low just to to make sure that I get it all out here I asked if it came down if we did come down to ... him his full response was quote I've accepted the recommendations in full of the board of regents which sounds like something out of\nA mainstream candidate so what what what happens here very they just you know it's\nSo amazing that you figure the decision on the football coach at the athletic director would be the end um and the start of something new and and because they left everybody in the same physicians that infrastructure of\nThe department and the school is the exact same as it was when George McNair died I'm In a way I think we're just beginning um\nIt remains to be seen how many players will will show up and play on Saturday against Michigan State um it remains to be seen how DJ dark and staff feels about this entire operation um I think we haven't heard you know we're starting to hear from the leadership a state of\nMaryland um I think some heavy hitters voices like Tom McMillan the former all\nOr can basketball player in Maryland or bend an operative in state in us politics or a former house of representatives stamper um you you were probably waiting to hear from from those people but you know at what point is it appropriate question for DJ dark and\nHey thirty six you know what do you feel like seemed hills best ability as a rollout passer is in ... in that situation I mean where does that ever going to be appropriate to ask them\nBasic football question it's too big at this point and and it might be too even though he's been reinstated\nIt really might to pay for him to win back is in\nFact incoming recruits that's a whole separate story how can you\nHow could a five star crew there have auctions listen to this guy and his living room and say you could go to Penn State I Know you could go to Georgia I Know you could go to ...

I don't know I mean the so you know we were ... and I think it would do that it's good to have a\nState that support for the state game but uh\nThat might not happen and then we'll see what happened afterwards that all of this is like I said in some ways started at ... today and it starts at ... or whether they come in to a close\nFriend and does do is uh James Brady the board of regents chairman feel like okay so we're going to implement all of the recommendations of the findings in the investigation\nAnd the one who's going to implement them uh is the same coach um and the same athletic director and we're good you know what we're doing let's let's so let's go beach party like is he really does that got really think that for real\nIt to five it defies logic and and that's why I think it's important now\nTo to not make this about the problems in the Maryland football program or the the infighting and Marilyn athletic department this is a stain on the university as a whole um because the people that oversee it thought that fundamental\nChange was needed and whether they want to parse the definition of toxic or say you know your dark and hadn't created a quote toxic culture um they are pinning their hopes and pinning their future\nA guy that is fundamentally flawed and and don't let Damon ... off here either I mean his job before he was the interim athletic director was to directly oversee football\nHe was either ... ignorant of what was going on there\nOr didn't care knew the practices that dark and was putting in place a thought they were appropriate I'm over so caught up with the in fighting a and backstabbing with his his boss Kevin ... he was distracted\nOr some of all three of those things and to to put him back into place to\nLead an athletic director of that I'm Sorry not flooded department that needs a full aren't turnaround\nIs is an extension of of the sick joke um I I really am astonished that we're having these conversations today I'm\nJust to make sure ... just last one for you bury 'em\nJust to make sure 'cause uh I I Want to make sure buttoned up fair balanced however you want to put it there are some players in in in a region sent boosters and and players who are pro Dirk and right it's not like it's the entire\nStudent body in in locker room against him right he has some supporters I'd love to watch\nWhat was it easy a nice guy a good guy and I I mean like trying to figure out what what we're that comes from\nWell I yeah I mean I think it is important to note that not only some players are supportive but but some players families are supportive and and that's that's important to do it I mean I I Believe this is the black and white issue but I understand why why people people do because\nIf he some evil how would any of the of the players I'm supporting my question would be um you know there there are two sides to every argument how many is too many players in players families thought the environment was ill suited and and um and really kinda sick\nOr before you say we have to remove this guy um I don't think that this is one that's the\nStraight vote and the majority just carry the day I I think that the dark and within a position that he had a clue that he was a unifier not a divider and I think there are things that that in that report and things in the ... by colleagues have done um in terms of\nHow he created a caste system a path and ... on that and really tried to warn people off from from the team if he thought they were a contributing um I think that there's enough there that even with support from significant people she should not be in the position that he's returning to today\nWell berries removed from the Washington Post notice we uh we looked around over the last twenty four hours is our staff and our bookers in like who's the person who can come from the mid Atlantic region who's covered this who can give voice in and let\nEverybody know what's going on there um and ... and people who are fellow colleagues of yours in our in our business all said you all pointed towards used we appreciate your calling in\nCyprus I appreciate it but that's a ... of the Washington Post into an ...
