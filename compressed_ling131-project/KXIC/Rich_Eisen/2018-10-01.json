the backfield throwing the ball down the field I Believe is a special combination in the NFL is going to have to get used to them and tried to take them out of the game what they're going to have success against the freeze is having a bad start to a season he's ever had\nGot control got both feet down and the officials on the field ruled that he kept long enough and they stayed with it so they're doing that which I think you know brings in common sense and stays with what the officials call it\nSo I Hope that's the case and like you say we're we're one game away from being completed and weak for and and and I don't know what we're going to talk about if in fact is roughly in the past year thing goes away\nWell as long as there's a the Cleveland Browns versus the Oakland Raiders tied yeah there'll be lots to discuss my prayer or what do you say to browns fans and this morning based on what was what happened yesterday\nWell you know I I [noise] I struggled overnight with this um you know because from our studios we kind of pretty strongly said that it shouldn't have been reversed um but when I went back and looked at the warning again and we're talking about the measurement that took the first down away has\nMade it short and forced upon when a when essential if it would have stayed the first down they could have run out the clock I'm\nI think he's short I mean I I look at the live shot the line feed as we call it and in some ways you have to piece it together but you know the first thing that hits the foreman elbow and to me\nHe's not at the Nineteen yard line where he needs to get and so I even though I went on a\nI went on the air and Cleveland today and talked about how I didn't feel there was enough to overturn it and you know we were talking about angles Howard Dean's talking about angles would this angle you know it makes the store to hear it but it's the line feed the ... shot right down the line and\nI think I Would say the Cleveland although you got burned on a fumble call where they ruled a quarterback was in like grass um and that was not a good call Baker Mayfield was hit in the head and the end of the game that wasn't called and should have been called but when it comes to the to the measurement thing\nI mean I think New York at it right\nWell I mean let let's let's just take it one at a time here I mean I I couldn't tell anything that was clear an obvious to to overturn a first down call my ...\nYou were here with me right now and I got to show you the video frame by frame I think I could convince you and I think I can convince you fairly easily\nOkay so then let's uh let's play that one aside um the uh in the grass call if we as a chief fans will will will always mentioned last playoff game Brian uh and then this call from yesterday why can't replace day okay\nIt was blown dead but it's so obvious that the ball came out and it was obvious that the ball came out on the other side of humanity did Walt Anderson couldn't see it\nWhy can't they give the ball to Cleveland after\nIt was a clear recovery by Cleveland when that came out I mean I have a way the return em\nI think maybe this is your eyes and point for this year if they rule in the grass\nAnd if you have actual clear and obvious video that the ball is out before he's even in the grasp\nWhich was the case um maybe you ought to be able to review that I could I could get behind that now if he's being wrapped up by somebody and and then the ball comes out no matter how quick it is then that's a different story but in this case\nIn this case I mean there was not progress was ruled it was in the grasp and nobody had 'em in the grass and the ball was out and uh I I ... I think I ... the although I'm not a proponent of adding plays the instant replay\nUm I think that might be one I Would consider consider adding if in fact the ball is out before the quarterback is actually in anybody's grass then maybe replay could turn it over and if there is\nThe recovery and the immediate action him after the play then give the ball the defense I support that actually\nCame Ike so well what do we do with this now\nAnd there's gotta be looked at him and you get to play done you got yeah you got the catch things done check that box\nThis this this may be maybe isn't well it's big and this particular\n... maybe it's not as tough but I was a huge\nIn last year's playoffs Mike ...\nYou know I I Know but in in ... I I agree now I'm not\nI mean that one was even a ruling a forward progress which there was no they'd be if the balls out before there was any for progress I think I I you know it becomes a bit I I kind of agree it becomes a bit of a cop out to be a you know if you're on the field you could just say hey I'm going to root for progress and then it can't be reviewed\nI'm a I'm I'm I think I'm jumping into your bandwagon\nOkay All right so we're going to do that what else am I missing before I let you go Mike that do you think the first four weeks we're not discussing or the NFL front office is discussing that hasn't reached ... ... as an affected a win loss or a major first down\nI'll tell you what's interesting to me as we all talked about the new for new referees and the adjustments that they're gonna have to make and and how it's going to be difficult for them but the problem so we're discussing there with the veterans they're not with the new guys in\nThem and I find that kind of fascinating that the\nThe youngsters so to speak have seemed to develop really pretty quickly and so um you know I'm Still looking at the game and I'm seeing certain officials that certain referees but I Do think it's time that they really consider retirement um whether it's voluntary or maybe a mandatory\nBut I think based on how the young guys are are\nPerforming you know maybe it's time for another set of new guys to occupy that position okay\nAnd where it's at these days he's there I mean he's a consultant now so he's making a decision making the rounds talking about what roughing the patch or as I remember I remember him saying to me before he left when I leave I'm not I don't want\nAnything to do with the NFL I'm going to get my motor home and drive around the country and now I read about him trying to defend the robbing the passer calls as the\nLeague officiating department consultant so he really hasn't\nTom I Want oh she's still in the ... is not gone away\nAll right Mike I appreciate [laughter] let's chat again soon that will send you your guy that's my\nPrayer Fox Sports that my ...
