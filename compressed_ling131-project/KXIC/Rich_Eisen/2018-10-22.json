Texas Georgia Oklahoma and Florida are in between Michigan and UCF as six to nine and Georgia at seven plays Florida at nine this weekend that's the marquee matchup on\nCBS coming up on Saturday So you'll see that\nAnd uh Alabama LSU in Michigan are off Clemson takes on Florida State and Notre Dame takes on navy\nUpset minded individuals no doubt taking on two and three now the reason why I'm spending all this up is the following so Michigan has been on a run chase\nOne of which who is uh the long haired pass Russia for the uh Michigan will range has been pointing out that it's a it's it's it's revenge time they're settling all family business like the end of the godfather right now\nAnd the only question is will Penn State\nAnd Ohio State lined up on the on the old\nCourthouse steps if you will like the end of a under the godfather will end up like gummy a on a massage table in Vegas\nAll family business get settled for Michigan let's say Michigan does in fact do that that's a very tall order\nCertainly winning and the horseshoe despite Ohio State losing at Purdue if you don't think our states that can be all amped up and whatever else them in Perdue will not held them vent and if you think what elder Notre the Ohio State at Purdue is part and parcel and the fact that Nick Bolsa\nDecided to leave the team and I heard that a lot over the last twenty four forty eight hours emanating from Big Ten circles\nThat Mick boats are deciding this past week to say I'm not coming back\nAnd I'm leaving the team in order to get ready for my next level shook them to their\nCore to the point where what they ... they gave up twenty eight to Purdue in the fourth quarter alone\nIf you think a lot of states not going to be ... ready for that game and everything that al them and they couldn't get done right and Purdue on Saturday Night if you don't think those are those boats will be tightened by the time the big game rolls around you are out of your mind so let's just say Michigan does all that\nYou know they're going to have to do go to a big tent championship game and take on most likely Wisconsin again\nPut a pending that for a moment Alabama\nTakes on LSU at LSU when they come off there by Alice use on by two so they're all rested and ready to go both teams will be ready to go into buy you Alabama's last game of the season because they face Mississippi State the citadel\nAnd the iron bowl will be in their house\nSo while Alabama have to do if Alabama runs a table or will they get for that table running a game against with all due respect to the gators\nWho will have to go between the edges one of the ... and other feed at Alabama or take on Georgia in the S. E. C. championship game you see what I'm picking up on what I'm putting down is backing up my call for a year plus now\nOf more playoff games that matter\nWho the hell cares about a Big Ten championship game and an S. E. C. championship game under these circumstances\nAlabama lucked out last year not having to play in that game Alabama should lose to LSU I'm not saying they should purposely go into a game of tank it but even if they lose the LSU\nWhat's the big deal they're bloody up they went out the rest of the way and not let let but unless you go into the S. E. C. championship game and take on Georgia or Florida\nThem try it out [noise]\nWhat are they doing Alabama should lose the game now I Know what\nThat does is just set up all sorts of uncertainties and that you went out you play every game you when you control your own destiny\nBut come on what's the point of winning all out and then take on Georgia\n'cause every conference won a bloody up their best chance\nTo send somebody to the national championship game or destroy a team's national championship hopes in a meaningless eighties meaningless championship game when these championship games all began to form\nFor whatever monetary purposes they were formed for\nThe idea was made me some Cinderella would get\nCrowned right some team that didn't do very well during the season or did well enough\nBut not good enough to maybe when it all out right during the regular season if it was back in the day and everyone is doing the same mix\nTo try and make a bowl game that that Cinderella would have a chance to knock off an opponent and then\nGet into the national championship conversation those days are over folks just because of team comes out of nowhere and wins a championship game and slaves\nGoliath that David not getting a birth to the national championship dance for\nI didn't happen\nIt would be compelling if you've got an automatic birth to in eight team conversation than those games would be really significant\nAnd whoever won those games as an underdog would get a spot in the dance to keep going\nNow you're just going to basically bloody up an opponent or destroy their chances for what\nWhy wouldn't Michigan after having curves dumped Wisconsin at home have to put it on the line against an opponent again\nIf they are in that spot by beating Michigan State Penn State Ohio State and Wisconsin why and why would Alabama if\nThey run the table and take on every ... ISI calmer with the exception of Georgia has to play Georgia for what for what\nBecause that's the crucible that they need to go through an extra game that means is zero\nIf they're undefeated in Georgia has one loss because Georgia couldn't go undefeated during the SEC championship during the SEC regular season they get a chance to knock off Alabama\nWhy\nFor stupid game it means nothing except enriching people\nAte for far too old for rich number to do Peter King when we come back here on the rich eyes and show the cowboys situation the jaguar situation and what was the bus that the Sean Watson was on\nWas he just and it was he in a middle seat there are no middle seats right was he in the Iowa window next to Jimmy McGill [laughter] as he was going to these rural spots in Louisiana mailing than the post letters yet [laughter]\n[noise] on his way to becoming so good man a good man that's next year and the rich as in show\n[noise] live stream is a great partner of the rich eyes and show because it allows me to tell you if you got good credit it can be put to work for you in a way that no other credit cards allow\nBecause light stream offers credit card consolidation loans from six point one four percent a PR with auto pay and you can get a loan right now from five thousand to one hundred thousand dollars\nAnd even get your ... as soon as the day you apply because light streamed believes that people with good credit deserve a great interest rate and no fees plus their division of sun trust bank one of the nation's largest\nFinancial institutions so you can have complete peace of mind\nAnd my listeners and viewers can save even more with an additional interest rate discount on top of light streams already low rates but you have to go to light stream dot com slash rich to get that\nL.

Jerry Jones or you know he's going to really have to be slapped in the face this is a guy who kept saying coach to treat your three six and ten years remember and so I I just I'm not convinced\nThat this is it I think it's I think as I say it's more likely than not if they finished under five hundred that this is it but it's not a certainty\nBy and then there next to games are on national television Monday Night or home against Tennessee and then\nAt Philadelphia on Sunday Night Football so it's ... it's a region only going to get hotter or the seat if there are no wins in Philadelphia I Know we could just chalk it up to a hangover that's what we usually do a when a team doesn't play very well after winning the super bowl were played consistently\nBut what what can you put a finger on with what's happened with Philadelphia as we're getting set to see them in London next week\nI think there's a couple of things number one I think that\nThat Carson went isn't being protected the way he was a year ago a you know the offensive line just seems to be leaky here than it was a year ago or even with Peter's back I mean that's number one number to remember last year was a running back by committee with a bunch of good backs\n'em you know now with jai go on a I think that is that's hurtful [noise] um and then you know I also think that is secondary should be better\nThen it's then it's played I mean how many rows and spent a lot of draft capital and I'll give you Sidney Jones and the Seventeen drafting the second round ... he's a legitimate\nTwelve or fourteen picking that draft he is not come back and played anywhere near\nA you know very top NFL corner level so I think you're able to throw the ball down the field on them um and and again look yesterday\nUh [noise] you know the last touchdown ... the Philadelphia Eagles usually don't get full on a simple play like that when you're not watching for gray goals and to leak out from the line\nOr from the one yard line knowing that the Philadelphia Eagles are it can't really trust\nThe power running game of the of the Panthers maybe as much as they could have a few years ago when it was when they were more of a power running team\nYou know say told bird and Williams I I mean you got to be watching for Greg ... on that play ... and they just let them go like [noise]\nPeter King Rosario sorry Peter I would say that that that was that really kind of bugs me about the eagles\nSo when I see the eagles as I called the game with my NFL game day morning crew on Sunday and London against the jaguars who's starting quarterback for Jacksonville do thing\nPeter ... a man and [laughter]\nI Know there are saying they should pounded table you're pounding the table for that ... oh\nI I mean look look I\nI uh I Would I Would just say I would just say this that my gut feeling you know but my gut feeling is they'll give ... another game because they don't really have much of an alternative\nBut portals confidence has to be at its nit deer right now uh because clearly when you hear Jay Leno Ramsey say everybody knows what the problem is in here we just can't say it\nI mean that is that's at dagger through the heart if I ever heard one I mean what do you do if you're around and cough when you got Jay Leno Ramsey I mean the ... you say wait a while actually pay you an extra million a year if you know comment everything the rest of the\nYear [laughter] you know on a ...\nIt's ... it's just amazing what what he's what he's doing but but I I you know I don't know\nI Would I guess I Would start portals\nAnd I mean to me the absolute Hitler for this team is not having for net to take over games eat it you know I'm not saying he take over a game against the Philadelphia front but he would at least\nGive you a fighting chance to be able to run the ball confidently against Philly which is going to be hard for Jacksonville so I I think it will be ... but I don't have any insight information on it or really\nAnd then in that game ah the Texans really put put it on a Jacksonville I mean if you want to if you want to come out and say that that that was for all the AFC South to win that game on the road to put the doubt into this team as deep as it could be\nA the quarterback position was remarkable certainly in fact as Glazer reported a during the pre game shows yesterday that the Sean wants and took a bus and you put a lot more meat on the bones I got glazier tomorrow what type of boss was it was it like a regular he bought it when we went down\nIt was it to her it was a tour bus I talked to I talked to Watson yesterday it was like a band to her boss you know a a smaller one there were six people on it or to drivers security guy uh ... uh one of the trainers\nUm and then there was that the director of sports performance Luke Richardson who kind of stretched and treated I'm a ... watt sent along the way they stopped at a flemings in Baton Rouge for dinner\nA friday night on the way there and got into the hotel in Jacksonville about nine o'clock or\nA Saturday morning and I asked the the Texans is okay it's convenient this week\nBecause their home on Thursday night and then he gets to rest for for ten days before they play Denver and I asked about you know Denver's a little bit further Denver's almost exactly a thousand miles Houston\nBut uh I guess the doctors have told them that that it should certainly be healed by the time they go to Denver for him to fly\nThere so he's not in the back room of a greyhound leaning up against the window rather than not not everybody's talking at um you know I mean it's it's not that's not what I said if\nIt was a bus trip like planes trains and all\nThe way you know\nIf you're going the wrong way [laughter] you know\nI doubt there was that much of a hardship because clearly he's got the ability to to stretch out\nOn a comfortable bed at or whatever way sleep if he wants to and he's got all the video he can watch he told me that he was watching TV and watching tapes so so do you take it probably like lazy friday night at home with a free dinner is slamming\nDid he take it back to yes huh yeah as a matter of fact I wrote this morning rich that if\nYou read his column early\nOr that or the Sean Watson is probably on a bus on his bus\nSomewhere in east Texas a couple of uh I'm getting home to use\nA few more minutes left here with Peter King a it's amazing Peter out things work with the ravens and bring those losses the Steelers now lead the AFC North coming out of there by week\nTaking on Cleveland it's now time to throw the spotlight back on loving on bill with the trade deadline coming up next Tuesday how do you see it all playing out here with loving on Peter\nRanch I talked to two teams over the weekend that I thought might be interested in trading for bell but the biggest issue that they saw a both teams saw this\nThat let's say for example they could find some way reasonably to pry levy on bell loose like trading the three and a five\nAnd he could be on the team the rest of the year\nWell you know it's clear that the agent and bell want to maximize his contract in two thousand Nineteen\nSo there's no guarantee it all that he would just say at the end of the season\nHey team ex let's make the best deal we can they don't want to do that they want to make the best deal they can with one of thirty two teams are thirty one team's not with your team necessarily so uh you know let's say for the sake of argument that you can't get a contract and well obviously you're going to franchise\nAnd then or transition them at least and then you're in the exact same situation he was in this year\nIs even get a report to you\nSo you're almost it's so hard to trade for knowing that you might only have him on your team because you can't you probably are not putting them in a line up this week or next week you might only have him on the team for like seven games\n... do I mean it's it's all I I Can't see the Steelers being able to trade them unless it's an absolute total dumb job you know like they trade them for three or something like that I just I I Can't\nSee it and then they they take on the browns 'em and Hugh Jackson says he wants to take control of the ... more that that's his area of expertise and this is the week that they go back to taught Haley's old shop I mean\nHow is that conversation going down with Tom Haley and Hugh Jackson for a team that's to foreign one right now where this\nTo the rich are\nKelly [noise]\n\n\nA job a quid the big three Ron

whose last name was\nBowl the world's toughest anti opposite ends Welch as tough as grapes you see\nWhat I heard him is there any chance [noise] from\nYahoo Sports for Hispanics blood you take out of that game last nicer\nA Lakers are kind of right now what I thought the the um they they have firepower [noise] um but they can't shoot threes and they don't offend so [laughter] I don't know how many games you win in the western conference\nUm the injuries were decimated by their their football team at Michigan is that the dealing with anywhere near the amount of injuries that Michigan State is although two of their better if not the\nBest players on their team or not playing ... black was not back yet it wide receiver and was shot area was uh not playing at the ... event so um but I Will I Will say and I know I'm going off it a little different direction but rich go forward I Believe what I said\nDuring the broadcast and I was speaking to Michigan fan I think you guys have been waiting since late nineties to to hear that it's real\nAnd I think it was kind of real two years ago and you were in a position\nThat may be beat Ohio State and go to the you know big tent championship and that at that compete for a playoff spot but this feels different to me it feels more well rounded I I feel like it's a better team\nI feel like the weakest link of the team right now is still quarterback play and yet he's got a lot of room for growth and and there's a lot of potential there 'cause he's still a very skilled player\nA and shape Patterson and that's what\nThis is real from Michigan I think that they're absolutely the favorite in the Big Ten I felt that before last week\nI was saying that on several different outlets and Ohio State prove me right 'cause I saw them two weeks ago they've got a lot of holes and\nRight now Michigan is the best team in the Big Ten\nI think if they win the conference with only one loss they're going to be in college football player\nI Want to get to that in a second job out here and there were chosen show what what what is wrong with Ohio State will I mean how how how did Saturday Night develop a based on what you just said when you saw them a couple of weeks ago Joe\nYeah exactly how they have been playing a of late and and namely there's only one thing that they're doing as the elite level which is throwing the football\nAnd you can't win like that there's a reason as much as he would bristle at the ... there's a reason that Mike Leach has never even won his own division rich\nThere's a reason because in this sport you still have to be a complete team to win championships whether that's the division championship a conference championship or national championship all these passing numbers are all well and good\nThey're all well and good but what does it come down to to beat Georgia to beat 'em a team like Alabama or Clemens in or even Oklahoma what are you gotta do patrol the game on the ground there is a reason Georgia beat Oklahoma last last year\nSo if that's the only thing you can do you've gotten major issues and right now Ohio State out playing quality defense they're losing the Russian game battle on almost a game a game out based in particular yards per rush\nThey're giving up way too many big plays in fact last week coming into that game against Purdue they had given up twenty two plays of thirty or more yards which was the worst in college football\nOr their man coverage is not quite as good on that defense aside and they cannot run the ball that was their fourth street game they average under three arts for Kerry that's\nA huge line of demarcation just to give you a sense of how important that three arts for Kerry is Michigan under Jim ... thirty foreign oh when they average three arts or more per Kerry during a game their oil and twelve when they average under that three arts for Kerry per game so\nIt it is a major major thing at Ohio State is not doing it very well and the thing that is alarming a lot of people is it there five often says Lyman would probably start pretty much everywhere in the country\nYou know if you took the five often says Lyman they're playing against at Purdue and that their five often climate you take all five of the house said often says Lyman well before you would take any five of the produce officers live in and that's why it's so alarming for people\nWell when you saw urban I mean Dan Patrick how to chat with her street earlier and his they echoed what a lot of people are talking about that he doesn't look right literally physically\nThat whatever went down with him and um you know the inquiry or whatever might be ... to cause him to take that medication that affected his memory according to the\nInquiries a findings did you find urban okay based on what moms on him\nI felt like there there was something there um I think that the week before we had him remember he went down to in the middle of the game with that headache and had to be attended\nTo and you know and and when I went in and saw them that next week I saw him on Thursday said he was known okay that he's got to take you know the the medication and he doesn't like taking the medication when I saw him on friday you know I it wasn't\nThe same urban that I meet with on a week in week out basis all you know when I go in there on friday it just wasn't the same you could you know when you can tell when someone sitting in front of you and they've got something physically bothering them doesn't some pain\n... you know and it's and I you could tell and he even you know rubbed his head a couple of times and ... was one thing a little bit more than I thought he was um or than he normally is so yeah I think that there is some truth to that and certainly Kirk\nYou know knows that program and knows him a exceptionally well and and I saw the same as Kirk has\nA couple more things left with Joe ... you're on the rich eyes and show on I'm going to hit you with what I\nKind of hot checked at the second hour was LSU and all of a Alabama playing each other\nWhy wouldn't it benefit Alabama to lose this game because that would take the maybe out of an S. E. C. championship appearance against the into Georgia or Florida and then making one lost their way into the final four 'cause how are they going to keep valid I'm Out of it seriously and the fact that Michigan goes on this run like you just witnessed\nAnd potentially let's just as a big if beat Penn State beat Ohio State they got to face Wisconsin again I Know you've got that game so that their business interests in a little bit here but\nI ... what are we doing here with these yeah China agent contests I ...\nI agree wholeheartedly with what your sentiment as my son has always been at that we should reward only teams that win their conference championship I\nThought that this play out in its creation was totally undermined\nBy the FCC and its creation and quite frankly the rest of the

deserving as soon as you say for most deserving you can say that you have to win their conference championship in order to be considered by the playoff committee that's\nThe only fix that we need in this whole thing or create it's much more value in order last year on the game like the iron bowl because last year as I Am all didn't matter at all in fact it penalize ... because they had to go in

your local Honda dealer today the Honda Odyssey what do you have over there are I'm Sorry\nWhat this just because it's hilarious to me so the browns lost another game yesterday in overtime\nTheir fourth overtime game this year\nThey scored twenty three points it's a fairly decent off into the output maybe not in today's high powered game but after the game Hugh Jackson went to the podium and said that he's sick of watching is often struggle yet again another slow start inconsistencies\nAnd said quote I feel like I have to and I want to this is what I Know so I'm not going to continue and

no chips left no cards left to play and I know Todd\n... means sun about guns sometimes\nAnd I know he really wants to have all full control of the ... particularly as he goes back to the spot where
