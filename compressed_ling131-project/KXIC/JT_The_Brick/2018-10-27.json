young players\nBut but they're playing at a pro ball high level and I think that that's a big difference when I was here before we had great players I'm obviously we put quite well and then I also think that the defense has been playing a lot better\nUm even when I was in Baltimore watching them defensively do most of the findings are a lot better defense live there and I think you know when you can play that up a copy editor football with your special teams and it gives you a chance to work out\nAnd this year a you know a lot of people thought what happened to the same last year was just ... and that they would have better teams should have made the super bowl and that you guys are off to a great start\n... does it feel like that in the locker room I Know you weren't there last year but just to feel like you got something special going this year with the way things are\nWell you know as a player and being a player for a while now you you're only as good as you perform on Sundays and so I've never been one um and most of the great coaches that I've had and they're going to say a was a fluke thing look those things happen but the game that we play we get one chance a week\nAnd so if you get into a playoff situation and you don't play with other Sunday for whatever reason even if you make the team nine times you didn't deserve to win on that Sunday and so\nThat's an important feeling and understanding that have because it makes you go into every game I understand that you could get beat by anybody on any Sunday um if they play and there are more prepared to play than you are no matter what your talent level is so I I think that we understand that collectively\nUm I think that going into every game will we understand as we prepare during the week for every

I think they win this game but certainly with the point\nI'm going with the raven that defense I'm going to take the ravens is the reason that their favorites on the road because of their defense and I'm going to go with the Baltimore\nAre I Move on game number three it is the pig skin pick off we are a couple of Fox Sports radio the Redskins traveling up to New Jersey to take on the giants what exit also giants get this guy's one point favorites on this one with their one went on the season Rob Parker who do you like in this one I'm\nTaking a gym in ... I think that ah there's a reason again sometimes you throughout the records when you're talking about a ... and the giants Redskins and being up enjoys the or I'm going to take the giants that or is it will be ugly ugly when but they'll win\nThis scares me a little bit because the giants they aren't going to lose every game going forward they're going to win at some point but the Redskins are playing for a lot more than the giants giants just half pride left I think and the Redskins are thinking division titles so I don't think they're going to let up I'm going with the Redskins\nOr are we move on now I don't know if you guys heard though Aaron Rodgers is the biggest underdog and his career this Sunday in Los Angeles had gone the undefeated LA Iran's rams nine point home favorites that's a big number Chris who do you like and that is a huge number\nCanada disrespectful to Aaron Rodgers but I I Know they're the rams look terrific but they have had some close calls and again they're not going to feed it they're going to stumble at some point so I'm going with the Packers whether they win or lose I don't think they get beat by nine or more\nPlus what I'm saying I mean how disrespectful to a Raj to think that he should be nine points on the dog to the rams guy you know we get rams all the credit that they deserve but this one I'm actually pulling that the Packers are going to upset the rent\nOr our last one here in the ... pick off you are a couple of Fox Sports radio the game of the week Sunday Night Football is a rematch of last season's playoff game Drew Brees and the same traveling up to Minnesota to take on Kurt ... and the Vikings it's basically a pick up here on this one because the Vikings are only one point home favorites\nRob Parker who do you like [noise]\nI'm going to take the saying in this game in Minnesota I Know the Vikings are playing better saints are still what did they only got a one loss right same night playing great so I'm going I'm going to take the states in this game that's the reason most teams are three point\nOf favorites at home automatically so that the idea that they're just one point tells you a lot about what they think about the same I'm going to go with the saints and an upset\nI think the Vikings are playing much better um I think the science or do for a law and so I Am going with Minnesota\nAnd there it is

league the cares about getting kicked out of the game\nBut we're just trying to you know add extra things you know people fought for years to get the point where it was an option\nAdded the fantasy football and now most would hate it because of the four catches do yeah I mean a lot of people hate it so it's starting to go back the other way but we can get bonus points for a guy getting adjusted and the bonus points on top of that because he's in a suit come on that's that's the next level\nOkay if you could do that that's a that's a that's a week that the actually the whoever gets the first or ever than when you're a week because the one shot deal right\nThat is probably the only job but I actually don't ... it was going to be the first of many\nYou know if there's a brawl if if a clearing brawl and you'll still couldn't help come go see this happen before\nAll right I'll I'll go to Iraq research step on that one as we take a look at tomorrow's games that we saw Miami lose tonight to Boston College to suddenly turn over chain is not nearly what it was a year ago but tomorrow obviously you'll\nIn Florida Georgia the big Markey game on the schedule look Florida is one of those teams I think every college football fan goes yeah but I didn't really that's good yeah but are they really there's good and we're going to find out tomorrow\nYeah the answer is probably not quite yet I mean it's you remember where they were last year I mean this was a bad bad team uh nothing was working at all it was dead team walking with Jim ... sure to be fired\nAnd they turned around fast you know it's not that easy I mean tendencies not turning around in a heartbeat nebraskan UCLA\nYou know certainly weren't able to flip this fast\nAnd but then Mullen was able to step in it was a good situation they didn't have to a completely you know got the got the building here for this thing they just need to tweak a little bit as it turns out yeah they are this good they are okay\nBut Georgia's ... one of the top four teams in the country so tomorrow's really that day where we kind of the okay now this clears up a little bit so either it's one of those days where we kind of clear out the you know the riffraff a little bit alright Kentucky let's see what you do it in Missouri Texas you got to go to school in the state\nYou know Iowa and Penn State there are couple but you won last teams out there that are going to be hanging around and have to be put in an article that I write in conversations that All right we'll see if you're still hang around after this week\nWell that's one of the things obviously me and in the Big Ten you got\nThe Iowa Penn State game well Wisconsin northwest we'll get to that later a Penn State a team you know Jason taking a baseball bat you out of out of you and Cajun Iowa Stanley sixteen and six almost sixteen hundred yards mix sorely has been fantastic in spots\nUm Iowa on the road to stay on hold up\nAt Penn State now we have to look at them to a different lens because All right that the one big performance against Ohio State in the last but they've not really done a whole lot else I mean you lose to Michigan State you know they need everything in the bag to get by Appalachian State it's been a good team they blew up some bad teams\nBut now now we find out because I was good\nIt was a bad match up for Penn State I like you mentioned they played really well\nOr the office of line is starting to figure it out that defense is great against the run so I ... going to have to be amazing I think Iowa winds is I think they keep going I I've said for weeks I think I Will win the Big Ten west\nBut we're gonna see tomorrow if they can really get because they went to milder running the table and they're going to be eleven and one that it just comes down to whether or not was caught is going to lose again\nI'd give me an upset tomorrow you wouldn't be surprised top twenty five if what happened tomorrow\nI wouldn't be out of my mind shocked to Florida beats Georgia because it is a you know it's a rivalry game and as you saw in Texas Oklahoma sometimes those things sort of happened\nUh northwestern it might beat Wisconsin because north western has a a little bit of a hacks over the badgers in al ... is in the concussion protocol and I'm actually going to the game\nWhere you know you go and I don't know\nThat it's probably going to be thirty four degrees and raining or whether it's in other words it was\nA little bit and I write this evening in some parts of the suburbs\nLittle bit yeah so it's it's the only find out but I uh I think Texas loses to Oklahoma State I have it there's nothing really to go on that other than Texas is due for one of these clunkers to go the wrong way and Oklahoma states do to have a good game especially with two weeks off so uh Oklahoma State of Texas is kind of my one for tomorrow\nAbout navy makes it hangs up just enough to make it interesting I mean obviously a twenty four point wind\nBut yeah interesting as you say interesting if you like the ... for a lot of points against an option to you but this isn't the navy team in the last few years it's not as Chris the defense isn't nearly as good and they know the names had two weeks off but\nThis starts a run for games in five where the Irish are away from South bend and there's just a quirky and if the schedule
