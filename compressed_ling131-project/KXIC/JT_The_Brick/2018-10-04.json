{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "Therefore I think Iowa [noise]\nAh is better than maybe some people think I think DACA Israel the makings of a very good team you know there's an old saying you could beat yourself or you could be the opponent but you can't lead them both on the same night and and that would apply to the guys and the badgers a couple of weeks ago\nThough you know my opponent the town\nOr a trip fumbled recovery by Wisconsin on a on a on a punt returned to field a kill momentum there for the moment are driving the ball down to the fiber coming away with no point is\nDriving the ball down to the one hand and losing four yards but I've got a on a sweep or a top sweep a\nThose are all plays would need to be executed a turnover is going to want the turnover battle but uh but my point at all that is not to criticize the harsh but I think if they extra few like they normally do [noise] uh this is a pretty good they're really good I Would change [noise]\nSo I think it's wide open to the west you know I really do [noise]\nYou know they used clearly Ohio State has the advantage how they do have to play Michigan to on the season\nMarilyn showed me something that gets Minnesota\nMichigan State I I think the jury's still out on this part most\nForgiving who they played a Indiana's better than what they've been Penn State obviously is\nVery good at Rutgers is struggling but I I think the clear favorite at least a given the way Ohio State score two touchdowns from way late in the game on the road at happy valley I could tell you from being there are those are times\nThat is not an easy place to play when you've got a hundred and twenty thousand people screaming down your uh your throat got on white out by the hearts of experienced wide open I get out the valley of Ohio State showed me a lot with a comeback they've always got talent\nThey really extra to one of the chips were down late in the games are right now you have to go with Ohio State in Wisconsin I guess pregnancy but they would be on the title game there's paid in some cases nine games to go\nUh let's see what's on the Anthony's minder I up in a

got another head coach on hand knowledge welcome in Iowa women's golf coach Megan Smith\nShow who's in her eight here at the University of Iowa and has built a strong program\nAnd it's getting better and better parts coming off a big win here the past few days when the Diane Thomas or a invitational coach Thomas sort of course at Iowa a number of years the Hawkeye stormed a victory twenty two shots ahead of the runner up coach I Know it's all coaching but you've been able to recruit pretty good talent to avenue\nWe have our ... excited about 'em sit last weekend was really strong for than we tell like than at the pizza they're coming together and I'm just an awesome weaken her son and you know just named player that we can get a lot of momentum for\nUm that we needed to talk for\nA few speaker senior Sean ... who was The Mentalist\nFifty for whole total of a\nPlus plus five to twenty to Twenty one plus five and a career best three under sixty nine I think that's not easy to do as a\nYou know it's really not I think I'm every year well ... how difficult that golf course planes and unfortunately we didn't have the greatest whether that's I think and but she really persevered got off to kind of a slow start and we had a really exciting finished with several of our ... kind of in the battle and she\nUh you know kind of got the lucky dry think a little bit that she would say that you know she was playing in the lead group and sometimes you just go out and gets put together really tall around and see how it all at the end and that's just an awesome date for her\nWhat what about showing where she's from ...\nFrom ... Illinois and she just didn't tipping off in person tight with the hardest workers I'd ever coached to be on it um she makes me better every day 'cause you just someone that has a very high standard not only for herself and her teammates and so we're very lucky to have her as well as Christine Glenn thing is our captains this year\nSigned the biomedical engineer engineering major and and uh going a dental school next year so we're going to talk about days you know very full that she just to have to be on every minute and she just an exceptional student athlete represent the University of Iowa extremely while every day\nBut Sean had a great tournament but you also had five parts in the top down in\nA freshman and upper class or let's talk about a couple of those to you mentioned a Christian a blessing or a Stephanie Herzog is a sophomore Donald learners are freshmen and men are willing to lose a route to\nMe and my aunt lives around zero zero zero yogurts are you doing international recruiting with golf as an international sport as\nIt is I think it's often the writer happy you know there's a great golf all over the world and\nWe've been very fortunate to attract players from all over the world to come to the University of Iowa\nMan well the great stories she played in the mid west junior here each summer as a junior officer and just fell in love with Iowa City right away she loves the people here she left the city she let a guy and um he's amazing I kind of have a dynamic duo and I'm Donna and while they just bring a great energy and\nLove golf just have a great passion for the game and her team golf and it's just been really just didn't\nReally and she's a lot of energy and dark team in our whole culture which is great and what do you\nTry and yet we're talking with so much so I was a women's golf coach or a beer [noise] has done a fantastic job at the parks [noise] what do you try and get out of the fall schedule is that more invitational just more\nAs you get ready for the spring and the victims\nAnd you know I think we feel like we really need to kind of get off to a hot start in the fall and unfortunately we were a little slow at the gate but I think that uh you know infringement in line up and we had two great seniors that I think we're maybe trying a little bit too hard rarely trying to put together a great campaign and I know they will um and sometimes in golf as we all know trying too hard and\nIt's kind of the last thing that you need to do we need to get out there and be comfortable and settling in ... so we kinda like that kind of happened this last weekend and um things are starting to fall into place and we're really trying to get as many round than er about [noise] um [noise]\nIt'd be OK if the rain with you a little bit to help without a little bit on the fall but it's really kind of get a lot around them\nIn the a lot of great competition and we continue to me and all of that every day we're just trying to get a little bit better every day and get stronger and figure out what our weaknesses are in and get where\nYou're not getting a lot of rural looks like five of these days with the record rain or would have been nice deployed even though it was a little windy too you know that's all at Iowa you've got to put up with the elements as you do in the spring but [noise] yeah it's a it's still do the game still gets back to getting fair wage hitting it into the green close to ... the\nYeah I'll be I'll be okay I'll be okay as I get older I don't get as upset as I used to in our\nIn our younger some\nGood good good at the end at talking about the titans that's certainly been a highlight you know we we uh really felt like book Noah and a T. J. or had the protests way very well is Sharon [noise] so they're doing a really good job there there are a tremendous young people and they're talented gifted they work hard and uh [noise]\nYeah they're really helping our team that's one of the positions I think that the ... [noise] yeah and I would say running back or three of the positions that we feel like we uh [noise] you know have multiple players complained going there and really play effectively\nTJ lead you in charge I gained at the tight end position course NOAA has the [noise] the four touchdown grabs this year and\nNext Stanley ... that's not a bad place to go a few of the quarterback as you continue to develop a wide and she [noise]\nOn a question in a you know that that's something we've seen over the last two years at progressing [noise]\nUm you know it got his feet went a little bit two years ago and then last year had a good year and teach it Richard it two years ago and\nNow they're nice shovel Asher is the first year player so you just hope every player is growing incrementally a with a return of the season that type of thing and um those guys are both on that they've been really nice job and it does it take some pressure off everybody else and\nUh you know when we're playing while we took we read the ball around a little bit so the defense and defense catches load up on the one one particular individual\nTurkey flipped things a little bit at the beginning of the by week he did a lot of the heavy lifting\nThe first two or three days brought the regulars and got some heavy practices in there then gave them some time off to turn to the back up to the youngsters are those are the inexperienced to to get a lot of reps in that that was a that was planted that was by design for and it was way so\nIt's it's interesting uh probably you know you you look at everything as your program goes goes along and\nUh you know we feel pretty comfortable and tell pretty comfortable last year where we're all preparation and our approach to that's changed a little bit over the years uh certainly did after the first Orange Bowl we we just had a disastrous game so we really looked at heart [noise] um but but times have changed too you know now we play after Thanksgiving\nSo my point there is it like you know we look at every ... days of our program for obvious reasons but uh the by we things it's always a little tricky and are there a couple of variables [noise] what what time of year is it when you do have your by a I think it was Thirteen we have to buy so there's a whole different discussion\nBut what time of year is that ... that turn all those types of things so we we did spend a lot of time on that back in the off season has a staff disgusting things uh through some ideas that our players and then you know when we come back and forth on it but yeah to your pure point and we tried to make the I'm\nThinking like a normal game week if you would [noise] uh we did a practice Tuesday and Wednesday with regarding uh the older guys just lifted on a on Monday that's all they did ... that's all they did but uh we had to go to work out some\nKind of split the team up a little bit ... younger goes a little bit more extensively\nThat friday or had a very like the old everybody and then get younger goes out for a little bit more work so [noise] uh they were here friday morning we normally ... in a a little breaks to the guys that were [noise] local law to them one home guys from far away to go home with a partner is that type of thing and [noise]\nThey got back to Sunday but one coming on or usually Sunday practices not very impressive and uh this year it went pretty well so what happened but maybe we maybe with something\nThat you found the right fund our weather but it's interesting because you mentioned do too [noise] and I'll never forget the hit your by week after the last football game and he sees yeah up at the Metrodome therefore you did play a game for fifty whatever eight days and oh by the way here's southern Cal go go beat him and the Orange Bowl which\nThat was a good game for a close game anyway for the better part of the two three quarters [noise] uh so you've had you've had the by week at the end of the year you've had the earliest by we care a\nThree four weeks [noise] end of the season I I'm assuming there's pros and cons with with\nWith each open window\nYeah so we'll look at the positive side right you know to try that are on extension with that but uh it's interesting last friday or by my count and that's on official was dead center in the middle of our [noise] our town or your for the season starting starting camp for the first friday in August and you know finishing up on\nA I guess November last friday of whatever it is right I don't know as one of the next to last one and nobody thinks giving week the exactly so you know it kinda fits right in the middle of it and we obviously do more heavy lifting in August and we do any of the time they're so\nTechnically on the energy our guys wearing spend will be much less and the next day we spend it was the first day weeks\nBut I I think it's that that a good point I think you know we played enough or we have a pretty good grip on our team [noise] not not that we're there yet not that we have all the answers or anything but we have a good picture of what the guys look like a game [noise]\nSituations tough situations and gave us some things to focus on his coaching staff players something to focus on and [noise] you know we certainly a purpose with our practice last week and then [noise] um I I really like works that's right now and now we got an eight week season and\nThey don't transmit the last time you played an eight week season in high school ... years but [noise] you know they might do anything for a week so [noise] uh you know we should be for us we should be arrested and we should be able to um [noise]\nPlay our best and give our best for the next eight weeks and that's that's really the task to him\nWe'll talk Minnesota's specifically here as we we press I Want to go back to the Wisconsin game um I really liked what I've read Kelley Martin showed that night to and and that's from a kid it was a quite a hundred percent yet these should be pretty close now but man I tell you he he brings some extra weaponry to the to the arsenal if he's healthy\nAnd just on and on the answer just talking about our backs you know we have a we might have a wider group of ... you know at least they are in the building all three of the guys are a little bit on the ... areas Doug say a lot of the boy I tell you works are in the essence he's gotten near\nHe's really impressed us just the way by goes about his business or what have you had a tour and has a very energetic um [noise] you know tough minded player\nBut again not not outspoken or boisterous just to us about his work really impressive land because jumped in there and done the same thing so it's a really good about the group of ... got a good skills good skills that now he's a little stronger in little tougher maybe think he is and he's pretty nasty and uh you know just kind of knows how to how to do a lot of things pretty well so\nHe's he's also a really good start and I would say the same about the other two guys as well\nHopefully recall and that is a legitimate three headed monster\nOn the quarterback is young a first year player but I'll tell you smart enough to go outside of those guys in difficult to them they both are very very dangerous to outside guys are ... you know there's that your first one number Thirteen to [noise]\nYou know I think once a month or twenty two times twenty but those are just a little\nDopp officer they're throwing the ball down the field that's their bread and butter because they've lost her ... to ... decision injuries that have Rodney Smith and shut up so I don't like those guys are there early tough runners and\nUh that you know it's a big blow in it was two quarters of a Kelvin\nTyler Johnston is the junior restrict you speak of uh [noise] and he's the guy six to about two hundred and five pounds he's from Minneapolis [noise] he's got twenty two passes average is Thirteen and a half years [noise] and he's got five touchdown passes so obviously ...\nHe's been very productive for them he was good player last year as well\nAnd I think you know we're talking about are having some balance on our came over the last a\nElements them or something like that and [noise]\nUh I guess the thing that's what their teams and put out you've got two guys that are really good the press [noise]\nUh you know these are true freshman out of Georgia\nYou know he gets down to feel pretty pretty well makes a lot of places to see you can't just sit on\nA number ... ...\n... is is the true freshman English because they've always got big titans are they have again this year they've got to a number of freshmen they're playing at the white out along with title or just the junior what about a brace Williams is a youngster from Florida coach tail back they\nMoved him in there they've been feeding him a ball a lot of good size six foot two hundred pure freshman\nBut obviously got some skills\nAnd he's not a good job and that came in Maryland game and ran really wrong the second half so you know he's he's quite a ways to front strong and then twenty fours a solid guy to be Twenty one ...\nLet's go to the ... or so ago Tony on the line we haven't talked to Tommy in a few weeks he's got a question or comment I timing [noise]\nHow long are you calling in how\nMe gain and no longer and\n[noise] the guy\nNext to call it kind of good to hear from you know uh [noise] well I don't know that I was players last longer than than other tennis schools I mean part of that as a roll the dice does that mean the average NFL careers like four and a half years if if you can stay healthy or you can last now\nA Riley reset a good run brand loggers had a good run Mike Daniels has been terrific but ah [noise]\nAh you know it's an honor to play in the NFL hid Marshall yet I don't want to forget Marshall either but [noise] you know a lot of things to have a terrific careers in Greenland flight eleven\nYears ... just retired and right before Amazon bought one of the play to pry Thirteen Years maybe the defensive tackle call to do and that the kind of line you know those guys take a lot a lot of shots from a lot of different directions so [noise]\nUm you know that I think part of it is a [noise] you know the reason they're good players here and we're talking about some of our guys like Corker\nUh you know those guys just do things they do things right they they show up for work on a daily basis and it sounds pretty Monday in a routine but\nUh I think ocean the NFL for six years it's amazing how many I struggle with that they're so used to [noise]\nOr just getting by on their ability and or something like that catches up to you so\nYou know being a pro is is much more than being a really good player it's it's just doing things that are on a consistent basis stern any profession you have to show up and do work in\nA you know get knocked on you get back up and you know those surrender you get back up and go to work and try to fix the problem is that the deal so [noise]\nI I think our guys are for the most part understand that pretty well when they leave and the um [noise] you know they carry that with him to the NFL hopefully I Know they've done the same thing in their\nPersonal lives and all that kind of stuff and\nWhere are the only program teaching at ... ...\nThat's the case but you know we've had some really good [noise] still are guys and the guys we've all talked about her just a minute ago [noise] um [noise] you know just sort of the great guys do I mean they're really good people and a fun to be with us and\nYou know so you like to see him do well professionally but more important than doing a good job away from [noise] and one thing about football it's going to and it's going to end pretty soon for everybody so [noise]\nYou know hopefully a little bit more going forward than just being able to tackle somebody or block somebody or say something down\nTalked to a Marshall a a\nYawn to this spring when he was back and he said he's feeling the aches and pains says eleven years or in the in the in the NFL and\nOf course a if you are a line on\nAh you're probably going to feel it more than most 'cause you're getting lead on every snap doesn't matter if you're in the old line\nWhere the defensive line or your bank and helmets shoulder pads all afternoon\nThere's there's really no way to get around that and um [noise] you know it's amazing [noise]\nFootball's hard physical game [noise]\nAnd ah you know I always tell people I said you know the players have really good hours uh I mean they are ours are really good or better than yours even okay and a few if you wrap it in the auto season and it's gotten less now than they were costs now than they did when I was in the national football league\nTheir hours are really good there pays pretty good even the worst day guys get paid really well [noise]\nUh but the one thing they the other part about it especially guys on the answer they get the crap out um it's a really hard job physically um you know so there is a tool that they all pay and\nUh you know if it's not an easy way to make a living by any stretch and it's a very competitive business in ... is our but\nYou know they don't mind cutting you and then I fell either telling you it's not going to leave so it's a business that's that's part of the deal so that you know those guys going through their eyes wide open an uh there's always risk involved and [noise]\nYou know but you're also can compensate for that and and nobody's making you do it it's it's something to choose to do\nObviously the best at what they do appreciate the call Tony go back to the golfers coach I Want to I Want to say to just leave in ... Morgan said his Tommy still call\nAnd I said you know we haven't heard from Tom in quite a while so good that atomic all going\nGood ear from Tommy is a longtime regular over there in Des Moines and nuts [noise] he's a he's a you know he's kind of like an old dog leaner than we do smarter than he lets game quite well all sports for that in my memory serves me correctly a Yankees fan too so [noise]\nWell I I think any you know he is yeah tell us what it is I think Tommy roots for whoever's winning okay I'll and I'll be honest with you but I may be wrong on that count as a Minnesota defensively [noise]\nThey had really good the lines of the last few years to start up front there sure what do you like about the goal presents a young guy out there on the end Carter Coughlin is pretty active\nYou know they played them as a freshman he was very heavily recruited a pretty much for everybody and the ... and are pretty much nationally chose to stay home he's a local kid and stayed home with the with the I'll go first and\nAnd uh you know really good player so you know he he to me is like the earlier up front they played them as a freshman or and he was warning on the job played really well last year and\nTease earlier up front so\nOr the other guys are are newer guys uh to the same thing if you're a good size up there and those guys to play their defense well they've got a a [noise]\nAlways had good athletes at linebacker Thomas barbers seems like he's been there a few years he's a junior comes from a obviously good bloodlines with Mary Ann Arbor but let's start with him uh what do you like about their backers and\nThese are center of the middle linebacker the center of their defense and uh you know again as you said these comes from a football family's very um um looks like to be on the\nHead of the whole defense there does a good job and\nMartin number Twenty one that outside backers of guys place to the ... a very good player too and cash humans um I think that's my you know the most veteran group is linebacker group catchment into a new started this year but he's been a really good special teams play or continue to play long special teams so those are you guys are really a good job at barbers in the middle on the east coast to the center of the whole operation\nThere is a big hole in that secondary coach uh at the Maryland game a\nA wouldn't feel the third\nSon of the great Ohio State player played the lead for fourteen years entwined Winfield uh uh had foot surgery this week he's done for the year\nOr so they uh they've got they've got some patchwork going out of that secondary but wouldn't feel really was there glue guy there intercept or their big hitter [noise]\nUh he will be missed by the goldfish at\nStuff when you you know lose we went through this last year the parents that are getting injured and it's just it's tough when you lose a guy who's kind of the quarterback back there are clearly leader clearly one of the better players and\nUm you know Andrews a part of the game [noise] uh you know we all understand that but it's really sad when a player loses an entire season that's\nYou know they get these guys work so hard for a year round for the opportunity play twelve games and\nYou weren't injured takes that away it's just really a distorting\nTo everybody unfortunately injuries are part of the game they call football uh before we take a break your Kirk a question from the audience and the NFL\nShielding by a quarterback or defensive back his past interference [noise] even if there's no contact\nPower shielding called in college if it is [noise] uh I guess there are just starting yeah that's a really good question because I'm not sure I Do is understand the calls that are\nOr aren't made so yeah that's that's a good question right there so it is it the college rule book\nYeah it is not suppose they'll contact yeah okay well it's obviously a a judgmental and by the part of the official as this fall placements you know we have a question about you know these are smart fans who are the gas ... when the receiver running back goes down [noise]\nIs the ball placed where the knee
