signed it receiver Nick Williams and they wave kick our Cairo Santa\nHow you feel about that did you like that call ...\nWell I mean again he's the boss and we can say I'm I I think it's going to be taken out of context I think people are going to make it sound like everybody just wants people to shut up and play ball and I don't think that's really what he's saying I think there has been a lot Sendai him a and I think given the little production on the field not that it's his fault\nI was going to say given no but most of them he's had good games who could look at as of a law this year he doesn't that touchdowns condemn a quarterback the throats of well he also has dropped some passes and he also had the ball bounce off of his leg well that wasn't a match that I was a band playing\nWell yeah I mean he hasn't been a you know as great as advertising and has\nBeen a great teammate I mean there are a lot of people who think he stirred up a lot of controversy in the locker room maybe some needed the beast or not maybe send some things that need to be sad but I'm not but yeah I uh I understand where he's coming from I think ... could have been a little more gentle with his words\nWith thanks a lot of them that it is the odd couple of Chris Broussard ... Parker would come you live\nFrom the guy told Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in your car insurance with guy go go to guy co dot com or call eight hundred nine four seven eight UT I'll be on the hard part is figuring out which way is easier let's go to the phone lines we've got James Jones the super bowl champion wide receiver\nPlay with Aaron Rodgers now NFL Network analyst James welcome to the AQAP was happening\nOr going off outlets\nWhere we were glad to have you on let's get right to it look a lot of people feel like that the Packers are not putting the pieces around air Rogers to get him to Super Bowls order when Super Bowl I'm One of those people are are we crazy or knowing now you agree of around him\n[laughter] man it's crazy man I get that question them on their cars or crazy or may not know right now I mean some are receiving her her so they're all over the map but\nI'll tell people all the time air strikes season than the playoffs wanna come on up through the roof or two and three other one of them on this team and on and on with drawn to play offs and lay the eggs so\nI mean a lot of the guys that I play with a mess especially for and the thought of all to think about your Michael Finley ... Jimmy you think about Donald Driver Jordan Nelson ... around and man and even when you go to the side of the fall when we ask Charles was when we come from a ... chart\nOut here is I mean a lot of ... just on the game count it man\nIn the playoffs player to play and know if it happens like that and the older man but no he has to be around or a James\nI I I all the time on a undisputed call people different names you know we we know the gold a call Tom Brady the low ... of all time\nI call up or so after Aaron Rodgers game last night I called them they'll pull out the book the ... old which is P. O. A. T. which is the best pastor of all time\nAnd have you ever seen anybody who I mean he was that was just a mask to peace with the way he does a football we know where he has the highest quarterback waiting of of any of quarterback in the history of the NFL he also has the best a touchdown to pass a intercept to raise children anybody by far\nIs he the best passes you've ever seen as far as our quarterbacks\nMan I Know people tell me all the time that I'm part of a clue Rogers man and I tried to get myself out of the men are he wants to and it's not because I play with a man I'll just go out on a single ... Smith quarterbacks man and a half\nA mile below ... he's the greatest to ever do it man I mean when you when you talk about young quarterbacks now is the first you compare him to Roger small he throws like air Rogers man when he gets off the pocket advisor down the field as normal like Rob how are you trying to compare it to him and all\nYou know it just shows how how special use math\nBut yeah he's the greatest ever do it in my in my opinion man what a lot of people don't understand how that accused by more than is in the pocket of just throwing a football man but this is the guy that got on the ... or maybe you're going to pick him this is the guy\nYou know what I'm saying to play tennis golf pick him just a he's an athlete you know what I'm saying ... no quarterback\nNo I mean you are you guys when I'm sure you guys play at time did you play wreck basketball into is he really a good basketball player\nHe has a good basketball player man\nI play wrecked craft or would it mean green but not a gym out there in Green Bay Packers know so much stuff to do mass play by play basketball out their Green Bay but no I have play on your show to all these quicker and you think man and he's an athlete matter he surprised\nTo see the play wrecked basketball or go to the target downtown Green Bay\nWhere you need a cleric\nOr old [laughter] oh I see a couple of sports radio our guest is James Jones Super Bowl champion\nWide receiver and current NFL Network analyst let's talk about the NFL as a whole I'm calling in the arena football league outside I mean these points to the room they're protecting the quarterback you can't play deep ... what's going on do you like this NFL\n... you know a man or a ... year old Ryan okay hit nobody no more is crazy because I was just an ego and the green room talking Reggie plane and I said I didn't play the for it but actually irritates me that\nWhen I watch football this past Sunday every time a defender set the quarterback Everytime he tackled the running back every time you hit the receiver heart they're giving up\nAnd they're throwing their hands off like I didn't do it I mean the hitting that heart and I'm like\nI'm like man that's no football like we all fell in love with the game because of the violence of it you know you go out their office you crack back also you can get somebody says man a lot of stuff going on and off the field you could come out there take it out also like\nDefender should not be getting up with their hands up\nLike I didn't mean to hit him and you got all the gear on and on the path and it's all five of the game is football man and just watching that\nYou know it's hard on the Internet and then they're second guessing ourselves I mean I Know you guys met grabbing the quarterback and let them go you know thinking he released a ball just because you don't want to sack him or her to quarterback man and you know I think it's a mess and our game a man and we got to try to clean that a man just throw these defenders do second guess yourself because\nWhen you second guess yourself in the national football league injuries happen you know now when you fly around and you're running around here I mean that's how everybody stays healthy both sides of the ball\nWhat was it like going across the middle when you when you played\nWhen you knew there was a chance you could get your clock cleaned and that's what I mean defenders were living for that that receiver coming across the middle middle versus like how you felt as a player at that time and how you think receivers field now knowing that that's not going to happen anymore\nOh defer man when I came across it on there for her and she's\nAlways plans Philadelphia Eagles Brian Dawkins and you know I'm I'm In there with Brett Farr he checks to slap route I'm In the slot and Brian dog walking down also closer to snap or the or is kind of like you knew to play and ... and and my and I said man for farmers lots of voters bar\nYou know because he he got a\nSuper strong army could sneak it in there and I'm like man I'm Glad it and then my head on my master's just catch it and he threw\nIt man and pride dog and hit me so hard and I still feel that he's still to this\nDay and asked me\nWhat you were playing with a guy like that that just want us to come down hill and man and knock you block off man and nowadays you know and okay I Can't get it here I Can't get there I mean there's really no we're going to open a middleman and that\nAnd I'm going to say the number two and number one it fixed you know easy one the realms we got to go with the Los Angeles well [noise] and um [noise]\nThey all my number one team on the power right I'm going to give you credit though I really thought you were going to find a way

Chris Broussard Rob Parker welcome you live from the guy told Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in your car insurance was guy go\nGo to guy called dot com or call a hundred nine four seven eight you Tio the only hard part figuring out which way\nIs easier and give us a call it is a trash talking Tuesday hit us up at eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine if you want to trash anyone or anything in the world of sports including\nRobin myself if you want to go that far I don't think you\nDo you better be careful of what this is your chance to line up will last thought that in a few minutes so you want to jump in here's your chance\nI we're talking about the Green Bay Packers ... air Rogers and Rob my take is that look and we asked James Jones who was a former Packer and won the super bowl the one Super Bowl Aaron Rodgers has one and he said they have definitely put players around Rogers and I think they have in various years\nBut consistently and especially of late\nI think more so of late I just feel like he has he's had to do more and more and more and I don't think they should be wasting any years with the quarterback as great as they arise in the fact is\nHe's got to get more rings you called him the pope the best pastor of all time well you're not going to be considered the gold\nUnless he wins more Super Bowl probably I'd say at least two more for him to be able to surpass um time\nRe look me in the end is near me in the conversation right but but\nBut I think your your point is well taken from the standpoint that they made a change in general manager you know what is your Ted\nThey go out and get you know they'd yeah ... yeah why\nThat they had normally never did they use them although they ... already Nelson go by you know but they were they were pretty amazing at Chris drafting players\nGetting diamonds and the ... you know what I mean and and the guys working out for them so that's the kind of happen for them I think that's how they that's their philosophy what it what do I but I but I've had wide wide but after a while it just wasn't working any more\nSo I think you're right that they need to go out and do that because look at what he can do with what he has he's an incredible players you saw last night\nUh most quarterbacks can't can't complete that come back no dead\nThan the regular less I mean we saw him do it what ... what are the first game of the season Chicago up when he got hurt remember they were down Seventy ... injury and leave the comeback like that he he does it all the time and even as he's banged up he's having a tremendous year\nAnd I just wanted to see the guy get help I Love seeing a history made\nAnd that's one reason I I really like Tom Brady 'cause I think he's making history but I'd love to see Aaron Rodgers do he's so great I Love to see them start winning more championships and get himself in that conversation when\nPeople talk to me they always ask me I I Would tell them I'm not a fan I'm not but I Do like to watch great players play you know what I mean as guys who covers sports and this is the part about jobs and what we do all the time so I Do I any chance I get to watch him Rogers and I did when I was working in Detroit\nBecause during the lions division I saw him play live twice a year for many years ago and I I'm telling you I I wouldn't take my eyes off for him because he's good he's a we're watching one of the greatest guys who ever do the football and ... if you a fan of another team or anything else if you just honest about\nWatching this guy's talent you know he's a great player no no question\nAbout it and I got to be honest Rob as much as we talked about earlier you talked about they really need to improve their defense and it's certainly I mean they can definitely use help on that side of the ball\nI Would love to know what's gonna happen I Would love to see them getting the mix for lay beyond bill\nI don't know I mean now you're paying Rogers all this money and he deserves it can you ... what he wants I don't know but I Would that's the type of move that I think would be great for them because\nJames Jones is right defines a Adams they have some good receive Montana rails thought right if you have a lazy I'm bell and now deep sea defenses know\nGreen Bay passing the ball\nThey know it and if they had to worry about a ... bill not only as a running back but also as a great receiver out of the backfield oh it would be crazy\nAnd I think they'd be a tremendous a much better team to have a better chance to win the Superbowl they were my pre season pick considering I don't feel good about it right now law got you but you're right well if you add a running back in the mix\nFirst of all he's mobile you don't know what you're doing ... plus you got to guard against Iran and then do can throw the ball all over the field so there's all these other things that are playing into it it wouldn't make them much more dangerous and they basically done it without a running back for years now\nAnd you said that they got the new GM they made some ... some you know they brought in some new guys are made some adjustments some transactions\nAnd people thought that this was you know a lot of people I wasn't the only one to pick the Packers no not at all possible\nSome people are blaming it on injuries that they did not healthy by any including Rogers so maybe that's the case but right now what the Green Bay Packers are shoveling out on the field is just not enough\nTo capitalize on the greatness of erasures V. can do it with this team\nThen that's incredible and who knows maybe they have a chance but you know things like the rams just have so many more weapons\nRight but if they get healthy as time goes you know the season is a long season won't eat yeah they were still have the same games la ... a lot can happen jumped in ten games we saw it on when Philadelphia and all of its injuries what happened was they won the super bowl yeah you're absolutely right play well in and I came together\nWhen when they lost their quarterback everybody said it was over forty eagles yup over\nI'm saying this over this year no repeat what are you talking about really they just play greater day might make the playoffs it gives them against the giant right All right I'm going to work with a ... D J Alex Thai food in the production crew could play well against the law so I put it back [laughter]\nBut I I the eagles are putting it together I did they not repeating I'm telling you that they're not getting back to the super bowl\nEight seven seven Ninety nine or Fox it is the odd couple\nAnd give us a call trash talking Tuesday is next a seven seven\nNo it was crazy Mario appreciate you are calling in a uh a couple of crew\nThey got some big I ... and they want to weigh in on DJ\nAlex type shirt with who Josh demand\nAlright guys also known by DJ vegetables I Want to ...

[laughter] I just want consistency Rob I expect it out of you that your car that's a good when they go\nHey ... G our our our producer Rob Jew who you trust you this week\nI Am trashing Denver Broncos fan to not just some a raider fan but because I was in Denver this past week why miss yesterday you were cold is anything I'll always freezing it was terrible I'm never going back\nBut the reason why I Try and it was because the Broncos like to uh tell everyone they got this great fan base and how incredible it is and you know a mile high and the home field advantage\nIt said on the big board in the stadium we have are so many records satellites in a row but nine thousand people didn't show up\nWow so you you can clearly see the empty\nSee oh yeah you can see the empty seats and even the P. A. edge announcer said we have another sell out we just have nine thousand do shows 'cause they can handle the cold weather [laughter]\nAnyway I'm going to live in Denver yes you know what cold weather feel that's embarrassing man you lived\nThere in the Rocky Mountains right I mean don't they know\nBut you know what that is that that's the team that's the fact that they got a two or four team that's really what\nThat is because they do have good fans and did not know Denver's a huge for ... a town\nAnd they love all the sports we know that we're on the air there in Denver\nYeah oh that yeah that was just a but there there soon\nEnough I guess they're turning turning off the Broncos to afford 'cause there's not much hope is there hope\nThis year\nIs pretty good now they got they got more than the jets run over the ... yeah and they started to give up ... points even though they you know again the defense is supposed to be they're calling for a car but they don't put up enough points\nWell can I Do or do we have time for one more call or should I jump in okay I'm I'm going to do one and\nI'm going to try many\nUh Machado crust\nIt's one thing not the hospital and the water you know apologized for to move on and I'm fine with that I not the end of the world or a damages your career forever but to say that you're not a hustle guy and you're not Johnny wholesome and all that I don't get that I just do what does that mean I'm not a hostile God\nHe made it sound corny to be a hustle guy right like Johnny helpful but I Want to also ... right right yeah it's a little more and we are tired of it is warm or not yeah when we got Rodney in Omaha shoot\nRight now I Want to show the dollars from from a scarf Ross even though we came here to try to\nWatch our trash everybody that goes against them because it's a work in progress you know what\nActually with the Rodney I because I I think Scott Ross is going to be a good coach from Nebraska I noticed this earlier ... was pretty good [laughter] well I watch Nebraska this weekend and they they were I think it was against north western\nAnd they should do with the northwestern yeah they had a great chance to win that game and last I Believe in overtime but not think Scott Ross is going to be good for the corps hookers\nAnd get them or get them eventually get them back to being um maybe national\nPowers to

RBI single early in the game they're in the bottom of the second inning and ... came out to the game after rolling his angle going for a ground or Freddie Peralta is pitching from Milwaukee\nJason Tatum having the big night for the Celtics he's got twenty points eight rebounds a couple of assess Gordon Hayward\nPlaying his first game since shattering is that last year it was rough\nSeven points into while you're gonna ... seven points and Twenty one minutes and Kyrie Irving having a horrendous night with seven points in twenty seven minutes so the Celtics this is how good they are they leave the Sixers ... eleven and Hayward in Irving our combined five for twenty three from the floor\nVistas how good the Boston Celtics are they are going to end this season\nAs your two thousand Eighteen two thousand Nineteen champs they get back to got basically you're getting to a list free agents back because Kyrie is back\nAnd we have Gordon Hayward back and look how far they made it last year when these guys are out you have so much star power on the Boston Celtics you have a great starting five of Mars coming off the bench smart rosier coming off the bench this they remind me of the sea hawks when\nThey first started there many dynasty when they had all their great young players under contract for a good two three years stretch so guys that are going to go make money someplace else it takes them a couple of years to become free agents that so much good young talent that still under their control their window is now they end this season has NBA champion\nAnd smartly with the along the marathon right we were just beginning what is it a nine month regular season or thereabouts before nine months playoff uh they're they're playing nine guys tonight nine players with at least Ninety minutes played in\nThis game for the Celtics so you're talking about coming at you and waves there's no let down in the second unit that you can just keep rolling through so you're seeing it on display tonight and as you mentioned your two stars\nOr at least the name recognition players right as Tatum they'll do everything\nCan get him over at this point right over it happened a little bit at the end of the regular season last year and into the playoffs and certainly ah he's gotten the hype over the summer\nAnd then during the telecast I think if you did a drinking game of references to his age ... minutes played all running last year you would have been done by halftime\nAbsolutely have learned a lot of that might be end of the first quarter well I I I'm Talking about you only taking that challenge if you got a little bit of stamina\nA little bit of drinking yeah I don't know why wouldn't you take it just because I don't do it why not what the hell I you know you take you got all comers and you can do it right next to that you do get much now my dad lived his life by a by this philosophy a blanket one more\nThat's my that's still going blind get one more that's my ... not a bad why well I'll take that job as vice update you know\nThat's not bad at all but yeah it is a word in Irving can go what five I'm twenty four for the night at this point inside of four minutes you're feeling pretty good about your chances once everybody round into shape and you actually start playing basketball after Christmas\n... they're going to get out of the east which is so weak look they don't have to go through a broad you're seeing the two best teams playing right now\nMaybe the Toronto Raptors getting collide debate he's he's the biggest wildcard in the NBA if he is he really going to assimilate and and be a leader in Toronto or is he going to be a guy that just counting its time we've heard good story so far but you have to actually see it on the court to see so maybe Toronto but still\nThis is the best team in the east they will walk to the finals and they will beat the warriors because the warriors dynasty is on the downside may have younger hungrier players they win the NBA championships Celtics right now write it down to two thousand Eighteen Nineteen NBA chip you get that futures better now\nThat is right now I mean uh yeah can I just I should probably get it in our well I\nI think if you if you want to uh you know profit before it starts getting too lopsided although I I Can't imagine you're getting too long and hard uh in in that regard\nTwitter out

it forward\nAnd then when you're you're mixing these guys in the end of the game in jail and brown is a couple of big shots of pain but now you're going to have an urban we're going to score down the stretch it's going to be pick your poison you got a lot of guys can take big shots late I don't see anybody being able to slow the Celtics doubt especially during the regular season when\nYou you you play this is one out of eighty two and they were playing the Celtics were probably going to lose you go you go in with that attitude and and you got to hope they have a bad night that's how good the Celtics are going to be in the east this year well the beauty of it also\nIs that you don't have to tax guys with heavy minutes early on right Hayward doesn't have to play forty five minutes a night while trying to round themselves back in the game shape you don't have to push that button you don't have to have Kyrie Irving running himself down early\nOn because you've got the debt so over the long haul\nEspecially in the east and we can talk about the west as well going back to the Lakers point right everybody it it was a muddled mess a year ago you had to great teams and then you had seven teams that were essentially the same\nNot a whole lot of separation and Jimmy Butler stays healthy\nMinnesota's interesting to watch does he take the court while their trip trying to trade him and does or does he go get a jet ski and hang out with a buddy until we don't know but the fact of the matter is you had a lot of teams that were very very similar Houston got worse or a couple of

Hi\nRed Sox radio network on the call so the red Sox go and\nTake it for two game and turn it into an eight to victory they take game three and hey\nThis is a series that I fully expect to go seven this is a heavyweight fight between two phenomenally talented teams up and down but the story that could tip the series one way or the other is really not getting enough attention as it should\nThe red Sox are still not sure when Chris Sale is going to be able to pitch again he was back with the team tonight remember he was hospitalized for he was released earlier today for an undisclosed stomach illness\nHe didn't travel with the team Mrs game too but now he's back but they still don't know if he can pitch game five\nYou're missing Chris Sale\nThat's going to give the series to the Astros I mean this is when it's we're locking this down and Chris Sale is coming in and he is going to be dominant this is the biggest story the series but because we have the games and stuff is going on in the oath sales going to be able to pitch a deal was in the hospital\nFor a day and he's back with the team but it's not no and is he going to be a hundred percent\nIs he going to be able to pitch more than four innings what's it going to this is such a huge story and it's not getting enough attention\nAbout when you had Jackie Bradley junior doing things you didn't do all regular season at a miserable a wrong way especially with the the bases loaded and we ... we saw the big hit a for him to break this thing open so that that takes over and and it wasn't about the bullpen David Price on a game\nMe that and that's that's yeah stuff when you look at sale a release from the hospital you got a light throwing session scheduled on Wednesday privy athletic they don't know how long that's going to last that's the other thing like you you can't even commit to how long he's going to be able to throw in the bullpen\nNot not even of the game availability is like All right he's going to try to work out is really how that kind of rolls through so\nFor the red Sox certainly a huge laws we talked about the bullpen quite a bit over the course of the last month or so even though they ran roughshod should a hundred and eight\nRegular season when it was well what are you getting if you can make it a ball game it worked during the series against the Yankees it didn't matter because they could hit this one ... out and so you'll see if I mean today you got a start nobody saw coming\nBefore you get six innings no doubt I mean that was a start but I ... a lot more\nBecause this is where yeah who knows who Yankee fans going bleep any of all the relief guy still pitch and I mean that that that's why\nPitching in general is a crapshoot when you get to the playoffs because you could have a banjo pitcher come in and give you five ... things as well as much as you can ... and they have to leave the game but a guy like crushed sale it's like saying we you know sale and even that was kind of guy and maybe get a good out maybe they don't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "17"}
