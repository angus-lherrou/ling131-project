{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "Lying there was a time where everybody every defenders said I Want to make ESPN's jacked up and it changed football they changed it a lot for the worst and now you're just out their head hunting do you think you get made the game more violent [noise]\nThat what did it as opposed to getting smarter about nutrition and science and weight training and everything else I guess it changed tackle football to hit football\nIt changed tackle football from hey I'm tackling and these players are going to be able to play against me too I'm going to do what I can to injure [noise]\nOr maim the guys on the other side if you think they actually set out to do that or was it I'm going to try and issue the biggest blow to get on the program if somebody gets hurt so be it [noise]\nI Would believe I'm I'm I'm just be speaking from experience there are guys out there that are out there looking at her church sites or an order back my son and I told my son that\nHas that there are ... there are many reasons people play this game there are many ways that people play the game [noise] okay and there are some guys out there that come with like terrible intentions not just bad intentions hey I'm going to beat him and saw him to the ground and all and make them feel bad about himself which I Love doing [laughter]\nYou don't feel bad about yourself when I'm done just pancake you\nAmerica is under the can hurt you know so you didn't think it was targeting but if it stopped the money comes from doing that again in the future then so be it yes\nI just don't know where you draw the line though I mean that was that was difficult to about this rule\nIs that I mean you can't I mean it's it's really difficult to police when you have an individual who is is is a physical player who I mean I remember back when I played many moons ago is that um\nYou know simply as you you got you might as well to catch the ball because you're going to get hit mhm I mean it was kind of the that was the best that we could do [noise] to to our receivers to anybody catching the route is you're going to get you going to get it to catch the ball less of them only as them but now it's like [noise]\nFor defensive person I got to believe it's just so was training to be like oh my gosh I gotta I got an opportunity to make a tackle but was that too aggressive or was it that I Do it right in my youth kicked out\nYou said something different you said I have an opportunity to make a tackle not I have an opportunity to take his head off with a big hit [noise]\nIf he had ran over their shoulder in his guts and wrapped his arms around him and took him to the ground there would be no question about targeting gay guy like Ray Lewis for example [noise]\nI'm just telling you the difference there was an attack all made there or there could have been a big hit me Lawrence Taylor\nGuys like that would have been fined and kicked out a little I mean they would have been I mean how do you how do you have the most of the guys you're probably talking about the change the game I'm saying\nThose guys would have with the rules in place been able to be asked physical or\nTheir shoulders putting it in your gut and wrapping up because their feet would've taken them there any way [noise] but they were playing in the world they played them so they played that type of football to the best of their ability which is way higher than anybody could imagine\nWhat's also interesting to me about this if you're suggesting as quickly as the game happened [noise] that\nIn this case the money Jones put athletes in general [noise] bang bang why would have the ability to make that adjustment yes\nTrust me you know what you do you do what you're going to do [noise] I Know\nGoing to be for before I get there I don't know whether I Need to either use my forearms forget my hats and my two hands on you I Know that just by the way your lined up or wait the way you're set up and ... and what I'm intending to do [noise] and you're about to have another targeting called come up\nRight here in order to wander yeah but that doesn't mean that was held up to helmet contact and he left the ground yeah\n[noise] yeah [noise] but it but it's but it's not different because it's still destructive to the other person is playing the game and that's what they're trying to get rid of they want you tackling say one shoe making contact physically for not trying to Maine\nFor issuing hits the may end up with that result three six five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty for a one star six hundred over here like and are showing his next meal took her cat Hawkeye had all shot or do you think tonight [noise] they\nGot it was just want to let people don't talk about survivor and very often but there were a little biased we're up here in Mount Vernon so we've been watching ... play it for several years up here and he's just a he's a great kid he's huge he's athletic\nMom I didn't get to see the whole game today but he blocked on outside zone play today took like three guys out handled low so last year in that Ohio State game\nReally well just interested to hear what you think of is a set of other stuff is performance so far in his career and and what do you think that the teacher my old for him to the college career and maybe beyond that also maybe sandwiches mentioned power doughnuts and [laughter]\nI got the wings here that's why I was worried about every little bit ago region in men grabbing\nYou know on on with her in a way to nothing man I mean this afternoon and [laughter]\nI was out in the wind was picked up a little bit man I rode across the street a couple of times diet and going to hear what I I probably wouldn't recognize any more what I write [laughter]\nIf you believe what you're saying yeah you ever that might lead you to that conclusion but All right John thanks so much for joining in here and a contributing on the altar forget Hawkeye\nHuddle tested worth [noise] guys beast [noise] had like the kid on the first game\nWill be [noise] took give them a little bit I guess I Would say to get back in there but [noise]\nYeah what the um side was three twenty six three six for once you once you get a little over three ten doesn't really matter yeah it doesn't matter down a certain point I mean uh [noise]\nI like the kid because he's athletic I had to have to see him play a few times in high school I'm\nI'm just a great kid overall just personality smart kid um [noise]\nIn any just athletic and use a freak of a beast in terms of his the athleticism and it's hard to find a kid like that at the feet I think he was also a wrestler as well in high school and um [noise]\nI like the kid I still need some developing obviously on this level but I I mean I have nothing but the great things to say about him in terms of his his athletic billions playing one of the tougher positions on that old line as well and for the record six five three twenty yeah right on the money\n[noise] okay so [noise]\nFor for me right to somewhere else has a shot put her in a wrestler which means two things she as solid hips\nOne [noise] see as solid hips the second thing would be his hips are ex most if he can use that [noise] okay [noise] once you take that combination of seizing explosives in his ability to bend so that you can use your hips to power your body you get an ... you get a different level of athlete\nSitting in an NFL locker room [noise] everybody around you you just look around and everybody is freakish in some way you have a super power of some sort or whatever it is you can read things faster you have better vision things show up in color to you you have a pinkie finger that works like a some I don't\nI just really hope that we peek at the right time where we can put this whole thing together um and we're still kind of you know there's just bits and pieces of us right now the bill in the lab right now under you know on the bigger issue\nYou know look at the numbers for interceptions seven tackled Spurlock including five sacks [noise] I mean\nThe pets is that have loved to have that kind of production and they're not real friends I catch\nHim with his mouth [laughter]\nNo you're absolutely right I I'm not being I'm I'm not being critical at all I I don't measure critical\nI just [noise] I just I just felt like there were times where I thought uh [noise] maybe we could be a little bit better than\nWhat you're looking at all and we'll pay I mean I thought we have been better situation than what we work\nThat they were going to three hundred and twenty totally arts two hundred and thirty four of them through the air uh let me ask you this Tom does this make a difference to you at all I was started [noise] to [noise]\nFreshman quarterback for the first time since two thousand [noise]\nSo do you care to take a guess who was starting as true freshman quarterback in two thousand [noise]\nA couple of guys by the name of Benny sap and Bob Sanders [laughter]\nSo how do they ever got about Benny but I I was thinking about Bob\n[noise] does that easier concern a little bit of time in literally I was not been as inexperienced in the defense of back field as they work today since the early days of the ... parents Sarah okay\nYou know one of them had to ...\nYeah well the other one I had one pic\nOr brands had one and a and bought mom who and I thought branch twenty a lot like Josh Jackson but thanks for checking in time it takes five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty four I Want to start six hundred over here like for true freshman quarterback will\nFirst time on the field basically first time on the field starting ... rather than go your first time on the field\nI remember that I Do remember was it was it was an exciting experience for me so much that ah I didn't get much playing time afterwards\nIn ... and here's what happened and I know how much time with that but I Try to get through it really quick um that was the second string pullback freshman year a freshman year got just came up my Richards was a freshman and I hadn't anticipated playing very much\nSo on the sideline I was I was paying attention to the game but I really wasn't paying attention because I really didn't think that I was going to get in the game so out of nowhere I'm\nRichard Bass was the was the starting pull back and um [noise] for some reason he had to come out of the game so coach comes over and kinda coach fry a coach Jackson comes over all your accent if you have\nTo say is Lou Montgomery [noise] am I what\nI was\nI was on the sidelines drinking all the Jews you know so I got my God I got I got a full belly full of like you said okay wait a minute the crowd waiving through the crowd\nHi mom everybody and everybody I so I called me and it's just [noise] I think you got to get in the game so of course cry\nIs it going to close fries locals Franco's fry a lotta times called the place so he sends me in to the game folks and it gives me probably the longest pull a\nMean the entire played [laughter] so\nI'm standing there and it's like pro right Seventy five X Y Z and squirrels squirrel that wiggle that\nOK ban literally pushes me out to about mid to hash marks where the one the one hand and and I and the clock is ticking and I get about too that have marks and ... and realized that I forgot everything goes just said [laughter]\nI think the thing that was just that it's gone okay\nSo now I have to make a decision do I go back in ... for clarification or do I continue to the auto and risk either a timeout probably or delay again you know I Am not having the best interest of the team in mind not wanting to burn a year at a time out or\nOr caught the team five yards you I'm I'm On national TV I'm In the front and Seventy thousand fans and\nI'm going to the huddle [laughter] no idea what no idea what the ...\nSo I Walk into this huddled then I'm unfamiliar with because I've never played on that stage before [noise] and ah all the guys are looking at me like okay are you going to see some more ... and I'm sitting in a huddle literally like um [noise]\nOh bad guys and I'll listen real close okay [noise]\nUm [noise] a pro right check with me and that was the best I had which was telling the quarterback that he can call it whatever you want to go out Rogers lose Matt Rogers at a time and ah they looked at me like that doesn't sound like I'm like come on man we got to go [noise]\nSo then they make matters even worse [noise]\nHi I'm New Britain huddled break Matt gets to the line and any checks to a different\n[noise] formation formation off the air is audible lies [noise] so now I'm In my stance I forgot the ... [noise] the audible I just said you know it does something that I knew [noise] only to realize that the color that he called the dummy call you up [laughter]\nI don't mean color with W colors and then on top of that to make matters worse [noise]\n... got the snap count\nSo that the step out what to do not\nCount was to I went on one now you're outside now I'm On the side and other online and a coach fried just shaking his head coach Jackson just is beyond himself and I am still literally standing there like okay\nThis is so so the wave to me just stay in the game right so I'm like wow [noise]\nOkay great [noise] stay in the game they bring in another player\nAnd uh I kinda got the groove of things after that but after we didn't pick up the first town [noise] so the walk from where we were at to the sideline was really to me felt like about Fifteen miles [noise]\nBecause that was the longest walk ever at Jackson was standing there in [noise]\nAnd yeah so I was practiced the next week oh Iran so many cross ills and stares and study that play book man I Know that play but didn't they have bet you do\n... to go after rumble [laughter] what do you want to what degree ... three pop out oh yeah that was late right there ... so that was my experience folks [noise]\nHow was your first a trip to the field trial it was very on glorious them yes you didn't forget the play I did not forget the play because I didn't know what to do when the play started because I was playing defense for the first time really yes at outside linebacker against Penn State\nCow Brady was just a man monster [noise]\nSo I'm standing up in front of him in there about the snap the ball and I'm like okay what they say now I got to step forward and shoot my hands [laughter] and shove him back and then find\nThe ball and sounds easy enough right simple\nShove it back [noise]\nI've got this [noise]\nI Am one bad freshmen from Canada yeah already and we're going to play outside linebacker huh well you know I've been practicing it outside linebacker ... Sam backer and and the five to scheme where you stand up and so I've been practicing so I felt that was pretty confident and you know [noise]\nAnd you know but the thing was I didn't have to go against the senior tied in to Austin in practice no because I was on the varsity side of the same so I was going against the freshmen\nTight and believing that that's how it works out there when you go you know you get out on the field in game day we were on game day against Penn State Lu I Know I it doesn't work that way no\nYou see when you get against the varsity tied into the nose thanks [laughter] you might not know yet\nWhat the varsity ... do a outside linebackers they know that stuff too so they can fight against each of me except for my hands on I'm driving back find the ball so lots of illegal wrong nothing\nNothing is simple and yeah size ball snack I get grabbed [laughter]\nMy heart radio now makes it easier to listen to all your favorite ... nobody for another ... all the biggest names in ... can't think can be part of the heart rate went literally thousands of them like NPR all lined up behind gaps including the radio but just data ESPN thirty or thirty ... and big names like ... how that works the New York times billion mark Mary Jo Robin ...\nAll available birth rate now your favorite radio ... can be your favorite time can't dance\nDownload her up in the heart rate went and found the gas down just start exploring [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nI mean almost his easy an open until December seventh visit one plan for me dot com slash I Am a choice [noise]\n[noise]\n... three years at a quarterback [noise] he's a converted tight in six for two hundred and forty pounds lost you're going to put up [noise]\nAnd pick it up he's back to pass fires down on the sideline Iowa Minnesota [noise] I don't I don't think I spoke to so called football dude and I think it's truly a sprint show I think Julie is ... got it\nAnd in fact he did that was the first interception for Julia ... as a Hawkeye what in the world the wildcat quarterback was doing but ... football up I have no idea but that he did and I was turned it into a turnover\nHandle the Hawkeye bring flight back in fact I just got a report from the shoe guy Greg Moore says that Ford is the patiently back in Iowa near Mason city so he's returning safe and sound on armed\nTo Iowa City for the fourth year in a row [noise]\nForty eight to thirty one any little tremor on the isle surfer cat Hawkeye huddled it is truly a family affair tonight Trevor your mom and dad came all the way from Alberta, Canada to see a little earlier my dad my sister Justin shown up Tommy fears well Lou your wife is here we've got the gang back together tonight I guess to celebrate the when yeah\nYeah it's a nice man it's always great to see family such good friends now it away happier showing up [noise] um I if I'm not ... I'm not responsible for no I've ever done my salad here's what\nI ate it so quickly right because you see it got ya uh-huh [laughter] I'm just saying\nAre you saying it's like I'm a hobbit all the punch where like you know you move so fast it was\nIt it it she brought it out you guys are over ... chit chat and doing your thing the masses and then next thing you know I sat was gone man and then at the amazing ladies when show up ...\nI Can't let that wins the waste though it's got a hug since outside jab okay bye week okay improvement\nI you know this is one of the better by week that we've had historically to be perfectly honest with you that that come off of a by we we basically historically have not done real well this year I think we did much better job of ah getting our guys prepare so I I\nI like it I liked the improvement that like the tenacity these guys came up but not only coming off the ... going on the road for the first time that was different [noise]\nI thought that played a little bit into you know ... we're typically a third or fourth quarter kind of team that you know will kind of\nWay around with you for the first second quarter is if we can come in and make a judgment that half time and then the third fourth quarter at least this year we've been able to really kind of on and kind of where people down or teams down but um\nI thought we did a nice job overall complete complete game today still some things that work on but for the most part\nI'm I'm pleased covered by weight improvement [noise] ... [noise] well utilized as we've certainly sat here before after ... weeks in fact just the opposite [noise]\nThing I think that we were able to do there were several things I noticed one there was times where ... and\nA map and that's wrong to feel the same time which happened a little bit against Iowa State and mhm but I think I think it just became more of a thing mhm and I think they worked on it do this by we cook right um the other thing is I think is a\nIt became bacon system thing with this vertical passing game and utilizing the wide receivers and that that that marinating that happens you know [noise]\nSee I I mean it's more set on the welfare seed post game microphones told us earlier that it's experienced it allowed us to click today so you don't forget that right well that makes\nOf experience has to be like given the time to flourish in ... and practice [noise] frightened that vertical passing them has to be put in and you have to put those guys down to feel that far and say quarterback your first read is this guy down the field [noise]\nAnd I think there was some opportunities even today that we didn't take advantage of even down the hill where a guy like either ... was there was so easily was it it may go had made a movement was open ... in\nJust Stanley dismiss him within a series of his regrets and so this is still some opportunity there but to Trump's when I Love the fact that we're stretching people Berkeley I think that's going to open up some think intermediate leap war between the line back from the state each\nAnd uh I think that's going to be very beneficial going into a really\nExplosive\nOffense and defense with Indiana coming in next week I had to tell you that scene throw ... easily [noise]\nThat was incredible that's what I mean\nThat was a heck of a thoroughly put it right on the money just in time before the defender coming across the field was able to get there an absolute picked a thing on [noise] yeah it was a big jump through\nWell that's one where you sort through\nRight you got to get it there quickly because it can hang out you know we don't want the floater over to the left let them do that yeah we saw what happened when you do that\nNot good things that we are either for true freshman quarterback I'd even they're picking on him all day long and then it through one of those up there in ... ... in the end zone yeah [noise]\nYeah Yes sir but to the well once you many times on that one voice yeah how about this a high number a path to\nA way in which rises every day where you don't know what they're doing or are you voting pro game time [noise] um so whether that was running of all we had with those games whether it was you know if you're going to run the ball in German born you know it changed a\nYou know we're here [noise] so they didn't plan to do it Minnesota kind of forced him to do it when they took away the wrong but I Will was capable of doing it and Stanley finishes the date twenty three thirty nine three hundred fourteen yard for touchdowns did uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "07"}
