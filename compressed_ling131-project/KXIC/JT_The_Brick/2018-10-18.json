I was a program that a\nTerrific coach is really good players but you you want to see if proven every weekend September he wants to tend to get better as just tap her a progress is and what October November get here for that that that aid game seven game stretch drive the guys are going on all cylinders and that you know to buy amateur eye it looks like that's happening\nI think that's her and um you know or give you an illustration that guy like Corker has he's not going to improve dramatically a cause he's played so much football forest but you know we have a lot more guys that aren't like that more guys that are\nA plan and their first second years and uh the good thing about being young inexperienced as you really have a chance to have more dramatic change an improvement [noise]\nAh but it but it all starts goes back to practice again how you approach practice or you know you're really focus on the things that you need to be doing and everybody's got an individual less so the the guys will do that concentrate on that and really work on it when they're out there in the ...\nAnd then go studying you know that that's a that's our guys improve so we talked about that all the time and um you know we've got got better and guys like Parker [noise]\nBucky can render but we are a lot of other guys are really that Ross Reynolds is a senior so you're seeing it hasn't really are starting to game until this year and then he played in a bunch last year but not a full season so this is a a learning process for him and um you know so you get everybody whether it's got like Ross or\nUm you know a younger guy and a red shirt freshman or a guy like Trojan horses in his second year on campus\nYou know that that's out themes improving but it starts at the top of their thinking on how they work you measure that\nIt's not a big shake your class for Thirteen fourteen guys are\nClearly they're doing their job leading these younger guys bringing up a law\nThat they really are and um you know I didn't know necessarily not not good or bad not bad by an arena Murray's not stretch but\nI'm back in the spring and it's kind of when spring ball you go out in your practice nothing really is cohesive you just kind of working on the individual part of things uh but it early during the summers where things started to come together and typically a good teams at least the standards of the guys at the poor guys down and\nReally kind of make sure everybody's on the same page and then I can mention a lot of guys whether it's named Stanley Anthony Nelson I'm TJ and all of those guys are all\nGuys that are are juniors that are acting like seniors and Brady Ross another guy so you know that's that that's how things start to to really take place and you know it's been a process but I think we're we're going to move in the right\nDirection but speaking of radio glad you mentioned employees he passed so solid for us [noise] so sad that he got hurt last Saturday and editing at a game but it's like a [noise]\nHe'll be out for a week or two yeah ... unfortunately income so he's in a book still on\nUm [noise] you know he'll be back as soon as he possibly can he's a combat in God and nobody wants to men are more than him [noise]\nAnd and it's interesting and we'll talk about him for a second you know full backs don't get much no ah for August reasons they don't play an awful lot and then when they do it's not a a glamorous jobs typically [noise]\nBut you know what he does the as opposed to what he does on special teams and then you're talking about a dynamic leader he is one of our our real dynamic leaders mainly just by by who he is but he's not afraid to say what he thinks and I still respect by everybody so [noise]\nYou know again that's that's not one of the first guy you would look to the same weather is one of our top guys but he really is because he just contribute so much and we'll miss him on Saturday and hopefully get back\nTo Kelly jumped in there and I saw those like say double Kirk they're built the same way I was as tough as the other and therefore I'm sure they help each other out every day in practice waiting for their ...\nBut they do an Austin's really improved he's one of our more ... over the past ... months in my mind and a part of that was him because he's got the right in front of them but ah yeah Austin's on a really good job he'll play well Saturday and he'll he'll plant special teams don't do a good job\nHurt or if you put up a almost five hundred yards fetch last weekend against a Indiana or the office has been really honor roll here a neighborhood obviously used at the center of that with\nA three four if straight games with three hundred plus\nA TV screen or his ... me and my binoculars a Polack\nWatches the play and then he turns to the TV monitor\nWhich is as good as a as he likes the delayed because it's like a slow motion replay for him\nHe he commented on what he sees that he's always right as you know and then he looks to replace a and then he adds another little uh uh salt pepper spice to it that's why a total lack of so good I mean he wouldn't need a TV camera but I've ever worked with anybody better Neal is pretty sharp and a lot of areas\nAs I understand it and I remember a ... and he was an outstanding real estate's than when he was in school here but [noise] um you know he's got a gun on believable and for football and understands the the mentality and the\nPsyche of the players and all those type of thing he's really got a great gift that way\nWell he'll be fired for homecoming this weekend as you know a ... it's quite one thing to be able to play the game at the level he did do it as well as he did uh we see him every weekend that everybody can make that transition to the radio or TV boots and\nRelive that moment for the listening audience ...\nThat ah I only got ... exactly right and not all those guys can go to coaching either and most of them are too smart to do that but uh yeah the radio and TV thing that people don't understand how hard that is you know just how much work it takes preparation and\nUh my experience has at least you know you can really tell the people that are going to go somewhere and I'm going back Twenty years ago now but yeah the the the good guys are really prepare a say guys guys were women uh Beth ... that our job was the last week or a or a game and she did or a wonderful job as a real professional\nBut you can tell the ones that really work at a study of uh when they come in and visit with the you know you can tell they earn their homework they know what they're talking about it all shows it's like anything else if you prepare and do well and it shows but it\nHad just got a great understanding it's unbelievable and I'm I'm Still blows my mind that you give her term punch he's a huge huge guy for [laughter] you know do that if it's ... the it can be good at it\nHe uh he uh he's proud that he's had his playing way now which is two hundred and Eighteen pose as six foot to imagine tackling him that is a big guy or having his elbows are sharp\nArmstrong and he's the best of old buddy boy I'd say the same abide by the hamster or who is just the best I basketball coverage [noise] uh [noise]\nUh let's go to our some of our questions here from the crowd or a Carlos Kelly's we get this one actually Kirk a bill that wants to know how many pieces of gum you go through during games [noise]\nThat's an easy one it's roughly three to four pieces treated for a quarter and the less I start mixing the cough drops in a well try them out of the point that starts early\nIf you get going out of hack attack which I found that outcome or do you chew gum during practices too I Do yeah I go there but I made full disclosure here [noise] ah that's about a pack a practice a pack a practice okay when it gets to ten or twelve something like oh that sounds like a copyright issue there for me I think you ought to have that as a practice\nTheir parents pack of ... there you go up\nAs a ... I don't think we are getting free gummy so maybe [laughter]\nWhat may have to talk about it and uh we get somebody here the ... can you give a shout out to mom shown to\nWear here celebrating her last day of radiation treatment for breast cancer [noise] she's a lifelong fan has hardly missed a home game she's been a season ticket holder just eighty five were is Joan Joan welcome congratulations John [noise]\nEighty five is a great year she brought us good karma [noise] it was a great year thank you keep redoing\nThose season tickets because if you met a season ticket holder since eighty five that number one versus number two at the hawks urban planning and ever since we had the best of luck good watch uh Joan God Bless you a with a new freshmen rule are there specific players\nThat you want to see a game action and the next few weeks ago ... here from a\nA coral bill we've talked about that new rule which really gives you some flexibility [noise] it's any four games yeah so you're you're looking at that shirt every week to see who's played in what game yeah they're they're really like a handful of\nGuys right now are a big handful I guess a couple of guys obviously are already playing you know we made the move with a\nA ... at the corner positions those guys are in the water there in the in the deep and swim in a way\nOr the you know some of the other guys have been in one or two gives me two games and you look at a situation like we have right now we've got a couple of linebacker still out [noise]\nSo you're special teams especially started getting run or in a little then so a guy like villains oil might be working on number two and a special team area of the nice thing about the rule is if if we have to go on and play him you know it's not going to cost him as you're a Belgian ability [noise] uh but I think in those situations just using him as an illustration\nOr the more we can hold off on that the better and that way in November it gives us a lot more flexibility goes you know we've we've had some injuries obviously already I'll predict we'll have more November So the more we can bank those games\nOr what the guys that were concerned that's that's kind of our strategy and then uh yeah November I think you'll see pride in anywhere from maybe three to five guys actually out there on the field\nOr helping us when the whole point when we're not going to put them out there just to put them out there they have to be able to help us when\nAn interesting approach a Tyrone Tracy's played in one game Nicole regaining who you're really high on a future wide receiver has played into games [noise] Henry guile played early in a couple of games you've been kind of holding him out here of lakes ah [noise] as I think that\nThat's a good illustration too because we have three back so we feel comfortable with a plan all three guys are doing a great job unfortunately [noise] or at least one of them's men out\nProbably four maybe five of the games I don't know so [noise] now who is your third back into being and again we're able to do that without a putting anybody's the eligibility arrests so I think that's a great role I still think they ought to slip freshman letter by play\nFive years [noise] good point and then go from there [noise] uh I've read Kelly a hope to have got to see how he's out of ... so knock on wood so tolerant and a guy at\n... I'm not going to call to three headed monster yet but getting over three pretty solid backs\nCould all do different things you know they're all doing a good job and they were talking earlier in the program about a inexperienced players all three of those guys came in relatively inexperienced and [noise]\nUm you know obviously there's some trepidation there when when you have guys in touch and the ball frequently that haven't played a lot\nI think we're all over that and all three of those guys have really earned our trust and more importantly I think that the maze recognize that there are really good players and they're all working extremely hard\n[noise] coaches cedar Carlos ... Kelly is uh [noise]\nIt's just a painting the windy forecast Saturday I've heard more talk today about the when the that's expected a game time are you practicing outside to get accustomed to the expected windy conditions\nYeah we took a drag says that any way so that that's another big issue and it's been breezy the last two days to enjoy all say that you know or a third order words I made eight thirty [noise] um [noise] so it's been chilly but [noise] ah it's been windy but not not to the degree they're talking about and\nThat's yes there is a first I'd heard of that good news it's it's just the ones they announced that things do change but sure that that's part of playing football and uh you know especially in the Midwest and or or the northeast there's certain parts of our country we're going to deal with when during the cold weather so we're like the ... [noise]\nUh and it is I think I think I still believe it's the biggest factor in any outdoor sports uh whether it's golf not that annoying about golf the Gulf football baseball\nOr you know one can be a huge factor in [noise] so it's good to be conditioned to it\nAnd you adjusted uh on the fly a NATO\nOr what kind of issues with the Maryland office presented is similar to Georgia Tech [noise] when we play them on the Orange Bowl uh we were talking before you got here about uh [noise] the last two weeks you face pass happy officers some out of necessity some that's what they do a this was a totally different game plan is\nVery different and I used to Georgia Tech comparison the other thing I guess yesterday uh seems like three weeks ago [noise] but uh anyway it just um it's it's not going to look like that to to our fans but to what it's going to look good comparison there is you really have to know your responsibility\nWhen you play an option to Michael at Georgia Tech is if you don't have a guy covering every base and exactly and the red spots full may hit the plays on your [noise]\nSo the comparison is with a Maryland in my mind at least these guys do a lot of shifting a lot of motion and the jets sweet package where a lot of guys you know raise some through there and obviously that affects the what's going on the fence all these do first and foremost it starts out with guys recognizing the formations\nAnd then there's a lot of communication has to go on after a call gets made because they're going to be moving around and doing stuff for the words shifting motion and all that stuff requires communication so you gotta love and does it have to get the same\nUh same adjustment and signal and then most importantly they got a point when the ball gets that but it all happens really fast and it's very tough to to simulate in practice 'cause you know we we don't do that all that often for SARS got team to do it uh it's a real challenge\nThe nice thing about Georgia Tech is that we have time to train her Scott teams or or ... got a good look at it [noise] uh it's tough for us to duplicate in practice what we're going to Saturday So\nThat's where the mental work really comes on these guys have to really do a good job in the meetings and you know the most important one you know what you see on a lot of times because of all this stuff you see the bees you're not a position above back will break through the scrimmage and you know if you don't have good angles to the ball\nAll of a sudden we're should be arguing or a ten year arguing ends up in the in the end zone and um [noise] you know just that that happens fast so\nAh I Can't remember planting that has so many big place you know like um [noise]\nBecause it's like it's like sixty Dr seuss me sixteen they've at sixteen drives over sixty yards and all but two of those they've had at least one if not too explosive type poison it so\nYou know you just you see those you know twenty yard game sixty five you're again it's just really you don't see that a lot in [noise] and that that kills you the sense of what if you're not\nYou know anything can happen and then he sticks to those that's just the nature of college football especially in the big ...\nStuck on half of the season or\nThe light backers earlier a I heard your comments yesterday\nLooks like jak Koch a day is that going to be ready to strike but did the name of it might be\nJak coming along but not ready to play doesn't have the confidence or not quite strong enough yet and Nick on the other hands in good shape you know he's just he was\nResponding well last friday we thought looked pretty good and ready to play yet but uh you know came up the price Monday and he has he's at no reservations but he's doing a good job and [noise] good good to get him back in the boat certainly and you know that that the guys have been doing a good job you know I'm a Christian waltz a Welsh jumped in there\nAt the middle linebacker position last Saturday a primarily worked at the well positioned fall spring summer all that type of thing and jump right in there did a great job so uh you know we're seeing a lot of guys do a lot of different things on the team to help the cause yet we're we're still getting good production were stillborn cohesive Leon [noise] that's good because there's so many new challenges we\nSure will a body Jones or the way they run the ball a ... could be a real factor this week\nIt will definitely uh [noise] you know you can see 'em out there in the field some so you know he's he's a guy that to some some guy's pretty well on the run spin on a great job on special teams to\nAustin has some nice just said you're on Twitter at very dolphins [noise] coach I leave the country and passing yards a third down I was unaware of that do that with that one I best what factors have gone into that it has your play calling\nApproach on third downs changed this year well it's nice when you come up thirty two and three versus\nFederal is elderly that always helps to the situations are the distance the situation certainly is a big factor in [noise] I'll go back to what we talked about earlier just think in general are often is right now we go to a lot of lot of guys that have more experience than we had a year ago and uh you know\nThe quarterback it's a lot of credit or blame for you know what is happening or what is happening\nIn certain there's all sorts of the quarterback but but every other piece of the puzzles really important and\nYou know you got to have a a pithy or senior playing quarterback and there's nobody to throw two that makes it a little bit of a challenge and [noise] ah you know if he's not being protected so [noise] I just think we're more cohesive experience football in the way we're going our Arthur dumb percentages of conversions and then for Duncan versions are reflecting that\nIndeed almost fifty percent forty four Ninety a third down that's off the off the church uh the harsh for eight of twelve our third down last week it at Indiana [noise] uh Larry wants to know coaches Ernie difficulty going from the two thirty or seven o'clock kick total eleven AM kick you've got to the road\nYeah we are talking about that a lot of the players and then it\nIt ... we a practice in in pre season in August that the various times just for that that same reason so will\nYou know how to seven o'clock practice where they got to hang around during the day and we'll have to almost as what's going to be like we play games\nSo this year we've kinda gone up and down the scale we um when things start out at two thirty then we went to a four o'clock then went to like a six thirty or something like that than a seven forty and we started coming back down the ladder again I think we had a a three thirty or whatever it was and then a\nThird of the matter of Moses interact last week I Know it was new and uh you know east eastern time which obviously is eleven o'clock central time so now we're right back to eleven which used to be the standard time but uh yeah just all you know we tell them every Monday what the kickoff times going to be in your somebody wants to use as an excuse\nFor that performance and leave right now I mean that's just that's ridiculous but\nThat is college football it's a good question 'cause than pro football's the same way you know that the networks tell you when you're going to play as you'd like to say [noise]\nYou get twelve Saturday get twelve gauge uh and hopefully get a thirteenth doesn't matter what time they go out there and when a we'll be back to wrap it up for this week's call a rock talk with coach Vance right after this [noise]\nMan there is nothing like home field advantage is just something about looking out there and the crowd and seeing nothing ... red\nAnd green and blue and gold in ...\nYeah the ... better to no matter the color of your favorite teams played for truly does

last night we want your opinions on this uh Kevin Duran there's all types of talk I've heard it and talking to different people around the league that he's going to leave the warriors after this season well last night when the warriors\nGave out their championship rings obviously ring night like every team does on the first night of the season in in their game against Oklahoma City\nThey announced Kevin Duran last\nThey usually reserve that for Steph Curry but last night was Kevin Durant and nobody has admitted this but a lot of people are reading into it that that was just a little subtle recruiting\nOf Cady like you know you're going to get an ounce glass you're you know find those in VP and so some people are saying that's golden state's first step in recruiting him so we want to throw it out\nTo you eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six sixty three sixty nine\nWhat should ... in your opinion what should Kevin Durant do should this be as last season with Golden State or city stay there and try to win four five six championship rings or city look to go elsewhere Rob what do you think\nI think it should stay on the bronze way and stop him from winning you should stay in their own state and just continue to do what they're doing\nAnd I don't know four years of low bronze outside a four year contract stick the same amount of yours is little wrong one will be three or ... like this one two three years and then after that see well abroad news and then decide okay now go to New York all go to somewhere else\nBut that he should keep that up and and just if he ever wants to be considered the greatest player ever well that's his challenge there is a is to stop all abroad from winning and if we can do that in Golden State and keep winning the MVP final people going to look at them and go to\nKatie is the best player in the league that's the only way you can get it done\nWell laughing look you said something that that certainly raised my eyebrows the greatest wherever you mean greater\nThan All right right right right 'cause I mean he's not you know no no no this is the ...\nBut yeah you're right better than the brunt I agree and direct thinks he's better than the bronze you should trust me\nHe thinks he is better or should they know why I don't know why why he thought that when he went to Golden State I this is not just because he has won the last two championships he thought that when he went to go and stay and was looking forward to meeting little brown and the final out playing him I agree with you now\nThe ... you know I agree that don't even think about going into the Lakers\nAnd helping Lubrano why in the world would you do that that's I don't you want to be viewed as better than the Bronx I'm One of those that doesn't I I don't really know\nIf Kevin ... ever be viewed as better than LeBron James but hey if Iran is his career with three rings and the ... is he is with five or six I mean hey the argument is\nAnd remember it happening all brawn James yeah Raul last happened when the ... there were contemporaries right they won't they were follows\nYou may you ate heartedly Waller brown rice was king but you were you in Burger King every day that it now you you don't you that that that is a good I mean now I Want to throw this by you you are a guy though\nThat doesn't necessarily like correct me if I'm wrong like when the ... went to go no I think you okay so you got him if he went to New York\nAnd want a ring no I wouldn't be mad I mean that would be huge now the one that is of order\nRight limit you gonna run with yeah you wouldn't know what a ring of ... four years or something when they get the other\nOne at the end and and I was talking to somebody in the league yesterday about this there's a sentiment in Golden State that case the that he's not going to in his in his career in Golden State\nBut that he probably they think he may stay next year to this year with a championship and then next year when they go into their new arena in San Francisco that he may stay for you know these next two years and play that first season in San Francisco and\nThen go out because he was a big part of building that thing getting build you know what the ... and and what these\nBut last year and he's been lightened it up business wise in Silicon valley wife oh he he loves it there and to your point if he stays in goes they\nTwo more years and wins championships that at the very least would assure him of having more than ... have you have so little versus three\nAnd ... at that point would only have one or two years later ... years left on his deal saying and then you'll be like ... now he's older\nHe has ... will nobody who are they getting have they gotten another big name if they didn't\nGet another one you go all the last two years he's older now father times catching up a good player a great player but it is not the grid\nAnd that's not petty I mean this is what this is about this competition absolute right that's not pay this is the guy you're\nMeasured against and you want to keep beating him I I don't have any problem with\nThat and

Angeles\nBad news is the chargers have already reportedly decrease their revenue goal for when they move into the new stadium\nThey were originally hoping to make four hundred million bucks they are now helping to make a hundred and fifty million dollars to having troubles can't sell them the yeah the PS cells um aren't going to be able to fill the joints so\nEvery every rising ... come on you know we knew everybody tells\nMe that everybody loves football and you can't get into football and yet their team struggling to sell tickets are sold anybody love for\nHim I said well first of all in LA on a Sunday it when it's gorgeous during the season everybody's got a million things to do we also have NFL Sunday ticket we also all have\nTeams from other places that were our teams growing up that were around and you've got out of the rams there you've still got you know the raiders whether you want to go up north for them or eventually had to use\nThe excuse that skews you honestly that USC and UCLA\nWho go to football has altered and I haven't been to a game yet or charges home game but I have heard that it's a tremendous fan experience just because of the stadium so small oh it's great I've\nBeen yeah yeah and and actually it was I mean I enjoy going down at Qualcomm I mean the stadium was old and dumping but to you know fans there were very loyal are they still weren't selling out the place that you know a lot of people were ticked off that they moved up to LA and so a lot of the uh the southern fans didn't want to travel up a couple of counties north\nAlso they should have paid for and build a new stadium above that you just said it was dumpy call call\nCall exactly well San Diego should happen again same thing the span of his family didn't have the money and and I think they were they were cheap to do it I don't think they were as broke as the Davis's but ah but I I don't think they had a plethora of you know cash falling out of their pockets that\nBut at the same thing I don't think they ever felt like they had to because so many counties across the country the the um\nPoliticians have and owners of the teams have convince citizens that they needed to pay for a new stadium and I think as much money as the NFL Owners rake in I think they need to pay for the stadiums [noise]\nAll right I agree with that yeah All right double thanks a lot you that will talk to you tomorrow the odd couple of Chris Broussard Rob Parker will come you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on your car

saw Robert Parker now any men can challenge their hot table one on one that's easy but what are you going to do when you got two very domineering\nVoices coming down on you\nThey are doing just stepping into the ring today sitting in the hot seat Fox Sports radio host and host of the air and tourists more spot gas parents tours and say was up to the film [noise]\nA raw guys nice to hear from you although I Will say I don't know if there's anything domineering about Robert Parker's or you know voice\nOr oh you have to go on and you know what I got I got some barbecue sauce to put on your back [laughter] oh okay\nYou can only some wings after that we don't even have a ... going you're still going to let me\nSee oh there we go [laughter] target and I you know this work you've got thirty seconds to prove your hot is take the guys who wrote but you got to get one more time around airing are you ready to step into the hot seat\nOh I Am ready to\nSell right here we go his first tank so hot we can't even get it out he thinks the Dallas Cowboys are going to win the NFC East air and you got thirty seconds to say you take [noise]\nHow about my cowboy look it hasn't been pretty it hasn't been a four star but there are three and three they are one Jason Gallagher a punt away from being foreign to and on a three game winning streak people talk about how bad this office but it is that how that is often it's getting\nBetter every single week the defense has been phenomenal and of course they are getting healthy ... could be back as early this week\nHowever the real reason is not so much the cowboys but everybody else in that division you I'm manning his career has been done for three years Washington they're counting on Alex Smith in Adrian Peterson which sounds like a great game plan\nFor dollars in aid on many Eighteen I Know\nLook you're right about the division of being a week it is horrible but the Philadelphia Eagles defending Super Bowl champs you talking about the Dallas Cowboys getting it together Philadelphia is getting it together which quarterback would I rather have\nPrescott even at its best\nOr a a Carson went\nThree quarters of audience I'd rather\nCarson when Philadelphia is getting better Dallas don't get it don't get excited about what they did the Jacksonville Jacksonville is in a rut and Doug my role in the head coach even admitted as much today\nAn aberration they know beat Philadelphia in his division\nIs this I don't know gay hey\nAs soon as Aaron ... skip Bayliss that's what I Want to know are you wearing your Dallas Cowboy pajamas cause your home or you're not looking at this for real look and see and take a look at this team has won anything courses on Aaron since Nineteen Ninety six\nAnd also take a look at the idea that that person got don't be fooled whatever was that you saw this past Sunday\nQuarterback and he's got nobody to throw to on top of\nWell I Would say first of all the pajamas or in the wash would I Do have my uh Kobe easily Jersey on here well first of all it's really\nCold guys I asked ... to ...\nI haven't I haven't seen a sequel as life was his beliefs as we can at Bernie's\nTo their debt they don't care they they\nCould have lost to Atlanta they should have lost to the cold and by the way I don't know if he started back into that schedule Korea there last for on the road they start to go to New Orleans Jew the rams cowboys last\nThree in the cold and the giants all three teams taken ... not in seven division champs baby skip let's go\nThat route one of the hot seat points taken away from the odd couple because they all look alike at all my father was like ten seconds ... seconds into my fellow isn't even your turn so that the biggest reason why I wasn't on zone after Chris' Errol done what am I on or you know one\nSince Christ in Rob you guys want to jump in there and defend your take so much but when you guys not secrets you actually\nThink that even though the lawyers are already going to win a third straight title\nThis season is still compelling in the NBA tell us why you got thirty seconds to say\nIncredibly compelling look how we don't know how the journey is going to turn out the Los Angeles Lakers dad for the last five years now you've got the best player in the world you got Brandon Ingram emerging as the star let's see what the Lakers\nIs going to be exciting to watch the got collide Leonard fresh off basically a year off because of injury into Renault a really tough team in the eastern Congress\nCan they challenged the Boston Celtics do oh by the way Jason tight emerging as a star gourmet we're back from years off injury Kyrie Irving back from injury I mean that seems exciting to watch\nLive beat in business is going to turn into I could go on in the storyline about storyline\nBugs or stopping\nYou asked me you got nothing to say errors you go\nOh I'm Sorry I didn't know this is my current here's the thing you talk about the journey Chris but here's the bottom line we know how it's going to end with the warriors what is the fourth championship in five years three in a row Robin I have been on this forever Kevin Turan has killed this leak is killed any level of competitive balance\nI you know look the Boston Celtics are great I Love Jason Tam I sit on your ... two years ago Chris Broussard he should be the number one overall drastic but when he's going up against Kevin Turan when Kyrie is going up against that it doesn't matter the wars are again going to sweep the finals the journey isn't fun when you already know what the and looks\nLike we know at the end looks like\nThere's no doubt about it Chris you're crazy you're trying to fool yourself into believing something's happening here let me tell you you're ready\nAnd the Titanic kids the iceberg at the end that's what happens is going to they're going to hit the Golden State warriors lose look brawn James you say is that the best player on the planet and\nHe can't even get into a competitive bottled they've lost eight out of nine games we already know and to add to that they\nEdit boogie cousins if that wasn't enough there's nothing to see here\nThing you mentioned the Titanic did you go to see the movie Titanic\nOr I didn't have money that we get you didn't see them\n[laughter] no I did hear and did you see the movies out there and it never heard of it you\nKnow we we all knew how the ending was going to be but we loved it it was a great movie in fact every movie you know how it's done to it and not only do you do is going to end

his glove is over the wall and into the stands the fed does not reach onto the field of play you go on the rule book in major league baseball and it says and rightfully so it says that\nYou can call interference if a fan interferes with the ball in the field of play however this is from rule three Fifteen\nNo interference shall be allowed when a field or reaches over a fence railing rope or indoors than to catch a ball he does so at his own risk this is why I thought okay this is going to be overturned because look he bets clearly has his\nGlove hand over the fence and is ... is technically in the stands and somehow baseball even though I saw the replay you saw the replay we also the replay in New York they said oh inconclusive Joel West is correct\nAnd he took away a home run that should have been a home run apparently Joe West it's not Rob Manfred but Joe West is the most powerful man in baseball 'cause he can call that with the naked eye and say on the field that that was fan interference and that's ridiculous\nGuys like Joe wants to angel Hernandez keep getting playoff assignments and it's fun it's fun during the season 'cause they're crazy and they think everybody comes to watch them umpire and it's a fun quirky little story in when you get ... by angel Hernandez or Joe as you can kind of laugh at it because you're onto the next game but\nWhen it happens in the play offs and the ales yes and it could tilt the balance of the game you go\nReally what his major league baseball doing I mean really he makes the call and then it's not overturn I've seen calls overturned was way less evidence on bigger plays in the playoffs I've seen calls just completely missed on instant replay by major league baseball in New York I don't understand I I even I I\nFor part of this I get the job was because it's all about him but I don't get how they did not overturned that I really that that that that fought baffles me\nWe have a blatant rule ... I mean it's just explicit the way it's written out he's into the stands and yes he is his glove and makes contact with the fan and it close it as the ball arrives he's in their domain\nLike they they didn't run onto the field is isn't reaching over into the field of play overall it's it's looking that's going over the railing it it seems fairly obvious that they should have been a home run so now the fact that we after three innings seven three three tie a soul genus and drama\nFollows throughout right we had a lot of fun with the Machado stepping on\n... what the other day and\nI made the point immediately goes yeah he was Cadillac and and showing them up by leaving his foot there doesn't mean that you can measure him and then try to take out his Achilles' here you've got a ... and go to replay and make your decision right he gets fine we still scoring runs like a madman day after day in this particular case\nYou you look at these games are going to be hotly contested that one run\nWill most likely loom large as we get deeper into this one\nAnd now they're showing it again at almost as if on cue\nAs I'm speaking one more time of that's going up and might have caught the ball dream item still in the crowd and based on me the rule as it's written\nThat's a home run that is that and then they didn't ejected right if it's fan interference and you're saying he's interfered with a bad at all yeah isn't that on the ticket is adding that the notes that you're supposed to be thrown out no he was told he just don't do that hey\nLook Joe West is one of those guys who thinks everybody comes to the ballpark to see me umpire him in Asia Hernandez think that and they have this attitude of I Am God on this field not we're here to adjudicate and to be fair and\nCall the rules of the game right and wrong now I'm putting my own spin on things and sometimes empires get too powerful and that's what Joe was an angel Hernandez are there are guys who think well this is my interpretation of the rule no your job is not to interpret the rule your job is to make sure the rule is enforced it's in black and white it says right there\nYou reach into the stands no fan interference does it get more black or white than that I don't know how Joe West can stand to have a leg to stand on that and I don't know how major league baseball says oh yeah upon further review\nThat's still it's still an out now it's down let's call it what it is\nRight we we discussed at length yesterday or you can find the pod cast Jason Smith show by carbon I downloaded given five stars we love you forever and walk coast to coast to give you a hug but we talked at length about the controversy of\nFilming looking for signals and what a major league baseball do they punted mhm that will get into it as that goes on but they wanted they wanted nothing to you you know this is a big enough for them to do anything [laughter]\nYou got out and\nGoing back and forth multiple sources going at some of the best reporters in the game and saying they're incensed that there's no further development there's no further investigation ...\nThey're not going to do anything else for that and I know you could play and they'll talk about baseball instead of NBA opening I keep it going Fox Sports radio the Jason Smith show with my business read my Carmen live from the guy goes studios were Fifteen\nMinutes can save you Fifteen Percent or more car insurance for more information visit Geico dot com yes you want more on what should be the biggest scandal ... major league baseball and years and said baseball's decided\nThese are not the Georgia looking for there is nothing to see here\nWe haven't had coming up next as well as easy to eat\nMore on the night for the next next next next make mix it up by the way the end of the ads\nYeah Clinton ...

I don't ... then goes back to LA is to save I don't see them at all I don't see them together no I don't either I don't think he says I think New York is the place to go if he leaves\nEyes the AQAP of Fox Sports radio keep it a lot\n[noise]\nDiscovered ... anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why they think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving them a try discover will give new car members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget at the end of your first year they'll match all the cash back\nYou've earned dollar for dollar no cats and no catches try it and believe it I discovered dot com slash match only for a new car members limitations apply\nHey did you know the Honda Dream deal sales event is literally happening right now where you can literally get great deals on certified ...\n...
