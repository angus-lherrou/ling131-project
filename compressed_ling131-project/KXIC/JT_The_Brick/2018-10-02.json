easy decisions\nAre are um there's a lot of hard decisions that are made you know I called the game yesterday that that I'm looking at a third down decision for the Arizona Cardinals ever on a day and it's a third down and ... you know it's two minute warning and and they're coming up to minute warning and\nAnd you just know they're going to hand off the Seattle has time out and I'm like I Know what they're going to do is talk talking about Dick Stockton are the brick right but I'd love to see them on a booth cheap\nGive a you know give a a you know of a receiver in the flat and maybe a you know on over out underneath the uh you know a shallow crossing route\nAnd give your quarterback and often want to live on opposite the run and I don't want to stop clock with incomplete pass but it was right on the edge of you know ... along field goal and ended up missing the look on the end up losing the game that\nUm I understand that decision part of that those those are hard decision to

L. cliff welcome to the odd couple how you doing\nOh great I'm Glad you guys doing\nMan would do great oh you want to you on the radio now football now you've got a radio show what's going on\nMan I jumped right into it man right after I got got it out um tend to want every day or Iran K they are not fit you just talked to sports Mac giving my perspective on on what I what athletes are what I Believe you know we're thinking more so than you know a lot of people just assumed\nWell cliff it's funny there's a lot of athletes who were means to the media if when they didn't and they joined a mean later you weren't going to the media I Know that and I'm going to do that and the joy have you have a brother in arms now a\nBut Leno and writer let's get right to obviously the big story in Seattle um besides the struggles that the team as having is just you know early time is in in the fractured leg yesterday that he suffered out for the season\nUm how tough for you having been a team made it his obviously a member of a legion of boom ... the last the memory of him it feels\nLike and it's an in Seattle is going to be of him flipping the bird to decide the fans whoever that was how tough is that for you to see knowing the type of person he probably is\nAnd that's exactly right right for me I I that's my biggest concern is that that's going to be some was last the image of him or possibly the Seahawks Jersey but let's not forget\nYou know what I mean all the great things that he had done for this organization that he's been a part of\nMe being a part of one of the best defenses ever probably the last decade to you know when the first Super Bowl here in Seattle and just be on a top state in the league for such a long time um you know and I don't want people to to to you know\nThis credit all that he has done and then also\nLet's be real now anybody anybody playing a sport or anything you are you break a leg you can't think people are happy you know a lot of things are going through your head a lot of things uh emotions are are are is that you and you just react in I mean when he broke his leg last time he was talking about retired you know so obviously\nIs an emotional guy he feels some kind of way but you Kate discredit everything he's done in a meeting personally is an awesome guy he's a great person great father or you know you just don't want that to be the lasting memory\n... it was it a mistake to maybe come back if you were holding out and he gave\nIn came back and and now you know now he's heard not getting really what he wanted would've been better for him to stay out like lay beyond bell and not come back into absolutely have to\nYeah I mean it's like you're damned if you do damned if you don't write everybody's criticizing levy on for not being there and then okay you got another guy that that shows up a little late to camp and now he's hurt his value guys just went down\nSo it's it's a tough situation to be is pressure from both\nSides me personally obviously has been looking at it obviously would wish she's still able to get his money you wish you the only play for the rest of the year so you know if I was his teammate I'd love to have 'em out there but I also understand the business side of it if you decide you want to sit out that's what you do to to to be able to feed your family\nCliff you were in a similar situation when you first went to Seattle to your plan for about three months three point seven million dollars and ... under paid you know and then you had a great season and then got your contract that you deserve the Seahawks did you\nHave you talked to Earl throughout this process um if so what do you tell him or why do you think like you handle it differently you kind of took it as motivation obviously is really taking it as a negative\nThem not giving him to contract extension\nYeah so I have contracts situation is pretty much my whole career you know a bit franchise I\nPlayed on the one year to year do um for me\nMy ... was a little different you know I yes I Would hold out and I did all these different things but you know I I use it as motivation but at the time I I don't I don't know what the outcome is either going to be you know we play a sport where a hundred percent of the time you you have a possibility of getting hurt you know\nUh but we're talking with Earl for me is more soldiers motivating I'm like look man don't worry about you know the contract things just to go out there and ball out\nAnd it's easier said than done and I've been in those situations again because of the back of your has your life man shoes I go out here I get hurt a lot of value can go down\nYou know so but as a free and I'm just letting them know like man you control which ... you can't control that they don't pay you or not to go out there ... try to enjoy the game that you love to do you and me and try to enjoy it as much as possible\nAnd and hopefully everything plays itself out\nCliff what's wrong with the Seahawks now is it just to the corps has gotten all delusional boom is kind of moved on and you know a lot of ... pieces are gone from that what what's the biggest issue with this team of why as a hard time winning\nA I think the biggest thing honestly is so we we as fans are including myself now I guess we've got we've got so used to have the same core group of guys around for so long which doesn't happen in a you know we got nine ten eleven twelve pro bowlers on the team that have been around for four to five years\nAnd again this is not a common thing that happens in enough though so now you know you have now that early on down only two people have less or three people that you have left this\nIs Russell Wilson you got Bobby\nWagner and kj right who has played yet this year you know so it's getting acclimated to the new face the new names um you know Bobby and I we could just look at each other we knew what was going on\nYou know now he has to actually verbalize and and take time to kind of coach up these younger players so it does take time for guys acclimate to get to get that come to build that relates\nTo ship their report with each other I think that's been growing pains moment\nCliff we see obviously Earl was upset with the Seahawks for an office lazy bell upset with the Steelers front office but I I kinda feel like they really should be upset with the players association for signing these you know these agreements with deceived CPAs because of course just call and terrible agreement\nYeah I mean let's say I'm teams I I'm I I'm always typically on the players' side\nBut they they have signed a horrible deal and they're they're just doing what they can do you know what I mean LA than might he might be lucky and get transition back next year you know so they should there\nI don't know how involved you were with the players a certain age and when you play but what do you think about that situation and and the players kind of miss\nPlacing their anger\n[noise] I don't I don't think they're misplaced anger I mean regardless you know your situation is your situations are you going to be mad regardless you know we live in a wonderful country that doesn't mean they're not\nIssues you know what I mean so right so that being said you mean uh the the the CPA I agree it's not it's not the best CVA uh we we have to we have to all come together for sure it strikes that's what it boils down to but now that the ownership and management and all that stuff\nThey've done a great job of having the Arabs which are just the quarterback basically in the have nots\nAnd there's not too many guys are willing to take that chance of missing out on the check right not too many guys are too they they know it's limited time to get this money it's limited time like if I miss this one game check you know a lot of guys are are going to trip off of it which which I completely understand 'cause I've been on both sides but if they're looking at the bigger picture\nThey have to strike they have to and and honestly it only takes one game it really only takes one game ownership and management and all those guys will realize like look we just lost a bill or whatever it might be offered his one game if they go one more game like you know people to start really\nTurn their head so it it boils down to everyone coming together in understanding the bigger picture I was a part of the first a CPA that do she says and you know guys\nStarted kind of going against each other and like man I Need to get back to work I Need to do this I Need to do that and they're not looking at the bigger picture but now I think guys are waking up there's more leaders in the locker room there's more guys I see in her having those conversations with the younger players\nIt was on the plug in the fix find a tool for free saving you time and money down the road so up your light is on residual

told me that you on the other side of the field and you really thought you could feel the game when you set up to the games high field goal or a game winning Google ... on on a fourth downplay I'm Sorry I just can't get with it\nYeah I I Would not have made that call but I don't think it was as bad as some people like I don't think it was a fireball the fence are you serious about that I think they should firing\nI'm just saying it's a horrible offense\nI'm not sitting there going to do it as a first year no I'm not alone but but you know what I'm saying like like you can't you that's not the way I get it\nYou love the idea of doing the fourth down kind of thing and they did it and they did it last year with the eagles it worked out for them but you can't give up a a a tie I mean you can give away in a way\nTo do is you know gay yeah try it better than a loss right you can't you can't do that\nThen yeah I mean I think he felt like look Andrew Luck get thrown for like four hundred

look\nOh it's a sixty yard or right now if we can shut them down and keep them from getting a few yards you know ... it's going to be a tough field goal but yeah it backfired on them and not all the players apparently at least those that have spoken have said they liked it we are Tony Gonzalez say he loved it\nUm he's trying to change a culture\nI don't think some people have said they're not

this guy is really\nThe strictest definition of a mercenary is he really going to give us all if I give him money so he has hurt his own image with this whole that with the style of hold out that he's had not just a regular hold on to spin the style that he's at trolling the team on line picks me on a jet ski all of these things he has lost that and he knows he's not getting the open market that's why he's coming back\nBut you're doing damage control you're absolutely right is going into the open market it becomes all about\nCash and shining through a long term deal now in the NFL it's easier 'cause they're always three three in one you know I was a huge balloon payment upfront and the only thing you're out as you're signing bonus\nSo if he does decide to tank then you're not as exposed but certainly with this many miles injuries and the past transgressions to the policies of player conduct\nYou know there's a lot of strikes against him in terms of getting other teams to me

up we're going to have my ... who's going to join us soon but\nOne thing that plays out of yesterday there's not\nMany times I sit and I buy the concert speaking of conspiracy theories I don't sit and by conspiracy theories on why things are done certain ways and sports this happens here in this and I don't mean like Colin Kaepernick illusion I mean things like all games are fixed and all these uh\nBut when I see the ending of the browns raiders game yesterday\nAnd watch the browns first down get overturned on replay giving the ball back to the raiders Derek Arthur's a touchdown pass the game goes over time and the raiders winning over time\nIt's places like that that make me fake yeah something's not right somebody's got something on the outcome you or something is is trying to be pre determined because\nThe browns had a chance to solve this game away on a third downplay the give the ball to Carlo side who gets a first\nDown upon further review it is ruled that his wrist and\nEl bowl was down before the ball cross the Eighteen yard line which is where the first down a marker was for the brown so the brown fat deposit and this is the raiders got the ball back\nThere's so many things about this play that I Can't believe first of all irrefutable evidence that this that this Web where the ball was down I mean seriously irrefutable evidence there was no irrefutable evidence on that Carlos I got to the front he got to the point forget about the yellow line he got to the point on the field he needed to get two for the first out he got there\nAnd then the NFL's explanation today as to why they overturned the first down\nThey said quote was replay angle shows hides rest and the elbow hit the ground simultaneously\nThen you go back to the line feed you see the wrist hit the ground you know the elbow was down at that point you see the ball is short of a line to a game\nThat is incorrect because the first time Carlos Hyde puts his risk now it's just as rest\nThen it's his wrist and his elbow he puts his wrists down that could give them a pushing you're allowed to do that you're allowed to put your your hand and the ground or you can do that and he does that so it was risque hits the ground first that gives them the push then it's the arm of the elbow does the rest of the album\nSo I don't see how they say it's the first time he puts his wrists down if not over the line\nI mean if it then the second time it's down then it's over the line\nI I don't I don't get that at all but mainly I don't get how that that gets back in ... what what what makes you go back but you know what no\nThat is in in ... when they try to say hey let's get another fantastic finish here at the end you've had such as if it's just all day let's try to make it happen like is there is there an executive in Manhattan saying All right and want to make sure people keep watching the NFL and watching red zone and watching the lake games let's try to get this game down as exciting as it could be 'cause the game's over\nSo hey yeah we're overturning that for a first down\nWell with these pinball numbers or nobody nobody's turning away at this point because it's really just bringing up points I mean what four hundred yards passing is now on nothing what twelve already\nAnd we're looking perhaps for one more tonight but the Broncos deep adds up to the task on my home so I was far but to overturn this\nWhen you're talking about an imaginary yellow line is absurd right now the wind began and what you're at least it didn't happen on the infield dirt because then it would have been even worse for all of this going well you know if you had an actual field we'd be able to tell but here\nIn at least happened on the field of play but so to reverse it\nI've watched replay a hundred times I mean I don't have the ability to blow it up and bring it has a bird or you know frame by frame where where everything's going but we've seen so many times through the years it's the this is a call on the field there wasn't enough to overturn it\nTo suddenly arbitrarily overturning this one in the face of all that it is curious to me unless there's a camera angle that somebody has that we've never seen\nYeah I ... and they say oh you see the feet yeah it's right the second time for the first time he keeps himself up was this was I I see the NFL in like a while it's like ... we got we got to protect somebody we ought to put somebody or something because that makes me think ... the someone have a vested interest\nQuiet keep quiet well\nA couple of course you want to be an old fart an old fogy oh don't say anything Joan Neighmond went out there and pull claim that the jets were going to beat the hell in a more\nAnd more when you do it in your back you know if he backs it up in a few weeks I look back and say I point knew something we didn't do we have a window down there yeah let's hear this sound hey I\nI don't maybe and then that's watching ... called around no matter who is going\nTo go out and we're going to say I can't [noise] and we find one point in the Senate both I think I think [noise]\nVery funny at the end they'll find in a\nWhile and he had what no shirt or a couple of Budweiser man you know he was part of our what you got to give ... give him this Chris he played has bought off all for the end of the season for the Dodgers together knowing when vision he played great ... and their high they are ...\nFourteen of Eighteen they they hit home runs like nobody's business uh but they kind of live and die by the homers well\nNo no doubt about it could not give you another very popular was therefore uh I'll guarantee she'd do you remember the guaranteed in basketball I Do wish I was I was there for that the priest is last game one to the patient this is two thousand four right and\nHe said that we will win game too and he guaranteed it and yes they did win game too and it was dubbed the guaranteed so I'm okay I you know once in a while now if you do it every year\nThey're not up I think it's played out Joe name it did it once if you do a once in a while and what this Dodger team I'm sure he's looking at it and just
