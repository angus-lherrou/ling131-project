this group of athletes turns around and come back out door and then you ask them to go home in the summer and reinvent themselves will be better for our country in about two months so it's pretty

[noise]\nHey guys she'll questions unrelated to each other but I was going to ask 'em what advantages and disadvantages you experience now by having Brian\nUh up in the press box for one season and then down on the deal with you\nA deceased and an unrelated to that I was just wondering what the rules and regulations are on it you want to recruit a student athlete that might go to school out in Pennsylvania Ohio when you're visiting\nAnd playing for example this weekend um are you allowed player when you were on the road\nThose are both great questions all sort of the recruiting won a in a time we're in a visitor stadium and uh it's probably not as as apt to happen in Pennsylvania but as you might imagine in the Midwest a typical you know those especially the surrounding states uh there's some guys at the games typically the you know we're we're hurting also the uh\nThe way the rule reads as we're we're not allowed to have any contact at all obviously we can't provide tickets for prospects on the road we can do it and you can make or we can give her a prospect free tickets they sign up for 'em and uh that's that's what there were a lot to give them a so the the host institution has to do that\nAnd now we're not supposed to have any verbal contact with them a much much like when we go into a school before a contact period not supposed to have an interaction with a recruiter also so the host team can do that and I know and can you see are all recruits typically down there in the south end zone\nAnd pre game they move up once again gets going up into the recruiting section [noise] uh and it will be the same way on the road and the other institutions so that that's a great question and a ... you know regarding Brian it really I I think you know I prefer to those two are what is called plays into encounter Keith was there his preference was to be\nOn the field and you know break prefer to be up in the box so it's a little bit more sterile there obviously you're going to better better view of the of the whole scenario and I'm Bryan started up there but I think he just tells a lot more comfortable down on the sideline where he's able to interact with the players are you know face to face\nAnd then I think the key component is you know with him coming down somebody upstairs has to be providing really good information 'cause we're all all\nDepending on that but especially with a guy called plays them in this case to kill them ... moved out there and it's not a great job with that so\nI think he's he's definitely more comfortable working this way and uh you know can be in the quarterbacks coach she's out on the field also I think that is um [noise] you know from my experience I think that that helps a lot on the quarterbacks coach can can see the see the quarterback not just you know talk to them on a phone but actually see 'em and\nYou know just kind of try to read read into the situation of old and then it gets really beneficial so I think we all feel good about that that part of things and uh you know we talked a little bit earlier and a show about the staff working well together and it gets it was probably one more step in this whole process\nBut didn't dawn on me to Kirk until\nThese road games where a\nConcert hall but I see more of the road that are home particularly as figured the coaching staff would you really lay a lot of responsibility undergrad assistance at her up at the booth and down the field with you as well and I think that's tremendous on the job training it that it's critical with\nThose guys do and and uh oh I see them tonight commentary night I'll give you another one here in a minute but a regret assistance to um\nYou know we ask a lot of them they they do a lot of the managers they do a lot of things behind the scenes as do many hours do the same thing that I'm pack the bags we get back at midnight and\nYou know I mean those guys do all kinds of stuff nobody has any clue ... through the same thing they make our jobs a lot a lot easier in the ... you know we're able to function early focus on the football part of things instead of some logistical stuff\nBut then on top of it yeah they'll they'll coach and uh we only have responsibility\nOf all we're doing teen periods they run the village team which is not an easy job I can tell you that from experience that got to go back you know thirty seven years than that it's a really challenging job it's a very important job\nOr for the team to prepare and then ended with individual players are coaching guy's hands on coaching them grow pork same thing and so it is it's a great great we learned suddenly way to learn like me and her parents in any business I think that's\nThat's how you learn and uh you know we've been fortunate we've had great guys working on that I'll give you another a just a little example dumb things in this world right so our players when we go to you know for home or whether they get for tickets you know no big deal Ga same thing we go to a ball game aren't they give players six tickets now\nNow now they are still getting more but they bumped the players ...\nAnd you know like fifty years ago it used to be ... you know you're a coach teacher ... bad that that was like how people do it I guess that that stupid to so somebody on the NC double a most of them have been a

up on social media 'cause everybody immediately starts clamoring for their favorite unemployed quarterback pick one here are just going kicked off a high school team kicked off at college game ticked off at NFL team is perfect for the XFL\nThat that's where he's going to have to play I mean really because look Chad Kelly is one of those bad news guys one of those guys who if he was your friend he would be the person that slowly you just stop hanging out with because look he's his own worst enemy as a high school\nHad to kick out of it was a cleansing scholarship kicked out what else happened gotten a bar fight with a bouncer gotten a big fight at his brother's high school football game he couldn't get away from that now he's got this he's someone who can't get out of his own way\nAnd is any I Do this guy's a quarterback not running back or a wide receiver he's not somebody who could take a flyer on and say okay he's somebody that you go boy this guy really lost everything and still he lost everything again think about his studying fall\nThis is a guy that had everything had the great bloodlines his uncle Jim Kelly and he was at clubs and not a football scholarship and then what did he do through no fault of talent on the field\nHe lost his scholarship there you had to transfer schools\nHe was going to be a first round pick then he got in a bar fight and then he got in a fight at his brother's high school and what happened then he became Mr irrelevant so then he was a seventh round pick he gets wrap that he's a third string quarterback but he works were up to number two and he's one bad half away from being the starting quarterback in Denver because they were clamoring for error and\nCan't be have at a party gets thrown out walks into somebody else's house monitoring entirely and it with a vacuum to me really has anybody ever gone from elite\nTo out of the NFL like that ever that kind of fall from where you were in high school or or where you were really in college because let's say no wonder how you get to the you get that scholarship you go to clubs and and then from there you look at where you are now you've gotten so many chances and all you have done is completely torpedo yourself\nI don't know that we've had one with that many steps to it right when you go to the decision tree I don't think we've got that many branches\nOn the falls I mean the obvious ones that are well publicized are guys like Miranda bitch but it certainly doesn't even have that\nMany many angles to it or ... no I\nJust want to go for our ... you know a a

young general view is out of the game of Ryan ... comes in with runners at second and third\nAnd J. D. Martinez singles to right field bringing ... tend to be so now it is for to Boston and something we're going to get into and this is what separates champions\nFrom teams who aren't champions is that look at how many runs the red Sox are scoring with two outs\nRight they got their first that runs tonight with two outs they got more runs tonight with two outs throughout the playoffs nearly half their runs have scored or come across the plate with two outs meanwhile you have the Dodgers who lead the major league baseball and home runs but can't get hit with runners are scoring position to save their lives\nThis is why the red Sox right now look like they're in a very strong position to go up to games to none of the world series because when you can do what you asked runners at scoring position you're going to win games you can be a star studded team you can maintain a bunch of guys it's two sixty five but you get that hit with runners are scoring physician that's going to be the difference\nMagic comes in with the walk and then Martina single bats and Ben attendee score and the the inning continues with the Dodgers normally you get that one one advancements\nIn terms of your rally it's a one run rally at a at a lot of left on base and a lot of hand wringing of what could have been guys popping the ball up trying to go for the three run home run instead of\nTaking the ball the opposite way trying to force the issue you've seen a couple of jam shots of guys still trying to pull it is I Know that the the balls away from you just go and so we uh we anxiously awaiting the next frame as we've seen some activity\nOr in the pan as well you've already seen the started chased so now we we get into the open\nLet her out at about ... like a swollen dome or live from the Geico studios were Fifteen minutes can save you a Fifteen Percent or more car insurance more info visit Geico dot com love more on this game as the red Sox continue to bat in the bottom of the fifth\nWhen you stink you need to say how do we move our assets and you treat oh they'll back him junior like him and like a major league baseball team who was awful middle of the season treats their\nHigh salaries veteran player boy you know what we think and we could get a lot for this guy and get out from that money and move on and try to remake the team\nAnd that's how you and and that guy gets traded every single time or do back um junior saying what\nYou need to now look into trading him and moving him by the down I Would say move Eli Manning but\nUh what what is anybody going to give you form but I Would you have to move out because you will get a fair price foreman and and more importantly you get out from under all that money you're paying him and you can take that money this off season\nRemake that often said why make it better and suddenly next year you're in with an off into one of the quarterback and at least you have the building blocks of next year you can have some excitement\nYeah you're already dumped a bunch of money into that up that's why you didn't find someone who takes Nate Silver off your hand on the contrary I knew that had a ... or you want to back no but go back to your last\nLast preseason right everything looked to be in place and I saw a team and then you had a number of injuries so they try do you know put a little bit of a new coat of paint on and and make it all pretty shine it all up thinking All right it'll be better in a paper that looked like\nThey were on their way especially when you're talking about the skill positions and bringing sold her to acres that all kinds of wine and said the office of wind been so bad that no matter what else you got it doesn't matter see I'm not worried about the the oh del ... because I don't I don't know that any given year is ... the bars been raised with the ... Cooper\nFirst round pick where do I don't think the first round put in right here and you're going to want is going to be some absurd level of compensatory Jones ruined it for everybody but what I was going to God I Know there's been forget it but he went out and got his guy\nAnd if you think that's going to be a difference maker then then you'd you roll the dice and and we've talked about that the last couple of days but when it comes back and junior ... money's coming off the books okay that's he's done\nAnd then of course ended up the next is going to be a wave goodbye to you I second half of the season and he's going to go off to a good night so now you're going to have a quarterback in at a very low cat number as you go and then it would have to look at how many more picks they have to to rebuild the ghetto one's got to get them All right that's the problem\nIs you've got a good wide receiving corps with anger him and and shepherd I no doubt back and junior you got saint going Barclay and now it's about maximizing your picks from there and and finding the ...
