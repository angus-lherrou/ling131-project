Milwaukee series fourth on Fox AJ present a Jay welcome to the odd couple\nShows are doing doing great\nWere great were great we're doing we're doing much better than the Rockies and I'll tell you what AJ\nEven though you know Christian yell at each didn't have a hit today there is a part of me that feels like he's dominating this series because it seems like he's striking fear in Colorado He's been walk four times\nIn the two games the obviously home reading game one and my off base or is he really having a huge presence in this a series\nNo you're not a base at all and the thing is those wars have been you know that's the biggest there's there's walks in the lead off walls and early ... super Colorado and that's one of the strengths of Colorado's they're open\nTheir love cheesecake ... out it's going to be a short series but more importantly for Colorado and they don't figure out what actually hit the ball it's going to be over real quick here possibly in game three\nThat's what I was going to ask you a Jay ... is it is it the brewers pitching or is it the Rockies because game one they won eight innings they didn't scored I Know they tied the game and the night or two and then they get shut out in game two so in um what Seventeen or Eighteen innings them the school board\nWell they haven't scored they've scored one run before the ninth inning in the last four games and those are all consider playoff games are playing games or whatever you want to call in or that's\nAnd they're often gone I mean you take away the two innings are the two runs scored in the night of can the giants are for the Dodgers ... home runs\nAnd then you take away the extra inning run or they had one running and then they score to in the night last night in his ear oh today and all night and so they haven't scored at all his work six runs for games and most of them have been almost meaningless runs except for the and somehow they figured out a window way to win a game so they need\nSo driving the ball and I've learned one thing or two days and watching the Rockies it really struggle and breaking balls enough so they need to figure out a way to figure that out I Know force field is advantage for them but if they ... they have it doesn't matter what Christ you know those two girls are going to win\nWas a AJ you are a lot of people looking at the Dodgers is the favorite in the you know we saw yeah feel pee wee guarantee that they're going to win the whole thing oh who is your favorite I mean I'm I'm assuming it's either Milwaukee or the Dodgers but who do you have favored or in the ... in the national league\nOne of the daughters still have to get through the Braves are only have one at all I understand you've already given that series because the way game one played out\nBut they didn't look like they were ready to lead you got a ...\nThan I Am and what do we do in the media we jump ahead right who knowing there's\nAlways so yeah I mean doctors get by the the the phrase I don't see all the way the brewers are playing the cop and say how sometimes in in all sports with especially baseball\nOr you just have teams of destiny and it seems like sometimes just as teams year\nTwo thousand Thirteen with the bombing and the red Sox it was their year they probably weren't the best team\nWent on to win the world series or the other teams uh last year it's used in with the flooding and everything that happened you know you just have games of destiny that kind of just everything goes right I Know one o five when I was at the White Sox everything went right every break we've got every break everything went right\nAnd sometimes in baseball and all sports that's just the way it is and you can't stop at once the momentum that train gets going there is no way to stop it in for the\nBrewers to win the division the way they did against the cubs back from the five game doesn't sit on in the in September to win the division extra way they're playing the way they're both in his loaded it just looks like it might be their here\nHow about a switching over to the American league you got I mean first of all you got three teams that won a hundred games I mean this might be the most loaded final four\nAnd the American league as far as the teams and the team that got knocked out of course the age they had a darn good season as well how tough is this the team that comes with the American league it's going to be a battle isn't it\nYou don't want to be an American issue with those four teams and like you said is Ninety five wins I think in in our home after one game so yeah it's tough and I think it's the for obviously probably the best teams in all of baseball one through twenty five roster Yankees a Yankees Astros\nIndians in Red Sox obviously with all the when they had so once you're twenty five those are probably the best sport that's some of those wins or the fool's gold yes because it wasn't all Fifteen team to the American league trying this year there was a bunch of bad teams and the American league so like the red Sox gained a bunch of went against the Orioles who lost a hundred and fifty games so\nYeah it was it falls go yeah but they still want those games it was four teams that is going to be a battle you saw today just in Berlin and went out and be Cory quiver asteroids looked unstoppable now tonight for sale pitching the way is\nThe red Sox are going to solve all I Know it's only one game but those two teams are are are going to be tough out anytime the Astros are in it after winning way they did last year you not want to play those boys\nAnd I want to give you a quick update the Yankees have scored its five to one and they have runners on first and third one out so they were in the red Sox bullpen now sale is out so this whole Yankees wanted why does get into that both been\nWell see I was watching it then I came to call you guys and we're in the hotel and the music pumping so I had to walk away from the TV to come call call\nYou guys are thanks for the update you're keeping me abreast of the situation even\nThough I'm not watching [laughter] well AJ we haven't seen a team repeat as World Series champion since the Yankees did a three peat finishes that finished off in two thousand one\nI mean first of all why is he was our arms around the ... to repeat yeah I'm Sorry two thousand why it's so hard to repeat in baseball and\nDo you have any comment I'm not asking you to make a prediction but how much confidence do you have been\nUsed in being a team that can kind of breakdown streak and go ahead and win for the second straight year\nOld will how life is so hard in baseball you guys watch a lot of sports and to turn it for any sport but in baseball a hundred and sixty two games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey'll have a team around him to where you can see some results but in the interim you've got a lot of empty stats right it's it's the empty shoot theory that we had an Oakland with Reggie McKenzie and well people may get mad at John ... say the only thing I'm mad about is that he basically address the guy that just doing their job thing you've done a terrible job and I'm stuck doing things because of you\nOkay so you got an empty suit prospect the the tie Lou idea in Cleveland on LeBron James or they're just keep trickle down effect here you got Andrew Luck with a a shell of a team\nIf he makes it through sixteen games\nAll applaud him for that [noise] you know it is an interesting phenomenon how people want to jump in and people would check marks who want to jump in\nFor an opinion of either Andrew Luck is overrated or the Dodgers are pushing Clinton ... out and they act like you've offended them personally well that's the larger I mean that's the greatest I graduate that's what I Want to do with ... say this I Can't believe that one guy said well why did I was I I was running rampant across\nAmerica like I was suddenly I was ruining out but if you were like holding I mean if you don't run and if you're really America because you've got hot hate got Andrew Luck and God Bless that I'm going back into the ... table and and we're going to have a lot of fun [laughter]\nGod it becomes this personal attack oh it's nobody's going after you and your love of Andrew lucky you got to do that yet the poster on the wall or on your ceiling and uh so that's where we're at right now Clayton curse shot up\nTo nothing Dodgers batting in the bottom of the second inning Boston fill up five to over the Yankees in the seventh but earlier today he used to be the Indian seven to they take game one they had a lot of home runs and the big takeaway from this game is I really was surprised\nThat a team and a manager\nLike Frank ... who likes to doesn't mind taking guys out early you know he's the guy that really a couple of years ago jumped in with the hey I'll take\nMy starting pitcher and put my clothes run in the city the only way you are on hold and with four different guys and shuffled him as ... yeah you're like what's going on why or why why is Andrew Miller coming in and the fifth inning because Terri Frank Kona wants to bring him in that early he will go to his guy\nI Know he's got a thing for Cory clover and Corey clue birds of a phenomenal pitcher but you could tell today\nHe didn't have it right he hit a couple of guys which he doesn't head guys and he gave up a home run a couple of hard base heads and I'm thinking okay that's it he's he's he's got to go get them because\nIn the playoff games get away from you very quickly but he's stuck with them let 'em give up back to back home runs and the game was over I mean now you're chasing for runs and suddenly it's boy that happened really really fast and by the time you call back\nAnd get a couple of runs well it it's still it's four to five to six and then you're done but that's a that's a situation where\nIf he has a better hook on ... and a better read on him for the day that maybe this game goes a little bit differently in the Indians tight and who knows what happens from there but really after that I mean after was bang home run and that bag a big hit and another big hitting the and the quote exit velocity off of these\nOffer these pitches and I'm going okay this is not clippers that you could just tell it wasn't as day and he left them in and that that's a regular season move and that's something that really surprised me that he let that he left them in that long and then the game got out of hand\nStill your age thinking that he can go into the bag of tricks that even if he doesn't have as best stuff\nOr that you can buy another inning of work right only gave up to up the bread man all around in the fourth\nThinking and come back out in the fifth maybe shakes that off if you're only down to nothing goes back to what we talked about with the as the other day right if you get if you only gave up two runs in the ... through five you're feeling okay with your bowl painting session likewise here thinking you get to the fifth in your good\nWhile he gives up another home run and all of a sudden it's for nothing but you're still within a slam much like we've been talking about here with the red Sox and Yankee game a as on a fly ball people are now of wading birds are in their in their way ahead of time in a\nMad mad mad world we're living in here Smith but I think that's it you're just trusting that even within eighty percent or whatever percentage you want to throw on his\nVelocity is what is breaking malls doing everything that you're going to be able to get through unfortunately in in this part you're also facing Berliner who was lights out and there was no chance to get back into the game\nIt's winter at how about a fresco Mike at swollen dome that Jason Smith show with my best friend my carving and yes Dodgers threatening again\nAnd I'm a runner at second with one out in the bottom of the second in the already lead the Braves two to nothing so we got more baseball Camp David on what's going on in both of these games but\nStraight ahead Tam T.

thing is you don't have\nNecessarily people who grew up living and dying Alabama football and are actually there to go to school\nYou know which is kind of crazy concept so All right so maybe they are all about a football fan that's fine but if they're you know gotta get blown up maybe they just don't care about going the other thing about this which is actually a real thing I was in ... with a
