in the team are they upset with Eli because he does not getting it done where do you think they are\nNow you got to remember this is these are different locker room talk on the right so if I were to gauge\nThis locker room back when I was playing things look different like so right now you have a younger generation millennials they they don't look at things\nThe way we used to look at things right like keeping things in house that used to be the common thread in every locker role as we've seen over the years that's not necessarily true anymore\nYou got guys Facebook Live in from inside the locker room [laughter]\nYou know what I mean so it's not like people always wondering oh man you know what's going on a lot to say the truth I don't know what's going on in today's locker room was one of the things that are happening would have never transpired in locker rooms with with veteran guys and it it just wouldn't have happened\n... we're going to have some breaking news after we finished talking with a ... so just hang on hang on\nWe're working with me\nAll right I Want to know met many Americans many Machado just sit home run into second inning it's one nothing Dodgers

rare\nWell even less and less stick with the giants okay hotel back um he goes off to walk off the field was the second left in the first half 'cause he he's cramping according to him we see his antics on the sidelines\n... what do you see where he is you know future with this team I mean they they knew what he was when they signed into that sixty five million dollar guaranteed contracts\nOr did you buy it when he supposedly a changed over those three months when he was quiet a and is this why you know there were reports that they wanted to train him but that they're at despite is great talent there weren't a lot of teams out there that wants to get their hands only\nLook at the ... all of that quiet before the payday\nRemember when you were a kid and your mom say you might be a month out from your birthday you do everything right [laughter] right if you're out everything right there you go get the best for you get that bike you want right\nSo you're not arguing you you know your vegetables or your horse you don't even have the homework store lose your birthday hit\nRight why all of a sudden\nYou yelling at your mom you're not you're not doing your chores outright and the like what you should be doing the work so you know we all have that tendency to straighten up when there's going to benefit us now we're really benefited him so now in terms of his future with the giants you girl\nGot when you when you dedicate that type of guaranteed money and that type of overall money to a player than you are married to that place April here you\nKnow no doubt about it I Want to I Want to switch gears and talk about a Patrick more homes quarterback for the chiefs who they play the patriots and and you know it's a big game a lot of people's thinking of going to be a high scoring affair and whatnot because the defense is both are not that good but\nHe started a year off with fourteen touchdowns no picks the last two weeks he's only got one a touchdown pass in touchdown and two interceptions or\nHave they figure them out already starting to figure them out ... not that anybody is always going to you know so I'm a hundred touchdowns ... but he has slowed down for where he was the start the season\nOr even the slowdown would have to be affected but when you look at the talent that this kid has his ability to throw the ball on a rope when he's on the move like you got great quarter but a lot of quarterback can't do that like they just they don't have that right so when you watch him he's so\nYou know he so either risk\nTaker so with Rick Rick taking he's going to throw interceptions if you look at those two interceptions one was really bad but the other one you know he he definitely\nAnd then down the gates struck white\nThat was the whole valley gate situation\nRight when he was fired actually before a bounty gate but now the gay came out shortly after his fired and you know bounty gate essentially was that Gregg Williams the deep coordinator was paying players for injuring\nOpponents\nThat would injure an opponent ludicrous I I'm not surprised I don't think is right\nBut it's one thing to say like I like to watch but not the injures somebody yelled at different ... I don't I don't like needles and nominate somebody out of the game or whatever what somebody that's not that's not how you play the game that's not what it's\nObviously the league didn't like it and he and painting or suspended for the two thousands well see why\nAnd there's bad blood been bad blood between him ever since but when the saints in the browns met this early this season Sean Payton said everything was good he said they have a great relationship and they had a great history and ... that's ... right right because to day\nTo day uh it doesn't look like everything is all good and what happened was that Gregg Williams now he's a defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns you know they have that rally possum in Cleveland little possum that runs around the field\nIs you're up ... possum near you when you were growing up\nIn\nCleveland or New Orleans or Louisiana Louisiana had him\nBut ah I don't ever met recall seeing a possible but here's a Gregg Williams I grew up hunting those things and had to eat them all ... I don't know if he really meant that or not but ah he said it and then Sean Payton\nBringing this few back out of nowhere tweets this at Mary Kay Cabot the browns writer for uh the Cleveland Cleveland dot com he joins back her foul taste a little like a like rats\nSo the assumption that everybody's jumping to is that he's calling Gregg Williams a rat\nFeud back is that what he's saying or is he just saying a possum tastes like All right well that's the that's the question\nI mean people are reading into it that he's calling Gregg Williams the rat is possible\nThat he is saying that but that hasn't eaten rat I doubt Sean Payton is eating rat rat oh God please bear that's why nobody thinks he was talking about the taste hey Alex I Hope I Hope for his sake he wasn't talking about today\n[laughter] no I Hope not but you're right you're right 'cause you wouldn't need a rat\nBut Alex can you eat possum and your diet is that do not know that it's not possible why what what kind of meat is that why not um that is animal products all as any animal yeah\nSo Alex we're the last time you had animal\nProbably a year and a half now wow\nIt's been a good time and you're never going back and do a man it's a new chapter a new life in a once you make the transition which I'm going to help you on that journey you'll see the same\nI mean I'm going to get in shape a little bit I'm gonna let you Alex ...

didn't it last week yeah they did yeah there are so young team and they're not all the way they're the rams are well oiled machine I think they would stand the cold and beat the Broncos\nYou know what I did not know it was supposed to be snowing in Denver\nAnd I think that's going to be a big factor uh so I'm going to go I I I'm not saying they were going to win the game but I'm going to do with them to protect the cover the spread or do you do with the point I Would go with them was the point so I'm going to go with the Broncos and miss\nI I was all ready to go with the rams but I don't know if they're going to be able to get that off is going\nOn in that part of my first W and I'm I'm going to go with their Denver's lost three in a row [noise]\nThe tough with the tough one\nBecause three hour radio show [laughter] I Am going to go with Denver to end the points programs ...\nVitally our disagreement thinking of getting real interesting here on the odd couple game number for\nRob Parker's Jacksonville Jaguars perennially at the top of Parker's tolerate the number two this week I expect we know where I was going to be it'll be our after this week but please but they are to re point road favorites traveling in Dallas take on the\nMediocre Dallas Cowboys the cowboys kids score\nMy first yes here for ...\nKids going now they're facing one of the best defense as we just saw what they did to my home mold said no judge down there to pigs\nAnd press got is going to go to light up the jaguars there'll be lucky to get a feel a touchdown I think that they stopped the cowboys and we've been scored a touchdown I got the jak mine is three\nYeah I Do agree but I I Am going to ... yeah I mean come on you know this is often says a joke and now you got drama in the locker room to go out and hers running his mouth\nI'm no the Jacksonville\nThey had a errors or\nIs it three hours three hours\nYeah and a couple of past balls and a couple of other things so was\nNot a good sign does that are here we go listen to the surface [noise] you don't\nTo be [noise] [noise] [noise] I guess we\n[noise]\n[noise] yeah I gotta admit I'm not that right that sounds real nice not to remember the heart of noise they had a jams it had its moments in love that was the jam really yeah that's that's what I remember the art of noise for from a it was like a\n... it wasn't a hip hop songs but it it I think it was common the hip hop that play in Iraq why get all that type you know instrumental jammed trans Europe expressed up\nYeah moment laying them out of that yeah yeah\nUh but that's why I I have to download download\nThat are here the whole song tells you like it and it's not nothing like princes virgin too but that version is really really I think it's better than princes version it was tough yeah well I Do I really believed that\nWill speak in a tough things are very tough in New York with the giants won and five\nAnd you know I I I've been listening to New York radio today I Know it's crazy I Know gosh they're there besides the like like the ... the world is coming to underwrite rises two years in a row the season's over\nIn October is two years in a row yeah and the Yankees are done up the next you know now don't have anything to look forward with them not to in certainly the nets right if you don't know there's nothing to look forward to not at all or nothing at all and\nI'm going to say it is New York fans might be upset but look in the mirror when you want somebody to blame because if you hadn't gone haywire when they benched he lived many last year\nAnd I know it wasn't may be the right timing or even white lie in his job to see the oil I got it they would like to where I got to get all that\nBut you could have tempered it a little bit they they ... fans when it's so crazy that you force the ownership John Mare and it's his fault for reacting to the fans but he did a complete about face and not only made he lie the starter at the end of last season again but\nFor the like the thing for the next two or three years\nNow you know one hundred percent and that's why don't go don't be crying over spilt milk now and and acting like\nYou lied to the other coaches ... Abed ...\nThe coach was there and Jerry reached the general manager of course the general manager who won two Super Bowl ... guys made us think when they were ready to move on from ... last year yes there was a lot of injuries and other things going on but he just didn't play well and he hasn't played well for a while\nNo question I mean heck let's beyond the who will never been tremendous in the regular season ... again oh yeah five one brewers and he's ... he's been clutch he lie but since that Super Bowl and the two thousand eleven season\nHe's made the playoffs at one time in the last six years and and really if we count this year is probably going to be one in the last samurai so look\nSake why Barkley is tremendous he he may be an all time great but an all time great running back doesn't necessarily mean you go when super\nBowl that's what a running back position isn't that looked at the same yeah either don't drop those guys hot yeah\nBecause if you I mean like why do you got like when that was drafted his ego Eliot he was like the final piece right who had dads Brian as a receiver Jason wit and you had Tony Romo at the time is quarterback you had a great office of line and a good defense\nWhen Jacksonville took glitter for net you had a good great defense\nRight it was already in place yeah\nSo you it's unfortunate and a fake one hopefully they'll get beat up would that week off as the blind and know passing gay but he's really the only reason remain in the wash the giants well look\nYou make sure you go to I chose apple pie cast SoundCloud and download the podcast you won't be sorry Jason Smith show with Mike harming coming up\nNow\nWe've all been there you're out on the golf course and it's bad family is not always easy to fix your golf game but when it comes to your check engine light auto zone makes finding a fix a breeze if your check engine light is on the plug into fix find a tool for free saving your time and money down the road\nSo off your light is on a visit your local auto zone today and let them find your fix with the free services firm auto zone you just can't lose getting his own auto zone [noise]\nOh I think you have you on the phone ... with the capital one from ...

I guess we should Congress ER wake up call come capital one [laughter] which I work oh of course but before you go can I ask what can your why capital one bank usa\n[noise] on Dan Patrick and this is about the noise in the NFL the quarterback it's most of the credit in most of the blame and it's not always fair but that's the\nReality of the New York giants they're not playing well as a team and Eli Manning is taking the brunt of the criticism and ... and playing well they have serious issues on the bench of mine and the defense look a little bit lackadaisical last night in that launched the eagles\nHotel back um junior gets a lot of attention as well and\nThe rookie running backs acorn Barclay was spectacular and that losing effort but ultimately it comes down to you I'm In the G Men are one in five and unless they find a\nFix for their glaring weaknesses they could end up with a high draft pick and if that happens there's a chance they get dropped a quarterback next year [noise] he lies thirty seven middle thirty seven [noise] they have to eventually move on at some point and if they keep on losing that time could come a whole lot sooner than the team and fans\nProbably hoping for [noise]\nI'm Dan Patrick and this is above the noise [noise]\nWhat's the last time you woke up with more energy less brain fog you feel sharper you're in a better mood you're going to be more

course trending\n... is in from Milwaukee now top of the fifth inning brewers have a five one lead over the Dodgers dot is the three errors all either putting runners on base or in scoring position Clinton ... is out of the game pitched three innings gave up\nMost of them went to the cardinals in the playoffs but he has had many big games where he's lost really thought like tonight really thought no cardinals this was when he could get over Seattle central apparently but if you got a game like tonight where hey here's game one of the NFL cs and\nYou're losing I mean it's it's five one Milwaukee all five runs you know we're we're charge the Clayton curse Shaw and\nThis is what you get\nIf he drops out this is why we set it right before game one of the series against the Braves with the Dodgers you let him opt out if this is them trying to push him out that's fine too because\nYou can show it gives you a level of excellence in the playoffs and he's the same ... and the regular season and he's the same picture in the playoffs that was Peyton Manning he gave me the same he was the same starting week three as he was started the AFC Championship game\nThat was paid because he played at one level the whole time but in the playoffs everybody raises their game they find a way to raise their game and so that's why you walk into oh here's why Peyton Manning has a five hundred right because this defense that probably couldn't stop them week six this is the one that's going to stop near and weak Eighteen in individual rounded a playoff game in the wild card game whatever it was\nAnd it's the same thing with ... you get to the playoffs everybody amp things up it's longer at bats\nIs it a better strategy against them and Clinton Kurdish all just has not delivered and for a guy that you're depending on who you're giving thirty million dollars to go by the way missed\nAssertive it starts this year with more injuries with another back injury his back is not going to get better\nIf you're pushing them out if you'd like in the test free agency and find someplace else let him go the Dodgers need to move on without him the other two pitchers they've had so far to pitch in the playoffs we're both better that ritual as rich hill but Walker bealer looks like a future star\nAnd really it was really good\nIn the in the first playoff game and he's pitch great all year\nThe future without curse Shaw is okay if you're the Dodgers but you're seeing tonight why again you can't count on them you can't ... hey gr shows out there that's a win for us no of course are goes out there and in the playoffs\nYou're just as likely to get away from Kurt Shaw as you are a lot he's eight five hundred pitcher in the playoffs that's not what you can expect or hope to try to win games when series if that's what you're counting on your number one started writing the margin of error\nIs that much last year looking at the defense and forty miles and Follies find the plate catchers you fear and she got a couple of ... you're looking at everything else is conspiring against you and when he's not sharp it spirals out of control in a hurry forget about the\nThe home read aloud to the relief pitcher for a moment was what was that after the side for just a minute you you look at each struggled with control you you haven't been getting the big strike out numbers in and it was great and was masterful the last round but you've got to be able to read her back and you got to be able to\nAt done blow hitters away and come playoffs you know you you got to find your your your place what ... said hey you got to an exotic geo that he's done\nAnd we're going to go bolt panning and we're in the fifth inning were already at heater time and his hundred and thirty seven mile an hour in Baton Rouge so great council just saying oh we've got um exposure to get the juggler expose we're going after\nWe're getting our guys in a bullpen pitch to a sub ... temper first let's just keep at it\nWith Clayton her show now you've got the big decisions of right wing games during the regular season nine wins I didn't get to double digit winds midnight two seven three are a is phenomenal spectacular but it's winning time\nI mean it's not the grounds one point said no I get it but I digress okay it was also wasn't reunions at one point one five yeah but that only for ... well when I get my I can come over that's half a season it was you know if you're going to keep trying to jam a guy anyway as magazine equal based ... around around\nDecember sorry got thanks plenty good project you want to go to Sam drugs while you're at it and ... know anonymity yeah right I mean you've got\nBig decisions here 'cause you got to decide you want Machado do you want to go after Bryce Harper do you want to go and continue on that side of things saying the kids are All right on the pitching side some prospects plus review last\nYou've you've got your guy here is coming back right he made the roster or your banking on him to go into the rotation next year you got Walker Mueller you've got a base going forward and that thirty three million dollars could be split up elsewhere\nEven if it's just to bring in another big Bob\nTurner ... out of ... Mike at swollen dome you're seeing tonight again why you\nCan't just rely on Clayton Kurdish ought to issue to anything eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox will keep you updated right now the brewers threatening to break this one open bottom of the fifth inning with a five one lead they have runners at first and second and just one out and Josh hater\nIs in the on deck circle they've already gotten one home run from reliever taught that could they get another will have more on this game plus the latest in the airline manning saga we had a twist today oh yeah and I'm going to answer all my own back him critics all of you every single one way next on Fox\n[noise] the M Elvie postseason as they go rock star ... highly\nWe got you covered\nFox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know the first who were actually peach baskets or that award basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game\nWell here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nTrue car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars with their certify dealer network and nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simpler buying experience whether you buy new\nOr used and with your car you can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nThere also more likely to enjoy it faster buying experience by connecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car check out true car and enjoy a more confident car buying experience some features not available\nIf they've been able to pull that off right that you didn't have this phantom ads first in a ... and here's this you know that he's already three on is that I Know del not mopping the gay and whatnot but either way all of that done right at your past and you know I'd say we say yeah there were seven points here but the reality is they didn't bother\nTo figure out whether it was the first out or not they just randomly gave him a Gatorade and fed into it enough it looked like it was close enough but yeah I Know but his arm never got bored I mean obviously it's an unofficial line but ... neither here nor there for the moment but\nSay they actually win that game yesterday would have been so much I mean it's fascinating and and the dumpsters or on fire but\nIf they want it you've been able to you would have been able to sell hope for three days ah it it would\nStill be the same showing up that flat that poorly against\nThe defending champions and your division rivals maybe they would have been in that old and they would have been that bad you know that's where short weeks are good because you have to forget you have to turn the page you hear about this is done and we're moving on and there's not going to be a loss of lingers into Wednesday or Thursday because we have no choice in the matter\nIt still would have been the same thing you still would have seen this but the giants their roster is terrible so tank\nI made tank and at ... and turn around and say we're the smartest guys in the world because we got to take one Barclay last year\nAnd we got hurt or whoever you want to take a number one overall seriously or printing the shirts yet or what what what tomorrow tomorrow's the game where you're going to ... river\nFor Herbert oh I like that although ensure that can do you ... orbit sherbet for her but nah I don't know Herbert can you a ... for because the only other famous Herbert as the guy we don't want to talk about for Family Guy a will there's herb Albert\nThere's her mouth or not and the energy on them for her ... her bra elder\nWill get your guy you'll get your quarterback and he'll be on display tomorrow against Washington watch them have this huge game if I'll give you a bit of preview into what my upset special is going to be all that someone had a huge game and it's going to be some of the ... guy giants fans are going to start watching Oregon gave that night\nTank tank and do it\nEverybody else will do this is what you have you got to be but you got to be good and you want to\nCorrect this horrendous mistake you made last year where we could add San Bernardino that anybody on no no no no say going Barclay hey go correct that mistake take the rest of the season that's how you figure things out whether he lies the quarterback or whether Phil Simms comes back to play quarterback it doesn't matter tank eat dirt for Herbert I\nI don't know when we got to go with her for her I like that yeah yeah yeah\nYeah I liked that eat dirt for pat and that it hadn't\nBeen of that and yeah I don't know something to hadn't panic we've got to figure that out but certainly for the giants there's so many holes and that's the thing right and we talked about it last night you can find a pod cast it but I just Jason Smith show with my arm and a given five stars will walk ... how'd you\nUh forever alongside our tastes are but the fact of the matter is that you you've got so many holes but the ... junior saga\nAllows you to just missed direct everybody 'cause that's where all the attention goes because that's the better movie\nIn one minute we're more on this game going on right now I'm a walkie and the Dodgers were in the bottom of the sixth inning cardinals gotten more on this coming up and we get into the oh del side of\nThis because yeah after today we got to have to but yeah for mentioned\nCarson is with us now with what strength the safe haven chance Milwaukee has won a lemon straight trying to make a twelve and a rover was lead the Dodgers five one in game one of the national league championship series Pedro by as now and for LA on the hill rough night to Clinton cursed shah\nGave up for earned run he has money granddaughter and a couple of past falls to errors including catchers interference and also\nA a an Arab by Chris Taylor out in the outfield again brewers with a fine one lead right now or the Dodgers there in the bottom of the six in Milwaukee and has just gone and filed twenty third ranked South Florida survive by kicking a game winning feel do twenty to the yard or what just a couple of takes on the clock\nSouth Florida beats Tulsa twenty five twenty four in the American athletic conference mountain west Airforce lead San Diego state nine seven one forty three to go to second quarter in the past twelve Utah out to assemble nothing home lead over Arizona\nSix and a half to go first quarter you know we don't like to find a fix for golf game thankfully you can find a fix here check engine light at auto is on the free ... will find the likely issues saving money down the road yet in his own auto zone and finally guys the diamond backs have learned inexpensive lesson\nAfter trying for more than Twenty years to grow grass in the desert inside a stadium where the roof\nThe diamond backs and made a logical choice they are going to synthetic turf at chase field starting next season boy so you know dead for Twenty years I've been trying to grow carrots\nInside my house [laughter] and that's not work [laughter] without soil oh oh I Need soil down just gets about ... they'll get you to grow grow whatever you need on tells me that I Will live from the guy goes studios where\nFifteen minutes can save your Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance for more information you can visit Geico dot com or Chris\nYellow chisel run or a second for the brewers are they leave the Dodgers five one as the bad in the bottom of the sixth\nInning but continuing on with the giants who still stay the big story of the day despite\nThe fact that they got some last night look when you're bad and when you lose it when you're New York people pay attention by the way congratulations to Philadelphia and Carson once for getting on track and taking advantage of the cesspool that is the New York giants now activists as well that is the New York football giants so\nEverywhere we went we had a big day on social media today and last night we told you about ... and the deal with oh back him juniors this he had he was fine before the game for his interview we gave with ESPN thrown the team under the bus on Sunday he left the game before half time when the giants officers on the field as he says to go get an IV\nHe walked off by himself to the lock them I'm pretty sure if you're drained and need an IV someone goes with you to the locker room and apparently\nHe's the only guy that can get an IV at the at halftime because he said you know you only get five minutes ten minutes and after I mean so anybody else needs an ivy you're out of luck right all the other giants needed halftime don't get them because they're all getting on the off the field after the clock actually hit zero no they'll get ...\nOn staff and James would er and Matthew Modine there's only there's more than ... there to administer and Eileen pushed out of your life that yeah you see that is with his girlfriend too yeah people think this is real life uh so what is it just fantasy movie\nHow much you want to believe auto back and was the whole I don't doubt that he got an IV and a half time but that's just the way to explain away him saying look at me I'm walking off the field 'cause I'm Upset that we're not winning well legit it's all show\nYeah well then in the second half he does the whole show of I had budding and electric fan and I'm yelling at it and this is due out back and ms you have to put up with the knuckleheads stuff to deal with his talent the giants didn't pay them Ninety million dollars to be like this and\nWhat happens is you not only have to deal with real stuff with the giants but you've got to deal with ... knuckleheads stuff some of his ... his stuff is just strictly off the field and it's like okay I'll deal with that\nBut a lot of it bleeds into on the field like last night with the whole thing with him leading before I left I just became the big story why did oh they'll leave the field oh\nDo you live said he didn't notice and then he said he didn't say too much doubt it yeah you know you I had no idea the ...\nAnd this is why it's easy to move on from him but the giants on him to a contract I told your pain and was going to be the worst thing because he's just going to be the guy he was this is five weeks it already you thought oh he's majority is going to be you know he was never going to mature or be a leader the giants got snowed because he acted\nAnd didn't do anything for three weeks and kept waiting for a new contract so it's like trying to they want it to reward a child we was behavioral problems because he behaves well for tiny period of time oh let's make sure we reward you yelled at your water\nAnd all over the back of junior saying if say that if I had to do with three weeks is is is not saying anything oh that was easy method that Santa my head\nBut this is back on and it makes him not worth it because everything you have to go through now the giants have to fix their team and they got to worry about ... what he says next what he does next everything goes into with hotel\nAnd obviously there's a lot of people that love ... and we're one of the come after me on social media today\nThe one thing I Will say that I'm absolutely sick of people saying when they say oh don't chase them you're ridiculous oh he's passionate he just wants to win I Can't believe you're seeing that off the field stuff ...\nNinety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of players in the NFL\nWants to win everybody wants to it and there are a couple of guys here or there no yeah there there are a couple of guys here that don't want to win but the vast majority Ninety nine percent of guys want to win because you go through so much in a given week preparing for a game that you're in it with everybody else in your locker room you want to win\nEverybody in the NFL wants to win but they all find a way to do it without being a distraction and causing controversy to their team Sam Darnell wants to win just as much as ... Bek um junior does but sand Arnold doesn't do stuff\nTo distract from what's going on with the team same thing with Aaron Rodgers same thing with Russell Wilson same thing with Cam Newton same thing with Ben Roethlisberger all of these guys\nEverybody wants to win every player the quarterbacks defensive back but they also but the difference is all these other players find a way to\nHold their emotions in check so they're not hitting their head against the ceiling fan against the electrical fan or hitting a kicking net or leaving before halftime 'cause they're so pissed off they're not winning and I think I went on and on it because there's Antonio Brown to", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "13"}
