always\nEvery Thursday we like to bring in our Fox Sports NFL analyst Super Bowl champion none other than Greg Jennings Greg welcome to the odd couple\nYou know you were going on my two favorite people\nWas a book [laughter] I'm great new sounds good sounds cozy yes\nNice and cool the man I Can't complain plan anyway\nWhy I'm asking you this gray we'll get right to it yes\nYou are you are Allen hers is comments about\nThe play calls on third down and landed that Prescott interceptions second interceptions this week when he said he was the worst possible call you have in that moment and then he said that may not have the authority to check down and I'm what I'm saying is this\nAlan and her and has to be careful\nBecause he only have a receptionist for eighty four yards this year and he could easily be replaced he needs to have an edit button and be careful what he said that's my take him out right or wrong\nYou're on it as a write your congressman right watch yes man look let me tell you something\nNobody wants to hear something like the ... and again I respect where he's coming from but keep that in the house we don't need to hear that publicly because your statistics and this you know this is what everybody else that\nDoesn't marry you the the platform or the credibility to say whatever you want to say nobody is going to really look at you and see oh yeah he is critical because he has forty reception or a hundred yards or\nSo now you know he has he doesn't he doesn't have those troops backing his statement so with that being said you can't make that comment\nStatement you haven't shown on the production that gives you that that platform and so I get I get well understand what he's saying you straight it\nI get that but at some point you got to just say look let's just make sure when we go out there whatever plays that are called we have to execute this is the issue that I have with a lot of teams uh in in in a lot of quarterback sometimes that that\nOne or two or even a a circus about Rogers last week he mentioned\nThe play calling or at least go no you know what you have to work with now it's up to you as competitors make it work make it happen\nSo what so what your take on\nA on a\nOld job back them junior so ... how did you take his comments about he lied about the team not having a hard and and that\nAgain you look at you look at the situation as you look at who think it's an art is incredible cannot tell you what are you saying and and then look at his level the plate\nAnd say well I mean I got a kind of listen to him because he's ...\nWell we were just because you have numbers doesn't mean that or you don't have numbers doesn't mean the honest answer\nRob I'm I'm a when I'm ... you're right but when I'm telling you is\nIf your production is there you are more you have everyone here we aren't ducks and is not fair you don't have that so what you say you have to be careful you you can easily replaced like light courses saying when you look at all about replacing him\nGoing out to find the next ... no you're not doing it so he ... he has that ability to say those things and he's that guy in the locker room or if there is an issue you're going to say hey man you need to go from the coach because you'd only one that I'm\n... years and years in the NFL did you ever see anybody get get caught for for for commenting on on a play or did you ever remember any but I never remember anybody\nGetting caught I remember God getting caught for for mishandling an on side kick or take their missing all on the ... game winning chips shots those guys up so you can get cut I've never seen anybody get caught\nOver making it on a common now if you're making up stories or or ... stuff I'm asking you\nRob I must I must say no because for the for the most part on almost hard I don't think there was ever any one who said something that we've been talking in the first place\nSo when you when you say that I get what you're saying because it's true it doesn't matter where it has to come from and who comes from ... but my point is you have to curses point you've got to be careful because your production doesn't give you that\nThat platform or that level of responsibility to say hey ah this play you just calling up off of a coordinator\n... call was terrible but because if it if it works it's a play called terrible\nRight well you you mentioned the giants and no doubt bedroom junior there obviously playing the eagles as we speak both of these teams really need this wind but who do you think\nAnd this wind is more important to the giants or the eagles who needs an hour\nAs a great day they both made it but I think the giants needed a lot more\nAnd here's why when you look at when I look at the Philadelphia Eagles I say if they lose his game they'll still be far I I I still believe that they'll win the division they have the better team moving forward when I look at the giants you look at from last year they start off or five then they went to Denver they had all go and nobody thought that they were in\nDenver they call out of when\nThey pulled her magic out of his hat\nAnd they sprinkle it on on at mile high and they walk away with a win\nTonight they beat that and when you think about everything that's been said about manning I play well he's already gone the interception whether it was his fault or not he's going interceptions already tonight\nHe has to quite well because the bulls eye the conversation is based on him and his lack of production so to me if I'm looking at a team that I expect to come out with their so called quarterback who's the face of every team\nLeave them it has to be\nThe New York football giants night\nOut about the ah we debated the other day uh you know here we are after all four games a quarter of the season uh into game five but um who's been the most disappointing team in the NFL who do you have at the top of that list\nAll those who is pick the Leno and I picked the giants right Chris are\nThe most disappointing team I think for me uh when I look at I mean those are two really good picks I Would go Atlanta\nOr having been down there I called their game\nKnowing the expectations that were on them not only that we are African but that they have for themselves it's kind of like what we thought of the New York giants last year\nWe they had all this talent coming and then all of her injuries they got they got it had to overcome all those injuries and then they figured out to be nothing\nThe injuries that they have in a ... incurred has\nReally crippled them and they can't get over it right now it regardless of what they do they they've shirt up their red zone or issues that we thought were problematic they've done that and they just can't stop anybody and it is really disappointing because you you expect or out of the amount of shock\nThat that's all you're doing it I Would give up all the if I was a fan give up all the regular season winds and all of the stuff that he's done that I marveled at to have one or two World Series the Dodgers have won the world series in Thirty years and then one of the greatest pitchers in baseball they need\nClaim Kurdish or to help them with the world series\nBut here's the thing he lie manning is unique in that\nYou rarely see I think in in any sport I mean we're talking about baseball and football but you rarely see the mediocre regular season guy\nGet to the post season and be just fantastic you may see a mediocre quarterback Trent due for Brad Johnson you know lead a team to the super bowl I shouldn't even say lead them to the super bowl when it when a Super Bowl right they're not like the MVP they're not the reason they won he lie\nBecause he's been everything he becomes like the reason they win that's unique though so I'm not sure like let's say ... shah was just a mediocre\nRegular season pitcher he might not get those chances and oppose the no no I Know what\nYou're saying but I'm saying I I Would give up if I if I was a Dodger fan all of the other moments that he gives\nYou because I'd rather him being yet all aside young all the uh on on average leader you know what I mean in all the other stuff that he's done which is all magnificent and great to watch\nIf I'm a Dodger fan I'd rather have an unbelievable run hope the Dodgers won the world series and I don't care about all the other stuff I said all the time Philip workers has been very\nConsistent and good for a long time right when I got new in the playoffs not no you're right not right you're right I\n... I just think the big stage is what I Want and when you haven't won a World Series in this in this long for the Dodgers it's got to be the Dodgers and what I'm most storied franchises in sports\nOr you you don't have a year it's interesting 'cause you mention you know Thirty years ago is when the Dodgers wanted and one of the pitchers who\nIs great for them was ... who had an unbelievable run by not ... not a hall of famer no\nAnd it was really good but not a hall of famer but in on the big stage he was often at his bath\nIn Nineteen eighty eight I think he had the fifty six game\nHe was great ... I'm only twenty three when he was ... yes yeah that was I mean he had a great year and and obviously a great postseason as well but that's a good that's really what you're saying so would you rather be whether you look at it two ways you if you were a player\nWould you rather be all her Sizer or Clayton ... Shaw or if you were a fan which one would you\nRather absolutely an F ... and if I were a player\nI wouldn't want I wouldn't want to be or ... all day I I Would even even ought to make the hall of fame\nI was still one of those guys who was a bull dog and help the Dodgers won a championship and give people memories forever he lied to reason that people in New York can't let go is for that reason I say no we can't play they know he's bad\nBut they do is my memory you can like do you always remember that right\nAbsolutely right now it's interesting 'cause I've always looked at bath when everybody talks about Robert ory who you know why are mediocre player during the regular season huge in the playoffs I Would rather be Charles Barkley I'd rather have his career than Robert ory\nWow you would rather\nRobert ory I'd I hear what you're saying but I think but but it it's interesting 'cause their baseball it does feel a little different I think maybe because her size or even though he wasn't a hall of fame you know he was a good ... close yeah what I mean I\n... actually a little ... I mean not surprised he wasn't in all the vein 'cause he did not know how to remain why you know what I mean yeah if it was somebody who wasn't as good as her size or\nIt might be tough but you're her ... her\nKind of you like a legend yes because you know the world series right right and he was at its best that's a tough one I Love ... Shaw and there's another question is\nIs it the up you know the fact that the competition gets better or is it the stage that why he hasn't performed as well so an interesting question to ask and ah we'll find out when this theory starts as the ... Fox Sports radio keep it locked\n[noise]\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first ... were actually peach

ever ends up starting this year round those going to start off to see\nJust depends if if Rondo a la brown look great together Chris why why would you stop that and go backwards I'm just saying if no you you you made any money and arms that will still play I'm not saying he's not going to play ... said anywhere between ten and thirty minutes lab that's crazy tightening thirty minute and and I tell you what little there\nI don't think I Know Michael times into this and they do have some\nDepth he was raving about their depths but you do need to get a rotation yes\nIt's hard it is hard when you have several players who are at the same level you know when you got like eleven dues they should play and the seven of 'em are about the same that's tough on the coach\nBut you also know in the playoffs and you've seen this when pat Riley was with the Knicks I can remember a lawn do black when he wouldn't put them in Cuba Davis do you remember those guys\nYeah you don't want him to really go eight or nine hours a day and like his logo nine now and not lose their nails but there there are a lot of guys don't see action\nIn the playoffs and that's my point that haven't fourteen strong doesn't mean anything at all it's gotten me all those guys don't play they just don't\nYou need nine ten strung nine strong and uh and they got down to it that's where lines are gonna be an end Rob my contention is that\nYou know the lines old boss circus at least for the next year or two and maybe a little longer is over like we're talking about lines are right now because the real games haven't started a month from now we're not going to be talking much about\nWhat do you think that magic in them got to a low bar and said do stop it or there's going to be ... you get your son out of town because he's really pipe down\nHere oh amazing it is a ... year old Chris yeah that that's a good question because you first you would say well why didn't they do it last year last year he wasn't expendable no and he was ... magic it pumped him up right yeah\nSo now he's expendable right like you don't need him you know the\nBronze age where the next four years who can play point guard if you somehow last Raj Iran do I mean hey brand new ... point guard to\nHey Chris we got a call on this list or go to Kennedy and ... you're on the odd couple on Fox Sports radio that I say oh you gotta happening man\nI'm good just wanted to call and I know we're talking about long to it definitely be talking for the next year for brown wasn't there um they wouldn't be good enough or relevant enough ... he would just step would be the topic on um wouldn't be an ... interesting enough\nRight that's a great point I totally agree I totally agree they have I saw it on live far\nHe didn't he can wait a while you are you surprised you don't hear a little bar anymore\nYeah I mean I think he might be a bigger part to overlook there I don't know I mean I think people are kind of done with them a bit I Would say\nIt's for you know and and look I have to borrow my pod cast in his own several tiny where the ban on undisputed I we have one on one\nYeah I like him and but I\nLook right now and he this

those movies it's unbelievable how now as I'm leaving him back Kansas will like there was popular like anyone get slapped back at\nThat's crazy but yeah I remember I that's what it's all in those old forty out macho movie that's where it would never say that now they all I Know no I mean people getting fired for why some\nYou know like that but I I was on a bus seventh grade\nAnd uh uh\nWe used to

Broussard and Rob Parker welcome you live from the guy told Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance\nWith Geico go to a guy called dot com or call a hundred nine four seven eight you Tio the hard part is figuring out which way is easier and ride the eagles on Thursday Night Football up fourteen to six on the New York giants\nAs subtle and other field goal they were they were down at the border the tenure on line a yard line and ...\nHad a great play on a reception he took it I don't know how many yards they see some yours was one of the sixties I'm young yeah he had to get it right now by one guy does have some great skills we neither of us\nIs saying he may not be a perennial all ... bankruptcy was fifty five I knew was lonely ... yeah but it's just not you need it you needed a quarterback that's really what it boils down to 'em\nBut speaking of running backs the the eagles look good tonight but they're not doing much damage on the ground it's a lot of Carson wins in the air and and obviously the defense as well uh\nThey need a running back they need a running back and\nThere's the rumors out there that they're going to get ... McCoy a ... a ... confirmed that they were interested in the Buffalo Bills coach\nConfirmed that or wouldn't deny at least that the eagles are interested in English and McCoy in a trade or an ... bell their reports that the Steelers are hoping\nThat the eagles will call them about ... ...\nI don't know what Rajiv ... do you know I don't know what the eagles are kept situation will be next year like could they sign ... long term\nWell they did free up about six million when they restructure Fletcher Cox uh deal for this season ... so you know that that\nYou would assume that the intention of bringing in somebody to bring back and I'm sure they can with the you know they want you to luckily for them Carson west on his rookie deal so they can add as many high praise the ice\nThey actually right now by 'cause he's a he's not breaking the bank they got all and you got him for a few years like this or you might as well go for it\nSee I I Would rather look ... McCoy I he seems like he's a little bit on the downside but he's still better than what the eagles have right now in the backfield or but if I had my druthers as the eagles fan I wouldn't want levy on bill said I wouldn't want him long term\nI think the whole dealt with ... McCoy is that you know the eagles on shore because also in that deal you'll get an A. P. B. to be named later there'll be some other situation\nNot you're right though he's got the melting via why there's so many\nJust something there so you just do you ensure you want to do in the eagles just scored a again\nYeah this is a is going to be ... or not you and I both work in New York and we know what the back pages or like do it is going to be ugly and nobody's going to be ... including oh\nNo no no nobody and they'll they'll blame all Dell for his ... and ... the the evil eye bashes will be out and everybody in um\nUh it's just how it is you know a ... you know once you get all the praise in the back pages when people win and that's how you know of course if you're playing well then you're winning your kings\nRight kings no question everything is magnified in New York and and I I got to be honest I never bought not for a second Rob did I ever by this talk about\nAnd it wasn't just oh there he was the main when I guess saying it but it was a a few people saying that that there's a galvanized the team\nBecause first of all I didn't think they were that good against Carolina North Carolina ... body defense that Ryan or they\nUp man I thought it was more failure on Carolina out the way I\nThought yeah I saw a Christian McCaffrey and Cam Newton in a couple of receivers just breaking tackles running over got like come on that's not galvanized\nAnd so you know you saw the mistakes by ... and others so this is bad for the giants and this isn't even competitive right now\nTwenty one six uh but this could be there's a great sign for the eagles and are in that division they still are look I've I've said it they're not getting back to the super bowl I stand by that but they are the best team in that division Rob genes that are saying that they\nWeren't touchdowns for once in a lifetime or did they get one on the ground now he has two they also had a one yard run by ... so that he has to ... I'm just trying to add another touchdown if I can but there's\nStill for twenty two left in the second so or not a bad first haven't got Twenty one points and Twenty one to six in the defense is as hard and down near the goal line right for the ... the giants so if you're\nYou know we're in the sports business and uh we travel a lot and what not you don't get to watch his mind these shows that's really what it's about and when I'm watching TV it's usually the news or sports right or old reruns of a more meat TV those loans all under arose yeah some\nLike you know one thing I've learned to night with the theme song because Sam is a young guy he played a lot of the newer stuff why theme songs have changed oh yeah they used to be so light and cheery you know what I mean and and then now they're like scary yeah [laughter]\nIt used to be like you would be in the other room you'd hear the theme song you knew your show was coming on route to dance and my mom was in the other room and a game of the what is the game of Thrones drones was on that theme song I Would think the world was coming to an end I wanted to show up [laughter]\nRight right well\nIt's time for ... talk\nWait until\nYesterday shop talk you're on the odd couple of Fox Sports radio now we are worldly gentleman we Avengers outside of sports you know the eagles are about the score again against the giants the unbelievable there's still a minute forty to go\nBut you know every once in a while we'll take a look at a story outside it's more than ... thought about just like here in the barbershop well Halloween is coming up in a few weeks guys and um apparently in Virginia they have a problem with unruly trick or treaters and they decided to take matters into their own hands here\n[noise] in some parts of Virginia they've installed laws that will put children over the age of twelve ... twelve buddy who\nEngages in trick or treating can be sent to jail and be charged with a misdemeanor crimes facing a fine of anywhere between twenty five two hundred dollars\nI'll be ... this you know they're real criminals and move where where where I'm filling up the Jill jails into court houses where what trick or treating come on Chris this makes no sense that's terrible and then at that age you want you trick or treating what's your what's your parents or chaperone Alex well look\nWhat I ... the large terrible that is ... it's a waste your time good on some button that dimension you put a record on somebody for trick or treating\nNow I Do believe that twelve twelve Thirteen you you you shouldn't really be done about the India trick or treating Korea Chris I my last chocolate treating I was eleven\nAnd a lot I was big stuff me a couple of my friends I was living in Indiana as you know I've moved all over the place Indianapolis me a couple of my friends we think we'd be you know we we used to have a group that we go with my little brother and his friends and younger kids and we didn't want to go with the little kids anymore right I'm eleven and I'm a big man you know\nSo we we go on our own me and a couple of my friends\nAnd we got an apple right some lady gave us apples and you know Rob trick or treating you don't want an apple ...

has been terrible for a couple of years now he can throw down field he can't complete passes on third down and he throws way too many interceptions nope we're sticking with Eli the giants will ruin this not taking a quarterback\nFor Fifteen Years old knowing the giants they'll step it at this year in wind up getting Ronald Reagan next year but they can sit back and look and go here Sam Donald who has been better than Eli Manning this year and that's kind of hard to do but Sam Donaldson better\nAnd you say boy we have steak one Barclay we did this and we still snake and we're still not any good so you can't tell me that this works out at number two I'm Sorry yes say quote Barclay as talented sacred Barkley the talented guy and I get it\nHe's not been great he's been good he's been pretty good he's been great in fantasy because he especially Hammond PBR leave these wonderful it's like\nEvery time you see this for ... actors\nAnd actresses when they wind up getting bad publicity for something right what happens there ages call around and they say hey can you get somebody to say something nice about my ... my act or you don't get a direct or say something nice or he's in the mix for a job or a commercial something to rehabilitate their image would it for whatever reason than let's say it's anything bad\nBut I feel like that's what goes on with steak one Barclay it's like every few days when the giants have really bad publicity they find people hey can you say something really great about sake one Barclay like today all all the all the former grades is all by ... or watering at\nAt how uh how good sake what barking like a giant said battle is for a few days getting ready for a game someone say something nice about sake one part but it's all that was that but\nIt's a stand alone game so you're going to get more guys chirping I had one of these games as opposed to a normal Sunday right when it's just one of a number of games on the slate not that an eagles giants match it isn't going to get enough attention but when we look at this team as it was constructed\nWe looked at the running back by committee approach that they've taken the last few years which was clearly\nAn awful failure and so when you're looking at it\nAs a complete disaster in many respects but then you look at All right we spent money on the offensive line we've got back we resigned em it will be happy shepherds here anger and here\nWe bring in the running back not that the running backs are transcendent figures right that's that's the big thing and all it is is that it has to go hand in hand with a lot of other parts and gentlemen and the front office thought that they'd done that moving made those parts stop moving up your sense of wine was fixed all of those things they put enough back on it\nTo make it at least functional and it's not\nI mean that the playing of the year is the late last mackerel really work though I mean I ... speckled you let me but I don't know that\nIt's all about think about ways track of what it is window dressing right and then and then you go over the top with whatever else you know and I I'm I'm In the mix on natural speckled okay that's what I mean but the other great word to say oh well I I figured I could get that I'd like my last day to be back all I mean I have a minute ...\nThat's ... that's that will get more gang that's a good day more gigs more opportunity that's commercial there was I had it right there\nBut you know you you put some fresh paint on it in a way you go and you thought it was better well they've been awful and you're playing the year is the flowers like ... ... through five weeks\nNow five and a half as much as you like sacred Barclay yeah it's still the leg whip that's going to define the season to this point ah here's\nThe thing I Would agree with you up until about eight minutes ago because coming up next the image of the giants season is now going to be old old back them both for half time the eagles are up big\nAnd waited we tell you what happened with him right before half time that's coming up next winter ad swollen dome\nOn at how about a ... this is the truth

I got to play feeling and Kaine and Allen\nSo I'm like All right now my flex spot like hot spot for that one so yeah but it's still Keenan Allen I got a great spot for you know and yeah but I I ... and Alan ... Osbourne might've fires you on the spot [laughter] as you mentioned I under I it's just these skied and that certain guys you got to even though they're playing\nTough matchup and staff Jason ... no I Can't ... I mean I could have played Jeffrey and my flex by but I got more ... playing my flex bought I got Lamar Miller coming back then I like about it so I'm like you know\nOutside Jeffrey you know seven catches sixty six yards and two touchdowns yeah Bertie one to six the eagles lead the giants\nAnd I left him on my mentioned fantasy so there's that it happens buddy I'm Sorry right when\nIt went on to broadcast questioning the efforts of the giants defensive players last eagles Dr ... knife through butter down ... touchdown passes Jeffrey and the giants I guarantee you\nGiants a giants fan looking at this clock right now I'm just saying just have a running clock we just want this to be over let's just get this over and I don't have to worry about football for the next ten days let's just let's just get this over an hour because this is just absolutely awful but it is good\nThat the broadcast booth sees what we were just talking about here you got a bunch of guys that just looked like they are going through the motions to professional football it's\nWeeks six it's weak sick leave quit yeah\nRight and what have you ever go back to junior is you still have to do your own jab jobs and here's the other thing I Do I guarantee you the majority of the players don't know about they have no idea they don't know that because what they did not looking whereas oh Dell like we are because we're watching the game it's on TV\nYou know I guarantee you most of the players don't know that oh what a beforehand because look he went in before half time it's the big headline of the game right now ... we've had a good first step but oh back I'm leaving the field before half time when the giants office was on the field is what's gaining a lot of attention right now and wait till they start to answer questions in the in the uh\nIn in the post game when it's going to be okay what do you think about oh they'll even if you're\nA what a what what ... what what I ... a um\nOh boy hey where's or any or it's just way way way up to the gym at somebody\nElse's bailed out Eli Manning on a badly throw a ball on third down their first get this first third down conversion they'd been over there prior Fifteen and now sake on Barclay jail what what are the sprints the daylight touchdown giant\nMore fantasy points for me say gone bars with this is his best game by far as a pro in the end zone is now eighty two yards rushing and he's up well over a hundred yards on the ground and that touchdown he's got along the fifty yards he kept Jaycee ...\nIt's a good game he's having a good game he came to the link twelfth and rushing\nThroughout the Lincoln rushing he's having a lot of game time of just how to game like this uh last week oh Adam Sandler hell of a game plan right into\nThat well we asked by Hugo twelfth in Russia I Want to know total your to your among running back where it was\nTotally on his own right I Will look up totally you're going to say that out\nOf wide eyed celebrate the the virtues of that run and again in the first half they had their opportunities and that that's the other part of it is you got to be the frustrating part for giants fans\nAnd for the giants players themselves as they they had a couple of point blank range tries you you picked up a big first down yet first engulfing before and you end up settling for the local and then you have another you'll go try you got roses who has an injury right he's playing through a quad\nBut two out of three and the fuel goals that that's not going to be enough it's up even yes you get suckered in the over under was forty four and a half for whatever said as it's been raining it's going to be bogged down no we're seeing big plays and with the defense laying down for the giants you're not going to when\nYou're not going to win with a bunch of a field goal intense just not going to work\nAnd look and look this is where the giants are at look at this and this is where we're at with with both auto back I'll just go back and forth it's old Allen sake on its own sake what is that despite the fact that ... that cycle and Barkley got over two hundred yards a scrimmage tonight the giants of Thirteen points right I mean he's got two hundred yards a scrimmage Thirteen points\nThirteen points you should you have a running back with two hundred yards discrimination thirty points\nBut this is the issue say corn Barkley is a nice player and he's having a phenomenal night tonight phenomenal night but the giants are getting dropped\nAnd they've been getting dropped all season long if you have a quarterback doesn't matter you can have it you could have a jacket running back and it doesn't matter 'cause you're still going to win games 'cause that's the most important position in the NFL that's what the giants are going to root drafting him and oh back I'm now it's going to be a case of\n... what do you do what do you do do you suspect what do you do he actually came back out now he's played he left the the L just on and he just made a cat so the giants allowed him to come back out and play in the second half\nSo in trying to predict what the giants are going to say after the game was ... they're going to say not a lot and it's been taken care of and meanwhile all it is is just you wait for the next direction from your weight for next and he'll couch this under I don't like losing I don't like that\nHe's not getting wasn't getting past has thrown its way in the first half and he decides I'm going to become the story I told her back I mean he knows what his actions do you can't stand up and say oh he's just passionate he's this and that\nYou you you think he's going to love the fact people talking so well about sacred Barclay not talking about him a come on\nDon't make it on a couple of one hand it catches then\nFind a way to work work yourself up and down the field we could be five minutes away from them fighting on the field that would be fun I I Would take sick one Barclay though and it's like I think there's no question I Would do with those dogs yeah he would fight of just within the odds Zillow does all you need\nA ... where we sit right now eagles lead the giants thirty one Thirteen six minutes to go in the third quarter sake one Berkeley touchdown\nI'm always in put a hotbed because baseball is a groove Chris you know what I mean no one you know quite how did you see the ball come in and you got a good ... you know I on it sometimes it's just it looks like a beach ball\nAnd then you can hit and then other times have you on the phone you just can't hit it is it's it's a squeaky thing\nAnd that's why when somebody's swinging about well you're better off keeping them in a totally cools down\nI ... I think more than any of the other major sports baseball is a group sport it is you can go into a slump and it just feels like the worst thing in the world but when you're hot which as you say ... is when you're hot you just feel great up there to play and it really doesn't matter who's pitching\nDoesn't matter and that's the thing that this probably came from above though I met this came above day Robert\nI don't I don't doubt it I mean I think that that's those are the managers that they want now that's why I'm a little surprised about the Joe Jr already\nIn Texas you know what I mean like that yeah that they're going after him because those guys are are becoming extinct all those you know the older managers who still caught by field by field and not by the front office given them telling them what to do the hitting them their line up\nYou know when a J him when he wants to be asked shows Chris last year\nOr he didn't make up a single line up\nCan you I mean think about that matters you may go they used to give them the lineup from upstairs from the front office and say this is what the line of going to be here I'd like to believe this your first three pitchers that are coming in after the starter yes [laughter]\n[noise] it's unbelievable but I look at look I mean you're obviously the Astros one have you on analytics at every team is heavy on analytics yet some more than others like you look at the Yankees who just got ousted by the red Sox they're heavy analytics and that leads to that's one reason they put together\nSuch a home run heavy ball club and the boys are they have one yet but they haven't won the world series since then since two thousand nine and they probably weren't as into the analytics into nine ... they certainly went out on the are now no no not not at all I mean I think there's got to be a mix of the analytics it's a part of the\nEquation but it but it is not the end all be all you pick\nThe Dodgers and how a tight in an uncomfortable will Dodger fans be just with the idea that courage Shaw has led Dodger fans down a number of times\nIf you remember the reason that they last World Series everybody blamed it on game seven but actually Chris they lost that World Series in game five ... Shaw was spotted it for nothing\nLead in that game and then the ... the Astros tied it the Dodgers came back gave her show another three runs and he gave that up yeah and that was that was really the gas\nThat got hurt out of his fans are nervous\nEven though you got the great claim courage on them out debit card so we're going to bring her back and she knows why ... is not playing tonight I hung up leads to start what's going on\nThere well he's not starting his ... his a lefty so you're not going to see as much as ... or Jack Peterson and during tonight's game making you know coming in Penn shed obviously as the as the relievers command they are going to see more of match camp and Brian ... David Freese\nAnd that's why that's why yeah scale is not in a line that ... that is it's an analytics thing back\nDown there I had it where he he's I but I gather he doesn't he's not Haiti well I Know he doesn't overall but his average is probably horrible against left he says my ... yeah\nYeah and it doesn't do well against lefty Sam ... which\nIs weird because most of the time you get a leftist", "year": "2018", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "12"}
