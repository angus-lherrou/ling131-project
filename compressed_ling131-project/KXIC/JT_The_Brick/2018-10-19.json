the wheel saying well thank you for\nGuard Jordan Bullhead and comments on the teams offseason work\nWe've done the same girls I think we just amped up the ends of the energy I'm done more of them I think this is all season that we normally have which\nIs obviously needed a but having a strategy that would be able to ramp up every single day coming up rights when I was going to be heavily ... that has to lead or for native so [noise] um [noise] I I have have have have that extra for that and really help us off\nOr to degree get a little difference as we know the um we're going to be what's expected of us this year we had last year but\nI Know the the guys in there were working\nIn the gym or so or any of her so the\nThe ... all of us and\nNovember is not far away I'm Rob Brooks for inside Iowa\nAiming to bring chaos I see I always say these news and sports station available on your Amazon smart speaker Jesse Alexa play eight hundred tax icy and I heard radio\n[noise] Fox Sports trending\nBoston Red Sox will try to punish their chickens in the world series should I leave the American league championship series three games to one game five comes up momentarily from Houston French shot syrup three one over the Astros\nYou know what I'm saying is that this could be blow back the other way and now I mean if the money's there I don't think there's going to be blow while\nUsing some players in the league now I'm just saying that they might do not like it but the way they did him was\nWas pretty raw I thought I don't think people are trip over that I I think you're right it was raw but I think people will be like hey if they're trying to get ... you know I get it\nSo I don't think that'll be a problem I just think if if that's the reason you do or don't get ... somethings wrong that that if if players or quirky some players I Know I just I mean we thought they were talking about how sensitive Kevin Iran is yeah but I think if that meant the difference\nBetween getting you you wouldn't take Kevin Durant but with Kevin to rent really going to go you know I'm thinking about coming here but that Bruce vote on that part cat I don't know about that I mean I you know I I don't lose bone and then maybe outside and I don't know\nBut but he did have a burner account [laughter] he does respond to kids on Twitter guy on their model basement right now I'm just saying now Philadelphia this is what is interesting to me\nThe talk and this comes from Zach lower ESPN respect the reporter he said and wrote that Philadelphia Jimmy Butler had asked for Philadelphia but that Philadelphia hasn't shown much interest now I the only reason that could make sense to me right obviously number one\nAre you concerned that you be able to keep it but you can have conversations with him to make sure okay we're going to give you the max and you're going to say yeah I'm I'm On the state okay cool you can take care of that by\nThe only other thing though is are they looking at one look at how he treated or viewed the young players in Minnesota call after these houses are star Andrew Wiggins who's you know close to a star\nHow we treat been or Joel or both ... maybe that's that can be that's the only thing outside of the concerns about whether you can keep them or not that I can imagine Philadelphia will be thinking if indeed they are not interested in him\nI just look at things differently like when somebody's trying to get out of a situation and you notice in relationship people say stuff sometimes to\nTo get you worked up right tape and and then it doesn't mean you walk out and never see them again you might not like to comment at the time but they're trying to to to uh\nBut I mean they they they don't if you don't know what they're trying to\nGet under your skin I'm just saying on I could look at that the same way and go well\nAs you go to turn on all too young stars those guys I think on a different level I Know towns as a as a really good player and and and ... but what are they those two guys I don't think that there are no no\nI think ... and then beat her by editor towns is on that level but Wiggins is not\nAnd I I just don't understand why Rob if I'm Philadelphia I Want Jimmy Butler\nI Want him now do they think is personalities too strong Whitcomb where they clash with Joelle NBA who has a strong personality where they bother been somewhat quiet I don't know I'm just saying I Can't imagine why a Philadelphia team that below it\nBy drafted march ... training to get ... votes instead of Jason

don't believe that that will be in your white I mean I'm I'm with you is\nDefinitely shaky I'm just saying that's you know I just can't buy it that's the you know\nThe good wife takes to broaden hey\nIf you don't take this hit I may never work in the league again she likes to big house vacations he's making a million dollars do you know what I'm saying so so baby I need you to wear this for

L. C. asked that some people think cost the Houston Astros\nAgain let's get to the callers let's see what you think the white in Kentucky you welcome to the actor you\nKnow they're doing great okay I got\nA little statement it real quick to think about is like it's like the letter law a rule he just rare okay you know I eat when you read ... player ban stretches the ball was in the field of play right it's it's it's not knowing if there was this is I'm In ...\nIn the short okay now here's why I say and that's why I think it was fair because like you said one of the market and which one you're up here to because the Mulkey\nWas saying he was ... you know it was over the line that go on line so technically that's on a plane but if he's going to catch the ball says he caught the ball after the whole room Iraq they want they want to say was said there was still\nWas not ... no I I I get that and you write Dwight you're absolutely right on that they wouldn't\nWhat's the difference in the band has an opportunity because that ball is coming right at him and that's what I'm saying the fan didn't do anything but to put his hand up to protect itself well you ought to try to get the ball you know what I'm saying like like if if it was obvious Chris\nAnd look at a glove up and the guy\nTook his hand not trying to catch the ball but swatted his glove down\nI could see where somebody could call and say that's interference so should intention be a factor that you have to look at it because I don't think you want to put 'em in the position of judge no but I if I see that the guys knock it his glove down and not trying to catch the ball I could say that hey Dan and Utah you're on the odd couple of Fox Sports radio what's up then\nI just wanted to say that route is a hundred percent correct\nUm when when the ball leaves the perimeter of the feel uh he goes into the stands offensive just much a right to the all as a player does and I remember a foul ball and the first with her baseline of the field or goes over and tries to catch the ball along the railing\nAnd he goes into the stands on a touch with the ball they don't never called the airfare\nAnd she never interference because it's in it's inside the stands and a player can try to go to the to the side and and sneak in and if it's the home team they might let the guy catch you and if it's if it's a visiting team right they just stand there and don't get out of the way right\nAll right All right Robin Ohio welcome to the ...\nThanks for having me I'm One of those and what the problem we don't want this to be a problem in America man you know like in a battered some some stadiums are packing the ...\nYou know five foot whip the grass swing the wall and the first row seats second of all I don't think optic ... baseball wants to see a friend in drill in the face\nIn the car wherever he doesn't get that off and the sand can't reach out because they really want to see your finger blasted in the face he got hit ... Robert I'm\nSaying you know and you know we've got to protect the fans they don't want to see someone get hit by showing all over TV and radio that that's where the weather or whatever\nNo doubt thanks for the call appreciate it\nAlright alright yeah fans gave you a little love my thing is is Joel West made the call on the field now whether or not he was wrong he made the call I didn't see definitive maybe it just wasn't a good angle and it wasn't they didn't have the greatest angle on this shot but\nI didn't see any angle they show me Moody's glove was definitely over the yellow line\nAll all I'd say is if if you're in love and care that ball hits that fan\nNot I don't mind fans reach and nobody minds may is trying to catch the ball and that's the part of\nBaseball but he did close movies in movie would have caught that\nBall ... glow\nCome home and you're talking about a great a great right fielder All right it's the AQAP will keep it locked Fox Sports radio we'll be

Gary are available via streaming ... dot com\n[noise]\nTalk horse trendy and\nIt's a loss that LeBron James is out they'll abroad James has a better shot at winning an Academy Award this year than he\nDoes he ever being fought I Know I Know he's Meryl Streep I doubt it I I didn't even tell you that [laughter]\nBut if he wins then BP or the Lakers win fifty two games\nBrandon Ingram emerges as a second star they get to the second round of the playoffs and get bounce is that a failure\nCan I give you the ... for all the things that you just said how 'bout they don't win fifty games and they win forty six\nAnd that has severed the right seat and get knocked off by\nA Houston or Golden State in the first round and maybe a brand and ain't gonna take to step back playing will abroad he feels uncomfortable he doesn't know where he fits in exactly Lorenzo ball continues to struggle a when well abroad those ... passes wide open for threes I'm just saying ... coups has\nA sophomore jinx the second year he's not as great as he was his first year I'm not wishing any of that on anybody I'm just saying\nThat as much as you talk about what could happen those other things could happen as well and those\nThe ... the the cast off don't supply will abroad thought they would then you have a a a potion or or mixture for disaster and the Lakers aren't as good and the bronze knocked out in the first round\nWell that would only be a failure if they don't they strike out free agency\nThen you really start to look at this situation\nAnd wonder what the heck is going on news break that the Broncos are absolutely mall lean their zone a ... percent as well I'm not I could have bought that pass come across there was nobody that will end of the coverage is that\nThere are about twenty seven three Emanuel sand is just catches a bomb from king them they making case Cain them look good today I mean granted they are too big to fix it for the right\nUm look the Broncos Rob you begin demolishing them they're not out of this race by any means they do have a good defense no they do and Kaine them you know here's what he is but maybe he can be a manager and and I think they have a shot that's all I'm saying at the playoffs\nAge seven seven Ninety nine on Fox\nAs we um you know wait for the bronze debut tonight I'm with the Lakers\nWhere are you ... is it am I my asking too much when I say that he's destined for failure that the LeBron James we've seen the last eight years or in the eastern conference will be no more in the western conference\nAnd every game will be a big game that teams will be fighting and saying we're not letting LeBron come in here and clown or ... or or or beat us up with these with these with this with this cast of characters that he has a this could be a fight in a struggle for LeBron every single night in the western conference\nSo what are you saying he's not going to I mean like look I ... when we can run down the team after Houston and Golden State New Orleans Anthony Davis and a bunch of good players\nPortland Damien alert CJ McConnell them and a bunch of gives you want what Charles Barkley said the other day he even\nPicked San Antonio all over the Lakers even pig Denver over the Lakers he's got other teams that he's saying that he's picking over and the same with me I just think that they can be six or seven seat or because last year just going off of last year Chris the difference between a third seat in the eighth seat was to game right and it\nOh they they could I mean look after those two teams I mentioned goals they used in there about six teams that are very evenly matched\nBut I think LeBron James if indeed he's the best player in the world which we think he is\nCan make a difference and get his team over the hump so at least be a a fourth fifth see something like the auditing\nThird seat what a father Tom catches up with well on this and that's always of course some a possibility\nWhen you're in your sixteen year but barring that and then if that happens you know blaming\nBarring that I think you make difference Rob I think LeBron is going to be more focused on this regular season then he has been in the past several years because when he was in Cleveland it was I even in Miami it was all about June\nNow yeah he wants\nTo win a chance to look at you you buy a say that no matter who say you\nKnow I'm I'm going to tell you I'm not going to be a lot hide it of course is he going to want to win a championship try to win a championship deep down inside he knows that they're not going to beat golden stations\nAre sold out your regular would you admit then this is my point the first time abroad James goes into a season no and he can't win I don't think he believes ... I don't think he believed that the last two years even though they were dominated Adeline once he felt he could win last year a championship\nOut if he thought he could win I at this I think this is the first time he knows he has no shot to win\nI mean it may be the first time since two thousand seven he knows you get to the finals right no shot right and if you don't get to the finals you know that's what I mean so at least in Cleveland you got there but you won the guy killed a name for being three and six\nHe got tired of it he didn't want to be three and seven years they that's what he said oh little second in my\nMost is the most out through give them five minute\nDrive out [laughter]\nI didn't\n... offering top high school players one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars to play in the ... as he was still rather go to college sitting sociology class eat bad\nFood in the cafeteria it'll tell you why ... is the capital L macko chicks energy league is the ... radio\nAll of your favorite towns are\n\nThree on the way\nAnd like the weird dominating this year's coverage are you in [noise] this is Fox Sports radio\nEverybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk\nHere's an idea let's add save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off a pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy go dot com and a Fifteen minute you could say fifty percent or more on car insurance\nMoney in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do you do today [noise]\nI don't think you have you on the phone ... with the capital one ... I'm limited capital miles on every pecking I\nNo ... yeah I wanted to see him slight Floyd like eight years I write write actually square dance to laugh and then it would be even worse this time\nYeah and what it turned out what many had a torn rotator cuff or something like that so they say yeah exactly so to\nThe gym you You're welcome thank you very much the odd couple of Chris Broussard ... coming you live from the guy on Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in your car insurance with\nGeico go to guy go dot com or call\nA hundred nine four seven eight UT oh the only hard part is figuring out which way is easier route\nThe G League\nThe minor league for the NBA but I Know minor league stop it what is it\nIt's where you train referees that's what the law I Know there have been several players the ... trademark within the joy work was drafted and nobody was sent down\nSeveral players that are made their way over the years and currently from the G leaked to the NBA I'm not saying they become stars you've got two guys role players who sit\nOn the bench who can't even get dressed all money and he had that gee league is\n... I'm not I'm not by now usa is coming into Julie\nNow did you hear me out I really hate Ali G. W. got under your skin would that he'll boat [noise] do you have you been waiting for the news ... hate are going to give me the news All right ... I think is a great idea was that you used the A R I don't know but\nThey'd already fine uh [noise] the gator I\nLose hope they sold the league the Delaware developmentally sort of the G League date or a writer for money whatever\nYou need money I mean every one of these arenas is bombs are Muslim and look at that they've gotten Nike jerseys or lack thank you thank you he the\nThe boat I didn't know but I Need I Need some bumps right goodness and I'll eat a hug rednecks break I'm gonna give you all you need a herd ready you know what I'm going to a charge he puts his hands on [laughter]\n\nAnyway okay go ahead Jean league under the auspices of the NBA is going to offer was announced today going to offer\nPlayers like the elite you know and they're tied up now with USA Basketball so they're going to be following these kids from a young age to determine who who is the lead they're going to be given ... vice and so on and so forth\nAnd letting them train you know with you know in NBA facilities is on and so forth so the kids that they determine our the elite like the guys that would be one in one hundred and twenty five thousand dollar contract so play\nIn the G League get to work with NBA level coaches training training gurus working NBA facilities did also get trained\nIn life skills in transitioning to the NBA\nI think it's a great idea it's going to ... it's going to end this farce of the student athlete who goes to school for one semester\nAnd then enters the league after one year at the school it'll end all that if these guys say the contracts and they'll go to the ... league and then get drafted into the NBA year after I think is a great\nMove do you notice a trial going on about money payments to top ... players right\nA guns will be able to write these kids will be able to hire ages\n... so these kids should take a pay cut from going to college and take a hundred and twenty five thousand from the NBA when they get much more under the table you want to go take a pay here you go from all gross they've been paying people forever you know what I Know what what\nAre we all do it it's all in the new one on knowing what bells and they go and do nothing for me I'd rather go out on the twenty five above board what is now with all the news the\nTrials and everything they can only really shut that stuff down there or was shut it down to some degree\nChris you it ain't gonna shut it down 'cause there's although you go to college I Would go to college who has no interest in Carmelo ... for one\nYou want to national championship did yes that's more valuable than than going to some fraud gee league\nA frog could you say there's a lot of fraud in minor league baseball is not you're talking to you just said is about\nTen kids who are they playing again they will be playing a game like better but teaching in a phase one basketball there then we have to buy is full of guys that won't even playing the Gene Kelly\nThe G League I'm telling you what the league is about that's not a credible lead to have six or eight guys who are who are in that category to make a league around it's not\nIt's fraudulent Lewis I Do not guy I was going to have ... they will have a better competition in the G ... fight and they would division one asked you you want to go play in New Haven Connecticut Richmond, Virginia instead of going to Syracuse\nPlaying for national championship Carmelo Anthony ... total first of all Carmelo that was sixteen Seventeen I don't know and it cut mellow is a much different is totally got more money than a hundred and twenty five\nHundred maybe I mean look we know underhanded these guys get paid but now you can get one hundred and twenty five grand clean\nAbove board you can get within agent you know the age of may be helping you out to finance or you know how that works\nAnd you can get trained by NBA level coaches in training staff you can work out in NBA level arenas I don't have to worry about it carry out the fires of going to class I think is a good day is not fifty thousand dollars a year it's a hundred and twenty five and you're\nYou know like opening the door for that's all ... paying for my date but I think who ever asked the\nPerson out should pay for the day now if I go out with ... ... if she asked me out and we go out and this Dutch I'm paying Vermont she's playing with it has to be said that that has to be set up a four well she asked me out and we don't set up who's paying and we go out\nAnd we eat and then it's like we're going Dutch I I wouldn't be upset with that let's bring about how would they don't expect me to pay when you asked me out how about\nIf she asked for a lobster dinner and then a\n... no no that's that's great let's bring you to do as well and they're on the assumption is you're paying\nThem up if you are where are you on this if if a female you know calls me up and bites me out to the movie I'm I'm expect in order to\nPay or not here's the thing and I'm
