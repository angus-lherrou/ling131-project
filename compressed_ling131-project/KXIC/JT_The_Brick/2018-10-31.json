Georgia at five and six respectively Oklahoma Washington state Kentucky and Ohio State found out the top ten\nNo man they they should have made that decision a long time ago um\nYou know it's unfortunate because the giants are terrible you know you are a couple of games they play he's got his to fight and it's not like they're just giving up and they ... they don't have any resistance at all you know I I thought for sure that they probably should have made that decision right before the season started if not the first three or four three games of the year\nWhen he was saying well I'm you know you got ... while he was there in general to go out and play and foot up you know for for them was in the ... you can get them to fall\nEverybody has to suffer because he last not perform and there's nothing he laughed because he's a Super Bowl champions he's done a lot of that organization but his time is up at the time it's a move off\nShonda what are you retired in two thousand twelve um today's NFL a lot different even from that time six years ago you see these quarterbacks putting up these astronomical numbers it's hard to hit them you can't hit receivers like you used to what do you think of today's NFL\nWhite thing a fight\n[laughter] you want to hit a body right now and again you know any more\nI I I Do appreciate them trying to clean up the game or you have friends um mentors guys who's had some bad stuff going on and a half a brain injury type stuff so I'm Glad that they\nAre protecting the flavor\nOf what I I just hope along the way that don't forget the reason why people love the game because it is such a fruit and violent sport\nI'm not everybody can do it everybody's not face to play football and that's why it's so fascinating the people that he's gay guy he's athletic strong guys and and you guys to fifty plus we've been running for foreign or forty or is why they love to watch the game so you take that away a little bit you have\nA some disgruntled fans you'll have people that just turned away and thus far me playing yeah that'd be that's the way in hell I mean you know I'll be I'll be planning for free all the fires and also like to every game there's no way\nWhile part uh how about the Dallas Cowboys uh they got more Cooper right to help that crust got they figured that they could go without does Brian now they're adding a receiver ... is that going to fix the fence or problem or is it more has more to do with jak\nRather than just a receiver\nLong you know the funny thing is you have to change that have different mentality that mindset\nIs when they go for your body was brought in to safely fully so they can win the right now they have a belief that they can still have an opportunity to win that division\nOf the writers are you there they're already preparing for the future\nYou know their trade away future of Yahoo straight away God for future ... big because they're already on their rebuilding process so it gets out cowboy bringing them Oregon it's it's a ... a big applause for them because they're paying into the place where the heck out we're trying to win right now we're trying to you know we'll go to\nYou know we got that ... first got here the guy can play we got a great guy in the ... office aligned with lots of things we were listening is somebody who can go to get to a wide receiver and they brought it to me so what he pan out to be\nYou know the greatest things uh for them or not he's definitely going to be beneficial to take some of the the the pressure off the back and take her to pressure off it you're going to happen to go out and play the games and really\nShow you mentioned the raiders and how they're basically playing for the future they've got nine games left how tough the pro players in the locker room when you know you know we're not trying to make the playoffs we're not going to make the playoffs and you still have basically three quarters of the season left\nDo you think we'll see guys basically given up given half effort I mean that's got to be tortured to go through a season like this when you note organizations really not trying to win you still got ten games left\nI I don't think so because at the end of the day since ... organizations\nAlready planning for the future um these guys are planning for contract was a team because they might not be there so or whatever you put on film however you're performing is how you're going to get jobs or you're next on track and another organization so you can go out\nThe dog is and you know play half feet because that you're going to uh\nYou know kind of shoes itself in the foot you're running for\nYour plan for money you plan for your family and your your personal future than you can go out there and

I think the caller might be getting it does I Do think Jordan would have been the best player and he would have ... from winning championships just like you kept everybody else from when the championships\nJordan just had that killer he joined that everything\nWhen you leave with leaders of doing that you made since\nHe was fundamentally sound he was as athletic as they get\nHe was a smart player he could do everything skill while they're there was no weakness not foul shooting ... D fish not jump shooting not going to the basket finishing he could play within the system\nYou know he didn't dominate the bought in over dribble he shot a lot when he didn't just dribble it\nForever arrow is like a lot of these guys including the bronze into do so Michael Jordan would've chapel abroad for women some championship final question eight\nSeven seven Ninety nine on Fox is the number alright\nYeah was that a tweet from Michael Jordan a bad look for LeBron will continue the conversation with you next is the ...

a hundred nine four seven eight UT oh the only hard part is figuring out which way is easier and remember this is a trash\nTalk Tuesday that's why are you a chance to trash anyone anything\nIn a world of sports so wall later on in the next hour you'll be able to call up and hug to get those kids are next to the curb and get ready for some trash talking eight seven seven Ninety nine ... box but we are talking\nLeBron James and a Michael Jordan and we're going to\nLose the go so let's let's go to Joe in Utah no in Utah he he probably have no love for Michael Jordan\nConsidering how much pain he puts the jazz fans through but Joe you're on the odd couple welcome\nBoys love your show he or she tore our now ... da da da\nDa and he discussed shouldn't have to go to begin and end with Bill Russell when you've got to eleven championships one for each finger on one extra one that you could put in there where you wanted\nYou've got to NCAA's championships and Olympic medal and his wife championship with as a player coach I mean this guy has done it on all levels and has you know when you're double digits in championships\nThere's few people in the history of any sporting\nTeam that can claim that what a joke I tell you a bill Russell baby\nWhat Joe here we go he'll be out on this okay how many teams were in the NBA back then how many teams uh yeah probably half of what were they not have half way aide Joe and\nThis was the problem is not that none of this to bill Russell\nWhat if you go back to that you're right\nThe Celtics water if you had a great team and you stayed together there was no free agency and all that they kept winning the Celtics won the Yankees won every year in the fifties right same thing on a molecule Canadians when they had six teams in the NHL they want every year it's it's it's a twisted\nIt's not real because the great players all on the same to wall one team and that's why they want all the time it doesn't mean that bill Russell wasn't a great player but but don't kid just sell football playoff rounds and just eight teams that bill Russell the greatest player ...\nLet me let me make a content you know I don't want to Jordan played there were very few players the content with Jordan don't ... outlet ... athletics that Bill Bill Russell how will and yet it take growth on with the Lakers and the Sixers that's a thought\nHere's what here's what I'll say Joe and I saw ... made a great point but when I look at the go discussion\nIt's not it's it's a combination of several things but two of the things are individual dominance statistically ... just dominant spirit but also statistically nor do I have been winning\nOkay if you got only one but not the other you're not the goat bill Russell obviously was a tremendous winder and and one of the greatest player who food is no real at all but statistically\nBill Russell was a forty four percent career shooter six ten in that era when players were a little smaller he's forty four percent from the floor he never\nAverage more to Eighteen points a game how all those little guys playing remembered it was Fifteen points so I just all Russell have the uh wins the winning eleven ... but he doesn't\nThe individual statistical dominant to match up with a Michael Jordan or even a Kareem Abdul Jabbar and\nLike and what I brought up with those three teams I mentioned that the law and all those championships the Yankees won a World Series in ten years in the fifties okay and the ...\nIt is one all the time so that you're all yeah kind of skewed because there were so few Myers couldn't move and you couldn't go anywhere so once you had a great team Chris you will grade up until God's retired so it's a little different age seven seven\nNinety nine or ... what about a week ago in California joined the odd couple Fox Sports radio what's up we go\nOut and ran I Love the show man oh man thank you Brian you\nWant to thank you guys made a comment on the wrong putting it in the in the conversation one thing you gotta realize this is if you look at how\nMany other you know where they're going to say you know that they're in the back and you know regardless of one of the best players in there are number one secondly\nI don't think the bomb something just conversation Jordan made a program on the wrong on\nAny do you know what I mean he made a poke at Brown\nYeah 'cause the commercial basically making fun of the conversation on didn't initiate that discussion and I was\nGetting ready to come or somewhere 'cause obviously like you couldn't say well Jordan could have been talking about Coby or Kareem read about because he said the numbers are the same so I feel you on that definitely legit point that's what was your point\nYeah so you know if if you want in a twenty three maybe find reference twenty three that's clearly a job on day one of our safety thing are already in the comment I've been wrong or said that I'm an army I was ... years ago you know so\nYou know I Would say I was just saying that you shouldn't have to put yourself or talk about yourself and not like when you're great other people will do it for\nYou does make a fair point though 'cause you you\nAgain we can't make it vague and say well my could have been talking about any of the great players because he did say and I know he didn't we know he didn't write the script now I Know this say they have the same number that can only mean LeBron now I got it so I guess that's a good point Rico Dylan in Illinois Welcome to the couple\n... thanks for having me on really like your show a lot of your body you know LeBron James is got great great ability as a basketball player and every time\nOr those to me he does something immature I mean he did it in Boston the players seem to give up did it when he was with Dwayne wade making fun of Dirk Lewinski being sick with the cold air coming out of the\nWall came back to bite him and that did they wound up and he was the reason why\nYeah and then he does it again with a comment like you just said now you did it with the law when he went to Miami Michael Jordan enemies got that measurable quality of heart is nobody else has been able to touch so to me Michael is always going to be the great\nYou are soon then the odd couple with raw Parker and Chris Broussard in\nOf our DJ Alex shirts\nAnd if you called in and want to get on this abroad and enjoy they hang tight we're going to get to you so do many hang up hang tight\nAlright but first and I got a serious question for you before you give him but let's get Parker's

I'm Still not crazy about their defense in and where that is what they're seven to one hard on a number one\nAnd the hit parade is the rams I Know they weren't that you know that people thought they were going to blow the Packers out Packers made it very competitive game package even at a chance to win a date\nHad the ball in the final two minutes where they were in a ... era Rogers hand but it didn't happen bottom line is that there's still a you know and they're they're a great team and so far no one has shown me that they're not that they're better than the rams so does my top five\nTo yeah I think you have to have Iran's their number one they've had some tough games though where we lately Seattle Seattle they be thirty three thirty one Broncos they be twenty three twenty foot the bill Packard\nShows that it shows that they can agree that it's not just blown out team that they can compete and if somebody to be at the back you know that they could still win games I like that about them yup yeah who would be to you got the patriots or to or the chiefs\nI probably would have I think the patriots I think the page I mean they beat the chiefs and I I think they're the best team in AFC I mean it might not they're not on paper but they get it done man I'd have to have them number two I think New Orleans I probably put Kansas City at three I share your concern about\nTheir defense he fetches not you I mean New Orleans defenses had its issues but it seems like they might be getting\nBetter but they there for and who is your best team in there and not the order but\nThe fifth Caroline how a lot of ... yeah they want to have a few that could maybe be number five you know Houston is playing great and then they just added the merits Thomas and I had a day or just last week and my top five but they drop even though they're still went out yeah it's just because of\nThe other team that moved ahead yeah yeah but they don't get a good father is a few teams you could look at you so not bad I I give you ... are getting Jacksonville auditor they've been out for about two weeks after it took like three straight lawsuit to get them out odd\nCouple say two\n[noise]\nThis is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers at you but please stay with me and just Fifteen minute you could say fifty percent or more on your car insurance\nThis company has been offering great rates and great service for over Seventy five years and anytime you need help you can speak to one of their trained specialists twenty four seven\nGo to guy go dot com today sorry Bob and numbers and in five four three two one I'm Out of time but\nFive four jugs of map of synthetic Motorola\nOnly Eighteen to protect your interest from sludge an extreme temperatures but the you know it also protects our troops but each purchase of member both of the editor for Eighteen Ninety nine a portion goes beyond prepping fallen hero spot quality ... people that from Noel\nI don't know how does the president feels presses medical will say well sex recycling offering seven thirty one\nYears today canceling committed a calendar or Tuesday October thirtieth the public has invited to North liberty fire departments Halloween party\nThat'll take place in the fire station twenty by west ... street on Wednesday evening October thirty first from five until late they'll have candy cookies and go go along with a photo booths\nAnd trunk display brands who the cardinal public library holding a book sale at the library fourteen all one bit street on friday November second em Saturday November third hours of the sale or one thirty five thirty on friday and nine to bore on Saturday runs with the global public library\nUsed book sale proceeds to benefit the community and the librarian Daniel soul and volunteer firefighters dance at takes place on Saturday Night November third from Detroit until midnight episode one American Legion on main street music provided by Adam key admission just five dollars and the door\nJoined the shoulder ... drive on Thursday November ... team from eleven thirty until two Gloria the Lutheran Church one twenty three he's market street I was sitting enjoy homemade soups breads and deserts\n... will be accepting free will donations and new songs for shoulder houses low barrier winter shelter for more information visit shoulder house by would dot org\nThey once this last holiday was on her ... will be held out the church located at six thirty used to have an ...

anyone anything in the world of sports do you want to light up jumping\nArtist the odd couple coming you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in your car insurance was guy go go to a guy called dot com or call a hundred nine four seven eight you'd see all the all the hard part is figuring out which way\nIs easier ride we been talking about\nLove Ron and Michael Jordan that's certainly not a new topic but it the fire has gotten lip again this week with Michael Jordan doing this\nThe night football commercial\nTo promote the game between Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady and I think it's an appropriate it was very appropriate to have him Jay as the spokesman I guess for this game let's hear what he said or about these commercials\nA lot of talk going on these about who is the greatest ever [noise] who has a title [noise]\nI mean even the Jersey numbers officer\n[noise] maybe the best way to do this to pay it out\n[laughter] All right there it is and he's talking about Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady but LeBron James or Michael Jordan where the same Jersey number two number twenty three and I said you\nCouldn't blame one on one that's probably a little ... but I Know\nThey of course they they couldn't play you write one on one but I say it was appropriate to have joined do this and I'm saying that because\nYou and I both said Aaron Rodgers may be the most talented\nAnd with the eye test just the best quarterback we've ever seen\nAnd not just us a Shannon sharp who played with John Elway and played in the national\nFootball league for a long time swears by Aaron Rodgers right as the greatest through all the football he's ever seen\nAnd Tom Brady was very complimentary of Aaron Rodgers in this story I just saw today was on the radio in Boston are either today or yesterday he he spoke glowing Lee of Aaron Rodgers but here's the deal\nHe's not really in the Gulf conversation because he only has one champion light but as Tom Brady that's Joe ...\nBecause he had to look at Montana for no we are loving touchdown yeah pigs in the super bowl three MVP by two game winning ... we had to throw touchdowns not set up field goals were they needed a touchdown the wind and he was\nThere and let me give out Tom Brady these numbers just because you you you praise and your guy won five and three you got to twice as many Super Bowls as Joe Montana but but anyway\nThis is similar ... brown obviously has won three championships\nBut the there are a lot of people I'm not necessarily in this case I'm not in this camp but there are a lot of people that will say if you just look\nAt LeBron James play basketball the I test if you take out rings and winning and all that you would say he's the greatest basketball player ever I when I say that I Would not say that based on the ads that but a lot of people would\nAnd the brown though just have one even though he's got three he's lost six finals so he doesn't have the winning that Michael Jordan has just like Aaron Rodgers doesn't have the winning that Tom Brady has so that's why I thought it was appropriate\nTo ah let know ledge or do they have ...\nIt worked out perfectly it really is and and it uh it ... it was ... produced it and wrote that put together something that was great it may have made a lot of sense it was great\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six the three sixty nine if you want to weigh in on the ... brown Michael Jordan conversation board\nOr line up for trash talking which is coming up momentarily a anybody right anything in the world of sports it's your opportunity got thirty seconds come hard fast and strong\nDo whatever you got to do but if you're a chance when the odd couple debt brought up an interesting you know ... uh I think she was trying to play defense to beyond their dad was on the phone [laughter] but\nShe did say look what bronze not done let's see what he does now I don't think I think he's going to end up as the leading scorer of all time I think it's going to end up as the only player ever in the ... in this\nUh but I don't know that there's anything he can do other than something that probably unrealistic like when the next three championships but the old he's put himself above Michael Jordan what do you think they'll\nThey'll abroad people have to use everything else because he has the word I\nWant to look at the end you I look at that argument for LeBron is the individual numbers by hand longevity and you know in the era that will be an argument but the other ... didn't have a super team era\nBut but but they also Louis Bell that Michael Jordan led the MBA ten years in a row when scoring he look at the ... times in steel yes I mean it's not like Michael Jordan was a was a Duncan didn't do anything else this guy had an unbelievable Korea on paper and on top of it\nOne six a championship and didn't lose any when you add both together it's hard you cannot poop poop winning this is what it's all about that's why I always say more levy everybody all great he went to four straight Super Bowls nobody considers them the greatest coach\nGod I got a little bit of the call up and down or start during the cold shoulder and to the most hated in my opinion commissioner and all professional sports and\nOh yeah there you know Joe [noise]\nAlright though are the announcement the NHL partnership and Vegas yesterday a Batman collected in question though is that the end of last year about what about possible partnership investing in Vegas of course he just headed for the deflection and I'm pretty sure\nI'm not ... but that's where it's where it doesn't matter what anybody says\nThis is what's happening now of course textbook selection not up for what he said but I really hard for them or whatever I Want to\nAnd it has been unbelievable how long because Gary Batman used to be David storage right hand man yeah when I covered we recovered the MBA years ago right Gary ...\nAnd he's been the NHL commission lap band or as good as David Stern and I never started was a great command not well liked bookstore and made a couple of mistakes in the basketball without talking to the players the dress code\nThere were a couple of things that I didn't like above the mistakes but I'm dying you know he they faced a lot of obstacles there's so many other sports didn't make it as pop he was smart he's the guy decided let's market individuals' rapid and team but he also I might may work out but before he took over in eighty\nFour so he was way before Joe I Know what I'm saying George league that you're right yeah so we ... it kind of all came together for more but\nLet's go to Paul in Iowa Paul welcome to the couple of who you trash\nIt got traction Mike mccarthy\nWhy because even okay don't let the Montgomery fiasco you forget that Mike mccarthy haven't bombed to yard line and he runs right issue when Donald for safety an eight point swing horrible white collar\nYeah you know one way they ran that play on your iPod there's definitely remember he gave up to play called a couple of years ago because it was so bad and they took it back but I'm\nA ... is not no he's not late allies in air Rogers the way he's you know he he's definitely\nNot a great play caller I agree ... Antwon in Nebraska you on the odd couple Fox Sports radio who you trashing\nMan I'm trust and everybody to go do this comparison LeBron James when Michael Jordan\nAnd all you got to explain\nThe the thing is man or you you can't compare great from two different areas because of their upbringing you know you have this thing called a sports medicine and everything else that was going to be that's available to ah to use the data wasn't available Thirty years ago Twenty years ago whatever\nThe thing is people forget that or they want to quickly bring up a bond James was this huge physicals and then the superhero whatever else\nThey could get that ... Michael Jordan was something that was amazing to see when we saw him live like we can look it highlights and everything else every day but when Jordan was out we compare him to other superheroes now all of a sudden we have the bond James and we're trying to downplay its physical ability\nBut don't you think it's fun and interesting to compare what's what's going on there was this\nOh no no it's definitely fun humid but the thing is to try to make it seem like just the fact that LeBron James is obviously this go individual you want to look at the the uh I had a tiger type thing or whatever that Michael Jordan plays with in the bond that whatever the thing is is Jordan had the same upbringing that\nThese youth and ... or ... on his come up or whatever else who who who\nWhat a player he would've been a while I was pretty good as it was like\nA lot I just ...
