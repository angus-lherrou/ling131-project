right to it we we were just talking about your quarterback John Elway\nAnd why he hasn't been able to select the quarterback now you got case Cain um he's obviously I asked why learn Lynch and failed and those guys what do you think you know sometimes the great ones\nHave trouble picking we see Michael Jordan in Charlotte having trouble like that so what do you think it is wide Elway hasn't been able to find his quarterback\n[noise] man you know a lot of have to do with I mean just think if he's elected in two thousand level yeah the second pick of Israel the perfect ... a drought with Keanu\nHe gives von Miller not you're not disappointed but that's not a quarterback you wore that guy\nIs not that easy I mean you know you think about Miami they've been trying to find Dan Marino replacement fifty retarded without even trying to find Jim Kelly\nIs not as easy as you think um some teams get look you go to Steve you go from Joe Montana the Steve Young oh you go from ... off the air Roger ... of the most part if you happy franchise great quarterback\nYou out ... years before you find the election and so what John has been successful that may be selected you know a bomb or he dropped ... junior\nMan if some people you know how we think about how many coaches in GM lost their job you look at Cleveland I went to Jim head coaches they've had trying to find that one guy yeah I'm Out here it's not easy\nNo doubt about it and you were in St people think when you're right it's easier when you are no no no no no no no that makes it harder because you think everything because everything came so easy to you you know well why can't you do that he should be able to do that and it's not letting\nI Know no doubt about speaking of not being that easy\nA as duck Prescott\nI I Know they beat the line this past week we had a big role late in the game but the offense is really struggled and he struggled at it as you've been exposed as he as good as he was you won or is he on a ... or somewhere in the middle between you want and where he is now 'cause he looks bad to me telling me\nThe wrong everybody automatically be what looked like a great place he's only going to get better well maybe he might that maybe the greatest that you weren't going to see\nA people automatically will soon have you ... automatically assume that if you play rate your one you're only going to be able to him that the tar already we've seen with Tom Brady we saw in your one year to year three she got better\nUh and when you go what he went what twenty three and four twenty on three twenty on for as far as that might I ask a local law I just think the GOP would try to make him something he wasn't ready to be ... this is a running ... ... ...\nWhen we were the ball will you be forced to drop the apes got down in the box to stop the run and now teams can't get exotic and the coverage\nKnows he's going to be taught you single athlete but when you can't run the football than if it's OK weren't going to make you beat us that Chris Scott and we can get exotic he struggles\nJust plain and simple to say that he won't get better if you have progressed he's just not there yet\nIs the cup of Chris Broussard Rob Parker joined by our guest Shannon sharp and Shannon unless the law into another quarterback Patrick my homes I mean obviously he's been lights out you can't help but love what you've seen so far you compared him I think you're saying he reminds you of Aaron Rodgers\nToday on undisputed Robin I've been saying we love when we see\nBut we just need to slow down because you know are the three ... Prescott comic happening we seen a lot of guys start out well for games is just a small sample size but are you convinced he's the real deal he's gonna be a great one\nThing is that when you when we are trying to project I Try to look at OK soldiers of coats general manager on solid ground yes okay what do they what do they have around him you look at tower review semi walking\nCream hug traffic kills me for the next three to four years\nGroup was going to be together so he should get better if you look at the things he can do you almost forced to like treat him like Aaron Rodgers and force him to throw the ball from the pocket because when he gets up to\nShe's not looking too raw although he can run they ain't got to let you know you have better speed than people give them credit for the roles that he can make the accuracy that he displayed on the move here very Aaron Rodgers is\nWhat makes Aaron so good and what what separates him from the quarterback is that the pinpoint accuracy that he had that whole quarterback lead the pro level platform which is in the park she can make those are all on the move rolling left and right I agree with you that you\nWe neither a larger sample size we need to see more but as far as you look at what what he's surrounded by and that's what young quarterback young quarterback that we like what we see\nOne of these around about look at your gall\nGo get him a brand new go they got a a word that got caught they ... they got the weapons or what kind of cars and when they say around ... weapons well if you want to go if you want to be that guy shut and you give him something through throat you\nNo doubt no doubt and we know what they go they took away two receivers from\nYeah well I don't have a problem with them moving on with their their clearly ... with the receiver that he was in two thousand or two and he thinks he can do this before leaving day if the apology holding them fail but if you're going to replace somebody\nYou should at least bring someone in a replacement I don't think they replay it I still think there would be the best receiver on that left\n... dead although long ... which do you think dads his career is over there nobody speaking him up\nYou know the thing you're there there are a ... dance harder than Dallas\nAnd I think people are starting to see that he really wants to play for dolphins doesn't really want to play but I don't know if you have an answer 'cause he keeps saying when right when I'm right I think what he means by writing the mentally because they shut the is when you get released taken from a guy that has been really you have to you because you're like okay\nNow for me I was in Baltimore I got really making the or at least all tied into receiving\nAnd I got really and I'm like hey what ... what am I missing right now you have to recalibrate yourself and says okay\nI'm not the guy that maybe I'm maybe I'm not the guy that I was more let me get back to the

and\nThose two I'm happy to see ... some of\nIs I think like a lot of like ... the business actually ...\nRadio for more Peter Gabriel in all your favorite part is\nWorking for me that there were times we support all your tank on time by the fact that was awful\nYard and left handed with doing that it not that way and doing the same thing I'm going to learn how to it\nAnd\nThat's what happened I mean that's all I can say that it just by saying okay we're going to get better you get better by actually learning skills\nWell let me let me jumping on one guy Chris Davis who somehow some way hit the same average four years in a row which I don't think I've ever heard and baseball to seven and Chris four years in a row which is crazy I I don't think there's any other baseball card like that\nBut he had forty eight home runs this year and\nHe's a master I mean a hundred and twenty DRP eyes he had an unbelievable year forty eight\nAnd ... and you said it unique in itself I I've never heard that I've never seen that average never thought it could happen but he hit the same average but you still get forty six forty eight almost fifty home runs a year and that's what's incredible\nAnd and I asked them earlier I said what are you trying to do with the plate and he said man I'm just trying to get my foot down and let it slide man and it ... and it looks like that at\nTimes because he's the only one I've ever seen step in the bucket you know at at front side flying out and drive the bottle right seal and it goes out the art Rob Chris\nThat doesn't happen no riot right that does not happen\nAnd and then when you see it and you start to go because we said it for three years now and the first time I saw it I went well that's different as to who who does that reminds you you've got to really go back to think and he said OK managed to do that\nThat it can drive it that way and he's saying we're willing to do that to\nReally step in the bucket and when he was planning a San Francisco a candlestick still drive all the yard or right see the light talking about one of the greatest player if not the greatest player ever that I had to compare him to say wow that is unique well that that they don't do\n... ... they um\n... this is a team is miss the playoffs the last three years nobody expected them to do what they did this season particularly in the second half\nHow do you see they're going to handle the moment when they step into the Bronx and yet he's obviously you're you know there used to this ... yeah do you think the moment you know we'll beach could be too big for them or what tells you that will be able to handle it well\nYou know a lot of those guys haven't been to the playoffs in it it's different it's just really different it took

Shaw their reliance on him has not\nWon them a World Series there's been met look when the ... six times ... times and they've been to one world series and Clayton cursed Shaw has not been awful in the playoffs he's not been awful he has been like Peyton Manning and the playoffs where there's excellence in the regular season aged he's kind of a\nNot a hit and miss pitcher but he'll give you a great game like he has before but also give you some stinkers in big situations in which he'll give up for runs in the seventh inning to the cardinals and the Dodgers wind up losing that playoff series but says the cardinals aren't here that it should change right they need to be able to move away from him\nAnd focus on\nOther players and bettering the team in fact\nThis is at the point where you got to think if you're ... Shaw\nDo you opt out at the end of this year 'cause you're in for two more years but he's got an opt out after this year\nAnd I don't know how this is going to play because certainly Kurdish was gonna say the right things it's the playoffs but how is he gonna feel dude I'm the best pitcher in baseball and you're not pitching me in game one they could both be arrested for game five\nThe way the series goes if it comes down to a game five both ... and ... could pitch at home on three days rest um I'm Sorry on regular rest so there's that option out that he could also start you in game five if he can't doesn't pitch will ... could come in but now you are relegating curse shorter game to status and\nNot only from the fact that they need to look to move on from him and I don't know if this is the first thing of the Dodgers saying hey\nWe need to create an identity that is not reliant on Clinton ... because we've we've done it for six years now seven years now and it's not worked out for us in the playoffs regular season has been great and Kirsch has been great but it is relying on them in the playoffs has not worked out for us so here's our first step toward\nThe flip side of it is win or lose game one while you're coming back with Kurdish on game too\nYou know if he loses gave one it's oh man what do you well you got crochet on game too is crucial loses gave one it's oh man the mental hurdle that the Braves get over going oh my goodness we ... we're we're going downhill now in this series now we've got to be real and that's it\nThis is a very big deal and it's about ... Shaw being bypassed\nAnd this is where the Dodgers should go not quite pushed Clinton courage shot out the door but kind of say hey you know it could be sunnier out there for you thirty three million dollars for Clinton curse Shaw is a guy who was that a lot of back injuries over the course of his career the Dodgers hold their breath when he goes out there to pitch\nThis is the first move of that and it's in the playoffs and I love this move\nNow I like the move for for review and having her shy as the game to just from the the straight\nYou've got a guy who's been dominant in home all season long pitching well it coming into the playoffs right body right the old ride the hot and we did it in football talking about Ryan Fitzpatrick\nIn Chile turned into a pumpkin you had to run with him and they did until they threw up all over themselves in Chicago and now James Winston back again after thereby and weeks six likewise you you got a guy that has pitch lights out you give him the ball game one\nIncluding her shots professional enough to know what the deal is here and\nTo the to the thirty three million dollar argument it's not like the Dodgers don't have money\nLike those brink trucks backed up at every\nAnd every time on it right and and re I beat it doesn't matter but at every exit of Dodger Stadium\nIs a range trucks full of cash okay then it's not prohibiting them from spending money at any point to build that there's other teams were that's the case spending thirty three million dollars on one pitch or prohibits them from doing anything else we've seen that all across\nMay not say ... painting for the Guggenheim stinks I mean that's that's one thing good about it that I live about a fifth of a pay it and some of them make depending on what\nYou got floating around I mean you know you go back to some of the the scream and things like that so it's like join a million dollars but we'll get into that at the time but you have an opportunity here and you have Walker Mueller as well\nLike putting her show he sees where things are headed doesn't mean he's going to accept less money to stick around notice I mean the Dodgers have to spend less money if we built a team\nAnd while he failed in the seventh inning of games in the bullpen is let him down more times than the number of years you and I have been alive but the fact of the matter is you get Roberts is operating from a very luxurious position here he'll take some heat if it it blows up but\nThe metrics and the math and the they feel and momentum that you look for in baseball because they always talk about getting out of run and having your momentum rolling into the playoffs ... everything points to this being the absolute right move for the Dodgers\nAnd and it it really is pretty simple it's a gutsy move for Roberts 'cause he lives in ... elite himself open the second guessing if it doesn't work out and I understand that part of it but\nReally for Roberts ago we've done it for the last six years I mean we need to do something different we've done it this way and look what happened it didn't work out for us we have a luxury now of a couple of really good pictures especially at home dealer now his confidence is sky high or this is the right move and I'm telling you what\nStart thinking about a Dodger future without Clinton cursed Shaw it ain't going to be that bad\nTwitter out how about a fresco might get swollen DOMA Jason Smith show where my\nFriend my column in live from the guy goes studios coming up next you got more on the craziness with the Dodgers and the Braves and this real over ...

Ryan Fitzpatrick from this point forward he played one bad\nIn three and a half\nGames you bench him you bring in Jay miss Winston who does that play well you've got to buy week\nWhy would you do this [noise] this seems like a situation that has been thoroughly mishandled in the space of sixty three minutes the box have gone from undefeated Annan off into juggernaut the likes of which we have not seen ever before and the history of the NFL\nTo a team that is going in handing the reigns back to James went and now I think this is not a decision that's being made for football reasons\nI think this is a financial decision\nThe boxer trying to figure out whether they can justify paying James Winston twenty million dollars a year and picking up his fifth year option\nThey picked up the option\nBut it's only guaranteed ... Jamison Winston is injured and not able to go elsewhere so I don't understand this decision at all maybe the idea is hey we're going to play the falcons in two weeks and the falcons are really bad and so every quarterback looks good against them\nBecause you can put up so many yards passing like we just saw Andy Dalton do like we just saw\nDrew Brees do and maybe the idea is oh we're going to hand the range of active Jamieson he's going to throw three or four touchdown passes and he's going to save us but on the road against Atlanta's seems like a really strange decision\nTo hand the reigns back to James is particularly when the reason he's been suspended because of sexual assault\nI don't want a lot of money in Vegas I bet on that one out of that ad on the Chris Davis it's two forty seven I Wonder what whatever you want to do that for next year I went to and and then I Would say you know what I Want to double down all the money all the millions I just one\nLittle down hitting to forty seven next year or two oh yeah sure it will take that bet yeah all that ... millions I Want I Want a triple doubt on next year and two forty I like the way you're thinking let's go\nTwitter at how about a ...\nMike had swollen down the Jason Smith show is my comment I'll tell you what nothing like strategy when you get to the baseball playoffs\nInsane right now Colorado and Chicago things are getting interested in Wrigley Field of an update on this as well as my parole era stopping by to talk all the latest news and the national football league whether it's overturning first downs or the roughing the pastoral but still continues to confound but\nFor an update on regularly let's say a dead Carson five what's trending Deasy\nHad low ranking hanging on to that one nothing lead over the cut his hair in the bottom of the Senate Chicago though with two on two outs\nSo this could be interesting as you said Jon Lester was lifted for the kind of sat through six innings strike at nine by the way starting pitchers were announced for Wednesday's American League wildcard damn Yankees will start Louis Severino the angel Leon Hendricks on the hill the game is in the Bronx first pitch in eastern\nAnd the Dodgers about an hour ago announced that hundred ... will get the star for an LDS game on Thursday against ... brains\nDodgers ace Clayton courage shower and get them all for Friday nights game to the twins ever leave pall mall at our and his managerial duties he's expected to remain with the climate another capacity but just last year he was he a manager of the year\nAfter leading the twins to the wild card game against the Yankees online car shopping can be confusing but not anymore with troop rise from true Cohn now you know the exact price you pay for your next kinds of is it true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience\nAnd especially for our resident J.

I like\nThat is one of those things where we don't give you the real answer you have to pick the answering your head you know one of those movies that doesn't tell you how the ends you pick the ending you liked the most that's how it goes uh I'll pick\nThat novelty let's move on\nI well speaking of picking the ending I like the most out of the one I liked the least you got to take us through this my two big things coming off the weekend in the NFL we're still trying to figure out\nThe browse look like they have the game against the raiders salted away they have a first down run by Carlos Hyde it's ruled a first down on the field but the officials go back and look at it and they rule that his elbow came down before\nHe got to the ... the line for the first down the browns have the pun of course we know they go to overtime and the raiders when what did you make of how that whole turned out\nWell I'll tell you when I saw it happen I it was pretty disappointing um because I just didn't see anything that would allow them to move the ball from where it was originally spot it\nAnd then you know I literally slept prompted on Sunday night and then I looked at it on Monday morning and I looked at the lives you know if you look at that and that's what they based their decision I don't know if you look it up well you know maybe short and uh\nSo I looked at further with the boy and the you know who commented after you know as what happened is that you couldn't believe that they fall\nAnd he's absolutely right um you know you look at it you have to get through the night there in the middle of a field with no deal marking no follow climb the yellow line is accurate um and and we know that it's not used\nAnd if you look at it like that there's really no way you can move the ball um\nI get it they pieced together they saw that when my hand was down the elbow was down in the same time and you look at it especially in relation to what the Mac or a yellow line show that you could say could be short but if you eliminate the yellow line and looked at the Nineteen the hash mark\nYou just couldn't change and um you know it's we're getting concerned because in the first two weeks of the season the rate of reversals was very low which meant they were staying with the calls on the field unless it was clear and obvious and in the last two weeks\nIt's all the way back to what it was at the conclusion of last season which means\nThere may be starting to get a little technical and then going through a street and I feel bad for the brownies 'cause I was there when they won their game and may feel because ... ... um they really got the short end of the stick or the short end of the down marker I guess on I'm On this one\nAlso in that game we had the ... the play where he basically did an old school WWE clap alongside Baker may feel but didn't drive him to the ground gets called for while the the roughing penalty or we only have five of those this week do bike so elites had a downturn in the calls but that one's\nLit up the Internet as we were confused once again as to what exactly are we trying to accomplish here\nWell I mean they actually what they called was for helmet contact with their helmet conquer I certainly didn't see it that way but Troy Vincent\nUm did come out today and say that he was okay with a call because there was helmet contact um we weren't we just didn't you know in this day and age after this conference call that the committee had with the legal as we\nFelt that was given to set a standard that was not going to have us where we were for the first three weeks\nSeason and I think it turned out to be true\nAt least in the ... guards with Randy and on top of the quarterback with most or all of your body weight because there was only one of those call and I agree with that because it was CJ better to San Francisco who got driven into the ground and the defender made\nNo attempt to braces all or to break the ball which is now a new interpretation and that is there no attempt to get to the side so I I was I I I was encouraged by that but ... ... lead in the in the number of\nRobbing the pastor's call then to me\nTo me Troy can defend that if you want to maybe there are slight contract but if that's rough I never even played quarterback and I wouldn't mind doing it now\nI I feel\nPretty damn saved if I could take my glass of wine out there if I wanted to and joy and joy my glass\nOf wine and feel very protected while I'm throwing the ball so I just think that was um that was too technical recall\nThat certainly would make the ratings for the NFL games increase even more if you were out there that lasted only because my you know the thing that gets me the most is that and this surprises me pleasantly is that\nBy this point I expected defensive players their heads the pop off getting call for these penalties but they you know even like clean Matthew he's upset in the moment Andy\nGathered himself and goes back and yes the defensive players are very upset but when these flags are thrown they they really just know when to just back back away and say okay we got to move on when by every right they should say I don't understand what I did wrong you have to help me out a little bit here\nYeah and I and I think two things happen when you get to let's let's go back when you get to this is an issue in contact with the helmet which isn't the first two weeks was a disaster fifty one more call\nAnd then something laying got caught and said hey if it was in a burden or unintentional it's not to be a foul and what happened the fifty one in the first two weeks of pre season I'm only twenty and the second two weeks\nOnly been three I think that have been called in the entire first or weeks of the season so it leveled off because of this show adjusted\nAnd so the players and and I think that's where we're headed now with the ... in the past ... thing you you watch and you can see and we showed a video I'm In our last call show that we had a Fox digital\nYou couldn't see players now making a concerted effort to get to the side of the quarterback when they come up the middle and wrap him or when you're going to the ground racing yourself on the ground so I think it's made a different goal difference both ways and", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day":
