the ... and the ... and then you drastic one Barclay and then you address the old line in the offseason you'd assume that the old line and the running backs and the receivers and the quarterbacks in

and I'm Serious about this the giants did what all of us have done\nEvery single year every time we've tried to predict the NFL breeding I made our season predictions we go division by division and every year somebody screws up somebody picks a team to finish is dead last every year we all do this media us fans everybody does this\nI think the giants misread their own team\nI Swear to God I think the giants went into this season thinking they were better than they actually were\nBecause now you got a potential fire sale going on you I apples gone demon stacks Harrison is gone or Kyle letter is being shown on the sidelines as a guy who potentially could be the quarterback of the future but Kyle letter was later round draft pick and he hasn't even suited up for a game this year\nI think the giants thought they were going to be better than they were\nIf this was all about building towards the future why did you take a running back and number two you had the quarterback of the future sitting there I think the giants took the running back because they didn't realize how bad off they were with Eli Manning\nAnd so they took the running back because they thought they were in when now mode only to find out when now we might not win again they completely overvalued\nTheir own team their own roster and that's why the giants are in this state that they are Jonah socks Fox

I I Do want to mention this though because we were talking about this earlier\nWhen I was making a point in the NFL so you saw the Tampa Bay buccaneers loose on the road to the bangles Cincinnati was dominating the game\nA James Winston was atrocious see through for interceptions he was benched Ryan Fitzpatrick came and he was Lebanon Fifteen through a couple of touchdowns no interceptions a drop him down the field got him back into the game actually tied it late with a to point conversion\nAnd then they went down and Randy bullet kicked the game winner eventually forced Cincinnati but the store you are coming out of this game\nI reached out to somebody that is close to the organization I said hey\nI I'm On the outside and maybe I've read this all wrong but I said\nJust looking at it from the outside it just appears at that team enjoys playing with Ryan Fitzpatrick more they seem to rally around Ryan Fitzpatrick am I wrong he said you're not wrong you're a hundred percent correct and this is somebody that is really really close to the organization\nAnd so I tried to poke around okay what's the future what's gonna happen or the uk who they go on with moving forward\nAnd he said you know it's too soon to tell\nHere's what I'll say we do have an example of this in recent years and the example took place back in twenty Thirteen with the Chicago Bears in twenty Thirteen Jay Cutler\nWas looking at a long term contract extension but Jay Cutler ended up getting injured and he was out of the line up for the bears\nAnd so they went with a veteran backup a guy who kind of knew the system a little bit and Josh McCown\nJosh McKenna was brilliant he was fantastic just like Ryan Fitzpatrick and the bears made their choice the second color got healthy they put Cutler back into the line up\nAnd the bears were not the same offensively and ended up missing the playoffs afterwards and if you talk to players on that team or people that covered the team at that time but they'll tell you the biggest mistake they made was going back to Jay Cutler after he got healthy because they were not the same team offensively that they were\nWhen they had Josh accounting and so the bears doubled down on that and they gave Cutler the big time contract extension afterwards and the rest of us history if you're the Tampa Bay buccaneers you've got to figure out who your riding with year\nBecause I don't see how\nYour cutter and James Winston coincided moving forward you either need to determine if James wants singer guy or dirt cutters your guy or neither you guy you keep Brian Fitzpatrick around you find it offensive minded head coach and you develop a young quarterback like other teams have done around the year around the league\nBecause at this rate it is not working and when I can see it and you can see it watching box game that it is not right there that there's something off that that the backup quarterback it's a better reaction and the huddle than the starter does the potential franchise quarterback something's not right\nIt's a bad situation edit it'd be one to watch moving forward right Jonah socks Fox Sports radio\nUh we're company live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios get me on Twitter at the Jonah stocks coming up next\nA there was a team that made a decision on a quarter back a few years ago and they got crushed for it and they got crushed by their own team for it but they actually got it right I'll tell you who it is next year officer\n[laughter] up and running\nWhen the game's going wind farm\nPond water sports radio dot com or Twitter has box boards radio Facebook Don ... sports radio Donny social media because we are about sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that a war basketball is bound to the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during a game\nWell here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nThrough ... also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their certify dealer network nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simple or buying experience when you buy new or use\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with drew car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car\nCheck out through car and enjoy more confident car buying experience some features not available at all states\nIf you suffer from E.

not you've been to a couple of different spots an FCC territory\nUm Death Valley is a unique one well with all that being said el issue is a fourteen and a half point under dog at home in a primetime ballgame yeah as it was announced by Caesar's Palace Crimson Tide for ... fourteen nap when favorites\nIs the first time the LSU has been at this big of a home underdog since Nineteen Ninety nine when they're an underdog again the old football coach the spring when he was the coach of Florida back in October night the Nineteen Ninety look\nAnd I know it it's [noise] and I think we've got the tea because it's Alabama so people are dealing with a little Alabama fatigue but\nThey are that good I as as um as has two or a Taco Bell a as he played in the fourth quarter you know we're not just some
