I mean Blau David lousy thrown two hundred and thirty passes the allies you send a lot of the backup\nHas thrown it up a forty five times so that's\nRoughly two hundred and Seventy five pastors thrown Stanley's showing for two forty five so these are two teams would like to throw the football\nThe makers have a a veteran a front a four of the five starters returned to the offensive line from a year ago this year led by senator Kirk Barron he's been around a lot of years a fifth year senior from Mishawaka\nIndiana they all go six four to six foot seven six two to six seven three hundred pounds across the front line uh everybody's over three hundred but left tackle grant Herman's who is\nTwo Ninety and he found his way to West Lafayette from Albuquerque which I Know that has to be an interesting story so it's a veteran Purdue team on offense defensively they they play for three but\nThey really fly to the football\nOr they do a lot of run ... historically a regardless who the coordinator is that's with Perdue does or they try to stop the run first and foremost like most defenses do but they're always in motion coming at you\nAnd so the hawks are working overtime this week on a game plan to knock off the red hot up until last week anyway Purdue defense was Pashtun seconds right now for station identification station id time here as we agree to from Carlos ... talk with her parents while I was ten seconds you're listening to talk\nYou know guys throwing a ball you're you're releasing the ball on your hand comes through and\nI'm seeing more than you care to wear a guy's animal in a helmet and a lot of times it's just things kind of like native Saturday but sometimes it can be worse than those guys you know um get substantial injuries that way so it's just one of those perils of playing football unfortunately and\nFortunately we're not talking about that kind of case right now\nSo any kind of if you got to start wearing stuff on your hand that's not good if you're throwing the ball so there you have it right\nFrom the horse's mouth looked for Nate Stanley to be on the line up\nOn Saturday and throwing the ball a uh well uh that said he he was inconsistent on Saturday I think that's being honest to a intern especially in terms of accuracy and uh we talked about it on the post game show and and and rightly so a Penn State has a very aggressive defense and obviously we're getting in his throwing lanes and\nUh I Know he he he stood up to the TJ Hawkins and mess on the on the fourth down which nobody's perfect but on balance what what else did the tapes show you this week\nWell first of all I mean Penn State played all the ... to ... athletes on defense they did not play the ... well but the week before and everybody was watching that on TV and it was a televised game\nA could attest to that um you know it's funny how sports are but to Indiana was rendered surely I'm you know an effective against us when we play with them and then\nWe two weeks later they're they're playing against the Penn State team that's very very athletic and talented and\nYou know they move the ball five hundred plus yard so yeah that is only about college football you're just you're every week the different adventure but the the one thing we knew about Penn State was their athletic talent and\nThey do Russia passer ... especially when they got the lead a especially with a crowd noise that's another factor in the nose rush so you know they made a top that way and a good defense and and you know we couldn't match it so unfortunately we came up on the short end but\nUm you know I talked to more of Monday morning talk them weekly the kind of pick his brain and he shared a story I used in the press conference yesterday\nOr is that Chuck normal after a ... game one time talked about Nolan Ryan he says you know no one line stands on them out\nA the the rubber as always equal distance from the place that never changes oh he's got as much time do you want some between pitches and he puts his a ball that's perfectly round and symmetrical football's just the opposite red ...\nA quarter basket hit in the face 'cause it and the throat\nAh they don't have a lot of time and you know so drawing from all kinds of such a goal was saying you know so let me explain you know going on for a million or one time and get to make it out of the first thing that I might explain why wouldn't you think are quarterback might have a tough game or two\nAnd a ... it was a pretty good ... and early ... no but I didn't know that store is pretty good you probably haven't heard the last of the great stories from Tom more either up that's all keep calm during a wealth of wisdom\nGreat orator indeed All right well let's go get settled in here and sip on his coffee for a couple of minutes and talk to the fans as we take a break here on TALK talk with coach parents were Carlos ...

Kelly's twentieth anniversary of ... please come tomorrow if you can't make it into a fight every Thursday as three dollar jumble margarita night\nAt all or uh Iowa Carlos so Kelly's but certainly here at turtles so Kelly's in Iowa City let's take a phone call jury and walk he is checking in with a coach parents jury good evening\nIt well are we going\nTo try to yeah with the Rockies are really a called a young man I was an outstanding wrestler as well as a you know a good football player and\nUh yeah we we chose to try to recruit him and he chose Michigan State so um you know that that's the way that goes to get every every guy on state that we offer it doesn't always work that way but\nAh to your point he played a really good game obviously we saw that film and made some really nice throws and um you know the Michigan State overall just played a really good dog or the real good game on Saturday\nWhat was the key defensively for the sports I mean blow it had like three consecutive three hundred yards passing games to run do cut a lot of balls but they were short throws you know they hope he could break and then a a really shut down the running game but I you know Michigan State has historically solid the vegetable\nThere really are really I'd say since two thousand one Marco then Tony I got there that that's the one thing they've really built their program on and consistently they've been really good at doing that regardless of\nUh what else was going on and that's that's for the most part maybe a blip or two in the radar but yeah they're they're just a very tough aggressive team on defense and uh they make ... make up on everybody basically in a you know even the Michigan tape of a you know you if you've watched that game that was a\nThat the scores very misleading there's just a really good defensive teams so you got to give them credit and they made a tough on Purdue I think the you know the big challenge of Perdue and uh that's true of any good offensive football team Marilyn was a different type of team but um you know minimize and those big place and you know they've got some guys that really has some\nA big play ability whether you want to talk about the running back who's really emerged as a really good player or the freshman a sensation of receiver and he's also returned guy so but they have other guys too that are very gifted merged guilt and on top of that they're very innovative with their attacks so they get the ball to a lot of different\nGuys but you know they've got some guys you better you better try to contain them or else they're gonna you know all of a sudden they're they're running wild run loose on you\nAnd if you're trying to contain them and doing a good job of it they got a pair a couple a couple of tied in to our big and strong physical and can catch the football and produce historically use those titans\nAnd they do a good job of that and ah you know it's kind of find just was going through today the state law says a couple of times two times in the third second quarter excuse me and uh then they they had a little drag widely thing where they uh brought the guy across the grand and\nA quota would then give them to score but he got down to inside the one yard line so you have if your focus totally on the receivers which is a good cook plant a you know they're going to find those items to and you know you've got to count for but it's out there and all double\nThinks the west bank your banking done in a few quick time to get more done\nMike wink outstretched going to go to the gym or

head football coach ... her parents are very often were killed eight o'clock tonight we're taking your tweets your Facebook posts we're taking questions from the audience here if\nYou have a question you'd like to jot down on a piece of paper or a napkin bring it up well up has Kirk about it and we're also taking your phone calls a day seven seven four six four to nine five seven a trucker Jim as a mowing his way along the interstate on hold for a while how Jim\nHello yes Jim hello on yeah go ahead Jim\nAnyway I just want what you guys are happy all the weight and first of all a little trivia you know as I understand that\nUm what ... really needs is a fully evening which is the eating meat for all states day which is a Catholic holy days so I thought it you'll end up a little trivia but I Do have a question\nA critic question actually and a coach\nOr you know there's lots of football players out there this country and beyond the players probably and obviously is it possible to evaluate oh man I'm I'm just kind of wondering what process this guy used to first of all\nSort through all the players get down to a manageable number whether it be a few hundred or maybe a thousand or so and then a mere\n... players to eventually I get it down to the point where you're coming for scholarships so it's kind of curious trusted coach and good luck a rest of the season\nYou know it's it's really involved and I probably spend hours on it and then um you know we we can ...\nHire a hundred people to be involved in it which which a couple of schools in the country actually do that uh I guess one of the rising concerns we all have about a collegiate football but uh it it's a very expensive process and in your point a couple of things are there are just a\nAn unbelievable amount of prospects that needs to be evaluated if you tried to do it from a national standpoint it would take an army of people so\nI'm most people um you know kind of localized or centralize their recruiting areas we\nA focus on states pretty much within a you know five six seven are driving radius of of the um University of Iowa City and um you know trying to break it down ... a geographically survey coach has a region he's involved with and then we'll secondary areas to that extent\nInto further reaching you know such as Florida Georgia New Jersey states that don't aren't necessarily considered mid west\nAnd I'm probably one of things that changed the most is just the the accessibility availability of looking at prospects films\nOr when I was here in the eighties you know actually get a get a hold of a\nA VHS tape or a sixteen millimeter tastes really good prospects ... that was a not easy\nAnd you would borrow one and uh you know male Pakistan as you could after you've got the appropriate people looked at it so things have changed so much with all everything being online so you know we have a a million people we can look at it I'm I'm exaggerating a use your term but not much you know there are thousands of paint prospects you can look at but it's not physically possible so\nNow you're just kind of screening um and then just start winning your way down but it's a it's very uh Geographic's a Center for us I think that's kind of the way we do it and if you look at a roster it's a you know you can tell the areas that we really focus on\nAnd then you may get referrals to for people that you trust people you know are there might be some kind of connection that might make sense for a\nFor a prospect from an outline states that might have an interest in the university and we'll follow up on those two and then go from there so you know just an awful lot of variables guys come to camp we evaluated them in camps as like we've I wait I'm On tape and uh you think of player like Raleigh moss for instance who you know we liked him a coming out of camp last year like I'm going into his senior year\n... saw him live last fall\nA on a friday night and then came back and said hey I think this goes a little better than we thought he was a that's a big part of it to just live exposures watch and watch 'em players and their senior years not not all the guys are gonna be really good players are already committed they are a lot of guys out there right now waiting to be found and now we're trying to stay on top of that as well\nAppreciate the call a gym as always a coach we got a tweet from Tyler Trent who lives down near West Lafayette Tyler uh made it to ... last year and participated in the wave and\nUh he's in a life a life battle with cancer terminal cancer but you know terminals a word and he's uh down near Carmel\nAnd he tweeted in and I said I'm happy to announce as long as my health allows my family and I will be a cheering on the auto makers that Ross said stadium but uh I'll also always take time to wave\nTo uh the the kids it's dead family children's hospital at the end of the first quarter and a shuttle organized picture of him and I'm assuming his dad are certainly a relative at the game\nLast year he was featured the evening of the state for new game a great story wonderful young a guy who was in a life and death the struggle with cancer but he took time to tweet us tonight and told her we really appreciate that\nWe do scholar and wish you all the best that I didn't get to see the feature I think Tom and all they did it but I did see some of the coverage and and ah you know what a tremendous story and I'm sure there's a real a bond there between all those kids and uh you know we're just to wish you all the best tower and\nUm you know appreciate you taking time tonight to to join us indeed\nA tighter ... let's say a prayer for tighter on Halloween Night to today you know I'd probably do I don't know two to three radio interviews a week during the season all over the country and I will tell you one of the first things that comes up first before we talk football\nTell us about the wave tell us about him children's hospital of any it is really captured the imagination of the country\nI ah it it's interesting I noticed she has a a my headset often heard wave on wave me and played the between the quarters at Penn State and top of that to them further you know just acknowledging that but\nUh yeah I mean it's it's received international acclaim not only national claim but international claim a kitten Kelso joined us down in Atlanta last December to uh get ESPN award and uh you know that was really great in fact came won't be at the game next a\nNext time we're at home I guess that's next week or western venues corrupt so he'll he'll be here for that ball in his family and uh yeah it's just it's it's just you know it is\nIt's a great thing you know in the best part about it again it's organic a crusty on having that idea and it grown into something that everybody can feel really good about and it's a it knows no bounds\nSo uh we're thinking about tighter let's talk to Tommy in Des Moines Tommy is a bit on old Hi Tommy\n... how can I call a core family or a cat and on three right now\nThey got it back and say why do you go now or is it\nWhere you get caught you know\nThat's that's a good thought I never thought of like a bus or something maybe a buzz buzz in because I'm you know the you know the a replay officials and we'll talk about that but the replay guys can a bus down and they do but I was down to the referee that sets up get stopped there\nWere told they review basically every play at least sort of thing it's revealed bull um so yeah that's that's an interesting concept that'd be different than throwing the flag in the NFL you got to throw the flag the challenger the ruins of it but you know because it is a little bit challenging when the when the ball is down inside the town\nOf ... the officials are typically pretty good about keeping an eye out for you and um you know it's just one of those deals but that's so unique autonomy thanks for the call Tommy let's go to Kevin before we take a break here yeah Kevin good evening\nA yeah a long long long time listener first time caller a really fun to watch you guys this year I'm just really fun to watch you over the years have two quick questions for you and I hope they haven't been covered because I've been out trick or treating with my kids the first one is for November is coming up I Know it's a very important Mont\nCan you reflect back on what you might consider your best November and why was it your best November and the other question is when it comes to trick or treat can be a ... cat guy or your butter finger guy are you a Snickers guy what kind of guy area\nI'll hang up and listen banks\nOr you know I mean cats are pretty good um baby rooster are pretty good that's money right there but\nI you know Snickers I mean it's it's knickers or nothing really I mean there's knickers in the house I I have a hard time ha ha ha ha you know in in America gets a little ones too so you like to share your pop 'em in like a piece of gum or exactly so those are pretty good\nHe's bars I've always been a big ... fan you freeze them or do you have a well I like a piece by blizzard okay that's about it I'm like you I like ice cream anyway but I'm a Snickers guy Milky Way Snickers and then if I go off off track\nIt would be a he's for ourselves like baby Ruth would be a I'd like to Carmel and the baby with that layer over the\nWhat do they call it makes the chewing nugget they used to uh well\n... she likes Milky way's I'm baby Russo I don't know last time I saw when they still make them I'm not I don't eat a lot of candy but at its it's laying around I may if it's a Snickers all either um\nAnd then November's you know I mean November football so important and uh really to me that's when things get defined so you know it's hard to pick ones that um you know I mean we're awfully happy when we got ... two thousand one that was pretty good\nUh one of my favorite seasons personally it was the ... season where we're you know back and forth back and forth and then just kinda\nI had a long enough so critic he played in Fresno and there was a you know full back in the NFL for\nSeem to like Twenty years I mean he was there for a long time but there are those guys are active and get after it and um you know the front in some ways a little bit like what we saw last week you know they get the bigger guys inside more linear guys on the outside that are more a\nPass rush capable type goes those line backers of Twenty one tackles for last year and a ... show they they do a lot of cleaning up once those big old guys with their hands on the ground or get after the officers lie in the back and they have an outstanding safety uh Jacob but to them and she's been all over the field is sure\nHe doesn't as you're like oh they're not twin brothers but his younger brother a kind of like his rise right behind him and he he he's a good player too so\nYeah the tournaments a really good player uh they're both uh Indiana kids and ah there's a very nice job back there it looks like he's kind of leader their decency and Bailey you know so they're going to go to veteran guys that have played a lot and played well and um you know really good players\nHave you could say that about a lot of changes in the big tent a lot of really good players will take a break come back with more from kosher answer as we wind down this week talk talk on Halloween Night from Carlos show Kelly's back after this\nMan there is nothing like home field advantage is just something

years and you have a four year contract\nGot two years between sixty five and Seventy million left\nAnd yeah that will probably become for years one thin ones like that yeah which makes sense for the Dodgers as well because you're not getting about that higher right but you get two more years out of right and I think he wants to stay in and that's a hard place ages though and I don't know we struggled and he's been bad in the postseason\nBut they've also for business one six straight and was tied up\nAnd they packed a place in the you know do all the other stuff and you don't have heart that all all of this thing up you know he I mean it's like when Atlanta have medics\nGreg Maddox and smoke and all those guys in when it and go out and maybe one one right yeah they want one but all

station available on your Google Home smart speaker just say okay good\nPlay eight hundred and ... heart radio [noise]\n\nTalk for a friend being [noise]\nBut ... and ... decided tonight to extend the deadline and I was going to be when he decides if the offset of his contract with two years left on it and said they've agreed to extend the deadline for that decision to friday afternoon\nBut there was never a doubt that Clinton courage show was one of the best if not the best pitcher in major league baseball you said that for the last eight years the only thing that's missing is the world championships so I don't think of being a big fish in a small pond or even a big fish in a big pond is any\nWays on his mind anymore he's done that he's been that to the league for pitching was over the last ten years I think it's just all about\nWhat am I pay me when I'm worth\nAnd as long as uncomfortable and we have a chance to win I'm good I think that's what this latest news shows with Clinton of course I got to think on\nSome degree you know starting the playoffs there was a push to get him salty and there was a different quake Kirsch uh to the media little more terse little more direct in terms of how you operate it you know discussing\nThe matter ... L. A. in the disappointment and I've got to be over it because I got to go do my job\nIt tweaked him I mean there's certainly something to do it and then like everybody goes through it was right when we talk about it and the NFL all the time when the uh receiver admit that he's no longer that he that number one option on a team and a lot of the number one guy's never allow themselves to become a two\nAnd so instead they're out of the game instead of adapting\nProclaim her show I mean you still have one or two seven three ER a nine and five what you're missing time consistently\nSo you've got a plan for that so any would be sued are out there that's part of the calculation and all this and you know I I don't know that he's the guy that is going to be to overly concerned about Walker ... review or whatever that it stuck in a way that's not going to be the only factor that pushes them\nBut going into the playoffs have to think there was something to that because there were there was just a different mannerism it seemed or at least that was the appearance outside of ...\nA different story and I know you guys talked a lot about when you got to start at the divisional series in gave one against uh Atlanta and then it was ... on game to\nThat to me is ... better than ... it's the future of Walker viewer that of being at that number one guy that would be the you know that would be the thing to Trump of him being the number one dealers on the track of being the number one and you know what\nSometimes being the number two guy is okay when then all of a sudden guess what your number one again and I brought up just ... role with the Houston Astros when he was acquired last year\nIt's not that we're lander wasn't good just wasn't the the Vert lander that I think we remembered and you're like oh they got Dallas title he's you know one of the top ... and then when it comes down to brass tacks the playoffs gets what did he go Justin ... and get your guy\nRight with with the playoff metal and playoff experience does anybody that watch Justin Berliner you'd had a couple of years of wow is that that's the guy couldn't\nRemember the Dodgers were kicking the can and whether they wear him\nInstead they went to you darling should obviously well we all know how of that coin flip and ended up but when when you're looking at the couple of years prior to the acquisition by the Astros though and there wasn't the same homeland or the IRA was up none of them imminently more hit a ball\nOr you had all those things that that came in the in fact er plus you're looking at a bloated contract and at least that was the appearance\nThat you get the world series title and it's a final but and the moment like that was a big consideration right he's thirty four years old here's how much is left on the deal et cetera but\nFor Clinton courage shah now you've got the injury thing that is ... anything that teams have to consider\nIs the only concern but the Dodgers with their payroll to be honest can absorb a lot easier than any other ...\nAnd ... that's the that's the other part of it right they print money so you know that the cash consideration to me is by far the lowest of any of it like ... shaken out more Nichols when it all comes\nDown to it or how many alive for the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes to say you Fifteen Percent or

NFL do a little more activity that wouldn't normally use you Adam in golden tae heads to Philly [noise] fun Johns all around [noise]\nThey got good to talk to yeah they're they're my production as there would be four to six\nTrades on Monday I Believe there were five and it was the tuition where if you notice just about every team was receiving a choir is pushing for the playoffs you either they're the rams were trying to get the super bowl is right now they're NFL's best team in ... no or you have a team like you mentioned Mike\nOr for the by and they need to push their number one need going into the guy was helping wide receiver\nProbably some expensive health but they've got that going to take another passing target\nA Golden State it's the most unique pharmacy where I've seen in years he\nHe ... he made he made prefab wind up the slack but after the after the snappy down field for right down far left\nThat's just the way the eagles really saw him and I know talking needles are extremely excited about it [noise] sky they've had a really set their sights on it a while for a while and they got them and they're really glad to have 'em and expect them to help them right away\nDid they're running game last year maybe cover up the deficiencies they had a wide receiver because that seemed to be a theme early on the season\nWas last year there Torrey Smith food not I'm\nNot going to catch a lot of passes though but\nHe was the the threat you had to respect his ability to get down field season because they pass the game for the eagles was severely compressed and I'm Talking to the eagles that's that was kind of what they're thinking was and\nI might have standing was they did a make an offer\nFor a morning Cooper they did for a second round pick their we're not going to a first the cowboys got a first round pick of they they were they all seem to offer one and ironically who to the eagles play when they returned after the by next Sunday night at home against the\nHated Dallas Cowboys the fans cannot stand those Dallas Cowboys but uh the star role invade and uh the cowboys actually play this Monday Night so they've got to primetime games or next two weeks\nNow and I'm One of the rumors coming into the trade deadline and when we watch the way on Monday Night was shown McCoy or perhaps tied back in a return to Philly was there are any he didn't enter was that just pure speculation\nMike what happened was there um I think the the bill's really we're not looking to move from per se unless someone really medicine if we can offer and because of his age and and really the legal issue that he's facing a we're\nStill not even going to happen with that I mean Rogers has been checked out it seems and many\nYeah I'm In the ... that may drag on but the fact that matter is it\nGoing forward here are just talking to people closest situation no one was willing to offer the bills what they want it so I I'd I'd set on my local pockets us we could probably won't be moved and he wasn't but you're right though at running back that's another position where I I Will certainly could use some help no Josh Adams now\nIs the lead back on first or second down he's that power back that they wanted a kind of what Cory climate and look out blind given less ...\nWhat is Green Bay message with Brian ... now not only do they make these trades a prior to the trade the mine also swung to deal with the draft when they gave up their first round or to get another one what is probably a good a good strength to do in Green Bay Packers\nYeah that was really interesting what he did a when you look at the time my company traded ... they were they just basically giving away they want to know about the roster and it just happened that they have the trade deadline or right there on on Tuesday and they they got something in return but it's not very much a seventh round pick\nAnd that just tells you that they based on what happened last week\nUh when when time I didn't do what the coach wanted a and that at some of what happened after the game was not great and the optics were not very good and er the Packers and go to coast made a decision and such elementary is personnel control it was his call and he made a ... ... decision to move on and how Clinton decks\nHe didn't draft him he was there then but he didn't draft him and the fact that matter is uh they were not can extend his contract a and ... this is another thing I find interesting 'cause there there are a lot of teams that are looking for safety's\nBut this is a guy talking to people around the lake that very mixed results never kind of lived up to being a first round pick and ironically\nAt fourteen trapped eagles were going to draft either heat or brand uh cooks or if I remember correctly is what I reported that once it was cooked first in a hot Clinton ... second once those guys went off the board the eagles traded down and then took Marcus Miller\nOn the hotline where this year as an accent and I know insider Adam cap when did you it's been shown with my ... Byron for Jason Smith company if I'm the guy goes studios\nAnd Adam staying in the the NFC North you know it's it's it's modeled right it's every team has its words but the trade of gold ... obviously in a contract year\nFollowing up with just the same thing with with lions fans are going to be frustrated as much as you may say hey get downloading a couple more targets is that enough to just say hey we we haven't thrown up a white flag\nIt's really interesting if you look at that to fish and it's not like the far back early in the early again back of the first place bears on the Vikings were for three one so and the Packers three three and one but again there are there are just a game back the lines are the bears\nI that's the thing was puzzling to me because it was selling with equal said to me uh who it was not that this person was not involved in the trade a terms of making a decision but\nThis person water had the winds one at home after their by against the Seahawks Iraq's came in and stay enrolled him\nHad the lions one they'd be tied for first place so so do you think they're really going to make this move very fascinating I don't know if they would have done it a ... guy made me think about it a little bit I think I think is probably the chance that they wouldn't have because quite frankly they'd be tied for first place\nI didn't even think about the only game back now like they ... it's a to target passing off I too was a three pass a target All right what are they throw to put a Kennedy all day of Margaret Jones Michael Roberts will tell you that I don't know I mean that that's it's very strange\n... a kind of went after a reporter today [laughter] artist posture raised yeah yeah I ...
