Parker would come and you live from the guy told Fox Sports radio studios\nAnd it is easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance was Geico go to guy go dot com or call a hundred nine four seven a U T o v only hard part figuring out which way is easier and Robin this McGregor could be hubbub\nOr something else that people are missing remember to us the before the fight a couple of weeks before the fight they announced the sick with the six fights or eight fights or Rob gee okay a fixed fight and deal with McGregor\nMcGregor has lost three of his last for fights if you include Floyd Mayweather inanimate darn included he's lost two of his last three and you have the and a lot of people thought he lost the rematch when they do\nAnd so what this is the U.S the is really they're they're beholden to Conor McGregor\nAnd if he gets beat down again by could be like and he he you know he's not at the point where he's not relevant anymore\nBecause it's D just lost you know he hadn't lost too much I guess ... was bigger you can justify that that way a void may weather of course was a boxer you can justify that\nBut if he loses again that could be\nThen you wonder how big of a draw he's going to be with people just start looking at his talk as just empty noise Alex our our a D. J. D. J. Alex Tyson who brings you to funky sounds are coming in and out of every break you had an interesting take on this\nYeah my perspective on the sewer kind of seems like it might come to fruition just like the wrong to rouse the effect where she was the hottest thing around everybody was climbing to her but she never really fought anybody that was up to her standard\nShe was always finding down her competition and she finally fought somebody that was above her and she got rocked she got an steadily unsteady she got knocked off her feet and she ultimately lost the fight and also her finding career out of it\nSo my perspective with Conor he's coming so much out of the gate just being flamboyant yelling talking all this up in ... they're quiet I knew from the get go that this wasn't a good fight for him going into it and he got the most within the five regardless of what the cards are\nAnd I could sell for the UFC in general itself he's going to blow over quickly and he should've never came back and forth because after you transcend fighting as he did\nComing back to the situation putting yourself through these rounds again and going into these situations not only hurts you as a platform but it hurts the sport in general because look how the after ... do you think that would have happened with any other fight of course not but he's like packing people's aggression of their personality their religion it it's just about like\nHe's not hungry anymore you know and even though he's\nAs well yeah that's where I'm going to get through his he's lost his hunger and once you lose that he was tiger yeah obese hungry he's finding for something he wants to the glory he's chasing something that's bigger than what McGregor is McGregor has hit the pinnacle of his career he's done absolutely everything he's chasing for\nWhat's the point of coming back and fighting for what you're not fighting for anything other than just for extra money you have all these careers these outlet of revenue so what's the point\nHe made he made a hundred million off the may weather fight which I thought he could have retired after that yeah he's a he's made he's going to make about fifty million off despite what the sponsorship his whiskey is a spot for a company as a sponsor he was involved in the promotions\nSo yeah he doesn't have to fight anymore the one thing I disagree with you on\nIs I don't compare McGregor around around the cause I think I think Ron to rouse the for the most part\nWas became so big and great because she was beating\nFighters who weren't that good like I think that stage of women's ... you know you weren't getting a lot of the great women that were fighting I think\nA macgregor was legit fighter like I think he's a really good fighter\n[noise]\nUh that that sounds ridiculous it's a two thousand dollar bonus if he had the lead at half time [noise]\nUm\n[noise] I got to say no\nThat's not [noise] that can't\nBe right there was a part of me that wants to stay true just because it does sound so ridiculous [noise] but I'm going to say\nBoston [noise] ooh\nWhat he gets bonuses if he has the most sacks on their team the most tackles for last if

one out no outs okay so I was right Noah and he might be about to put this thing\nAnd I I'm a big hit here will blow it open but so it's still early fourth ending up but the Yankees are honest thing pitching is a problem tonight\nWhat do you think Mike Tomlin made his comments about the officials let's let's go to those and hear what he said\nThose look like legitimate cause we got to be better there but some of the other stuff man is a joke we got to get better the national football league managed to leave the costs of people games in jobs we got to get them correct and I'm so I'm just about it to be quite honest with you that's all I'm a stay on it\nIn my time with your high but if you have a check book with them because the other right now the checkbook right you're right about that but he's on the competition committee\nAnd so it'll that that's what we'll be interests I agree with your take that the league you know this is all about money for them and they don't want to have to you know pay up guys in retirement or family it is gross when no doubt it's all about that but at the same time\nYou know you have to keep the essence of the game to what it is I mean if you start turning off fans because\nJust silly calls that are inconsistent you know we don't know when you're getting ... what's going to be a rough in the past there call and what's not uh it's it could hurt the game and that hurts the bottom line just as much as they're paying out these settlements you see the the Red Sox just went up seven\nOh a loud seven nothing in the Bronx Boston\nYeah this is a this is getting interesting but yeah I uh\nI I agree with my time and I think we're seeing too many this is the the rough in the past or has become the catch rule of this year last year it was what's the catch nobody knew where the catch was and now you're seeing all these penalties you know that are really\nAffecting games in my town is absolutely right that you're talking about players getting cut he's talking about coaches getting fired\nYou know you're talking about people losing their livelihoods because of these inconsistent calls that referees and umpires are making and here's the bottom line wrapped they the NFL\nBecause their officiating has been poor for a while all\nThem money they make it is absolutely ridiculous that they don't have fulltime rest nor am I wrong\nNo you're not wrong they I mean can you imagine picturing an NFL referee that we all see on television on Sunday\nYou know working at travelers insurance company or something like that or working at you know a restaurant during the week I mean come on yeah what is\n... and the other problem and I bought it up to the day\nIs sometimes I think the referees and or just behind a step or two behind and they don't see everything there is a lot of bad calls in the NFL and its been as you mentioned has been going on for years this is not new really isn't and even sometimes with the replay they still get it wrong I mean it's amazing\nWith all the technology all this stuff that they got all the vantage points and cameras and they still\nStill get it wrong so it is a one of those things where you look at\nAh the NFL and they do have to do a better job because I think that the the the job that's been done has been a unsatisfactory for the most part and I know you really can't say\nA kids say too much about it if you're in the league and that's why a you know when you speak out against the referees is usually going to cost you some money because they can have all that but I think at some point\nThe league has to look at it and and decide which where they go and hear the they got to get the game better and you don't want the referees to be the story you want it to be about the players\nNo not at all eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven\nNine nine six nine ... back when you think about the officiating and we're also and get into oh they'll back home and

Jason is not a bad coach is certainly not a great coach he's a mediocre coach and the results have been mediocre and\nI think we needed to know about Jason really wasn't over time last night for the new one on forty two about six minutes to go and overtime\nHe's got the best running back in the league and I know he was stopped on third down um but if you still believe in that all kinds of line that mine is Travis Frederick you just go for it you try to win the game right there you'd be aggressive and he punted\nAnd even after the game Jerry said you know I'm a risk taker and we weren't playing as well as them at that point that was a time to really kind of assert yourself and then it goes of course I'm not second guessing\nI guess right right\nYeah but you know I was really a lot of that I read it a transfer from Jason this press conference today and and a lot of the columns in Dallas and the tweets and whatnot you get a really good feel even on the air right now is it good feel\nFor the reaction was and I haven't seen anybody defending ... and ... and it really is hard to defend in overtime game when you're already across the fifty and\nThat ... there and you gotta figure if they stopped them wants to not going to stop 'em again\nAnd it it just is you know really emblematic of of his tenure as the head coach there just is eight and ... he's an eight and a coach and um [noise]\nI I won't say there's a mandate\nFor um Jason's make the playoffs this year especially because Jerry's income and your wide receivers but um I I just think the fans are getting really restless but like I said to beginning Jerry's just really comfortable\nWith Jason who allowed I mean I've never heard of an owner on Monday Mornings that sits in the staff meeting with the with assistant coaches and Jerry's there every Monday in seasons there as well\nAnd it's just really unusual\nAnd I'm just not allowed to head coaches that are going to allow that and I think Jason's ability to hold onto his job\nTo a large degree is because he lets Jerry kind of do what he wants\nGary does does Jerry really realize how how things have not gone well since he basically took over as GM\n... on a shelf in bottle washer and everything else and he's in control of everything I mean I just can't get over all the cowboys are hardly America's Team more like south America's Team because they are always under five hundred but I don't I don't get it does he does he even realize how bad it's been since a\nJimmy Johnson and all those guys left I mean it's been a long time\nWell I I I think it does eat away at I'm Rob that um he's very competitive it does want to win he he's he's his priorities and I'm not sure what order they are besides his family which is everybody's first priority his two parties are making money and winning football game and\nI'm pretty sure if you took a poll of the fans in Dallas to think that makes the money is number one on the list [noise] he he says it it really bothers him and it's hard for him to to understand or to even\nComprehend\nHow it's been over Twenty years since his team was in the super bowl and his biggest regret is he feels he wasted the Romo years and he did because Tony was for a long time a top five quarterback and they never got past the division around to the playoffs and\nA lot of it has to do with the fact that Jerry considers himself or football man he considers himself the general manager of the team even if you felt that way when Jimmy was there even though we know Jimmy was making the personnel moves so when Jimmy leaves\nYou figure okay this is my toy and I finally got a chance to play with it but\nAfter the long ... and one of the chapters in my book is about Jerry Jones' comment general Mac and
