it's good that\nBut he is in the Nineteen forties and saying we can't say the words no hitter and we can't say they have the lead because then we'll jinx it with or you know listening to us\nI Will go one further that Dodger fans above all fans should not be followers of that Jake's because longtime Dodger announcer Vin Scully is the guy that used to say the words no hitter while he was calling a no hitter and he called more no hitters than anybody in history\nNow ... that's one of the reasons we love 'em ... or ... or so and I said the Dodgers broadcasters\nWho don't cower in fear them angry mob and it will say it's the semi angry mob this is the mob that tweets negative things about you you know they don't actually do crazy right over it they throw it see fit and you got these broadcasters that pandered to oh I'm not going to say Steve this eggers not one of those men and I love\nThe identity is wild Vin Scully was on the air in recent years the angels TV announcer purposely would not tell the audience\nThere with no hitter being pitched because he thought it would jinx it I'm not kidding you\nTalk about minor leagues Dodgers leading five one at Milwaukee in the bottom of the seventh game seven of the NFL cs is on a fast one right now rookie Walker viewer pitched into the fifth inning as the Dodgers starter\nJulie's just seen was taken out after two weddings as Milwaukee starter Christian yell at you hit a solo home or in the first nearly had the timing RBI and the fifth inning instead LA left fielder Chris Taylor with a sliding catch on the warning track to end the ending\nPreserve the lead and then on top of the six ... with a three run Homer Chris Taylor's defense by the way he's not an outfielder they had to teach him outfield in the past couple of years just to get 'em in the light up he's an infielder\nAnd the Dodgers are three innings away from a World Series appearance the world series starts in Boston Tuesday nights on Fox TV will city has one of the city [laughter]\nOn Fox TV by the way quite the college football game tonight and incredible first staff at twenty fifth rank Washington state leading at the break twenty seven nothing over twelve ranked Oregon they dominated the stats that about three hundred yards to ten at one point lay first that\nIt's not what twenty seven Seventeen lead over the apparently not ferocious ducks with

[laughter] she raised one eyebrow like really that's what you're going to leave in the studio with you [laughter] yes she is she gangs out most of the Saturday Night so cool is that love right there at is love\nBut I wanted to give a shout out to the LSU Tigers\nBecause you think about what they did tonight they beat Mississippi State they allowed what three points this evening\nNineteen to three playing great\nDefense and you look at Edwards Ron who is on the hot seat heading into the season they have lost one game on the road against Florida by the looks of it if this Ohio State score holds up they're losing Twenty one to six you can have L.
