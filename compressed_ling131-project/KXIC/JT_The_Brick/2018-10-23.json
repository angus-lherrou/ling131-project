{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "It's going in game one is sold his boss is going to be great\nWhat what's crazy is the last time that these two teams met in a World Series you already was over a hundred years ago in Babe Ruth was playing for a while the red Sox wow over can you imagine that's the last time these franchises met that's incredible\nIn a World Series ... and and the and it was the Brooklyn Robin they won't even the Dodgers that's how long ago was awesome read so who you\nGuy who's not been there yet we are right on top ... I don't want to do that like oh why don't you wait for tomorrow number one or two minutes from now we'll wait for a little bit but but I I Will say this I got the Dodgers okay that's fine you know that's fine let me make a white mom\nI don't want to give them right away that quick I don't want to do and\nThey're the listeners are dying to hear your predict when you go out and bad\nCitizens Chris just so used to doing the NBA analysts work where you just pick to go and say words here\nThat don't give any analysis you don't break down the the defense the op ed the pitching staff to ... you\nShould do and even ... I look I Will say this ... if I I was thinking about this on paper I was picking the world's going to say if I wanted to break it down and just looking at I mean the red Sox I think are more mounted\nTheir starting pitching is hot like I Would pick the red Sox but I just think\nThat the Dodgers I think it's their year out I don't know if I Want to say a team of destiny but if they win it I guess maybe you could say that I just think this is the Dodgers year I Do think the red Sox are probably the better team\nYou know what people are all on the red Sox to think about their path to the to the world series did knock off a hundred when Yankee team\nAnd then a hundred and three when they and they won a hundred and eight games I mean on paper you got to go with the rest and so ... on paper but that's not house Play Doh always upsets I'd get all that but to me\nUh this is another one of those ... moments not just game one but this series he cost them the world series last year I don't care what anybody says no when you were a seven and ... and ... and he and he they were up\nIn game five was to to do in Houston and you get a for nothing lead the team gave him for runs quiz he gave those up then the the the Dodgers scored three more runs and he gave those up the next inning after that that was the world series that that really was it\nAll right let's go to George in LA you got a a comment about Clayton car Shaw welcome to the odd couple of George\nGuys how's it going I really like your show or like Mr ... yeah this is his moment in time you guys we we've got to take care of business there is no tomorrow when you've just written Boston\nOne thing the Dodgers do have we I think we have a better bullpen and and the red Sox but it's going to be a very good World Series it's a good time to be an LA thank you\nVery are you confident in ... that's the question I mean he's had what three out three starts this postseason two of them has been pretty good have you you know they develop the confidence in him are you still think he's shaking the playoff\nNo no I'm very confident him right now I think he's a overcame his problems in the past and um I I think he's going to pitch very well tomorrow night we need to get that Boston and then we may be wrapped up in LA\nWith no died look out here that if they know if you win tomorrow if car shopping sale tomorrow David Price going for the Boston and game too I mean look what gives you a link\nAt some point\nPrices going to win a post ... hold on one well I mean when when like not the team well no no he didn't get it when they did last\nYear he finally did the game that they uh clinched he he he got they got a course when that was the big thing that he finally got there I Know times I and\nSo now the now he's over that yeah you would think before he was overdo\nThat might ... relax him and just let them go on pitch now you know what I'm not wearing the ... were in their own non tagging him right right right I expected to be a good series and we'll get more into it and talk a little bit more especially before the first pitch tomorrow best of seven and it's gonna be weird weather wise as we said\nForty degrees they said the first two nights and Boston Tuesday Wednesday and then when they come back to LA supposed to be Ninety on friday Ninety or Friday Saturday and Sunday so it's going to be crazy or the swings but you can't go up there and play called turtle and not be ready for it I'm Talking about the Dodgers you know what I mean and give up game because it's cold\nThis is baseball now I Wish they weren't playing the most important games and the goal my goal I I don't know if they can they need to to me come up with something where they're playing and whether that's more more warmer more like I get it it's not going to be summer but you know warmer weather but it looked\nIt is what it is it going away for years as over hung on his own right All right well and even you know with the additions to\nThe you know wild card and more playoff team now the season you know it goes a little bit longer in the postseason but teams have dealt with it got up and what you got to do\nExactly so I I doubt that that's going to be an excuse me ... and the other team is playing it they might they might have used to it but they still got to play and there I made it makes a difference there used to it but you still got to play the same elements what I'm saying you got to get hit the bats things when you don't hit it right you know what I mean that\nNo question you've done that everybody I I didn't hit it right a lot and so [laughter] oh well ... thing but you didn't hit it at all so how have your rights are you ... almost made the little league World Series did

I'm just Chris you me out I Am I Am I'm listening\nHe still is a man of conviction who feels like I Can't be bought just because\nYou you any up some money for something and that that that's not enough for me it and that's all I respect about him whether or not he's doing the work that Malcolm Jenkins is doing or whether it's worked at you approve Bob\nI respect Eric read as a as a man saying

American people but he shouldn't go out and disrespect Malcolm Jenkins who is doing the same thing in a different manner\nThat's oh that that's like I mean not letting letting the system divide to African American men who are really fighting for the same thing it's like they tried to divide Martin Luther king and Malcolm X they were fighting for the same thing they just had different ways of doing it and Martin\nWe spoke truth to power he went to the politician he went into the lawyers map them as much as I Love him he sat on the outside it was militant but at some point you need somebody to go into the system and change it and that's what Malcolm doing bond says air recent respect that\nHe's not going to guess you had a disagreement I get it but this man is out there fighting for the

good\nAt all and I don't think that's really in his nature but you're right he can be doing it with his place in the league but I I didn't\nKnow there was a point he's walking kind of a way with Chris

I Will say\nWell look I'll give you that the most balanced team in the league clearly office and defense is LA ramp I think the rams probably are the best team in the NFL certainly right now they ...\nThey can run all over the hill\nWho was the second best team in the NFC New Orleans they got no defense as Minnesota there flawed as if they meet any and\nI wouldn't right off the patriots against the rams but if they any body else in the Superbowl oh well we don't think they can't win it because of that these men 'cause they're mostly\nCan't play defense here you go to this was going to happen or do lose the game playoff game and go what do you expect where do you do do they don't have any deep as Bella check your sabotaging Tom Brady or the defense is awful I mean I'm telling you that's the excuse that Brady will get\nAnd I get it no I get\nIt take a look at it 'cause they only want to give them that if you just get bank and they get up against Kansas City saying AFC Championship game\nAnd and Tom Brady does for four hundred yards at four touchdown but the whole social for five right bumped up that'll it'll be about that the defense couldn't do any ... we saw that go there will\nThat will there be some truth to that know what I'm saying that I mean I'm Still say up but if there is there some like if Brady throws for four hundred fifty yards maybe four hundred yards the only reason they lost all four hundred yards and they put up like thirty five points and lose the\nKansas City is it legitimate to say the cost\nOf ... the only problem is is it the end of the game that we had\nIn the past Superbowl Chris were Tom Brady coughed up the football in the final two minutes they will winning\nThe game right okay they ... I'm not a call absolve him and that he will do get hurt I Am saying needs to do but I'm not saying he's perfect I'll stop\nSaying you know a Sunday Night Football they said that like a million\n... has it's genuine none that go on to the job you know and you know what's crazy do know\nDid that\nBut but we don't want to have to go what do you not even if you can't even make the goats for the\nBoston I'm a ... what was the um\nCan't even get out your remember deep down inside you know use the go you know what what's your story straight to the the uh four guys that they picked Mount Rushmore yes he's not even on the ... no no we're not going to read a goatee not ... I wasn't it\nWas more like you Ted Williams Bobby or\nLarry Bird and bill Russell if anybody goes off it's not it's not ... well you know one is not coming off the Brady is better than we do is not the guy with copper we've heard it would be Larry Bird if you had to take one of those off\nAh how could you not have been rubbing on three titles Bob your one to two I Believe he was one of the greatest hockey player\nBird one of the greatest basketball players I mean what is probably rank higher in hockey maybe a couple of nachos member\nBut part is one of the greatest basketball players ... he's the best\nTom Brady doesn't even belong on they're not the only Tom Brady unquestionably there's no way you you know you can't even say it with a straight face I Wish I could see the little eating\nGrin on Robert Parker's face I Can't even say I taught for Fox Sports radio [laughter] [noise]\nHey did you know the Honda Dream deal sales event is literally happening right now where you can literally get great deals on certified ...\nLiterally I don't trust that ... can literally a thousand breed as\nWell that's literally impossible but there is literally a Honda Dream deal failed event happening right now and Honda is key be dot coms twenty Eighteen best value Brent seriously\nNow's the time to get a great deal I certify pre on Honda at your local Honda dealer based on twenty Eighteen brand image which from Kelly ... dot com for information [noise]\nOh thank you for having on the phone ... with the capital one picture card un unlimited capital miles on every parking\nThink about unlimited double mouth and everything you by not cast and I purchased cell I guess we should call this young wakeup call come capital one [laughter] oh of course but before you go can I ask what can your wallet capital one bank usa\n[noise] oh no the heart radio we can sport time capsule\nHay fell a sports fans is any west that I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week is sports history are back in Nineteen sixty four for the famous wrong way run the Vikings Jim marshals picks up a fumble and runs sixty six yards in the wrong direction\nFor a safety still to this day it is the NFL's number one blue for this week in Nineteen Seventy the MDAs Cleveland Cavaliers leave their first home game losing to the San Diego rockets one ten Ninety nine\nThis weekend Nineteen Seventy one Texas Stadium opened the Dallas Cowboys be the New England patriots forty four to Twenty one stadiums unique root structure covers all of a siege unless uh Plainfield exposed to the element was often says that the whole on the roof was designed to allows God to wash his team play [noise] yes [noise]\nLike ... percent this week in Nineteen Ninety event or Holyfield not sell James buster Douglas fir the heavyweight boxing title as we can Nineteen Ninety three the NFL announces a new expansion team the Carolina Panthers\nWill be in Charlotte and they will begin playing in Nineteen Ninety five and this week in the year two thousand the Monday Night miracle occurred down thirty to seven at the end of the third quarter\nThe New York jets pulled together and improbable comeback with for touchdowns in a field goal in the fourth quarter eventually defeating the Miami Dolphins forty thirty seven in overtime at your high heart radio weekends for its time capsule\nYou deserve a better way to watch for ESPN by force and on the show roaming\nWith the original and the entire thirties or\n... I see I always say these news sports station available on your Google Home smart speaker just see OK Google play eight hundred kicks icy and I heard radio\n[noise]\nContesting the giants doubted than run another flight but that going to go to Dave Marr\nOr yeah we'll give you that first round pick for the Cooper kid and they were like yeah sure go ahead\n'cause I I don't know how this winds up being made unless it say Jerry Jones directive\nGo get them already Cooper for first or get a wide receiver right\nNow is a look 'cause this is and this is the reality before we get to the raiders part of it this is a reality for the Dallas Cowboys this is how they have to do things now\nThey have to shop in the clearance bent and they've been doing this for a couple of years why do you think they take so many chances the draft on players with character issues are all ... college because they have no choice\nBecause they spent so much bad money and free agency they don't have money so they have to figure out a way to go All right well we'll move this around with us from now will make a trade for mark Cooper and we train a first round pick for a guy who's going to be a free agent a year from now who is not very good getting him is fine but given up a first round pick are you crazy\nThere's a big part of it but I think went under the radar in a in a lot of the reporting this today is he's only got one year left on the deal\nThis was when we were talking with Jason walking for last week and and but even before that talking about hey Derek car given what John Bruton seems to be doing and and the other thing we'll get to the raiders part in a minute 'cause they credit getting what somewhere that we didn't expect but the idea that Derrick car would get dealt\nWith was out on the table there was a guy that was still on the contract to twenty twenty two so it makes sense if you have to give up crime assets to go get him\nBecause it's still under a team friendly deal for multiple years at the most important position in the game here's a guy that's got fourteen million dollars on a book his staff from a Josh ...\nOr ... I don't know Josh ... no no no I don't I see him every now and again around the building ... yeah I Know fifty two games with the writers and Mari Cooper Thirteen games over a hundred yards Nineteen with less than thirty so let that sink in for a second\nAnd and try to blame that on him but they the idea that you go and you give up a first round pick to a team that's not very good you got good defence\nWeekly can agree that the Dallas defense can bring it at times still waiting on the league actually do something with the markets Lawrence that's been hanging out there and it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere at this point Roger Goodell again\nDisappears into background a white offensively is visiting the guy that's going to jumpstart things and certainly make you a contender but that's the other part where you're at right now with one more year to go on his deal that suddenly turning you around that that's the worst one is probably a top ten pick\nBut that's the other ... it's a top ten pick is this is this isn't pick twenty seven\nThis is this is the Dallas Cowboys doing things how the Dallas Cowboys have always done them under Jerry Jones let's find a way to really dig a hole for ourselves that we can't get out of your losing a franchise player you are losing a franchise caliber player for one year of a jag wide receiver\nI it it it makes absolutely no sense and it makes no sense the raiders they give ... away\nAnd they get a first round pick for a guy who's thinks the tanking can continue although I Would argue putting him out their means they're continuing to tank\nIt it it makes no sense for the raiders but now that they've done this right I give the rate is a lot of credit today they fleece the Dallas Cowboys whenever they do maybe they were they were doing the whole thing from what was the Will Smith movie focus a with\nMargot Robbie when he was he was suggesting numbers to a guy like all day and drove by the side of a Boston when he would have lunch the number was on his menu and all this stuff because he wanted to pick that number for a bed that night like maybe they were doing that to Jerry Jones it just said Cooper everywhere he went and it was his limo drivers name was Cooper\nYou know he went to get tires they were Cooper someone's name was Cooper that he'd been all these different things he watched Fox show with Cooper Manning maybe a Cooper was everywhere so he decided to make that trace a weapon but if your the raiders now go the next step\nYou had a chance we mentioned it last week a lot of people said oh you're crazy now are we crazy the jaguars need to call the raiders for Derrick car chase a lock and foreign told us a first and a player that would get it done for Derrick car\nCalled the raiders for Derek are obviously you need a quarterback play portals gets best yesterday he plays so poorly Cody Kessler has to be out at all he does that sort of spectacular he throws a touchdown and the fans and and the the team Mavs and like he just threw a Hail Mary when the super bowl\nBorders keeps his job but this is after teams that members of the jaguars were fighting after\nLanding at all today reporters out there and letting them into the locker and said no no go back out there you gotta wait a few this is just an absolute\nMess trade\nFor Derrick car the jaguars you can remake your team you'll have a vertical passing game the writers are obviously trading everybody call and get their car he's twenty seven years old he's got a good contract he's been good he's having a bad year this year he's in a bad situation a change of scenery he will continue to show\nWhat he's shown up until now he is a good quarterback everybody left last week now it's like oh hey but that's the only time the\nSenate and everything that everybody was going to sell the un manning thing which one do you go with that yeah you don't have to give a bucket of balls at this point for you I wouldn't go make the investment on a guy that could actually be your future you got some good wide receivers there I thought it was interesting that suddenly Reggie McKenzie was getting credit for this trait\nThat he wanted his phone and all but he was the one in just in on getting a number\nOne pick how come it's been all John grown to this point in our own group has done is take a baseball bat Reggie McKenzie but then today this deal gets done he flees says that the cowboys and suddenly it's all Reggie McKenzie getting it done like no no no who's actually in charge over here what's going on\nBecause it's an often supplier now now they give him credit anyone's layers John Gurdon is getting rid of all kinds of players well Reggie McKenzie is getting rid of the office of players and I won't get on that I don't know how we're gonna do it here in Oakland nicely done that's how it's going in Vegas I was listening to a little Chicago radio today you know what they did a um a contest for best Chicago accent\nThen they really I mean given away gift cards well your city and who knows most embodied\nReally letting all well and it gets on the one is always stereotype\nOn on you know Saturday Night live or other comedy shows or sitcoms or whatever so they had um I I really thought we should have called in and in order to\nMake the move get Derrick car you need a quarterback he is absolutely available eight seven seven nine out on Fox sweater at how about a fresco Mike it's slowing down the Jason Smith show with my bed read my car and\nIf you like paper or if you like planes [noise] this is your show Monday Night football four minutes ago on the third quarter [noise]\nFalcons leave the giants now ten six thirty six yard field goal is up and good so this barn burner continues coming up next we are suspension we are spending we have a left hook we got everything\nYou need just got he just he asked people did Getty jak just got arrested and yet not yet\nBeen an assault we'll talk about that in a box\nThere's no doubt that Britain anger was more talented bought with LeBron James\nFronting the Lakers do you need the talent or Brennan Ingram or do you need the shot making of cow coups ... they may stumble into something here with Kyle ... as far as now ... got to be forced to play point guard as I said\nI don't think ... and ... on the court at the same time for long periods of time is going to work because they both need the basketball\nBut maybe they stumble onto something\nSo I'm okay with this for the next three or four gave Ron does out for three Brennan comes out for for let's see these guys can slide into role maybe cruise ... comes down for twenty five or thirty tonight and suddenly off things James this is not the really bad thing that everybody made it out to be over the past couple of started\nPre season is really what you get down to right here here's a more a roles\nThat that change and you shuffle up a little bit we see what this combination works works in that Luke Walton might not have gone to otherwise\nIf you didn't have this this situation occur and I think it was a good that we had a real fight when guys really were angry and it was a big men\nWith no real guy and I was a lot of talk yeah I mean just look at the longevity other than Ingram I mean the the young guy in the in the process round on Chris Paul they've been around a while\nThere's a lot of residual heat anger floating around thing when you look at these bidding sensation that got a ticket to a national level but Chris Paul soon as you put a finger and a guy's face that's ... that's just\nThe way our wars and average on a basketball court that happens at a bar that happens anywhere you know\nAnd and here's the thing is that for everybody who got suspended I Can't believe my damn Tony what's your from Mike then Tony I Can't believe my Antonia actually was mad that Chris Paul only got two games can we hear from a damn Tony\nCan we hear from Mike then Tony a tighter\n... close to it was just not acceptable\nUm [noise]\nHave you watched the family was busy what's this and that it's just [noise]\nYou know understand maybe just one but [noise]\nYou know how does he not quite what does he supposed to do just stand there and get spit on the thick of plays a punch in the face and then\nSay well that's okay I'm a doesn't make any sense of a better way that they're doing the best they can do is a hard situation I understand that so we're going a will be five foot or someplace\nNosy and here's why might didn't Tony just wants to have selective and Alice is of what happened we'll get to that coming up in a minute but first let's check with their cars and find out what's trending in this big high scoring battle in Atlanta it's a field goal fast\nAll right so it's a
