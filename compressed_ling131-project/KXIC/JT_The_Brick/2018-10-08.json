{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "A sneaky big move in the world of football was just made right a sneaky big move\nThat's got a lot of layers to it including an NFL Andy college football aspects so ten minutes from now we will have the latest on that move that just went down in the world of football I don't go anywhere how's that for a tease huh\nThat was a unbelievable ... and even for you\nAnd you're good at and then they'll fill ten minutes from now just stick around everybody or for whatever reason your local affiliate makes a mistake and switches over to something else to find a Sunday I heart radio at Fox Sports radio site um so I got to ask you real quick before you hear from lie but Jesus or not that I control them or anything he just shows up when he pleases button yeah so the Houston\nTexans so they're up tend to six on Sunday Night Football the first half was winding down and the Houston Texans have the ball at the one yard line at the Dallas Cowboy\nOne yard line as they are approaching halftime so so they're getting in to position to try and scored a touchdown up tend to six already\nAnd for whatever reason below Bryan calls the play is Sean watching misses a back\nOut of the flat or who may have been covered the Sean watching then takes off with the football after they go forward on force down and gets obliterated by Jay Lynn Smith who made a fantastic ... met the guy from Notre Dame who suffered the unfortunate injury in the festival a couple of years ago\nAnd so the Houston Texans turn the ball over on downs\nAnd the Dallas Cowboys get the football back on the one yard line\nUm what did you make it a play call and how much of this was below Brian getting crushed last week for taking the field goal and accepting a tie and his game against the Indianapolis Colts before Frank right given the when yeah\nI don't know if that had anything to do is I I just think he probably thought there was going to be a good chance they were going to be able to get it in right um there there were\nI mean it was ... maybe a foot or so is all they needed and I'm not a ... thought hell of a play by by ... says I'm it looks like he's you know back to his old self back to the play we saw before the tragic injury the fiesta bowl but um yeah\nI don't think coaches in those moments\nHave that kind of thought process because just as a player you don't either you know it's not like you go to the last week this is what we did and you know worked out but what does aggressive we need to know aggressive this week I I don't think it works like that\nI think you're look at it as saying come on man it's the first half or up a word hall let's go for this thing well let's go for punching and before we go into halftime and\nThe other thing is you know there's no concern if you don't get it of them coming back at that moment 'cause there's not much time left the house and they might be getting the ball coming out of half who started off the football game I think the Dallas are with the football yes\nSo usually that's what we talking about you say you want to double up so you're trying to get points there to end it and points coming out of half time and maybe they felt like it'd be more of a statement there if they got a touchdown and then a touchdown out of it now you look at a forty point swing and again nobody all my\nBills so by the lightning Jesus good God\nBrain that was a big one\nIn the lightning to unbelievable uh All right so the lights are completely pitch black in the studio um I Can't see anything all the TVs are out now that we could see those to begin with I'm there to the computer light is out of their their the cars of all stopped traffic has stopped momentarily it's almost frozen in time right\nNow outside the studio and into the studio comes a beaming light shining down on to the desk it is it is shining\nIt is it is a glaring my eyes I Can't see anything except a piece of paper that is falling down on top of me Brady is raining on me right now this piece of paper I Will open it up here on the air so you know this is not a radio bit here on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nIt is tonight on the seventh day of October twenty Eighteen that I live ... Jesus proclaimed the pick to be a\nCowboys plus five and a half so there it is ready cowboy Sunday Night Football\nAre you happy now you know they're going to lose all come on man to say\nOK Ben matter here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me you're just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates in great service for over Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their train specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy code dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nDid you know that over Ninety percent of male and hasn't till the virtually the same thing that to be done over and over again why settle for the same old product when you can get something that really works and then you need to try not to tell the explosive male enhancement formula that will unlock your performance in the bedroom to a level you could only dream of\nTitle imagined by ... on steroids called now for our special the bottle offered today\nCall one eight hundred nine three oh five for all that's eight hundred nine three oh five four oh eight hundred nine three oh five ...\n... veterans showing how stupid and know a career I was Airforce from Ninety three Ninety eight they got hurt a practicing\nCombat search and rescue fill up fast ... I'm ... I don't know where I ...\nIt was ... I've only seen that now\nYou know through struggle you know that's what the marine corps service is all about Indian tighten those bonds will get stronger and stronger the more you struggled together and the the harder the hardship and ah I don't know if it gets any harder than being a quadriplegic so you know we instantly bond\nParalyzed veterans of America is a nonprofit and it gets no federal

station available on your Google Home smart speaker just say okay Google Play eight hundred and ... and I heard radio\n[noise] talk force trending\nMore presented vi true cough online car shopping can be confusing not any more withdrew ... car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next cars there was a true car to enjoy more competitive car my experience\nIn college football you have complete autonomy of who you recruit what you recruit how your team looks what the culture is\nI mean urban Meyer is the highest paid public employee in the state of Ohio you don't think you can do what he wants to with that program\nAnd how he wants to go to our next saving for that matter with with Alabama\nYeah I mean they're rock stars ... exactly and so it's it's hard then to want to leave that [noise] and now you have to go work for a guy who was a billionaire who's telling you what to do and probably doesn't have any clue especially with a track record of head coach is going to Cleveland\nSo that that's the tough part about that place Dallas different story different story because it is Dallas citizens stone that decided the helmet and you know given that Lincoln Riley hails from a sexist want the Texas Tech a given all those ties\nIt'd be hard to pass up man I mean it would be really really hard to pass up that opportunity\nAnd there's also and you can say whatever you want to buy Jerry Jones and he's a little kooky and he's kind of out of it when he goes on these local radio interviews and he says some crazy things but you know what he is he's a loyal guy\nAnd he's probably one of the more loyal owners in the NFL because a lot of teams would have already fired Jason Garrett by no he didn't and he stayed with him so I it to your point if I'm choosing between Dallas and I'm choosing between Cleveland\nThat's got to be heavy consideration thinking All right well how quick as the trigger here I mean how how like well how how long is the leash on my job because if you bring them into Cleveland it's because\nYou've made the investment and Baker Mayfield and you think that guy can get the most out of Baker may feel because he coached them first you know for so long in ... at the college ranks but then you've got to deal with everything that comes with Cleveland so yeah I Do think it's an interesting an interesting ah predicament for him to be and bite\nLike hearing that he is that well thought of from Albert ... have you heard the same things that people have talked about Lincoln Riley and said this guy's on another level\nYes and now from Albert career I'm a ... not so much says on another level I mean look\nAt it to be honest it gets kind of like the hype right now fashionable homes every the quarter back in the ... ... ... it's not that it's copycat league it's just that we're like blowing everything up and we don't see them on a greater sample size that he's been the head coach now at Oklahoma for two years\nAnd this is a program that in some ways you could make the case All right it wasn't that hard to to keep it running at its highest level because Bob students gave it to gave this fine you know well oiled machine to you\nSo all you had to do is plugging in play and not mess it up and there's some people would say that it's hard to keep it at that level right I mean look at Ryan Day for example the first three weeks at Ohio State or urban Meyer couldn't be around that seem and all that\nWell oiled machine that worked out pretty well doesn't it yeah so um you know you don't know really what you're getting with with Lincoln Riley on a bigger scale because he hasn't been a head coach for that long\nI mean so there's a big risk and that I I Know you can make the case for ... out there\nBut look there's a lot of other examples of young inexperienced had coaches who do get those opportunities that don't work out Yeah John just days not think about him well Josh look he's a office of mine that's extremely bright and he'll get another opportunity rightfully so right yeah um but it's like what's just pump the brakes you kind of see how things work out\nOver the long term and and in this case let's say the ... year ends up with them 'cause look the other thing is who's going to be there to vet school later\nRoughly ... assistant coach you could potentially be that for the for Oklahoma Tim issues alive backers coach he could maybe be that he's he's been to D.C in the past and then carry cooks is technically the assistant defensive coordinator so\nMaybe he takes over the interim um because he's got that title but we're all still end up picking\nA Brady couldn't Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio a couple of your life here from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios coming up next\nThere

... set a big win this past weekend over Michigan State he's the quarterback at Northwestern\nHe's the guy you'll hear a good amount about ah in that regard uh Ryan Finley is the quarterback NC State there are top twenty five right now and defeated hasn't put anyone but\nHe's another guy you're kinda hear a decent amount about 'em as we had an extra ... shape Paterson's another guy quarterback from Michigan you know you might hear some people talk about so that there's a bunch of names for you\nI don't know that anyone necessarily really jumps out because the most impressive or players in next year's draft are all going to be defensive linemen and those are going to be the ... that you see a probably taken off the board first unless there is no quarterback if someone falls in love with it as a big time need for\nA but that's the tough part I think right now at least if if your a giants fan is that that's what you're looking at\nI mean he can't okay Suzie you draft the guy and he's a project and have somebody that that's going to need a little bit of time and you draft him who knows maybe early second round if they decide they want to go on a different direction in the first round does Eli Manning have another year that he can give you\nWhile you try and develop a quarterback because then we're approaching year three for ... and it already looks like this is the last year I just it's it feels like maybe they miss this one man like maybe this past rap was the draft to do it and you went was sake one Barclay it feels like that was their opportunity\nTo at least provide some help with a brand new head coach instead they went with the same guy to be loyal and it just isn't working anymore he can't do the things\nThat are necessary to to to really maximize ... talent in and there are there is weapons on that team they do have to count on that often said just feels like they miss this one like like looking back maybe they should have gone to quarterback instead of say going Barkley\nI think so only from the aspect of it if you feel like you really love one of those guys and maybe they didn't\nI mean look maybe they didn't maybe patched overlooked and said I don't feel like we should spend a number two overall pick on any of these quarterbacks I Know it's hard early on right now looking at it because they've looked pretty darn good but\nUm maybe maybe that's how they felt and it felt like say growing market can come in and give them an impact and they still feel like you I made it could play the high level but I think this year so far and it's still early but it's been pretty revealing I mean he's just he's not going to be able to be the same type of quarterback unless things change dramatically\nOr you know quickly and I will say this the last thing just on the subject look\nAnytime you're working with a coordinator I Know pat Sherman runs the west coast it's probably similar terminology to what he had been that McAteer before that\nIt's tough it's tough for everyone to get on the same page everyone to get involved I think you could make a lot of cases looking at teams this year that are struggling offensively and have had a change as as their play color or change that position and dealing with that so always keep that in mind like you're not going to see those dividends paid off to the second half of season\nDied so quick answer one answer one quarterback in college who you think makes the most sense for a patch or more often in New York to be the future of the giants\n[noise] ah one guy [noise] it's it's tough because I haven't been able to really watch these guys on safe enough to get a good feeling he wouldn't\nMost people do man don't research it just talk to your you\nKnow one guy [laughter] [noise]\nUm I drew lock probably at this point um that they have the quarter back out of a ... but again that's that's just based out of watching a sling the football around a little bit um and if that's what ... wants to do I mean he'd be the guy could throw into that conversation\nOur ... year Fox Sports radio I'm Still trying to figure out how that is not running the pastor and genuine [laughter] football

interceptions\nHe's never Seventy six than touchdowns isn't that kind of weird it is it doesn't make any sense to me his forty three careers touched or forty three forty three touchdowns a hundred games but you're literally he's like the best ever and yards a reception and I and I\nCould understand if it was one of these situations where he's all day got see just double team that guy and other guys get touchdowns but like they've got other players there like there's a lot of talent on that team and for whatever reason they just can't connect in the end they're deep I mean he's got a long long roster you know\nWe got this week that quickly otherwise we'll be at a Monday she says Monday Night guys a Redskins at St so right so we're going to set the over under ... four hundred and Ninety nine and a half for career touchdowns by Drew Brees writes for Ninety six going into the game\nFive hundreds of miles stone so basically we're standing at three and a half for his uh touchdowns
