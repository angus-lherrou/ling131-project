I said yes Rob says no we'll continue the conversation next a couple of Fox Sports radio\nWhen you get us on Facebook Twitter on Fox Sports radio dot com\nOr if you could just to see it on your radio [noise]\nImagined that working\nOf ... sports do you\nFox Sports radio\nIf you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you noted the first baskets were actually peach baskets warm\nBasketball is bounce here than a coal one player can run as much as four miles during the game well here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car to car also helps people get used cars to guy\nJust for buying new cars would they're certified dealer network nationwide inventory of nearly one million use cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simpler Beinecke\nYou shall receive file somebody's probably asking for it anyway Lakers gotten Alonzo ball overturned from his knee injury he's not going to start in\nFact he's expected to come off the bench and be limited to between ten and thirty minutes but he's going to play with LeBron for the first time this pre season Wednesday night when the Lakers face the warriors in Las Vegas\nAre there are just\nBe interesting to see how many of the uh the stars played tomorrow I'm with the Lakers and the warriors\nBut a should be fun as far as the preseason game goes to see a couple of Chris Broussard Rob Parker we're coming to you live from the guy told Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in your car insurance was guy go\nGo to guy called dot com or call a hundred nine four seven a U T o the only harbor figuring out which way is easier\nAnd we are joined now as the NBA season is upon us in next week it'll get going we're joined by five time NBA all star and I call him all I Want to hear him a C if he he wants to take this title\nOr he is the innovator and the creator of the modern day cross over dribble I'm Talking about none of events him hard away did I get that right 'cause you always texted me like don't forgive me I created the cross over and all that\n[laughter] yeah right exactly right don't forgive me keep me and makes makes you buy an stand out and kill a crossover king yeah right I Want to have it in ...\nNothing much man everything cool man I Can't blinders ready for the season to start\nRight to enlist start right there look I'm I I don't know if you feel this way I think most people feel this way the Golden State is going to win this championship tell me if you think differently but\nI think Tim that because this could be their last harassed together ... yeah yeah he might leave whatever but my point Tim as they should I think they should go out there and try to win Seventy four games and win the championship\nAnd leave no doubt and and make a strong argument that they are the best team ever do you think they should go about it that way or just you know coast when they're sixty some games and then trying to win a championship [noise]\n... you know what I'm thinking the way you think you know let's go out with a bang this quantum with Seventy Seventy five games if we can\nJust go out him win a championship again if we can but the main thing is we've got to stay healthy and you know what they got to stop arguing with the referee that got stopped in and and um arguments with you know trying to\nTrying to get into the referees head leader referees all go out and play the way you can like last six games other western conference finals and the four games that you sweat\nThe Cavaliers that's how they play each and every game take that initiative each and every gang grow up it would add it to go out there with a\nShow on there by we are the best\nThat's why we are the champions and we don't show yeah why we are the champions because meet on a mission to win and again\n... and ... and I thought was them I Would take that approach why not take\nThat approach you know um that that was set a precedent for everybody\nSo am I to be the bearer of bad news and sour grapes fun [laughter] do you do you like the NBA where we already know who the champion is already this is the fifth year in the role of that do go to the NBA Finals\nAnd uh that that hasn't happened since the fifties and sixties I think with the with the Celtics back in the day when they were eight teams is this a good MBA where were we already know who's going to win the championship\nI think is great MBA no you know you know who are you think we think we know who's going to win a championship and everybody at least they they know\nGoing to stay war is going to win a championship so want all the teams come out him prove everybody will come out here\nPlay hard play to win him play together and try to win you know and beat them in the playoffs that's what it's all about nothing else and and and make everybody be wrong about their dish\nWell good luck with the action is I Know I Know I Know good luck [laughter] but but I don't check you may you know Chris call if he wasn't hurt I think they were to get even though I'm going to stay warm\nAnd I had it at a\n... I think that Chris Paul was a big difference um ... when he was out and when he was an airplane that they missed his leadership they've missed his um you know it's gone ability as ability to uh um to get other people involved they missed all of that so so are you know seven\n... are you there ms twenty seven to three quarters of the whole that's what they did you\nKnow they they they miss twenty seven three point is in a row but you still miss Chris Paul not stand out there\nAre you giving used in a legitimate ... a legitimate chance not you know anything can happen but a legitimate chance to beat Golden State this year\nOr you know what I'm not giving them a chance any more ... more because you know they lost a reason origin was a big part of their team man I'm Talking about defensively slash or a you know he he he did like some than what a\nA map and golden state's does swing them equally up to now yeah does it now becomes in ... he just plays hard each and every night he makes shots when he meets and may shot he plays great defense all we we basically the fence on the best player on the team ... what have you\nAnd you know I think they all Mrs presidents big time wanted defensive and add some of the office of them by slashing and making ... and giving them a chance um points to\nTim if if the warriors do win it this year ... Kevin Duran need to go somewhere else and try at least try to win a championship to get that ultimate respect\n[noise] um you know I mean\nEverybody's talking about alternative respect\nYou know I think Kevin ... to me he already has ultimate respect me ... K nobody stopped him he's shown that he did Golden State warriors give him the ball\nBecause they know cat and nobody stopped him in the league and he may buck is for them that's why they win that's why they want game six and seven and guess Houston and that's why they want\nChapman shipment and walk for for or against the against um the cavalier\nKing nobody's stick Kevin Durant man I don't care who who think they can he can dribble the ball he get to that on a court weighed nice to get on a court he makes it a shot way nice to make the shot and he makes three I mean he's a triple threat every time he gets the ball all the time\nAnd I mean to me I think he had all due respect but I think\nThat uh uh people don't want to give them that respect because he went to the going to stay worry I don't to me I don't think he has nothing to prove I just think that he just go out there playing a key when it when it came when it but you know\nYou never know you might get bored dare he might want I don't know if he wants to leave I don't know I don't know was in his mind I don't know I think but\nI I Would just be thinking this year when the championship a one and you know if he can win as VP and go from there\nIt's the odd couple on Fox Sports radio I guess Tim heart away five times MBA all start Tim in here in Los Angeles\nYou know the the big talk about the Alonzo playing when LeBron or whatever but it's ... tell me about what do you think about ... ... as a player and be a who's going to be the starting point guard when the playoffs start ... will be a rage Armando\nWell you know I I like Alonzo I think he's a good really good basketball player last year you get hurt\nOr he was in and out of line up and um sometimes you coming out of college and um you know ... to get\nThis road trips and rigorous schedule and it's tough on your body heat in his by didn't respond to\nThe way it needs to respond I think this year I'm going to respond stronger he much more mature ah hopefully he has his jump shot a lot better than what it uh it looks you know uh because I mean come on man it's a it's\nA [laughter] ... you know you know so uh\nUh you know so uh I'll I'll\nHopefully he has worked on that uh what is for them to get that better but I think you know down the line down the line he's Omar from ray John Rhonda\nDown the aisle know how what is going to be if you can also started he's not going to start a in and out lie I don't know I was going to be but I'm I'm death the guard or the future and you you know you're going to have a guard there has been in that ... has won a championship knows how to win a championship\nKnows how to play the game of basketball without scoring\n[laughter] you know he he could go in there and play defense rebounds and assess and um you know and get you five six seven points and still win the game so you know I think he has a a viable guy and Iran do so uh you know I think\nIt go either way but I think he should learn and don't worry I think he should not worry about if I'm start worrying about I'm finishing a gay\nSo so dominant a finishing game and that that was that wasn't court finishing the gay and and being that the and when it makes the is\nTim I'm predicting fifty three went out and like brown the MVP for the Lakers what's your prediction youth what type of the ... going to have a Hoosier MVP predicts\nThe three ...

five\nThe Carolina Panthers at three in one [noise] okay I was in a way to get the giants are the deepest was ugly late you know they gave up\nBecause they were beating them pretty good and uh yep needed a Ninety through your field goal in the winter games but they did get it done the three and one\nWas that sometimes that can be the sign of a good team when you don't bring your best games do you have a lead up yeah like they did and you win so I'm with you that's not a bad one\nOur number for the New Orleans saints Drew Brees we already know all that goes but he's having an MVP type seeds and he's playing really well for them [noise] therefore wandering remember they almost lost it wasn't the browns are and then came back and and since then they've been roller but there for one so I'll go with the number four\nNumbers are so good number I'm\nNumber three I'm going to go with the Kansas City chiefs they got a lot of help I mean Blake borders was awful five turnovers he just handed them the game it was a really bad a performance by Blake borders but they won the five and also I'm a keep them of course in the top five what\nDo you worry compliment no you couldn't just give 'em prop though I could no people just say they beat the best defense in the league number two the Jacksonville Jaguars around despite\nBeing despite being three\nNow not just three into it I just got to buy your numbers to see what the what the\nProblem here is that a a a a terrible quarterback game for ... and the other band when he does but the thing that was most impressed with\nThe crust is that Patrick mold was supposed to be the greatest quarterback ... and how many touchdowns did Heathrow against this event and\nGot to do when he beat him thirty ... what do you think you\nKnow and it tells you about\nHow we got here who is not an order back to order back could not could not get a touchdown okay\nHere two sides of the football game I don't care if your defense is the best ever if you can score you often get started over you can be a great to\nChris is this the parkers power Viking not chard okay\nUnbelievable and ... and I know what the\nNumber one is obvious it's the rams there five a notice caught thirty three points on the role to get some pretty good defense so right there in Seattle a solid defense so I'll say their number five and this recon and everybody was all about the rams and so far the number one\nI'm speechless what\nDo you know do you have Jacksonville number two\nWho's ... who's the hottest guy and yet in the NFL this year who's the hottest quarterback\nHottest player proudly Jared golf stop\nNo Pat Pat ... home he didn't\nNo he ran for a touchdown but what he over three hundred yards\nHe started this season was fourteen touchdowns are no pigs he had zero touchdowns and and to picks against again\nWhy then dagger rebuild our ranking they you know we had one touch down against them they held him to one Dee Dee he\nYou know I don't know no no you can't just say race what Blake mortals did that's their quarterback\nThey're going to they're going to war with him that the guy their banking on man\nRob I Can't believe in telling you

are many with\nThe guys play here I Am an eight hundred checks I see I was cities ... sports leader okay Google Play a couple of cats I see what I heard radio\n[noise] ... [noise]\nTerrorists in a in another sport between Drew Brees and Steve Nash\nNo doubt about it and and I made a comparison earlier and I'm sticking with it\nThat uh Drew Brees is the NFL's LeBron James and from the standpoint I'm not a broad one three championships he's only won one I got all of that I'm not saying that uh there are parts player but I just want people when they make the argument about the bronze greatness\nA lot of time that we saw up numbers and I and I'm always telling people be careful with all those numbers because sometimes it's not exactly they they don't always paint the the correct picture LeBron James is the best that feeling is that she I don't care what anybody says\nBut that alone does it make you great and Drew Brees the perfect example of a guy who can fill the stat sheet but uh it's not even with all of that is considered to be the greatest of all time and we got the other example which is Matthew staffer from the lions who is on pace\nTo to a break a Drew Brees his record right now he's on based on believable and met Stafford hasn't won one playoff game with the lines in ten years you would consider the lines of below average team on my right oh no question okay so so\nJust be careful virtually every year right number is not a hall of famer now he's right into the hall of fame you think his numbers are just he ... he hasn't won like you said yeah they want to play I Know I was teams aren't that gay and even in the playoffs very much\nHe he's rewriting the record books have you just look at his numbers\nNo I Know his numbers are are great that's that's unbelievable it's similar even arrest you recognize Emmett Smith is obviously a hall of famer and deservedly so but when you look at the NFL rushing list\nYou don't just judge the best running backs of all time by their\nTheir their you know who has the most yard itch hey you know because a lot of it can be accumulation and I mean as much as I respect and love Emmett Smith and think he was a tremendous all time great back I don't think he was the best back I don't even honestly I don't think I have him in my top five wow\nHow could you not have Emmett Smith and your top five\nMe Walter Payton Jim Brown memory sand\nEmmett Smith did everything I mean he would he blocked the court from the ah he caught the football he scored\nA touchdown arson is he better than anyone any one week and they and they had a dynasty that won three out of four and he was a big part of it I don't get me wrong I don't know I don't know he's not in\nYour top five but uh that's another conversation hey it's for nothing Red Sox top of the force\n[noise] they got to lead off home runs to the Yankees are in real trouble and that\nSeemed to be dead so this series looked like it could be over unless they catch lightning in a bottle just\nLoad on all day can at least making an interesting game will see or not and then I get better\nYeah they and they look a little dejected the body language doesn't look great so we'll\nSee if we go now to have in our age seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six sixty three sixty nine if you want to weigh in on Drew Brees and is Steve Nash the fare comparison LeBron James or is he\nA top five quarterback of all time whatever you want to say well let's get to the phones route\nAll right Robin Ohio you're on the

we're going to bring in the great\nBucky Brooks former player former front office member now he's with the NFL Network and you can catch him here on Fox Sports radio on Saturdays from four to eight pm eastern time Bucky\nWelcome to the odd couple ... no problem but it's\nOur pleasure live we've been talking about Drew Brees and look he's an all time great first ballot hall of famer without question\nBut ... neither ... nor myself have him in the top five quarterbacks of all time even maybe if you just say of the modern era\nUh we've got him like just slightly below that that many Peyton Manning Tom Brady Joe Montana John Elway group where do you stand on breeze in terms of all time ranking\nOfficers are probably out and we'll go right I don't know if he's a tough time or\nOr we think about the modern era I'm I think you have to really recognize\nAnd appreciate of accomplishment I mean all of them in fact I have all the touchdown and all the like but I think we're really measure quarterbacks I mean I have to be that range but I think you kinda have to have some more accomplished what they call the chain victory\nOr having one civil war they were doing all of us when we talk about the\nThe voice of multiple chair\nAnd I think it's just not the ... yeah the other stuff but yet if you were raised together if you have a conversation at my ...\nYeah that that's a good call because a map through Stafford is a and M. on pace to break his records would yards and all the stuff that he's done and he still hasn't won a playoff game and he might pass them and who knows they might the lives might win but that's the argument that just numbers in stats don't don't add up you've got to have winds to\nThen you got to have more than that I heard one of the guys talking about today like the fast and yours because it kind of empty calories I got to go to ... on it yeah what was it certainly affected us a fantastic\nAccomplishment give them a war going to be a little more if you're gonna be the go I'm as we began to talk about that conversation that is going to be orders to pass with a way it is accomplished but some of these other guys have accomplished because they have put a big numbers but he also has with on day ledgers\nBucky sticking with quarterbacks we you know we're supposed to be a great match up this weekend in Kansas City and Jacksonville turned into a route in large part because Blake morals was just horrible ... can miss team as good as they are elsewhere\nCan they won the super bowl was borders or have they made a mistake and not going after maybe even like a tidy Bridgewater somebody like that in the off season\nHere I mean I think you're going to make the argument that their quarterback away from winning the civil or there there's a path where they could have went it was late\nBeing there but I think the other parts of the team at the play is such a high level that the margin for error when it comes to the quarterback play is real real small\nWe saw Joe Flaco when the super bowl ... he got hot in the post season I think it would take some like that for Blake borders to be able to do with it or this theme that good at the same as you go to the thing\nIs obviously loaded uh all the fast they're talented enough or up to get it done but right now the quarterback play is the one thing that you have a huge question mark about last week we've like written and we saw how hard it is for them to win games when he is in play and get a high look\nI'm Glad I Want you to to stress that the quiz he doesn't understand how good Jacksonville defenses they know they give us do how do they have given up like five well well five touchdowns in five games which in the NFL's crazy see six and yeah and I'm\nLucky you know nobody can stop Patrick more homes he didn't get a passing touchdown against the defense of that to pigs where this guy was lighting up everybody I think that the defense is\nCan win you a championship would you do have to have a little bit but you got to have a consistent a quarterback playing just have a guy who doesn't give the ball to the other team\nMan that's that's the biggest thing that you could you could ever tell anybody when it comes to winning games\nBefore and you can't win games you have to learn how not to lose and the biggest way that you can lose the game is turning the ball over so they don't need to be a tough ... quarterback they just need him to be a middle of the fact quarterback just don't give the Baltimore yes in\nFact I Would go so far as I said if you put Alex Smith\nAnd Jacksonville the Jacksonville Jaguars win a championship because typically Alex Smith doesn't turn to wall over if they don't give it away to the other team that he is going to get the office enough opportunities that they will eventually score\nBut you can't have someone who's a double agent right now like board of play football team that was on the other team and you can't have that if you go in and I\nKnow not do much about it\nYou've been in the locker room as a player so tell us the truth how does how does the OB Jay comments sit with his teammates\nThat's my parents' trust blink

and over a balcony and he almost hit a two year old boy\nAnd he was throwing like phases and an Ottoman and all this out the window I I'm thankful for Antonio Brown and the people are the boy and other people that may have been around that he didn't hit anybody\nBut you got to be smarter than a lucky can throw Saddam out the window and hit or maybe kill somebody so I'm a trash talking for

Mel Hall University of Iowa sports we Gary are available via streaming ... dot com [noise]\n\nFox Sports ...\nNot even a buddy up in the bullpen and tobacco is giving a base it based in double off the wall sacrifice flies suddenly it's three nothing is well now are chasing the reruns and Aaron Boone doesn't take out or make a move with his pictures he doesn't manage because he doesn't do anything because he thinks\nOh hey I was like in the regular season\nI could leave a guide after three exits my starting pitcher you don't do that in the playoffs if you're starting pitcher doesn't have it he is out in the third inning but Aaron Boone didn't want to do it because I don't want to be second guessed people get\nBottom line easy here's here's the thing he'll be second guessed anyway because all they did was leaving starting pitchers in wait too long and they gave up leaves the Yankees couldn't come back now does this mean they're going to win the series\nNo because they're not hitting the ball and it doesn't matter what that's the other ... the main part Aaron Boone is he's not managing he's just kind of sitting there like I said the zero carbon footprint he's a glorified office manager Erie is last night when he talked about why he didn't go to his bullpen sooner in game three\nWell because with a gallon we we figured we only had permitting tonight [noise] um\nYou know and certainly in hindsight we could have started the poor thing with Robby or something [noise] um but we really felt like I said they could at least get us a couple outs in that for thinning before turn it over to Lynn and then we could roll out our guys\n[noise] um [noise] we just to stop the bleeding you're also [noise]\nThat was that was [noise]\nThey couldn't get him the talking points in advance apparently not here's the line when this failed [laughter]\nI mean they had several ending to work out the verbiage and get it down to the dugout for him to practice in front of a mirror up in the hallway right I mean going back towards the clubhouse there's\nPlenty of space to go do a little pacing and and get the the verbiage out 'cause you know that's the first question you're getting asked tonight no excuse whatsoever you got five straight writings coming up so that is all over the place with his control and then he started getting bad around you give up two straight ahead so while pitch before you know what it's three nothing in your team's not hitting\nSo thinking that all of a sudden the giant barrage is suddenly going to cure didn't happen you got five innings out to poor shallow he gets the job done you got four hits on the night one of them was rolling bones\nThat just stayed inside the third base bag another ... out in left field that probably should have been caught that went for a double don't know if he thought he was running into the wall or what but you haven't put anything together often simply so every extra out that you need to get to everybody's available\nThis isn't a limit aging way thing to say it's one thing to say in the regular season we were hoping Severino can get us a couple of more outcry it's nothing in the ... you can't just hope a guy gets you a ... regular ... could be over ... that she doesn't want to do anything he ... he screams\nDon't second guessing me I Love this gig and it's awesome and I don't want to do anything I don't want to use like Adam Silver and Rob Manfred they don't want to do anything they don't want people to actually say bad things about them like their scrolling through social media all the time going\nSomeone criticizing me somewhere and now Aaron boot welcome 'cause all you're going to do is get criticized for not bringing your pictures out now bottom line like I said\nThey're not hitting so they would have lost anyway but you have to at least do something instead of sitting and watching the game I mean I'm I'm sitting and watching the game I think the same impact on the game was armed but we got to give yourself a\nPoachers chance right you're not going to generate runs you're not you know it's not to get them on get 'em over and get 'em in type of audience that\nCell and we have
