[laughter]\nWe already said man yeah looting Trevor Trevor wearing address which I was thinking of the back of my mind earlier this week with all of its Indianapolis talk I Wonder is blue and I can talk them into that again if I were in the back\nThere and it has to be man you know we already had a lot of the very end of the ... not all are we already out a lot of that that's a special thing going undefeated favorite [laughter] see how he ... I Know I noticed that hey I'm willing\nDo the right type of thing and when you go big time and get on the beat in how you\nGot to be special is what you're saying ... million Cedar Rapids is next on the outside for cat Hawkeye ... what's up\nMan\nGoing once [noise] hey what do you think well you guys doing a great job thank you [laughter]\nYou know I'm a Hawkeye than but um I have to label this or this part of the show a question will play calling [noise]\nUm I have no idea why they'd be passing the ball and that play\nFirst down on the line now why would your past fall at all and I play [noise] um and I just say in a play written for half time I don't really rent that crazy play why in the ... when he put the ball and that play you know just a couple of questions I Am you know I just don't think there's any way they should have passed the ball Napoli go ahead\n[noise] and my question Billy is do we know what standards are are you a hundred percent sure what Stanley checked out of the passing play\nYou know I I sure don't know\nYeah I don't I don't either and then we've kind of established I guess the the Iowa sideline was calling time out and\nThen the fuel judge for whatever reason to follow through on it but I think that's what I heard you guys say earlier wasn't it that they were both thinking this is Iowa football we're going to run it for ... and her own if we don't get in Trevor fine they're better than we are [laughter]\nYou know it kind of funny the way coach parents you know when when when running back home all the ball he's gone he don't ... you may not see the light of the day the rest of the game right\nYeah who am I already do you know\n[noise] well yeah but who is going to pull let's say he thought about pulling daily in the fourth quarter after he Watchmen Zell at the end of the first half not run the\nPlay well yeah that guy [laughter] guy he got a point there you\nSee there you go he already had his chance to gauge trust that he didn't gaining right\nAnd all kinds of rocks falling down in he's better off just falling down on that plane down right\nI Will maybe take some more chances that they haven't taken to try and create a level where an atmosphere of being comfortable but nobody's\nGoing to get mad blue then maybe you can yeah I mean I [noise] man how well you really don't want you don't really don't want salty Lou I've been trying to\n... or ... yeah yeah\nBut I you know as fans you know there's a certain level of expectations that and even as an alumni\nWe we want you to come out we want you to play like a true Huck I and I know these guys are going out and they're competing every single week Tom and they're not going out deliberately doing that I just wants to be a little fire in your belly man [noise]\nYou know and [noise] I mean there's an acceptable [noise] I I just I mean I could play better than that type of thing yeah I think you've got to have a little bit more [noise] you know um [noise] you know\nBe upset that you lost the game now\nI Will offer this from ... milk and who may be gets a little closer on the welfare seated honey post game microphones or what you're wanting it leads to hear from him\nAnd from members of the same [noise]\n[noise]\nI just got to pull together amounts but [noise] or maybe I won't [noise] that's okay I think everybody's in the right direction so I think we have a really good team really do think chemistry so like you said we just got to pull together and ... well [noise]\nI don't I don't question that they don't they're not playing together team I don't question whether or not this is a good football team I'm questioning and the fact\nHe just got the [noise] in the game that you really should have one [noise]\nAnd they're not given me enough [noise]\nWell you know I'm I'm I'm I'm angry it should be upset this [noise] I mean I just don't I don't know this is a big deal we set out to do with the start of the season because it is not transforming why why why is that in and that would make me\nWork harder that would make me it would upset me I guess that's twice\nIn eight games where\nIt's been on the table and the fourth quarter and we haven't taken it we got to get to the point where we can take these things [noise] I don't agree something like that would\nBe what you do yeah\nI mean he landed him actually that would be [noise]\nThat would be actually refreshing um interesting enough like you know there are times where you got to play calm be cool [noise]\nAs there are there are also ways to express desire to be more than you currently are mhm to not have given up this game with out you know getting past the line\nAnd that's I think we're looking for and that's what I'm looking for [noise] you know we had in our hands we let it slip away that's frustrating at five yeah against teams that are of the level of caliber that we we are yeah well we think we we should be\nHoping to be [noise] so let's get past the hope that was that that was our goal to be at that caliber it was it still is I mean we can't go we've got no slouches right coming out well we've got no slouches coming up so\nWas we keep on thinking about hope and then all of those so we better go and figure out how we can get a little\nLittle fired up and a ... and go and put this ball in the end zone and then do the\nRock in stopping Kyle ... the\nMotivational the man I mean but it's true I mean you gotta you gotta explosive Purdue team that I Know they got it today but they got this will produce team coming up you've got to North western team is coming up I think they're going to play in Indianapolis now\nAnd then you add Illinois team that would love in Illinois in Nebraska tune that would love to knock off Iowa at the end so\nI mean at the ... we got to get fired up man and\nJust start knocking people in the mouth as if there is I think still committed experience taking place here but\nUh you go to the point of whether they were able to learn from mistakes would certainly be nice to um [noise] here a little bit more of a of a level of disappointment I guess following another\nLost that should've been a victory for at least five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty for a one star six hundred on the line to get back to the phones here coming up and a check in with a Lucas who wants to talk a little bit about confidence rainy creates you though\nAnd they collide opposed in principle brought up the effect on the altar for cat Hawkeye huddle\nScoreboard updates brand new creates the climate was not the best and the result was tempted to the ... or major encounter with the lions by the ... thirty twenty four and this was the final time the ... the battle against these priests sorely hot spring touchdowns today for the hawks included\nSam brings down arousal dazzled past white to safety data poor points to the hawks total dino stone had a twenty four yard interception return for six points from\n... to field goals and the one in the first happy had was a clear mess forty nine yards he also converted both extra points for all star play by play icon Mr Gary dolphins shares a highlight familiar field sports how about ...\nYears but shortly after ... and he's going to back back up to the Golan straight back froze\nHad intercepted stone has to pick up the twenty five years with the fifth day turns the corner he's going to go into the zone touchdown Iowa out on the no stone\nRegular average run to the ... exactly right try to cover the whole ... both hands out in front of himself\nAnd then talk one under the other to get the ball into the hands you know into the the Kerry position where it may Bob all a little bit how much does that happen normally that is just accepted but then all of a sudden when there's a sideline play or there's a a touchdown player that's going to the end all of a sudden that's not allowed right no\nI I agree and I and that's where I'm saying is that it's a little its way to nit picky as psych guy has fallen his hand she's making a move he's going to move the ball you're taught to move the ball any way right away from pressure\nYou know it's all part of protecting the ball so give it to clear drop the ball you lose control and the ball is down on the ground without you having some control over his job but then I mean I think we spend too much time on this\n... yeah yeah it's it's really difficult because you've got to find where that where do we draw the line at I mean and then you know ...\nWe're saying hey this particular play it may not have made a major difference in the ball game but maybe a cut up so where did that line where's that line actually you're on ms could have been the difference maker could have been a lot of different scenario that could've came up but\nNot everybody thinks of Calvin Johnson from a few years ago right when this comes up\nThere'd be traveling\nYou know [laughter]\nI remember Calvin Johnson from you remember that I'm Talking about is never really thought that was the touchdown or yes yes we did\nExcept for shooting crew in New York [laughter] but they gave it to the patriots before that\nI see here we go and see what I just say hey come on dry parents is a patriot ... village that grade [noise] true true but you got to be that guy is a master build those check\nAdam good or another that certainly isn't or something or another wait a minute here how yeah sneak in there well no I was gonna say it certainly isn't a instead chat or\nWhat the heck health was that he said the ... or something along those lines and that would be one thing that he probably it has been quite bag or sometimes\nThis is interesting scenario with social media today where people\nAsked me say something that may cause risks\nWhat caused rips your team for frustration with your team it's a ... it's a strange scenario currently happening with no offense where his brother is expanding on things on social media but\nYou know ... nobody is asking him soon but it's being now\nTo the larger picture of it okay to you have to ask me that [noise] yeah I understand nobody's acting do was brother but if you're you know was rather do you just sit idly by may not say anything or do you feel free to express your opinion well\nBefore in in in the world before social media nobody would find out what he thought because there was no way to tell the well that's yeah I mean I sit next year in the bar right I think [laughter] you know I'd rather have\nAdded [laughter] right there [laughter] I didn't hear ... [laughter]\nHere's what's going on with him I I I haven't seen that sort of thing play into social media and play into a locker room scenario until now and I find it in an interesting phenomenon yeah\nOh boy now I'm sitting here wracking my brain because it seems to me that we've talked about and maybe not direct I'm In a way\nI I Can't give you one\nOkay there's Kurt Warner's wife but they asked her [laughter] [laughter]\nBut I but then\nIt ... why does it do do do you only speak when asked why yes and\nThen I took a trip what is it All right\nHere we're really so okay fine so now I'm going to make this officiating conversation so those phone calls that I get you know hey they did back\n[laughter]\nLook at it [laughter]\nWell I don't recall [laughter]\nI got a call dust asking me to read [laughter]\nSitting in the state of yelling yeah [laughter] and pointing going for you [laughter]\nSo I don't remember who I don't I don't remember you know asking triggered anyway what he thought he had a\nAnd [laughter] I didn't hear it\nCome there's never been given I don't\nElicited response to all [laughter] you know a question that answering questions [laughter] that's why I'm On the show [laughter]\nWell that's certainly true dry but offering unsolicited opinions I'm not sure if you need to know each other [laughter] but\nI Know I just thought why don't they mostly phenomenon that is true but what do you what do you think it is the Iowa players are not allowed on Twitter for example in\nThe habit\nI mean oh you mean for the fact that they may offer an unsolicited opinion I think\n[noise] true\nTrue\nI I mean I happen to remember a particular receiver who got a ... yeah [laughter]\nWe drove in Fargo that remind it resembles that guy maybe [laughter] all kinds of crops ways with everybody ... yeah yeah true true I mean he did set a precedent there for you know this might be a bad idea [laughter]\nI didn't want to let the not not lifted that but three six five or six I'd read eight hundred ... before opening or star six hundred on me here when I don't know\nThe yeah I don't I don't know how much longer the courts have said that for a while too but not much longer one can continue with such a policy against social media but yet it seems to me not be a hindrance so\n... what are you talking about not a hindrance it we're supportive statement don't do this why because there's trouble they're kind of like the the the hot stove hey don't put channels so 'cause it's high pay what oh\n[laughter] I don't cry about it a crime for\nAugust oh well yeah there are still do not detect it looked like a burger\nOr what [laughter]\nEvery experience these things so I can I can speak for ... [laughter] as a child [laughter]\nLittle bit too much inquisitive and it's you know what do they mean hot like how hot it was\nReally very you would you would never believe that I Would be so out there and you know and then probably a couple of other words do three right on the radio [laughter] thirty six five or six hundred hundred thirty three two fifty four order are six hundred over here like\nLet's look ahead Shelley what's left for this even seriously I mean this is a young team\nDoctor today what's left to play for is an interesting question to uh discuss next on the altar for cat Hawkeye huddle", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "28"}
