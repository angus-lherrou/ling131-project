you got here Kirk or wanted to know uh I I Do I Do Kenny O'Keefe used a script [noise]\nSo the first fourteen Fifteen place about brand does he do the same thing yeah I I\nThink it's really kind of become a trend we're we're most coaches do that not all that most do or are they may um [noise]\nUh you know list or ten or twelve plays that they want to work into the conversation and really the two are almost the same because even when you strip plays out if you get to a certain situation you get off the script go to your [noise]\nYour menu if you will fight you know what are we are on thirty one or whatever first time we get in a situation we always have those\nIn a separate category but I I think most the coordinators are play cars have kind of gotten in that mode and brands in the same thing and uh you know they put a lot of button time into that that that's a there are certain things are trying to look for typically a you know show multiple formations maybe some motions or shows those types of things and\nYou know you're trying to trying to get your guys going but you're also trying to get a feel for how the opponents going to play you\nOn that given day and uh it's amazing how a lot of times what you see ... film or you get a different a different recipe when you when you show up for the game so it's always it's always interesting to see how things are [noise] you know in an atlas both ways you know how we're gonna play somebody or vice versa and\nThere's a lot of little little intricacies that are going on in the course of the game on both sides of the ball and you're not draw these plays out of a jar is okay we're going to run this sweep or hopefully not yeah we usually out here and there were some years were like the full full confession on that but\nBut it's all based on tendencies it is I mean he he you know every team has a personality and sometimes the personality is that you are going to get a smattering of\nA and those are those are tough preparations to [noise] you know and the better teams tend to you know they have an identity and the trick is you know okay we know what they're going to do and\nWhat have you but now the trick is to go out and execute against them because they do do it very well and uh so yeah everything's a little bit different there and then as you well know a college football I think one of the beauties of college football is there is a very diverse\nUm way of going about things in in terms of your office of tech your defense of attack and\nYou see a lot more diversity in college football I think that way than they do manage cell or not not to say there is no diversity there that's not an accurate statement but [noise]\nYou know you you might get a team it's going to Georgia Tech for instance yeah are you won't find that in the NFL or in the ... of his like cutting six hundred Russian yards up against somebody so\nWe we know that nightmare and we sell those families so it's just a you know it's it's you know one week you may be playing a team like that and then the next week it may be\nA Washington state who's going to throw it all over the joint and\nYou know so I think that's one of the neat things about college football I think that's one of the reasons fans are so intrigued by the whole whole sport\n[noise] coaches you could imagine they're speaking of execution the swinging gates or a field goal attempt [noise] uh for a touchdown has gotten a lot of play everywhere to spit on her a Twitter page a lot tonight read a coach I Know it's been discussed to death but\nI Love the trick play how much did Brian have to talk\nYou into running that won it iffy up or if or if he had to do the ... and you thought it was about ten to one coaches are against it you are or a coach's favorite you against it but\nI guess there are a few more agreed with you\nYeah I Know I'm just trying to play up to the stereotype of being a curmudgeon you know the other ... everything a killer good idea of conservatives who are so ah no it's it's it's interesting I think um to that point [noise]\nUm [noise] you know really\nAnd and it really kind of began after the fourteenth\nSeason I think you know obviously we change our practice schedules we ah had long conversations about [noise] you know being a little bit more aggressive on fourth down those kinds of things so [noise] I I think our mindset change a little bit program was and um [noise] you know it continues to be that way but [noise]\nTo to the point of this play or any play like that you know we we all kind of talk about the staff during the week and then on Fridays we kind of [noise] um [noise] you know [noise]\nCapitalize or ideas a little bit and then you know and it's a case like this it's\nHey we think it's a executed and uh it's the first discussion and then secondly what are the situations where it might show and it just so happens the other day that it was the perfect situation for it or you might go into a game like that with every intention of running that play in that situation doesn't arise so it's it's on the shelf\nOr in some places are only go from a certain hash mark you know that type of thing so he might have the right down to distance figure on the wrong cash or you know ... you know those types of things so there's a lot lot that goes into it but I think the bottom line is our staff communications been really good [noise]\nUm are in that case is responsible for those ideas but you know it might be a temp politic might that might be something they did it North Dakota state that uh you know we throw up on the board and\nIt's worth looking at you know I'll go back to the ... it was something that you know we look the work that practice for a while and\nLooked like we had a chance to execute it and you can't actually get to that that's really the bottom line if you can execute it if\nIf ... or Jackson doesn't make a great a cap on it you know throw that out if breaks can't make a great block on the edge you know it's it's good on the board but not very good on the field that teachers pretty gifted it to do it a lot of great things with the football don't don't underestimate teacher doing anything he's he's really a ...\nA ... a super [noise]\nHe he's shifted that thing left hand is is he capable of doing it with both hands\nA lot yeah yeah right side of the day I was ... so [noise]\nBut we have been so blessed with terrific logs staffers for a lot of reasons the clue over a ...\nIt's interesting you know not everything has been perfect for a Nineteen plus years but that is to your point we we have been so good at that positions are on the show and ah going way back Twenty years ago a and in commonality every one of the guys is walk on\nAnd they're kind of all like self made guys you know ... it was not a big guy when he showed on here\nYou know you hate force fed himself to get up to two Fifteen or twenty would realize that he was the yeah yeah

radio\nJust sing to numbers is wonderful voices are still continues that way and it's it's a lot more difficult you know because the demise of the music business and record stores uh has made it extremely difficult for any minority and trust a\nFocus on line activities and\nThere was still I'm happy to say you know\nGood audience and\nIs I think like a lot of light post business actually flourish [noise]\nWell keep listening to I heart radio for more Peter Gabriel in all your favorite artists\n\nFox Sports trendy and\nA lot hotter in Minnesota this time of year today anyway disgruntled garden Jimmy Butler returned to practice today for the evils for the first time since demanding to be trained in things that a little heat in butler yelled at teammates coaches front office number in fact he can from the reports on ESPN\nBecause when he wasn't when Michael Jordan he never one do you know what I'm saying like right ... and and I think you look it's always about Michael and I get it and and ah Scotty was a big part of it but uh being Robin always isn't the greatest thing if you could just decide to do your own thing and I think that I really believe that that\nStory that was out there you know whether it be a rumor or just hearsay that will abroad tried to get the cab the trade for Chris Paul the year after they won the championship I think that her ... when he found out that the LeBron was involved in that I really do\nI think Kyrie was very fortunate when he made his trade demand that he was moved to Boston oh yeah obviously a Heinz I was a bad move\nThe Cavaliers stupid move by the Cavaliers but ah that he could have ended up in Phoenix he could have ended up and some basketball wasteland\nWhy MBA Siberia right\nLike right and so for him to go to Boston which is just about the best possible situation he could be a he's still the superstar he's the best way on the team\nAnd they're good and they're going to be a factor that you know there and favors to get to the finals in the eastern conference this year and I tell you what I I'd pick Golden State of course\nBut I think with the heart they play with with the coaching Brad Stevens their death that they would give goes data a nice little series and so as long as he's in Boston He's always going to be in the hunt here's my thing\nWhether it was the best move for his career\nI think that remains to be determined because if he stayed in Cleveland they would have\nA better chance of winning the championship now you we can say we all think their goals they would have been the favorite in probably would've beat him they beat him for one of the year before\nYou know that's a good team LeBron Kyrie Kevin Love\nAnd they beat Golden State before now they didn't have the rent but still so one you have a good chance you'll you know I have a chance to win another championship of us they in Cleveland and here's the other thing people are like well now with brown left ... would have been stuck there he would have been stuck there for a year\nHe'll be a free agent next summer he could have easily left Cleveland and gone somewhere else I'm saying it remains to be the term and if that was the best moon cause as a free agent he'd go to pick this spot\nAnd now in Boston they went to the conference finals without Kyrie what if this year with him healthy they don't get that far more water way around though in Philly we of course what if they knew that it remains to be determined by what they do\nThen is going to be people don't look at him and you know so it I just we have to see how this plays out obviously for him personally it's great and I'm happy that he's happy but let's see how it plays out on the\n... let's just squeeze in one year can we do that Taiwan's been waiting for ever in North Carolina let's do that you're on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio was up\nHey I'm Chris how are you going again angle on it all run it say that no God no one for him to burn\nAll of that ad that got it all and I want a man and gotten in the mentality in about no\nYou really don't think those are the losers you really think that they want to win\nI mean not that they weren't aware of but I don't I don't that they know the guy you know they don't got it or not you know I kind of\nThey're not no one guy's on championship teams\nYeah so it's like a not got it or the you know the high level I feel like I've got the winner mentality\nIn a in the foot and winning above ever look there is no doubt the best opportunity for them to win Rob will be to go play with LeBron would you agree with\nThat no I agree with that but that's not always the path maybe you want to do it on your own you want to do now they\nDo Jimmy but they're not winning a championship and don't do that but I'm telling you you know lead lead the if he and less there's a better player on the team to him he not winning a championship\nI Am as good as he is and he's Bernie last aren't really good but he's not in the ... not ... I'm On a wheelchair\nBudget all older deep almost below bronze only ... first round ... come on and what ended up in game that if it wasn't what I Do it and I knew that frankly that goal tending they gave liberal on when the Celtics\nWon it in two thousand eight they win seven games with the Atlanta Hawks in the first round that don't matter man come on\nI'm buying it always hanging [laughter] jak butler strong performance today I'm a I'm a given ms props but I think he's being a little hypocritical right now I'll explain next is the ...

I'm not the one you're the one so very pretty lot a lot of mind games were selling in order to get this line [laughter]\nYou know the thing is with Jimmy about this story is insane I Wish I really could have been there to see him beat up on all the starters with end of the bench guys with with the with the last guys on the the they're probably going out even make the team and play in the ... you can move on\nBut this is what Jimmy Butler\nAnd Antonio Brown and levy on bell all need to realize is that other to your destiny lies elsewhere\nInevitably lady on bell will be someplace else Jimmy Butler will be someplace else eventually Antonio Brown will be someplace else because the guy's crazy or you saw stuff today that he thought that the another police story about Antonio Brown but in this whole thing throwing\nFurniture off a balcony that he thought his Rolls Royce was solely when the police showed up at his condo to ask about it he slammed the door in their faces he's nuts I he's got problems and all of these guys are going to wind up someplace else\nThey don't realize the damage they do to their images and how less desirable that makes them because other teams want to be able to say okay hey ... it was a problem for you here that's okay you're one man's trash another man's treasure I get that\nBut all the teams in the NBA and the NFL or going\nBoy if we give levy on bell that contract is he really going to show up for us I mean look how bad this is and if he doesn't like how things are going is this what it's going to be like for us they're saying the same thing about Antonio Brown when things go bad and he doesn't catch a pass in a game is he going to go nuts and yell at our off into coordinator and cause all kinds of problems we want to get out of his contract\nAnd the same thing for Jimmy Butler people you want to trade for Jimmy Butler this is what happens when things go bad Jimmy Butler as decided to take this\nAs a crusade and put himself in the top and I'm away from the team and now I'm here and I'm yelling at the gym and I'm causing all this controversy\nThis is what players failed to realize is that when things are bad other teams look at you and say All right how are you dealing with this and none of these guys Jimmy ... at the forefront because we're talking about in right now none of these guys have shown\nOther teams will go oh yeah yeah we want to go get Jimmy about how many teams you've seen in the mix for Jimmy Butler just one just the heat that say how many teams you want to trade for levy on bell no body no body wants them all of this because you don't wait when things get bad you\nSee and you can't get crazy there's such a thing as grace under pressure that team still care about I Know it's all about what goes on on the field we've had that conversation for Fifteen or Twenty years now but when it comes to a point where we can get you are not get you well this is not going to push me to saying hey I think if you come to my team\nEverything's going to be great it's not\nWhat a couple of things when it comes down to Jimmy Butler I mean you you love the the honesty or as much\nAs he's going to be honest in these discussions why he's going in front of Rachel Nichols go cats are to talk about it uh doesn't make a lot a lot of sense to me I you know this is still one just like the others keep it in the house and and try to take care of business but at some point\nI guess you decided you taking it as far as you can wear this gets typical does that you're talking about the distressed property effect\nLike that there are certainly offered it yeah there's only so many teams I can take on\nJimmy Butler salary and have the ability to just say okay we're going to break that the other way 'cause he is he is he a transcendental figure\nOh he's a great basketball but he is he the guy that we can say he was going to be the third or fourth or whatever or and also ran in the in the west there were nine teams that were basically the same last year and just a slight variations because they had been more exciting maybe pulled extra around in the plaza sure but is he the guy lead them to the title\nOf any that I watched him in Chicago you watch them last year and and what are you gonna do all the players and you give a hundred percent\nEvery practice every time all the way through and GM's are licking their jobs if they do want and they're not going to waste it so it's I'm not surprised when I got to go oh I Want him you know so you hear about the heat okay that's fine\nThey're waiting for rock bottom prices\nWhen it comes to a trade or did you guys got up there on the left to go the rest that goes down they're not getting more after today but that's the point is\nFor them they're looking at it going All right let's watch your key burning\nWe don't need 'em right away right October is just rounding guys into shape it's like the the rams did the first half week one because we had to play all preceding let's get after and the is the same way so you're just waiting on it so you're waiting to see exactly what you're going to take\nTo cut bait with with Jimmy Butler and how cheaply you're going to be able to get it right into the house where something bad happened\nThe murder see we go back to our horror film ... or you know people fell out of a job unfortunately and asked to get rid of it quickly I mean there's all sorts of the same thing with Jimmy ... he basically said this is fixable I'll see these guys all in el by sports\nRadio the Jason Smith show with

as a freshman in college argues greatest freshman year and then everybody adjusts he didn't have another year another level\nSee I'm not ready to to bury him fully with what's been built by the Joneses in that organization\nThat all day on buddy you don't build the hall of fame often supplying again and maybe it'll be good well\nPut pushed that aside I mean how about a functional offensive line which they really haven't been it's been a lot of his ... during the ... work himself yeah Travis Frederick went down and again\nEllen hers is your number one wide receiver now they have no weapons we told him they were going to say so it was a guy yeah this is like Jared golf a couple of years ago with Jeff Fisher was at the hell no I Can't kill the guy for what's in front of them by the way they also want a couple of games now\nBut but nothing in the east has yellow ... you're alive boy they could go six intending Wendy's ethics at that age and their families and how many ... pointed out that what a lot of it in five game gets left out but look\nThis is a bad team Prescott has not been the quarterback you why look if he's an elite next level quarterback\nGreat quarterbacks like that can get around sub par often supply play they still find a way to make place but this is not ... I I Want to take the whole deck Prescott 'cause everybody's jumping up and down on a lesser let's go\nThis is where I Need that Prescott to lead I Need jak Prescott to do an interview and to say you know what\nDon't bring any of his BS crap because it's all a bunch of crap we got the guys that can win I don't care about and heard this question a play called we believe in the coaching staff we believe in each other and everybody should shut up and go do their jobs\nThis is where jak Prescott needs to be more than just the quarterback of the team if jak Prescott really is that he can take a jump and a leap not even having anything to do on the field he needs to be the guy to quiet this down 'cause right now the Dallas Cowboys have no leadership\nNone that Prescott to use the quarterback but he's not a leader which is why you are hearing all these wide receivers who you don't even know there is still in the legal what really is guys up federal dollars the Jason Garrett's not going to say anything because he's just happen to be working in Dallas because he doesn't know if the next thing I say it's going to piss Jerry Jones off enough\nTo fire him as head coach 'cause Dallas starts two and three every single season and somehow Jason guard still has a job nobody wants to say anything\nBecause Jerry Jones is a de facto leader of the cowboys but this is where the quarterback steps up and says you know what\nI Will feel this way because the quarterback\nIs very visible when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys and their position on the NFL Matt yes if Jerry Jones is team and Jerry Jones will always get the headlines people gravitate towards him\nBut jak Prescott steps up for his team suddenly it becomes jak press Scott's team there in one fell swoop and suddenly that togetherness that feeling that we're all in Fort instead of sniping about the play calling all of this that stuff gets solved\nI Need that Prescott to be a leader now and I know that when quarterbacks lead they like to lead with their own personality and you can wait and have that come out in time\nAnd and that's fine I get that you could be the rough and tumble leader right away like Baker may feel you could be the the quieter guy like Sam Darnell you can be Tom Brady you can be Aaron raw you can be anything you want\nBut in times of turmoil\nAnd the cowboys are in turmoil someone's got to step up and say something and grab the team by the throat and dad Prescott needs to be the guy to do that 'cause nobody else and that didn't get as he can only uh can't do it he's not a quarterback he's got to be the guy on the problem\nIs you're getting if you're getting friendly fire I guess it's a nice way to call it from all sides are you talking about Alan her surgery at Colby usually do it we we look at Troy Aikman from the booth\nHall of famer part of the Fox family Jay in that jak needs to be more accurate and pointing to the what is it sixty one point eight sixty one point nine percent completion percentage you've gotta G allele running well you've been able to flare him out as a receiver\nI think your point when you when you look at Jason Garrett obviously embattled Jerry Jones keep sticking his foot in his mouth and then you have does Bryant he's got his popcorn he's going to hold Terrell Owens route\nAt this point on social media chirping in in in every play call and watching games live and commenting surprised he hasn't been brought in to just get I get a sponsor for some lived commentary during games and just let him go of full on on filtered\nYour teams are covered right here on Fox Sports radio\nHost season is here so we're getting this dream all stars and army I because the only thing that matters is October\n... begins tomorrow one that's on

guy go dot com or call eight hundred nine four seven eight you'd see all the all the hard part is figuring out which way is easier\nAnd it's a theme song Thursday right there Chris you know what does that\nHave no idea was that was I was saying value that one that theme basketball wise [noise] it's ...\n[noise] yeah um Saddam washed [laughter]\nNo I don't watch it either but I knew what it is

old days ... like the one hand all his son and once you get things at all and all that they will get the we got we got plenty of shallow lie you exactly\nA darn strokes to jump present I feel is you got to get to ... percent on so we can sing that we haven't had the ... yeah we didn't adjust course we gotta sink to the Jefferson yes\nOh yeah okay I of course that later on and that was a loan from good time wind singing a very good that was a great great art let's let's go to uh the U.
