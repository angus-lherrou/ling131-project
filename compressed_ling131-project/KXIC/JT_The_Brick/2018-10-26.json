Danny west and I'm here to take you on a journey back\nTo this week in sports history\nThat started way back in Eighteen fifty seven where the world's first soccer club or football club Sheffield ... founded in England [noise]\nThis week in Nineteen Twenty one the Green Bay Packers play their first NFL game seven six when over the Minneapolis Marines so this week in Nineteen thirty nine NBC become the first network to televise the pro football game the Brooklyn Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Eagles twenty three fourteen Brooklyn's Ebbets Field\nThis week in Nineteen sixty six ice hockey legends audio your scores his\nFirst career goal against the Montreal Canadians at\nThe time of his retirement she was the leading the sentiment in the history was two hundred and Seventy goals [noise] this week in Nineteen sixty seven the New Jersey Americans who later became the New York and New Jersey nets played their first KBA game and jumping ahead this week in Nineteen Ninety three\nJoke Carter has only the second baseball World Series winning home run\nAt the Toronto blue jays win game six of the world series to beat the Philadelphia Phillies games to do\nAnd I can still remember every awful moments\nYeah I'm a Phillies fan that you're a high hard radio weekend sport time capsule\nESPN Plus your college football covered\nTo bring chaos icy Iowa City sockeye sports station and know all the University of Iowa sports we Gary are available via streaming cats like ... dot com [noise]\n\nCourse trendy and\nYou get to keep that money and you can still go to school\nWhat's the difference the Jim ... wants to compare seven zero ... division one big time college basketball players and football players so all Seventeen year olds working well let's compare Jim bay time so all basketball coaches\nWhy should he get more money than the high school coach than the division three coach but in the division to coach or even a small time the reason why goes what you're all glorified gym teachers that's what it oh you are but Jim behind makes millions why because the steamy coaches generates that much money I'm not\nAt you know why don't you when you when I Do the same thing now as common collar or we don't get the same amount of money why he was in a row we know that sounds absolutely so if these players are generating that much money they should get paid for\nIt no no doubt about it and I just think it's wrong especially in light of this this is why kids have got to take money under the tae Bo for their families because the system is messed up\nAnd that's why the throw this out there that's why these college coaches I don't care they they want to deny I didn't\nKnow you know you\nKnow one hundred pray and that's why they don't mind it\nThey don't want to get caught but they let it go 'cause it deep inside they know this kid\nThis or you know why if you really wrong and the kid didn't deserve it you wouldn't let it happen\nAnd the other thing too about the fallacy of the scholarship\nIs that it's not guaranteed for four years right they could take a scholarship at any time and I don't think people really understand well they got a four year raw\nDude if you're not playing up to par what they really want from you they've had kids had their scholarships taken all the time eight seven seven Ninety nine or ... what side of the fence are you on on this\nYeah I I just think ... is way off in this and and we're talking with our producer Rob gee earlier and he was saying well and I I don't have all the answers as to how you would pay college athletes\nBut I Do get bothered when people act like it should be well if you pay the football players use your pay the swimmers and now you know the swimming and the residents aren't generating\nMoney for the school the football and\nBasketball team that's the reason you even have swimming in wrestling and lacrosse and all that that puts the bill of rights\nThey take care of that and I'm with you I don't believe in that it's the same thing we talked about it with some of these other like like a somebody's a TV stars movie stars I get in why Denzel gets twenty\nEverybody in that movie that and make the same way they don't they don't make twenty million why in in in college sports everything has to be equal when no other area of American Life is not like that or not\nDoesn't work like that if you generated and and\nYou know I teach at USC and I respect teachers and all that people always say well ridiculous these players are making his money and teachers don't get compensated I said when you could sell tickets and broadcast a teacher teaching didn't they didn't it changes I think that's just that that's the reality of it\nOf course we all got that big Chris\nBigger because of the television on money and they did it at the gate was seats right when it was only about the gate were seeds guys didn't make that much money does a fax\nSome of them in back in the day work other jobs because they couldn't let him out that much money it's all about what degenerate there's no I don't think anybody in their right mind anybody\nWould say that what these pro athletes or big time college coaches are doing is more important than that elementary school teacher nobody in their right mind even these athletes if they said he they're crazy but who's making more money why because that's what this or generate simple as that I\nDo college athletes deserve to get paid you can weigh in eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox a Seventy seven nine nine six sixty

I'm married\nActually finding out about out about the downtown area was later why ... he was mad\nI Want to get out of should've been ballots in depth and this was well Alex what's your take on you know Rob\nI'm the kind of guy that likes to go above and beyond for ladies but if it's an instance where she knows that prior to that you got the hook ups and she's not okay with it that might be a red flag already right there no that's a deal breaker yeah that's a little too much but in my perspective\nI like to do things that are bought for somebody I like to make stuff for somebody like you said pecan so style paint a picture something something that's like a momentum that only you to know about\nThe oil and you wake up and you may for an ... like a man and walk we smoothie lung\nThing on that point it was like ah for me and my ex for an entire year I wrote a note about something she either dead or something a memory of us or something we went through and I did three hundred and sixty five of 'em and put in a jar for her birthday gave it to her why every day is way down and read something different\nHey delicate you man man see I I think he went above and beyond it's a thought that counts the experience than I Am not everybody can just sit down the court side and so yes it counts and I think it's shallow that she you know she's upset that he didn't pay for\nThem that would be a deal breaker if I was dating and she was like made us think that that because I got the tickets for free\nYou shouldn't be luckier with somebody that can get you those kind of perks no question\nBecause that just shows the person that out of material in the act I mean that's you know you're going to have problems going to\nSay that it didn't that didn't count I'm at work we made it didn't count and that was\nReally thoughtful and him to try to especially that's something she really wanted didn't yes she was excited until she found out that he didn't pay for the ticket na shallow\nGet rid of what did he do with the extra money that he saved from those tickets I don't mean a like a Saturday or friday followed ... are you saying\nThat that's what I went to a strip club\nThrough that money a single [laughter]\nThat is a that is\nGood as well you see re purpose of the money that's fine but if he took that extra money was going to spend their pocket it\n... it actually ended up she\nSays why you know the idea that he was being honest with though he didn't have to tell though he was he didn't think it was a big deal why are they are\nComfortable with it or you write you know this is my otherwise you would lie yeah 'cause most girls or a lot of them would be appreciative that you know like my wife well now we're married but she will be glad we save the money yes when I had to read and\nAnd how would you not like if you were a jab dating a guy and he got caught seat set up at a pistons game when you say well you got cloud you know some big time people\nThat want to know us you wow you know Robert oh no no I I ...\nThat he went to the effort to do something that I really wanted to do and yeah I wouldn't be thinking long term okay he knows how to have fun and not spend a ton of money yeah yeah Craig and eventually the pot merges and it all the you know they didn't you and comes out so\nYou know quite high used to take my wife and I told you

are already bang up Houston secondary will be out without John than a Joe ... for the second half hour than ...\nSo we'll keep you updated here meanwhile not merely the biggest headline out of Houston is the third quarter is just getting underway\nAccording to reports league sources told ESPN the Houston Rockets are making yet another bed to acquire all star Jimmy Butler who let me answer butler can get it no he never he's never gone to London you're sure ah well I don't know worldly man but surge Jimmy buckets\nI mean that's ... ... it's I don't know I could we can sell that serve buckets Yes sir buckets alright yeah there's a there's a branding opportunity there\nWho is still\nUnhappy in Minnesota but the the controversy has died down a little bit since the season started but still they wouldn't like Jimmy Butler and they have offered not one not to not three but four [noise] first round draft picks to the timber wolves in exchange for Jimmy Butler\nNumber one why have the timber wolves not said yes okay because all you have if you look back and go you know that Steve Nash trade really worked out for the ...\nOh no no no don't did let slip back oh let's do that for first round picked if Jimmy Butler was Kevin to rent or\nA transcendent player like that if you mean butler was joellen being if he was so I understand okay for first picks you're talking about a guy that's going to be your future for a long time to be butler is twenty nine and he wants to max deal\nFor first round to are you crazy I feel like Houston is deeply panicking because they've seen the start of the NBA season and they've seen the wars is still the warriors the Lakers or improve the pelicans may beat the crap out of everybody all the teams in the west are better than we expected\nSo now they're flailing and Main we knew we got to go do something they gotta go get Jimmy bought little Jimmy ... is a good player but for first round pick and you can't do it\nFor years in a row so you're talking about these for first round picks could be spread over as many as ... years do you want an eight year reminder of how bad that is when you want to go all that in on one guy because look it looks like Steve Nash is a great trade for the Lakers three first round picks things were awesome and then what happened Steve Nash got hurt and it was oh my God\nThat set the Lakers back five years that trade five years\nYou want to give up for first round picks\nFor Jimmy for\nThat's you're talking about potentially\nThe future of your team getting pushback by five or seven years because in theory you want to say well it's really late first round picks but ... ...\nYou could think anytime in the next five or seven years and hey the Lakers stunk we don't see that should be great for a long time yeah they were all set with national white our to Kobe and look what happened they stunk and they kept giving up and they just kept getting first round pick after first round pick up a first round pick\nThis is what could happen the rockets could stick a year from now when suddenly those picks are all going to be much higher and and it's going to be really difficult to justify that deal there's too much downside was making this trade for Jimmy Butler too much downside\nTwenty nine years old however many years he has remaining you bring in a defensive guy with the the upcoming years you've got to harden injury right now still trying to assess exactly how long that's going to sideline him and how that will impact him over the course of this year\nUh and then you've obviously got crushed ball or give me already thirty five years old so you know you're you're gonna have a a shift in this team here in short order\nIf they give you the timber wolves you say yes yes ... and very quickly because you've already got your future in theory you're two guys that are supposed to be the the bookends of what this franchise becomes in cat and weekends so why would you not shut up a guy who's on happy\nI mean you can ride it out there are two and three and a and they can win some games right they're going to be a solid team if he sticks around but if you can solidify Sean picks it obviously the first one probably isn't going to be very good right it's probably going to be made round at best\nRight but you can also use that and say hey right you have it all you can move or we can deal that\nFor another player because first round picks are really that this was not suddenly this is not me saying that the rocks are any good for franchise players in the first round but first Ron picture so valuable because you can package and move up\nTeams want those they want first run picks you can get another really good player and all you gotta do sometimes just give up a first round pick all we've got salary and the first round pick first round picks of any kind are so incredibly valuable because you can do so many things with them this is why how the timber wolves not said yes\nSecond team all and be a guy a guy I Love to watch uh and and I think brings it every night for his forty eight minutes but as we talk about not a transcendent figurines not taking over a team ie not dominating\nThe ball and and and and isn't a dominant score so yeah for for ... done I'll make the deal for\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox where they're at and how about a fresco might get

I'm not mad at him at all that's the part of the game I'm not mad him now if I'm playing basketball and I know what players coming to yellow telling my teammates\nWatch watch the screen every columns yup why you also pick whatever you want to go and you go to call it out right and the same thing that's why a catcher hide just signs when all these are all face yeah what a batter's up\nAbout it could look right back down at the catch it and what they do yeah they put that glove there you can't see it it it it it makes a big difference when you know what's coming doesn't mean I'm a hit it automatically 'cause I Know it's a mid ... but it makes a big difference right you know if I Know a break and come and I can wait lab by much", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "26"}
