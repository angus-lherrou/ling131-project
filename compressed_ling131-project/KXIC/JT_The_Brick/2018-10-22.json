I Know there's been several playoff games where they were\nOr that they were hosting Pittsburgh was one I Believe they were hosting against the jets if I'm not mistaken so there's been some of those but this isn't just on Andy Dalton uh Marvin Lewis hasn't had a great track record but I actually think they're a pretty talented ... where do you stack is is the AFC North is it the best division in football\nThe AFC North I Know the honesty sounds pretty good I'm there to see south is a lot of parity there see west with the exception of 'em will probably the raiders and I don't think the Broncos are as bad as they've been\nAh even though they won a Thursday night um yeah the AFC North is probably the most competitive I think that ... says a lot of parity in it yeah um so yeah they have seen or if you're in you're out of tickets as three teams legitimately playing for ...\nI'm also a live that Jesus has sent out a tweet he should be making his parents are momentarily like look I\nLook I I'm not I can't wait for that bomb ... this is and again or just the cheap shots at a guy who is really putting his time if you're new to the show here's how this works so alive but Jesus uh started appearing on our show a couple of years ago\nWe've never met him a piece of paper fell down onto the desk after all the lights went out I thought we had an earthquake or something here at in Southern California and on the piece of paper there was a bet\nAbetting lying on a game that was going on and it said sign to live that Jesus\nI thought it was a one time thing and as it turns out no it was not just a one time thing he's now showed up virtually every single week since then\nAnd um he has not been consistent as of late ah he's ah he's lost a bunch she's won a couple and break when thinks it's a nice thing to do to pick on the guy or gal whatever he is or she is and I I Do not happen to agree I think it's kind of messed up to be honest with\nYou I say here's the deal we don't have him on the show because it gets system comes on 'cause he gets system stinks\nWe have them on the show because he's supposed to give our listeners some betting advice so they can win the cash and then they can do something fun with it or maybe have a a few extra cocktails okay that's why we bring them on the show he is not winning that's my frustration\nHe needs to go on vacation for a few weeks that would that was it I think you should take his place\nBecause he didn't even finish you didn't even ... he just grabbed his crotch and said I'm getting in and you ain't stopping you ain't stopping me you are not\nThat documentary Clinton's sounds like something that's\nPretty dangerous ... yeah well you know what I mean a like a crotch child or they don't ...

West and I'm here to take you on a journey back\nTo this week in sports history start off back in Nineteen twenty three were the New York Yankees when they're first world series feeding the New York giants four games to two today the Yankees won the world series twenty seven times\nThe next closest team the St Louis cardinals with eleven this week in Nineteen thirty three the Philadelphia Eagles play their first NFL game and lose the New York giants six to nothing since then they've met hundreds of Seventy three times in New York leading the rivalry eighty six eighty five and two ties\nIncluding last week when by the eagles\nThis week in Nineteen eighty three the Chicago Blackhawks in Toronto maple leafs combined says the fastest five goals in NHL history\nEighty four seconds this week in Nineteen eighty eight and one of the most dramatic moments in baseball history with two outs in the bottom of the night and injured Kirk Gibson hits a dramatic to run home run to give the Dodgers a five four when in the first game ... eighty fifth world series\n[noise]\nAnd this week in Nineteen eighty nine during a game against his old team the evidence in boilers hockey greats Wayne Gretzky breaks greenhouse National Hockey league career scoring record is\nI I mean it it just it wasn't going to be genuine and whether or not you won a contest that no deal and the NFL does genuine just what his genuine what it seemed draft you as their quarterback\nI mean whether or not you feel like you you want to be there you want to go there or not it's irrelevant you're getting that she has to play professional football not see that shows you so that is genuine and so that's where it when you looked at the decision that maybe\n... or ... or the Minnesota Vikings that matter I think each team has essentially don't what was in their best interest I think the Vikings didn't want to have to have a rookie quarterback they like what they got and I think when you look at what the ... of their future I think they're happy with what they have\nA I I also think that people forget ... ... and maybe you don't realize how how cutthroat the businesses it 'cause everyone just assumes you know you're rooting for your favorite team and you've told me stories and stuff that I Would never repeat on the air about just what real life NFL is and what real life relationships with the organizations are\nDanny ... none of the bears on his grandmother is sick with cancer\nAnd she's never seen him play a game\nAnd practice on Saturday they surprised him and they flew his grandma out I'm surprised him at the practice field and Danny to rate them broke down and how does grandma and said I've been in the leaf seven years\nI've never had anybody do anything like this for me from an organizational standpoint in my seven years and I saw that and I thought\nYou know like that never came up like\nIt's it's like that it's ... you're playing for me or are we sign your checks a go go go make us a bunch of tackles and go go to a pro bowl and go into some games\nBut the idea that that the NFL really is such a business I think we know that and we see the contracts that are out there and we get all of it but just from a player standpoint\nYou know them flying his stick grandma which is you know a couple of pennies to the organization meant that much to a guy that just goes to show you how cutthroat up a business the NFL is and you've you've talked about before just\nYou know players not wanting to play late in the year because they're it's a contract year and they don't want to you know give up another sack and have it be brought up in negotiations I don't think that we've really wrap their minds around just how much of a business it really is\nYou know people are are penny pinching and they don't want to give you a certain equipment and all that kind of stuff I mean and that's and that's where it's the little things you know what they're throwing it used jock straps you instead of just giving you your own ... um yeah so that I haven't [laughter]\nWe only have a high um Brady joined us Dr Fox Sports radio as we can be alive and the guy who finished my thoughts

during the points court for the rams we set up thirty three and a half\nThey scored thirty nine and I was kind of ... the money and the only one you guys got correct outside of that one will Jones is
