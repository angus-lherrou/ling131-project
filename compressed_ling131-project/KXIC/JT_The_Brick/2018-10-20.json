how Iowa and Nebraska are road partners\nAnd the in the hunters are going to come in here tomorrow night play [noise] and [noise] is that right yeah that was on a hill so you know a lot of times it's always been the thing we're Iowa volleyball has really been a second thought in the in the referred into scouting process over at the Iowa Nebraska weekend is that still something that's lingering around here you know\nI'm I'm not going to say that it's completely gone because Nebraska and Minnesota when they met a week and a half ago uh in Lincoln was for first place in the Big Ten they're still to chop ten teams I Would definitely getting respect\nBut you still have to make sure when you play back to back like this that you're giving the brass gets do and you may be right there and we may be seeing the golfers looking a little bit past\nBut if I Know head coach you and a assistant coach Matthau and Laura Casey they gave it the respect that need it and we'll see what happens off
