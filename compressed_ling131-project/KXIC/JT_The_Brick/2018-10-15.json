that's false there's actually some good spots for okay good uh well uh but that kind of kills ... so just to go to go along with the joke here and tell me that the food in London is bad the food and one is not good okay\nNothing will set you off like a bad meal right so what's to say\nMaybe they have a uh some fish and chips\nAnd um and they realize that the fish and chips as a matter of fact is like a a rolled up dish rag and uh and like a pretzels that have been sitting out in a pub for three months and the guys are pissed off and Blake morals goes out there any cops on up the defending Super Bowl champions again they should have one\nAnd the Jacksonville Jaguars looking at it as a statement game this is the super bowl that should have happened it should have been out there last year and and not a New England patriots and we lost because of Blake borders owned by the way we haven't had a good damned meal since we were in Jacksonville before he left on the trip I Would think that that is a possibility\nA a a frustrated appetite and a frustrated defensive secondary and and front seven that gets after Blake bottles in London\nPotentially I'll play along all play along and I'll say this okay\nOr even though jak vote goes to to London every year right it's got like a second home for the jaguars um maybe if they go over late you know 'cause I remember I went over the Denver Broncos back in ...\nAnd we went to late so we left Thursday we had ... and all that in the morning that we flew a later that afternoon and so we got in friday morning and then they actually had to stay up\nAnd go to a walk through and cricket field and kind of warm up and go through some things I got to tell you I've never been more tired of my life it was awful ah and then we probably thought our worst on game day I'm so if that scenario plays out\nThen yeah maybe some guys are just cranky and they're exhausted hired they haven't had a good meal even though the store price of good food
