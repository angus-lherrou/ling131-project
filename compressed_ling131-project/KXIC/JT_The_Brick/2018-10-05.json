[laughter] but here's what I'll tell you\nIt as much as I respect brass Stevens and think he is a very good coach this was premature the best coach in basketball is Greg pop of itch pure and simple no doubt about it case closed he's the best coaching basketball\nOr you know what I think for all the the the\nUh you know ... the love affair for for pop I I got some questions to to me Greg pop a bitch has to win another championship without one side you know without a Tim Duncan and without David Roberts Robinson and also\nGrown he had one and we don't we Robinson passed this prime and Duncan passes number but I'm not like they were still it they're hiding there again I\nAlso watch like a few times where he made huge mistakes and you know this cause you saw it a win win or a way Allen hit that three and Tim Duncan wasn't in the\nGame for a rebound you remember that at the end up yeah I mean of course that's\nI mean that you're not perfect among many college and I come home late ...\nThat's ... well not that was the first guess when when Tim Duncan wasn't in the game\nI'm like how could he not being a game ... then you think that yeah I did\nAll those right in there I I get a you want five championships you going to say the greatest coach or how they had a Coby shack cabinet just think that uh Jordan Pippin combination I just think\nThat when you when like again\nWithout having those superstars you know I just think it makes people a\nLawyer you know I mean you ...

I just I\nI I don't think once you start messing with this was in college basketball and you don't play every body and all that I just think you got to be careful or not to make the regular season meaningless and then all of that make more money than me because you'd have\nA if you have a play offs and uh how many teams at sixteen and she had\nAny relevant to sixteen teams are coming from the west you leaving out like like what what was done or the none of that matter I just think that it's cyclical they used to be a time when he's not sick it is just a matter for twenty year was the issues to be ... issues to be better than\nThat was over Twenty years or if it was cyclical it wouldn't be the one who is cyclical and I don't know how this dipole Jordan retired and I will not wearing a Miami one titles Cleveland want to try to use these can win a title but as far as just sheer deaths I Do not have been better for\nThe longest I just said is that in ... you know what I think a western conference teams are better run their front offices are better\nI I don't really go out and I don't know if that's the case whatever I think I'd like I told you before the broad altered the eastern conference and just haven't been able to recover from that and that's part of the problem howdy alter the eastern time while we can we don't have enough time to do that now with one day you're going to read my book about a year\nI here's what I said though it help if they were to guess right of the great too if they were to go one through six team what you have to do first prerequisite for that would be to even out the schedule\nLike you couldn't have I mean 'cause right now\nEven though most teams would still be from the west the west conference teams are playing a better schedule a tougher schedule so it's not even fair I think you have to go to\nEvery team playing every other team essentially three times it couldn't be totally three but you play most teams three times and then you'd have schedules would be similar and you could just take the top sixteen teams\nYou could do that and several I mean sports I I don't I don't feel like that is the need as much in baseball\nFootball obviously the NFC he's been better for a while um but I I feel like is most urgent in the NBA in my opinion\nYeah I'm I I see Eighteen percent sounds about right it's not like it's eighty percent and they really believe that they should do it so um I I think that that's more realistic I don't I don't want them to alter the game too much um and and then the wind up having to fix it again I just like the way that it is and I'm good\nAnd with it I'm fine with it the way it is\nWell imagine if you have the best like last year you could add to Houston and Golden

Mike it's rolling down the Jason show with my car but now let's meet a couple of Yankee fan shall we the first one we are going to be is a guy who was got all kinds of viral attention because of what we've seen over the course of today\nA Yankee fan put on social media video of one of the players from the Yankee game where the Yankees scored runs I I I Can't tell what play it was but Yankee fans are celebrating so it's some kind of a player they score to run last night in your voice triple it kind of in the void triple it could have been judges I could've been anything\nAnd it says in the left field bleachers where you see the video and I pointed out at how about a fresco\nThere's a Yankee fan with a beer in his hand and they're celebrating the play and he just decides to throw a full beer at the A's fan who is in the road below him and to fans oh he just throws the beer at um just because he's an A's fan and\nHe felt like doing that disposable income right there on our number one that's a waste of Fifteen bucks number two you know I I ...\nFor every time I Want to defend the fan base on things things like this happened and this is not just the Yankee thing this mainly when I saw this happen you know and I see the fan and you know what God Bless the A's fan because he turned around obviously knew he was\nOut man out guns out numbered out\nPlanned he was out everything he turned around looked very upset but didn't retaliate probably 'cause he didn't know who did it\nThe AIDS found this guy and they gave him all kinds of they said hey can you help us find this man from last night\nAnd we really want to help them hook 'em up we feel awful with what happened to him in the in the stands last night and they found him through social media people look so oh yeah that's so and so and the guy who lives in New York He's an A's fan you more as a span to the gate a ways Jersey to the game and so the A's or hooking up with tickets in a bunch of swag\nThey got a New York resident named John Spencer they found him dried out John Spencer no not the west wing John Doe that that guy now drive the Oakland native and current New York resident will be sending ... packaging hosting it again next you\nKnow that's awesome as you look like I said there is many things you can say about the Yankee fans and this is a lot of Yankee fans unfortunately [laughter] much so it'd be good at that age that\nI mean that's Yankees but there's others fan bases that have the same thing happened to them it's not just unique to the Yankees it's just everybody that's out here tonight but I Will say this this is the most important thing I learned about where to sit in a baseball game or a football game if you are rooting for the other team do not sit in the bleachers\nIt is not as patrolled as the other areas things get crazy people are together if the it's the cheap seats what's where people get in and want to get in and drink and and and cause problems do not sit in the bleachers if you are wearing the Jersey of\nThe ... that's actually the opposite I don't think they were just ... in the end the you didn't get punched out\nFive guys didn't jumping up and start beating him it was literally ... oh yeah no no no no you go and what you don't have the point is is that when there's probably not a lot of A's fans right there is a critical mass no in terms of having extra security so there is something to what you're saying\nI was in the bleachers Red Sox Yankees there were twenty security guards in my section ready for whatever the hell was going to happen so you you have different events where where it's gonna be patrolled and staffed differently in Chicago certainly there's plenty of security in the bleachers\nLook look I mean there's no point in the bleachers [laughter] look at all the things\nYou see where things happened in in stadiums right when fans get in fights where do they all happen in the bleachers or up really really high near\nThe\nThat's where everything happens in the bleachers or a pioneer top if you're going to go on the other team\nSpend extra money do buy better tickets is that what you're saying sit where it's safer going Marlins fan and hang out with him sit where it's safer don't wear your gear in the bleachers touch it's you're just I'm not saying you're asking for trouble but you're really tempting but you definitely have to be aware of your surroundings\nAnd what's gonna happen in this case you didn't go swinging smart move on his part because even the innocent bystanders might not be so innocent when it's all said and done and if if they start flying but I I don't know I'd I'd say you sit where you're going to sit and where your budget allows you to just keep your head on a swivel\nMeanwhile there's this Yankee fan this video coming to us via bar stool sports this is from a bar in Boston and I think it's last night and\nOf course the red Sox big theme song has been sweet Caroline for a long time right now they do at seventh inning stretch it's a big\nDeal I gotta like his version a little better the live version but you know Neil Diamond is is a class C I Love to Neil Diamond version then it became a pop is nothing that can't loving anymore because I loved it before the red Sox made it they loved it back with beautiful girls was oh she even before that I Love sweet Caroline but now it's\nBecome the red socks on so I got to find something else\nSo this is at a bar there playing sweet Caroline and the voice you're going to hear is a Yankee fan who has it incredibly crazy look on his face almost like what you would expect Michael Meyers face to look like if you ever saw it in Halloween and here's this reaction as he hears sweet Caroline being played at the bar\n[noise]\n\n\nLike I had the devils eyes man again wouldn't play it again I Want to hear to\nGo [noise]\n\nHe doesn't get any time to throw the football now you can get time to throw it down field that's one reason one reason some of it too I think he's a little trigger happy 'cause he doesn't want to get hit\nAnd he's just dumping it off these short passes but part of it is that he just doesn't have time he's one of the quickest really he's getting rid of the ball as fast as just about any quarterback in the league but the past Russia so brutal that he is hard for him to throw it down the field\nNow I get all that and I'm not saying that he has the perfect scenario or that everything's cool or whatever but uh he's long into to the news some issues going on\nA you know with him he's just not as good and I think people have to come to terms with that it's not a one year or one that you have your situation go look at his numbers cross over the last four or five years they've been bad\nSo you can you tell me every year it's always the offensive line I Know they tried to upgrade it this year\nAnd it's not as good a and and I'm not saying\nIt's all on him but the numbers just on there and even for oh PJ to even bring up the can't throw the ball twenty yards and you brought up the numbers what three four twelve and how they just can't get the ball down when you don't get the ball down feel you know what happens the defense doesn't feel like it has to\nHave to respect that they were up close and that's why you struggle because they know balls not going over their heads or going you know what I mean the no question that may have no way so it takes a big part of the game\nAnd it allows you to change defensively and play up closer brain God's closer to the line\nLet me ask you this because you brought up he lives if he won the super bowl and twenty eleven the last six years he's made the playoffs one time one time\nRight so this isn't everybody in New York like the last year they looked at it and said oh oh BJ got hurt the offensive line was horrible we didn't have a running game it wasn't\nEasy lie well it wasn't a one year thing no not when it comes in he law right right and they let me ask you this didn't remember they try to they benched Eli yep\nAnd Gino men killed for it right killed for it in New York and they did an about face and all of a sudden he was the man they're going to build around again did they make a mistake should they have just written it out taking the criticism last year and then drafted a quarterback this\nYeah but they got so much pushback and everybody got sentimental I I I get it Chris when you have a guy who's who's won the super bowl not want to\nAnd with the MVP you know what you Tom Brady you gotta why why's beat the Eighteen into your patriots right I mean you got some cachet in that town and you'll have cache and ...", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "05"}
