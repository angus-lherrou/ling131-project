I was\nI I don't I don't disagree with you on principle about\nThat that he wasn't this great quarterback ... because he really wasn't what I Will say when you're talking about winning the big one and and the and Tom Brady and and the fashion he didn't win like Peyton Manning won his last Super Bowl rod where it was all defensive you do for Ninety yards and looked like\nDustin ... that was done with the catch by a I Can't remember his name although David ... that the one that I have you around with them as\nFar as I'm All right 'cause look at how we got a got free to even make that will run and play and the other one I remember to throw demanding him down the sidelines yes\nRod let me get your opinion on this I Want to move on to another quarterback quickly we got about a minute left it looks like the Tampa Bay buccaneers are given up on James was ... I mean to me you don't start running is Patrick at this point unless you're done with Winston as your future\nDo you think like what do you think the future holds for wins then are you ready to just say okay he's probably just going to be a mediocre quarterback or do you see something there where he still could become a star somewhere\nI'm just going to mention the fat and I think this is as close to being right he's played forty eight he started at forty eight or fifty games he has like Seventy one turnovers\nAs a starting quarterback yeah in forty eight or food [noise]\nMan that is hard to win when your quarterback on a consistent basis is turning the ball over be through interceptions bit too far\nIt's just hard to do and then when you're watching play and you know I Want him I wanted him to do well you just I just don't see the understanding of war he wants to throw in the fine print of defense on a consistent he's he's he's been in the late long enough to understand what differences are\nAnd he should be able to decipher defense and hopefully pick it apart a little bit\nI just don't see that on a consistent basis he might have one or two games you might have three good game but every player that plays in this league on a consistent basis especially as a starter they have these in game yeah uh I just don't think I just don't think he is Wanda position\nOutright and tap and then when you when you watch you know the bearded wander in\nAnd even though he's a journeyman he he knows where he wants to throw the ball and then you know he's one of those hot and cold guys yeah when he's hot hot when it's cold he's coal\nI ride well thanks a lot for the knowledge man we really appreciate it and uh we will talk to you next week\n... absolutely where we can ... will pick up on this uh this he like\nI Know it's a really a Robin I've had this does in and and I I'm with you but I just know how New York is an ... I've been in New York and I know it's not I've been influenced by my mostly as New York 'cause Jim Plunkett there's no ... there's no battle cry\nFor Jim point but the holiday season too late\nBut it but the other one is seriously and I know we're gonna let you go ... will be here all night [laughter] but but I always say anybody can win one if you would have won one Super Bowl then there's no way is\nWhen you went with but what about plug it but it's when you went to I always say that's all it was a Super Bowl I I I don't know what I don't know why he's not a hall of fame would too but it wasn't that good during the regular what did he MVP on both Superbowl did he do game winning touchdown too when I don't know all of us don't do it for me this\nIs my this is my only problem with or the argument of Super Bowl because this is the ultimate team sport I always say that the best quarterback that ever face to face fourteen hall of fame quarterback or going to be hall of fame quarterback Dan Marino who never won a Super Bowl of the best quarterback will face\nSo I I don't think you can always judge\nWinning the super bowl was saying this guy should he's in a ... player because he won the super bowl\nJust now you know I guess my God yeah I Know that's why there's or yellow one he's ever said more maybe we will never wore a robotic this Saturday Night live\nOur fellow\nI as you heard Rob ... thinks he knows better than a hall of famer neck the first bringing them cars for the latest in sports that hey you gotta when it's about when you do have to land where do you why do you think Deborah do you live in the hall of famer\nAh [noise] I\nI think you'd have to because he won two Super Bowls with New York and it'd be great and why ... I think he is I mean he doesn't feel like a hall of famer but those two games right there say he is I Know right I mean it's going to get it and it it feels I Know I Know you feel more like a hall of grades rather than a hall of fame or you know what I mean\nI mean he had such there's no doubt that those were two tremendous Superbowl victories is gonna be interesting I and I think the New York factor is a huge I looked at a time when they let us stop\nInterim no no no you're fine but ... and we you guys had mentioned it and obviously we talked last to update about Josh Gordon supposedly according to NFL Network was going to be missing about a quarter of the ... and I\nAre because he was late for a team activity on Sunday still haven't seen anything from an Rapaport who initiated that report he started the game they exactly I Know in fact he dropped a deep assets that could have picked the first down that ended up on a three and out for for ... the first\nDr phil and I believe he is he was in just a second ago too but the game a scoreless nonetheless of the patriots are down inside the twenty right now so scoreless six forty three to go in the first quarter at Buffalo Bills are the ones who are playing the patriots and I\nTry not to bill's winning if you're going to look at it and warm and almost exactly\nExactly and if anybody's wondering I've had people saying here's the quarterback for the bill his Derek ... and you know knowing what it is yes the lions are dangling receiver I golden Tate is trained ... Detroit reportedly is asking for mid round pick\nFor trade for really they don't ... well I think they they want to pick up some other pieces so I don't know they need to round out a couple of other position so\nI don't know if they feel like they're sets and again that also is NFL media so generally you can count on\nAnd but when you see things like ... not going to play and then he shows up in the starting lineup\nUm buccaneers bench Seamus Winston in favor of Ryan Fitzpatrick for their week nine match up against Carolina\nFrom sees investor rookies under the ... program has especially tools unique deposit required getting his own auto zone\nNo marquee names for the raptors in the ... on it a combo right now ... thirty to twenty six lead over the raptors late first quarter patience with a sixty three sixty one holy over the trailblazers for to go in the third\nAnd the hawks are at the Sixers Philly up by ten at sixty and the second quarter guy\nAll right ... thank you thanks Debbie the odd couple Chris Broussard rap Parker we're coming you live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in your car insurance were guy go go to guy co dot com or call a hundred nine four seven eight you'd see all the only hard part is figuring out which way\nIs easier Rob we going to give you the floor\nDoes your ... disagreeing with the hall of famer uh you got about a minute to sell us or you are ...\nI'm just it's not that I think and and I just said the same thing to to Rob Woodson Philip Rivers go look at his numbers rose Fifteen Years one you anything tremendous in a regular men just regular seasons and I just think and it's no not\nFill up what it's about winning a title it's about winning something right that's the ultimate\nHe didn't win it just once he wanted twice he peaked at Eighteen in old patriots team what Randy Moss Tom Brady with all the unbelievable numbers and everything that went on course why it was a tremendous year\nThey won on the road they won in Green Bay go look at the the the two playoff rounds you had there were they were really really good and\nIt wasn't like he had a great deep beds and he didn't have to do anything right he had to make big roles and bring them back to windows games right Tom Brady bumped way to do it through a touchdown to Randy Moss to give them the lead and then what to do to David ... read it set up a for a lot to do to a\n...

than Boston we we challenge you to find that in college I let's go to\nJoe and West Virginia you don't see Boston is titled town huh well\nI mean if you want to talk I asked him gifts\nFrom the time I don't know spoke started uncle well [laughter] going out there which I don't know how many titles forms of one and I know the pirates of going out one or two World Series that you know John\n... deal

yeah well the guy lobster up there so they are smart [laughter] [noise]\nYeah you know what used to be at one point in time titled town for the NFL Green Bay oh you're a Green Bay Wisconsin now much recently though is the guns idol that's a good segue Chris like like I'm not used to this like you know we'd like I'm doing right now I'm Better at this is unbelievable to me\nThey got one title in the ten years that Aaron Rodgers started and less throwing Brett Brett Farr what for one more they got two titles two Super Bowls and torn with two of the all time great\nQuarterbacks that we've seen or they letting they letting these guys there I mean so far he let them\nDown a lot too because he through so many ... wives so there's not a neck you know 'cause I was always the playoff games with a pact with wood and were Brett Farr build across his body right and do the bad pet right that's that's how the players always end what we're bringing this\nUp because yesterday in what has become just too much of a recurring theme\nSome of air Rogers teammates let him down and hide Montgomery Rob ... it's not only that he fumbled at the ... near the end\nOf the game to deny air rises the chance they're down to right before to too many have been able to move on and play with him down all the ... there's no question\nAnd Mike mccarthy told him to take me lead it'd be a ... and let's start at the twenty five\nYard line and let out and we'll do is wedding what air rises would've moved him down and that would have been a huge when you reach the rams\nWere undefeated in LA yeah it would've been such a confidence boost for for the\nPackers and beyond that I Know it's still relatively early but the Packers are fighting for their playoff life no doubt and they can't afford to give away game but but what\nYou just said is is this is what happens for whatever reason I must say that Aaron Rodgers on last of the games but seems like teammates do like a ... in that situation you're told\nJust kneeled down yup and we'll get the ball the twenty focused on it I remember twenty Fifteen NFC championship games you know Seattle lead the ball back to go to doing on site kick\nThe play was drawn to you know as soon as going to catch the ball you just block young not joining Nelson is going to catch the ball the most shore handed receiver on the team\nOn psychic comes and they're tied in Brandon Bostic\n... I mean George standing right behind them and he touches the ball Seattle got back tied the game and one overtime a cost of a trip to the super bowl had Jody caught that ball quest to go to the soup does another jumbled up was wasted yeah they're really ... with Aaron Rodgers had a chance the\nMarry again against the avalanche two thousand twelve remember Golden State catches the the Hail Mary pass from Russell Wilson the replacement rough that got the deal\nJust been such an embarrassment lately\nThat we can get and show up to New England a few weeks ago\nNo no they knew my agent bad they showed a bad they didn't show me showing up since then [laughter]\nOh hi so I think the caller's agree with me that Boston is titled the end look Rob I'm not trying to make Boston titles now it just is what it is but last caller said Miami and of course LeBron James brought them to titles LeBron is playing the night he and the Lakers are at Minnesota\nI think it's a one point lead over the timber wolves the Lakers are leading ... brunch struggling tonight huh well he's got fourteen points or how many ... shots\nI bet you hadn't had a lot of shot I'm going to say look it up seven but ah what what what\nYou try and get it no I'm just trying to you know me I'm all in\nDonald fourteen selfish because that was the only point to where ever you know Seventeen points for that on this this ...\nYou say that like 'cause you never know what you were saying that twenty two points on twenty two shots does well for you and it showed a fifty percent\nEscort twenty two boys one twenty two shots\nIf you ... ... were twenty two to twenty two boys if they're all two pointers no but that's not what you do expect what a guy gets one but I'm I'm just saying like that's not a bad night eleven for twenty two twenty two usually takes you a shot to get a point if you shoot I'm just you ask him from the floor\nThat's a good night you know at\nTwenty chalk on a map they teach you in Detroit I don't I don't know [laughter] I Will you to use my fingers but I couldn't always get their\n... but liberal outlook so your point\nLeBron James is not off to a LeBron James start this season he's too busy doing a movie stuff in the rye wanting to be Meryl Streep on my own party like night time\nWell you got to hear for four more years to live in LA and then I'll change\nBut he look if you 'cause I threw out look this year might be the year\nThat the question is legitimately asked is what Brian James do the best player in where what you're talking about Chris what are you saying no I'm just saying right\nNow if he keeps land like this and not playing\nBad he's playing like a in all pro player\nTwenty seven points nine rebounds I Believe eight us this we still putting up nice numbers but he has not been the best player in the league it's early I'm not ready to make a definitive statement but do you think he's still the best way in the world\nKevin to read did something the other night at Madison Square garden that caught everybody's attention would you agree with the Knicks in a game that was close\nUp to three ... and ... you out scored them\nNow maybe that's the nix the Knicks no no to that but that's still in the process and they should be playing in the Big East you know what I mean they have used ...

can't leave ... Thompson and see if you can get to Seventy Seventy five\nI mean that's something that then the entire world is going how many points can you get 'cause every especially now\nSee for scoring not just the words of scoring one thirty one forty defense is just gone out the window this year and it's like I Want to see something you know I think the other teams would understand if this guy's got going on and he's shooting that he's still shooting and this is something huge big for the game if we see if a guy can go for sixty sixty five Seventy point yeah\nI I think you to pieces the fans and the outsiders more so than even the clay Thompson or certainly the guys on that team even though you see him roar rolling and you're like oh we want to leave a man you're torn because one hey I've got to go back and do this again I mean we've got eighty two of these and then we have the ones that\nCounts so it was like you know after a while you're like a I get\nBuckets that get buckets but um do you always want to go out there and the quest of setting records because\nHey we all know how this game is so fickle things can in fast and drastically for a guy who chased in the wrong things not necessarily the endgame so I think as a collective\nThey just they just pick straws like ... like my night then it's like step but my turn and it causes your turn and look when when they've had his night what was it a couple of days ago he didn't play the fourth quarter so\nIt's just the way it goes you got if you're lighten it up you've got three quarters delighted up their society has\nSaid Marcellus what this is all about us being you're doing the show Dr right while they're on so right I Want to see history [laughter] every fan wants to ... but of course but also remember the warriors went after the bulls got their Seventy three and then walk ... you know there are a number of stats and then I\nThink what we were talking about the tea in and we all know the stats on players suddenly rupture and very dry hey man what like tempt fate\nImagine that headline I mean this is parallel to the time and gum rehab law which do you make a decision in the right spirit to do the right thing but if it doesn't go right we're all going to bring you hell you imagine ... Thompson is out there trying to make his fifteenth three pointer\nIn the middle of the four corner landscaper ... oh my God I only want to show more than ... says hey I'll give you five hundred second run at yeah yeah the layers your bonus I'll pay you're fine I'm tired of this go get enough of this record and his record right now\nShe brought the Montgomery thing from yesterday with the rams and and that to me that's a different time a gun Murray was pissed off that they took him out of the game and he was mad on the sidelines that he was stalking around\nAnd the reason he ran the ball out of the end zone on a play where he wound up fumbling and the rams are able to kill the clock and win the game is because it was one of those sources in Phoenix on the sidelines say oh screw you want me to just need you want me just catch the ball in the ... in the end zone I'm going to run it out and and that's the kind of ... and I\nCan you put back on the field after that I mean he disobeyed that and you lose the game Mike mccarthy\nDidn't go where the teammates went and I don't know what color jerseys anonymous teammates we're\nKnown as the element of you got like ... if you're going to say my name yeah say\nYour name that's what caused that always say names and numbers so none of his teammates or say what your chest or be quiet Mike mccarthy went there now maybe he's taken the high road to protect the team as a whole but he said\nTime a gum rehab a decision to make so that doesn't sound like it's a directive doesn't sound like look black or white\nHe sounded like a respect the clock respect when you catch the ball and then make the the right choice and I think in those moments\nWhen you're not giving the guy mandate you leave it up for interpretation of the he was like I could have a winning moment I played a lot of football the coliseum I went to Stanford we used to beat up on us the I feel that I had three kick returns in college I got mo Jo right here and he tried to go out there and make when they play just didn't work out\nFox Sports radio the Jason Smith show with ... friend my comment andme other best friend or sell us why because you know not many people you know give me a Joe named matures yeah Mike where many of them are in your title\nI fed him alive [laughter] okay we've we've been doing this show a while now I fed him a lot of money or your boat it over to oh hey look I cook\nIn your in your book is there about all you're going to the Jersey finished you had when you were younger all the churches that you bought a ... on the cutting room floor that's all that that didn't make it and why do a lot of Jersey swap too did you know and that way it was a weird thing man I don't know if you remember that Mitch ness crazed\nHer yeah oh yeah and everybody especially players had to have all the jerseys and then I disagree with the ... that starts adding up in a hurry brother love\nYou and we were just mindless to it just because I wanted to show up with one you didn't have so every day when we showed up for me it was like\nOh he's still Mitchell [laughter] minutes and that's what it was so everyone had these plug in\nProbably about the same plug is playing all of us but it's just like oh I got I got two and then it will like I'm wearing Jersey the people I've never heard of I don't know if he is good or not all of the hall of fame or not I'll give a damn nice colors right and I'm wearing them and then you look up one day when the fat\nBecause what happened is crucial boulevard and other places started to have the knock on you know like five dollars on crucial or spent four hundred image on us and then we were like why are we spending four hundred and then you stop wearing them and to you\nOf African Americans is completely different from that a white Americans and at black athletes\nAre because they dominate sports they are the most powerful most loved ah most irreplaceable\nAfrican Americans in this country when LeBron James could do if he knelt down during the anthem like a ... some people of course might not like it but he certainly wouldn't be black ball\nAnd the league wouldn't do anything about it even though it's their rule you have to say and what we do it's still\nNot saying I'm Still upset that the players agreed to that right but I I Am\nBut you get when I'm saying like they have they they are love because sports is so big in this country they are loved by all races of people in America but they have a cloud to speak up they're irreplaceable\nRight but it doesn't mean that they wouldn't be pushed back I mean it still be pushed back\nBut I Know they're going to push back but it's it might might push back but it's not going to be getting rid of no one can find a white LeBron James\nNo but you can't the same thing and and the play it's a it's about ... on a different plateau right than than or a colon Capra Nick and this is my second soup or is it are not the colon Capra Nick coming off the super bowl appearance with the forty niners it would be totally Ryan would you agree with\nThat well that's why I that are in immediately when he began kneeling\nI felt it was more courageous doubt about it because he was he was really wasn't the cut him he was coming off the light they could've cut him and nobody would have thought twice about it I I actually gave him\nMore I'd ... curry but I didn't either way I think you're right from the standpoint that too often\nIn the black community or people who are quote unquote made it or been like stars or whatever have turned their back on the black community yup and assimilated more so and you know the famous oj I'm not black I'm O. J. O. J. was much just face it was one\nOf the other guy and him as a running back but he was a complete fill out the ...\nAnd so that that's where a lot of that came from and and as much as we talk about Michael Jordan what a great player was Michael Moore no part of\nOf any kind of controversy and and I know he never said it is like a you know a\nOne of those ah what is it it's called the ... urban legend that he said Republicans buy sneakers too I guess he never really said that but that was what he would say that within the last ... of it yes 'cause he wouldn't go to a a a rally or dinner for a guy was wanted against Jesse Helms in North Carolina\nHere's the thing no I'd say about Michael job because he right he does get this rap if he didn't want to speak out and he didn't speak out however there's different ways of getting a cat\nHim becoming the first African American owner in the national Basketball Association that's you know we need like we need that type of powers not just about speaking\nOut and you know challenging the man if you will but I also about creating business opportune I get that and and all that well he's done that\nBut what does the same you you would know better than on a Bible for for ... much who is given much is as much as require require much is given much is required and and and that's all and I'm not saying he has to get on a soapbox for every issue but there are issues that might do preaching my you'd like if I could have done a couple of things and even\nIf you remember early tiger's first commercial was Nike was about golf courses that wouldn't allow him the way yeah so he he they got to him and an altered his corps right but the right to know Tiger Woods was more about\nThat social issue and I'll always remember the one that I always thought that tiger should have stood up for what's the one where they didn't allow women members at Augusta right and that's where we're not going to get up and stand up with a Tiger Woods would have said\nIf you guys all going to allow women to play here right be members here yeah then I'm not going to play at Augusta again he would have been able to alter yeah because it was no golf without tiger back then rush and the tigers said he wouldn't play there till except the female members I guarantee you know question they would have taken female member\nNo of course and and that's how we can make a strong argument\nThat black athletes have done as much as we can make an argument that they did more for the civil rights movement\nThen our civil rights activist because they were so but love they said they endeared themselves to all of America because of their great sports ability and that changed a lot of use of people just because they were such great athletes is that a couple of Fox Sports radio keep it locked\n[noise]", "show_name": "JT The Brick", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "30"}
