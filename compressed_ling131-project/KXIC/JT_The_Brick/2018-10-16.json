maybe you can keep me on long enough that I can that can smack down a little bit beyond a a on Tom Brady\nFan but anyway I\nHave you on the ground deserves to get paid and it's not I don't think for one second that he's turning down to ... billion dollars\nThis guy has been franchise for two years in a row yes and he's given up if he would have signed a long term contracts two years ago and gotten paid more where a lot more than two million dollars a year to hit him in his career is\nThat right now more or nor do you mean to more than I was a you know but more you do right now he leaves last five to six million already not to\nBlame for on the franchise like when he turned down was fourteen million be sixteen million I'm saying is if he would have got two years ago I wouldn't have to worry about getting injured and yeah it would have had a long term contracts pets were played him two years ago\nI had more let me tell you you are so right in that you should pay people who produce this guy's not liberated normally wouldn't lose nothing\nAnd forget about franchised because the franchise pay was nothing but an owner's one of them are squeezing the player\nYeah I agree with you on that it exists hey what did I suppose that don't know I got more right more good give me your take on the Tom Brady real quick\nTom Brady some voices my home now you take a look and you think of sugar and you think of Mohammed Ali there were boxers\nWhen these guys went into a room against the young puncture who won and the whole thing is my home is right now is a young puncture and when you watch that two minute and drill yesterday\nYou saw a boxer go and take a young kid to school now will homes might very well learn\nAnd I I'm not ... won't but right now Tom Brady is a ... class boxer who everything to him is in slow motion everything or snap sort of completion it's been slow mo for him because he's a boxer he knows what's happening before it happened\nAll right thanks but we we should you listen thanks for calling from Ontario\nAh let's go to Nick in Seattle you on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio what's up Nick\nHey guys just real quick on the levee on bell stuff you know sure the owners have more than enough money to pay these guys but what I just wanted to point out as you can only pay so many guys and when you give them more money\nYou're gonna just hamstring yourself at other positions and kind of the prime example of that as a team to do really well when their quarterback on there a rookie contracts right you look at Seattle Russell Wilson with every side of the athletic guys go\nMe the golf at West right now on their record deal in the team's doing really well but they thought for big money they'll have to make some decisions and so sign I Love you know more about\nYou know look at long term than it is about the owners have enough money though\nYeah but the only problem I have what it is made up a number of why they don't want to pay people do you know what I mean like if you really want to pay people you could still pay them and that's what a CPA I have a problem with the whole thing\nYou have a problem for the whole it's a full system\nIt's the only system than and all that means is that they don't want to spend a certain amount of money but we appreciate that call Nick thanks\nI Don in Texas Welcome to the odd couple\n... thanks for taking my call a couple of you guys are on\nA buddy\nOr no you won't like me\nI'm kind of you know it's All right I dropped out now the only one of the hammer on me I'm listening to head buddy\n[laughter] uh

the New York jets and Fenway wow wow\nDo I go ahead\nAnyway the whole thing I Love the guy you write down the stairs people when we play against the Steelers he just he's a great brought him back the only problem is\nWe've got money is going so much in sports right now that the bottom have to follow you know it's got to that just got to be a strong it's going to break the camel's back\nAnd and the owners can't just keep charging more tickets war for fear than dollar hotdogs you can't just keep making people pay 'cause it but it's going to be\nSo obviously running back look at the patriots the patriots have you know they they they've given up running back\nBut they always filled and lay be unbalanced pricing themselves right out of the ... he's not in a a dollar a buyer's market right now\nWell it's all going to prove you know going forward let's see if he indeed\n'cause I've said look I don't like given up five to six maybe seven million dollars this season that he may give up but

hundreds on enough Cody bell injures up\nTwo outs so ah and Turner is in school and position on second so\nUh but but there's a strike out and ... villagers struck out and the brewers get out of it they go to the top of the seven\nAt Dodger Stadium and the brewers to hold onto a two not the lead and they scored their second run on a a I don't know if it was scored a wall pitch or pass ball looked like it was ... because it bounced in front of the catcher and when you're outside but you got to look at this and go wow you know like\nOkay let's go to Wal pitch the Dodgers got nine out I mean\nThis would be a blow you come back home you what a dramatic game to write in Milwaukee tourist to run home on the Chris and you say to yourself the crowds all pumped up Dodgers back home and who

to conclude oh there will now it yeah no it's not I mean is when you're right it would be a blow because the Dodgers have been feeling really good about themselves I think the moment um affects the fans\nAllow a player you go up and down do you feel great one right and it affects it it's amazing what sports does to people\n'cause you could see the difference people bouncy or when the team when they come into work the next day\nAnd they're all thrilled and then there's other day they'll like so down and out yes like what's what's wrong out at Dodgers last night did you see that game you know

Arizona but for touchdowns for interceptions moves well in the pocket you got good running game going against Green Bay and green based defense has nothing to write home about right it was like oh there's great personnel a brother and I were chatting about it a little bit earlier\nThat claim that use and and we've talked about this on air he's got that reputation now forget about the\nThe madness over the past year or whatever else he's on that reputation part of his career to where he's not quite the claim that he was he once was and we acquainted with our Chicago roots don't jump Ryan or lack in his final couple of years hall of famer\nWhen he was still getting credit for a lot of stuff he couldn't do anymore and I think ... it's it's not quite Matthews that he was still there he's still on the field but he's not the disruptive force he was you know they have a lot of pressure coming up that there's been able to sit back\nAnd because of the good first down Ron yard is that they'd been garnering he's been able to sit back in the pocket and make big plays down field and he's finding good would try to keep it up within what I Want you're not doing it again\nI mean look these I mean he's making some nice throws but\nThere's a place where mark he's good with his five yards away ... but that's what he always had and they just couldn't throwing the ball no there's no ... yeah and he's got a strong arm and look that's there I'm not saying that they're suddenly is oh why did you go get Jimmy gr up but that there is one of those very good backups he's the guy was a third round pick\nThis this is not a guy who just oh hey we're we're throwing them out there and and and we don't know how good is going to be no he has flashing he is definitely someone that can move the team down the field\nIf if you have CJ method as your backup quarterback your feeling pretty good\nHe he has made a throw off his back put to good went over the middle flash forward it got there in a side\nArm exact I mean not that that was great mechanics because your clothes off but it still is able to take a step back and and drill ... go to the middle against the blacks nine of ten a hundred and eighty five yards into school and he's he is a very functional quarterback and you know what I like about him is that he\nGoes down field he's not a guy that's going to say okay I I don't want to take a chance I worried about turning the ball over the guy's got a lot of\nGuts so long term I Know we're the ... for the rest of the season but he's obviously\nGoing to play the rest of this year you're going to see him grow we continue to be a good quarterback and now here he is he's going to have this third game of near or more than three hundred yards in a row because he's having that kind of night tonight and suddenly or they're not as you're thinking\nHey we had a pretty good quarterback situation after ... not for real or you know ... suddenly you could be going into next year the quarterback controversy just thinking about that oh my God I didn't want her back out of runners right\nChip if nothing else\nI mean a ... overrated right to that to oh sorry I didn't I don't think\nAgainst what he said no I'm Sorry forty niners just ran a beautiful way rather than in motion a and you saw claim after you just run right out of the screen\nYou know clay Mathis then again I

wasn't really hammering at home on syndication going out you can't miss it I mean friends everywhere yeah it's on it's on CBS it's on TNT I think it's on at best one I think it's going to be on after the game tonight but like the last couple of years I'm friends with just so I'm like\nOh friends it's just kinda just okay it exists on the characters and they're giving the same kind of punch line that the writing is not any better the situations are not any different and the the character's rely on their personality for you to laugh at them and that's kind of work like that these ... personality of the claim that the sack\nDancing his hair and I'm Upset 'cause I Can't cite the quarterback and what's gonna happen and that that's really where ... is right now it's it\nMay expose him

can out\nAgainst perfect for his elbow Antonio Brown had in the third quarter of the Steelers when on Sunday many players want him suspended that to me is the big question how are you going to take a look at what you're doing to defensive players when they hit quarterbacks\nAnd then here's want as perfect with dirty hit after dirty it after dirty at we get into this coming up in one minute with my Herrera Fox Sports NFL rules expert former VP of officiating and the national football league but first let's find out what's wrong with the cars in DC well\nYes the brewers have extended their lead RC is to run home run\nHas that day for nothing lead now from Milwaukee over the Dodgers there in the bottom of the eighth inning in game three of the national league championship series there at Chavez Ravine can I add the game of course is game three series is even at one game of peace and all the forty niners taking on the Packers Atlanta\nAt the center ...\nWas it the far side\nHoarding on er [noise]\nSecond time the first half\nBack hard to ask\nThan ... members good Thirteen and Seventeen two hundred twenty nine yards to touch downs that was the niners radio network and the Packers fans you'll be happy to know that Mason Crosby is making field goals once again\nTamil tonight already great news as quickly you can save money switch to a guy go get a guy called ... dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance by the way did I give the score twenty seven twenty three forty niners leaving the Packers\nAt the end of the third quarter finally guys the Fox for a mass police have arrested at Twenty one year old man and charged him with disorderly conduct and throwing an object at a sporting event after the culprit allegedly true a beer at chiefs receiver tiring hill last night uh July stadium\nPatriots have already banned the fan for life from the stadium and hail and his age injure Rosen house one of the books on this guy just to emphasize how seriously they are taking player safety\nBut you do see that live from the guy goes studios the Jason Smith show with my Carmen go tobacco dot com and see how much you can save on auto insurance right now joining us\nNow on the hotline you can follow him on Twitter at my career a former veep eve officiating and the NFL rules analyst a box and Mike we have no shortage of topics tonight and I feel like as the day went along like well here's another one from Ike and here's another one it's like you're you're backed up right now [noise]\nWhy I just hope I can remember all of these guys man I never\nIt's all you want there's never been a shortage of the things to talk about that's for sure\nIt's good for business by schemes those checks coming right well let us keep me a job I keep employees\nOf all the official told everything will be no need for so let's start with Emanuel Sanders yesterday and the big um an sportsman like conduct penalty catches what he believes the touchdown pass kind of points at the ... and he gets flagged front sportsmen like conduct was that a white flag to to to throw or is that something you got to keep in your pocket\nNo no it is the right by the throat because of the point I think if if\nYou want to say something and you walk toward the guy you're you're gonna be okay unless you get right into his face or almost make contact with a helmet but\nIf you point going at him and yelling at him it's the same as if you're headed into the end zone and you turn and others defender behind you that's taunting it's still point that got um the trouble that really took away a touchdown\nActually then became a Fifteen yard penalty after the reversal and though it was a a costly point that's for sure but that's the only thing I Would say the players say if if you're excited and you want to say something to the other so your opponents say it\nBut don't make a gesture don't point that I'm not going to get your like every time\nSomebody one of the other players a frequent are rules in infraction participant Montana's perfect at it once again comes off to the suspension\nAnd now he's doing flying Elmo smashes to defend it or to Antonio Brown already wrapped up on his way to do a ground uh nothing called on the field how hard is the lead them down and when are we going to see protections employers that our quarterbacks in the same fashion\nWell this is a tough one for the league because of the history I mean and and ... and I've seen this happened before you take away the history\nYou know when you look at that play and it's a minimum a minimum bar but because it's perfect with what he's gone through and what he's done this is certainly not one of his most egregious it ... it is a defense was player who was being wrapped up\nSo you do have the you know the element of the foul with the you know with or to the head but\nI I don't really see the league doing much of anything I mean I I I think they recognize the history but they also look at how like rent is the act and I I think of it to anybody but perfect if we all look at that we think it's not that like we say yeah that looked like it could be a while\nBut I don't think he's going to overreact just because it is a perfect so fine probably yes but anything beyond that though\nYou know the thing is ... and this is what kind of\nMakes me feel like you know my faith in humanity is restored a little bit Mike is that when plays like this happen or when when players hit the quarterback and they get called and they get fined\nOr the TJ what the the phantom grab at the at the at the legs of of Matt Ryan a week ago is that I really thought there'd be some kind of all out revolt at this point we're going to be the way for the season in defense of players are beside themselves but still they've they've carried themselves in a classy way and just continue to ask questions\nAnd I you know makes me feel like okay like I said a little bit of my faith in humanity is restored\nWell I'd be I'd be done asking questions when it comes to the quarterback though I mean\nI think that we've talked about this before the needle has gone so far to protect the quarterback but you know the push the Porsche after the release of the past has become\nA foul and when you're talking about that watch it on Ryan I mean it maybe you could see there's elements to are found there is enough that we should be twenty thousand dollars for that I really don't really don't think there is\nYou know that we talked about this at the studios day you know you've got John Runyan is basically the one that um you know going out these fine and he's probably still a little pissed off because we find him so many\nTimes and now he wants\nTo take it out and finding some of the other players with a guy that we used to uh send up a lot of plays with him picked employers awful piles as an officer lineman but\nA ... and you heard about the players association now get involved and wanting to know about\nYou know the firing on what or what really seem like it almost wasn't even a towel on rye and so\nI I think the frustration starting to build but you're right I mean I think they've done a\nPretty good job of saying hey you know we're trying to understand this and and you know and I take a look at you know everybody's talking about how great the game is right now how great it's fantastic well they'll points are up the touchdowns are up the plays or a\nPort defensive guys don't have a damn chance\n[laughter] forest\nRanger there's the summary statement NFL twenty ha baseball it's three outcomes football the defenders don't have a damn chance\nWe won't my ... and we're gonna put down a T shirts bike or will make sure that you get caught by sports radio Jason said she was my comment when the guy goes studios former vice president of officiating and the NFL's current rules analyst over at Fox Sports find him on Twitter at my prayer and you can\nSee the latest ah he and be bland dino going through the the calls this week called last call\nWith my ... find that on his Twitter account at my prayers\nSo Mike what are the other players from last night's game we we saw the scoring really off the charts patriots and she's just like we thought we would and then some of the play that really making the rounds what we're talking about that Neal player Mr speaks\nAnd well speech he did a about the Tom Brady play like that or as he\nWas drifting towards the end zone a potential uh sac\nAnd says quote I let him go because I thought the ball is gone now I thought his body momentum took it away from being a sack but that's just me I in in places like that this is the first one and this was the doomsday scenario that Schmidt's been talking about for six weeks\nSo as it official you know you're you're watching that I mean how close is that two wary you'd be looking if you had released in my hands around him you know we get back into the quarterback call here\nListen to a you know ... and I've heard this excuse used before and that's what this as an excuse to me I mean\nHe didn't make the play and and there's nobody that said that you can't pack or quarterback my God you can you can just grab and hold them and get that in the grass call so the fact that he says that he let him go because he didn't know of the past it was released them\nI'm like you I watch it a bunch of times that's a big body going to a different direction and um and it's not easy to hold on to anybody even if it's not the most mobile quarterback like ... is not so\nI kinda look at those and say okay we're having a tough enough time\nTrying to get what is wrong in the past or what is not I think we're getting better especially when it comes to land and on top of the quarterback with all of your body weight\nBut to go where he went um you know Mr Speaker spoken um I think he gave one of the all time great cause for not making a football play by it\nO W getting low on the odd couple by\nLed led he's made some of those nasty cold isn't Cincinnati [laughter] for the\nCall a seven seven Ninety nine or Fox if you want to weigh in on the LeBron James and why it seems like a lot of players are avoiding playing with him let's go to Andrew in Las Vegas Andrew welcome to the AQAP all\nHey what's up got a Rob I Love everything about you man you also smoked\nA mini talked truth man oh ... ... what do you you were robbed no we don't we don't just you know we're in the morning where you at all I I liked\nI liked the way you put the blackout lead in a good like I like that man and and everything I've been following this guy for years man all went back to the week ESPN or whatever but that but this year there yeah

say about match for the Lakers how big of a Lakers the process that he's not back on the run up okay if you are right you want to be prepared to go you got to come along\nWell hold on I don't know if you want to be considered the gold you have to come through Los Angeles that's not true\nWho's going to go home Michael Jordan is considered the gold did he play in Los Angeles oh let me ask fan or all of that so does the plane is Andrew who's considered to go\nIn there won't be considered the guy or you just talking about big men is that what you mean man rod now you you just threw him a bone\nMan alright\nAndrew good job of peace Diego in Washington Welcome to the odd couple\nGuys it's a I wanted this girl quick one last caller so I thought it was the one that was too cool for school and I thought raw Parker was the best debate or how he ... he's always been really good at how he breaks on a date and kind of the people at their own day\nI'm like you are\nAlso a so ... so I think it's more I don't know so I think it's a little bit of leadership thing I don't know uh I don't know how strong are like why like why is it that like sometimes you kind of um go jak on other people when things are kind of going around really great player a really thing like oh\nYou mean like the passive aggressive tweet and stuff like yeah yeah I just\nKinda like it's not only at leader dislike kick everything is leader but then he also demands the bathroom everyone around them and I don't know if it's a generational thing are maybe this generation that doesn't like that kind of aggressiveness that that he wants to use the ... the best 'cause he's getting to the\nMobile Diego I I I hear that people always use that as an excuse while those guys don't want to play 'cause ... the demands of Muslim you\nWhat the other problem is it's always somebody else's fault that just does and that's the part I think that people don't like that sometimes it's just you just lost it's nobody's fault just didn't the other team play better\nFare and it is ... brown is now there are times when he does seem to kind of put in different ways passive aggressive put it on his teammates that's the one but not always now is the media saying he doesn't have enough ...\nBut I'm just saying sometimes we'll bond dog and then it has\nBecome the narrative you're right we we got a one more call me going wiring or in Mike from LA you're on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio real quick\nAnd what's going on\nI was just calling just because I was just my perception is that nobody wants to say because there's so many mothers out there nobody wants to come out and say that but both on the side of his career you know nobody is uh\nYou make your ... years or he doesn't seem to be showing it planned wise\nOr because you look at his first poised to a certain point they're not as great I mean it goes out you'll score like twenty five point in the first time that all of a sudden you'll finish the game with thirty points that people say oh he's got a great game\nNot at All right yeah okay well I mean it will it breaks down a season he look great in the ... the the odd couple Fox
