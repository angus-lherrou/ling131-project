as doubting since July third forty six pitches for Josh hater so that's got to be a form and the brewers are going to have somebody else for the eighth and ninth here's the big thing is you have a very\nDaunting scheduled the rest of this series you play I Believe it's seven games and nine days right that's what it is potentially mhm and how often can you go to your bullpen for seven innings at night you know you play today Josh hater is going to be unavailable tomorrow\nThen I I you know there's no chance case the motion is eat thrown at any outing all year\nHe'll be unavailable tomorrow eventually you like to think well I'll win the game and worry about tomorrow tomorrow and there's nothing you can do about it because it's not like Craig council has all these other\nOptions saying I'll just going to do this but that's the one thing that might that would stop as if you think after ... won the series really pills to Milwaukee because they've beaten Clayton Kurdish all ready and and and they're off to the races is that this is going to be hard as the series gets deeper\nMilwaukee's bullpen will get more and more vulnerable because when you have guys when you have guys pitching seven innings tonight\nThat's going to be a lot you got to hope that a hero comes in and pictures five innings at some point and that may or may not happen like I said hater your best reliever is now done he's not able pitch drive you bring 'em in tomorrow you're you're really risking his arm after throw in fifty pitches\nIn this game tonight but that's what's going to turn this into a series is that Milwaukee's relievers as good as they are you put that kind of stress on them that's really tough to say OK over a long series\nYou got to get it done that's really hard\nYeah it's going to be curious to watch now you're getting into the weighed Miley\nJolie shut sheen will be the was Fifteen game winner but he ... over the course of the year so a guy almost got the two hundred ending so perhaps that's you're here five or six innings guy that helps you uh get a little bit of rest for that ball and so they are quite as tax but\nWe're talking strength on strength right you'd say the top of the rotation was what the Dodgers were bringing not to mention all those bats but\nFor the brewers it's all about the bullpen mentioned the stat earlier than it was a one nine to your race in September first they've been fantastic over the course of the season\nBut now you you went went to the well very early Gonzalez not particularly sharp but it seemed like that was councils\nPlanning coming into this game get um a couple innings and then go from there and managing game for game it's going to make for a very interesting series right we watch that with the Boston or New York series and wondering if the bullpen was going to be what eventually\nOn did the red Sox instead the Yankees inability to hit the ball\nThe lack of long malls in the final two games and three walks and oh yeah going down sixteen to one of doesn't help matters but it never became about the red Sox bullpen here strength on straying we're going to see how much credit counseling can mix

I'm\nLiberal Reno now everybody going back over the last month was severely start pointing out some obvious flaws and\nHe was tipping pitches or the ... there's video evidence the red Sox going this is a fast ball he throws a fastball this is a curve ball was a ... there's video evidence of that leaving it was ...\nIt was all for your normally right oh so you're not going to come up with some other ball oh no no ... or any of those problematic things like you normally like to do with listen I I'd a boss\nI Know the red Sox the red Sox chief a logger for his last name as ... so I think they're okay on the clear for that well it's\nA descendent of yes\nUnless citizens Aaron Boone leaving cc's via too long way now he became Jeff Fisher today I mean that even got you know orange ...\nSebastian gave up seven and nine runs in that game I wasn't happy so Aaron Boone today in an interview in which he said I got a little too greedy was trying to\nGet extra out out of both Severino ... when it was clear they didn't have they tried to come out of the game now analytics has come under a lot of fire the last couple of days and that the Yankees were lying to watch an analytics and leaving Severino when and leaving cc's about the end and that's a load of crap\nBecause we watched Aaron Boone manage all season long he just doesn't want to do anything to get to second guess\nHe doesn't want to do anything that's going to put him and paint himself as a bad manager so taking out Severino Sebastian too early that's something that he thinks that's going to get me second guess something we've made a little bit too long but if I leave me too long and it's still the third inning it's well it's only three innings right\nHe did not do anything proactive from game one all the way through the end of the year he sat back watched his team rake\nAnd when they were only the only time I really and it tells me which is in August he did nothing\nHe didn't try to do anything with the batting order he didn't try to do anything to inspire the team he didn't he didn't\nTry to take on some of the blame blame me for this all the things that managers do to try to get the spotlight off of their team to get them to play better Aaron Boone did none of it he had zero carbon footprint\nOn the Yankees and what happened here in the playoffs leaving Severino in because you know in the regular season if the guy's through three innings and he's struggling in the fourth we try to give him a little bit more time and burn out our bullpen and he tried to the same thing with C. C. so bad for your all because he didn't want to be that manager that gay guy any panicked\nAnd what happened he still getting second guessed anyway it's not about analytics is not what he stuck to its Aaron Boone didn't want to be someone where the back pages painted his face on the back of the daily news and the post when the bulls eye around and saying this is his fault well\nThe good news ran as they're doing it anyway we just told you about a month before it happened and now it's habits maybe now next year Arab boom won't make as many mistakes\nSpeaking of that to the whole mistake part of it has signed Brenner\nWas on Ninety eight seven in New York earlier today and talked about even though he likes Aaron Boone he hopes Aaron Boone learns from what went on this postseason and moves on but still you know he would tickets every in a lot earlier\nI can tell you one uh that I that I disagree with them that's bringing Severino out for that for setting I Believe\nOn Monday I just I think there were too many signs that and I got to get a lot of baseball guy but I can tell when the guys getting hit hard right even if they're out so it just seemed like he didn't have a stuff and you know it it it might have been time at that point to to make a change but again on Monday morning quarterbacking which I hate doing but us\nSo there's house Steinbrenner a hard job butter on it saying hey I don't want a guy doesn't have it right so let's take him out of the game look Aaron Boone if not analytics this is Aaron Boone\nNot wanting to do any like it's we see that sometimes out of out of coaches who just don't want people in authority most times people want to do all kinds of put their in print and and their fingerprints on stuff other times people want to just back off\nRob Manfred has backed off the entirety of the time he's been major league baseball commissioner Adam Silver has backed off the entire time he's been NBA commission or whatever the players want is what Adam Silver wound up doing ... if it's not face a play he won't even pick up the phone\nSo sometimes people in power like this just don't want to be quite want to come in and do their job and have people just say okay this guy does a good job I get to keep this job I just have a high status high profile I don't have to do anything that is what Aaron Boone did or didn't do this season\nThan making quite job a little bit in the end tweak for bats against Jefferson as career\nOr strike out he's perfect match\nIn any way he waved at that bottle a yeah I was going to swing that was a All right I'm committed and I've just got to go through the most\n... it's not like many channel had great swings either but he was able to get that bad on the ball and hit a floater out over the shortstop said for a two run single All right well who who's\nThe hope laid off bar who is who he may be more popular or not or then angel Hernandez after this call third strike that he just gave my editor a that was\nIn yeah there's a human now a ... it wasn't even really know how that was awful\nYou know it's funny you mentioned it because Scott berries home plate umpire and they put up a\nA graphic earlier in the day early in the game that ... lifetime ER re when Scott berries behind the plate is something like almost five\nSo I'm not that when he's on hiring that's Clayton ... so\n... ... ... ... ... maybe they got beef Mm investigative reporting all that you're watching too much sons of anarchy I heard that was an internal beef everything was everything's a beef all sides of that and we get the same ... be ... be\nIt's what's for dinner or what you what it\nDoes does does every\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Twitter at how about a ...

Kansas City beach New England they really could go sixteen oh they do have the game in London coming up against the rams which is a big one for Kansas City but\nThey went in New England who are they going to lose too right they beat Jacksonville\nHas too many offensive issues to really be a team that that they wind up having to compete with over the course of the rest of the season they won that battle last week I was amazed at how easy it was for them to score points I thought this is the deepest that's going to slow them down they did\nWell in New England Journal that they claim like mortal well there are a lot of young like for the other a lot of ... for stairs yeah well that ... well but the point is everyone is are we going\nTo kids you know no he threw the ball to them yeah well they

regularity\nThey win that's all right he and I will always have twenty four teams\nThey could go sixteen oh I mean they really 'cause I don't know that there's any team that could wind up feeding them\nTheir officers running at such a high level I think they're going to win Sunday because of ... believe it or not he worked the patriots the last time in his debut a year ago and he's really starting to heat up a little bit now at a hundred and twenty yards two weeks ago at Ninety last week and a touchdown against the jaguars Kareem hunter was not really been a weapon so far\nIs starting
