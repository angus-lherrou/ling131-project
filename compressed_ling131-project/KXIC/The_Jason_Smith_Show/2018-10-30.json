to be right\nWhen you were if the you know the the whole you know you know rules expert on TV doesn't work there's a couple of other shows I think I could use your right now that yeah hey a lasting a two part in this first of all you haven't talked since this happened\nObviously it was a big shocker late last week we saw Hugo cruise get replaced it's very rare we see an unofficial disciplined and then fired during the season you know you had a few days to think about it where are you on that\nI'm really pretty disappointed and and I'm disappointed look I get it you know the fans and everybody likes it because you feel like you're old and an official accountable and they shouldn't be held accountable and they are held accountable um\nBut this is the first time that we've had that they've actually pulled the plug in fired of official during the season\nAnd you know he was in the playoffs the last years he's only been in the league for for he was the first year he was an alternate in both of the last years of the playoffs and then he worked the first six games and then basically fired after his performance in the first six games we\nWe never did that you know we always felt like and this is the way when I say we demonize\nThat if a guy had a bad year if you had a bad year we put them on probation if he did make standard we put them on probation and then the second year when the second year and had a bad year\nThen he was subject to being fired but we always felt like that you know\nLots of things can happen and officials mind and you've got a lot going on and you can you know an official can have a bad good officials have bad years um\nBut the thing too that really concerns me not only break them fat\nYou know of that history that we have had\nIs that you fire somebody mid season and I'll tell you it's not something that the other hundred and twenty five officials looked kindly upon they trust\nTheir leadership they trust the fact that they'll go by history and that they'll give everybody a fair shot even if they're going through a tough stretch and\nThis was shocking to them and I'm concerned about that because Thursday when I was at the game in\nWhere I didn't even know where I was nowadays used and I think but um you know I really felt like the officials officiated scared and the first half they were not good\nWere missing calls that they shouldn't mess they were making call that they shouldn't have and um you know I I really when I look at the health of any organization if you are the boss and you go away from tradition and fire somebody in the middle of a season\nOr it has morale morale consequences so I wouldn't have done it I was that that I Would have sat him and then got rid of him after the season was over\nBut I certainly wouldn't have fired up public shot and and let everybody know that he was fired because what it really does that makes it looked like just a PR move\nAnd and they basically announcing that he was fired is exactly what they did is more of a PR move than anything\nAnd to the mall former VP of officiating in the NFL current rules analyst for it you can follow him on Twitter\nMy career and
