{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "There are more ties now in the NFL because of the overtime rules we've already seen a couple\nAnd you are in a position where you have to realize what's the likelihood we're going to convert this and when this game what Frank Reich did was put losing the game back on the table this wasn't forced him to from the Texans forty and you know what I can go forward here 'cause\nHe's on his own side of the field he's got five yards to make on fourth down and I'm going to give the ball back with a chance for the Texas to get one big pass play and then kick a field all that's exactly what happened\nIs football was like baseball fever metrics people would have been in these you're yelling Frank you have like a Thirteen percent chance of succeeding here because that's really what it was the percentage chance of success was so low this\nWasn't as as simple as its fourth and one on the Ford do I go for doing not if you look at everything that goes along with it you have a tough time getting this because it's five yards you put losing the game back on the table\nAnd there are merits and its high because you never know what it's going to come down to at the end of the season for a playoff berth or not certainly a tie at this point is that I I Know you're frustrated I Know you're upset\nBut that's a big thing and Leslie Frank Reich is a first year head coach and he's got to realize that if I don't make this that I'm gonna get absolutely crucified by fans the media and everybody else I'm a first year head coach and people are gonna think I don't know what I'm doing\nBecause I decided to go for the win and it backfired and now\nThat's exactly what people are wondering is Frank right now what he's doing\nThe strike right now now the next time he makes a mistake it's going to be Frank right can't do it and now we got we got to turn the page on him he will lose cachet in the locker room\nHe'll lose cache with the fans and it's going to be Frank right you've given yourself short rope to succeed in the NFL because of this he's basically put his own neck on the chopping block saying okay next time I screw something up I'll be out of a job\nWhen you're a first year head coach doing things like that is just not smart\nFellow checked made it even worse mistake the big fork down play against the Colts a few years ago but below chicken won three superbowls so if he makes a bad call well OK clearly the guy knows what he's doing he's built up the cache to make a couple of bad calls he can't do he can't do that Frank right does not have that kind of latitude to make those mistakes\nSo I think he does at this point in his tenure and looking at the mathematicians work guys for them for you said it's about thirty seven percent are allowed\nTo go and run the the algorithms and and do the math myself and plotting it out a historically but the the effect it to where I said is All right you're already on three\nYour team's not very good you've had the game of your lives nobody expected Andrew Luck to put up the numbers and the game that he did and the score what they did on that day so here you're trying to\nPush if nothing else for the you're you're fighting for the when you're fighting for your guys you believe as you've marched up and down the field that you can get it one more time and in the this locker room that you're still winning over it I'm sure you know he's done a lot\nTo do that I think the players saying hey we're we're going to go for it and I've got your back and and this is what we're going to be we're going to be aggressive and go for wins\nI think that that carries its weight right now you've got a very young team around Andrew Luck\nYou look at the offensive line that you've shoveled out you are missing TY Hilton I think a lot of it had to do with just very much and that idea of right this is the atmosphere and this is the culture that I Want to build that we don't let anything stop because what's the tide do for an eye when three team\nNo no that well there are wanting to there they would have been one to one one right once once you would have some but what about what is it would have stayed in it's a positive moment it's look thirty seven percent that's not good enough chance to to put losing a game back on the table\nThat is not a good enough chance for that it's gotta be hey it's either fifty fifty at best and do it on the other team side of the field at such a huge gamble to say okay we're going to put losing the game to hack into perspective it went from the Texas with zero percent chance that went to hey how they could win and they want\nOr not not a zero percent chance on what he went into a fetal position with football maybe then he could\nWell have you but you might think well yeah but if you're hunting and then how much can go wrong there uh yeah but most likely not maybe thirty seven percent I don't know about that much oh we got more from the NFL coming up next Fox\n[noise]\nEverybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pickups milk full day\nBut here's an idea what said save hundreds of dollars on car insurance\nAnd the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nOh you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you can be saving Fifteen Percent or more car insurance extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding too do you do today Geico\nSix two thirds just the one hit three strike out and that's what I circled had great demand and did what do you want it on the mound and and that's to be expected of a guy who's become the east in the last two months but a nice luxury for David Roberts does have Thursday Clinton Herschel don't get it and\nThen that's probably the planet it'll be likely a I I was told that for the game crush on reviewing some order I I Would imagine it will be crucial first and then ... you\nAre out there for for games one and two at home now we know Thursday and friday and then I'm going to Atlanta so it'll be buell or a back of course he grew up in Kentucky so uh not not all that far from from the from brave country of the they call during the southeast so this is great for him I'm sure it can be a special room to have that start\nIn game three back in Atlanta and uh it it's going to be a fun theories of course the Braves are they're the only team and the national league that that will have been off\nA for these three days and and their entirety so that they'll have a bit of the lay off\nUh I I Do think for the Dodgers having won this game it'll help them a little bit uh we've seen many times where teams that are the top seeds they get stale that there are a little more vulnerable I I think that for the for both the the brewers and the Dodgers have won the game today that they're\nThey're in great shape now that I'm really confident that they've got a chance to just have the right amount of rest I Believe before things start up on Thursday whereas the cubs are disappointing certainly at home to to lose that game but of course they get a chance again tomorrow night\nTo be Colorado and still find a way to a a match up once again with the Milwaukee Brewers\nEither before we get to the game tomorrow night how worried should the Dodgers be about Kennedy chance he comes in in what's a mob mob situation gives them back to back home runs he's given up more than his fair share of home runs the season\n[noise] well and that's a great question and it's a really good point because um the long balls hurt them\nAnd and also let let's think about how that inning proceeded you know early on he was he was a little uncomfortable or I think and he wasn't able to put a our NATO or story away obviously with the home runs and and if you're\nPhysically not yourself and certainly we know what he's dealt with physically this year including um the irregular heartbeat or you know that's that's very serious and and it seems to me\nThat it's it's taking them a little while to get into the ending in terms of his feeling all of his pitches and and and getting into a rhythm and and there's not time for that in the playoffs unfortunately it worked out today that five run lead but you think about the way that they've Roberts has used them in the past\nUm he's gone to Dave is gone to him and in big spots in the eighth inning with men on base in the seventh anyway with men on base you think back to the Clinton game against the national two years ago so at the very least\nA Jason I I was ... it it really kind of eliminates the possibility of of putting him in the middle of an ending which I think fundamentally changes the way it can use your bullpen so\nI I'm with you I think there are certainly still some bullpen concerns\nFor this team and and you think about things going forward now I'm In the Braves have some bullpen worries as well but the brewers bullpen was really good today and and so you wonder how quickly in the playoffs the Dodgers they find themselves in the very unfamiliar position of having a bullpen disadvantage in comparison to the opposition\nLastly J. P. for tomorrow and we've got last year in ... getting it on I Know you had the Rockies looking for some momentum today as her John ... sports looking for them to to push through and they beat Lester tomorrow\nSo ... and you're right so I thank you for for being very generous and represent the fact that I was wrong and my production\nHey that was that would be an incorrect prediction by morose hey I've got I've got a thousand a week ... voice you guys is that the first time I've been wrong wrong again\nProtections are not really my jam I I I Am not very good at them um and so I was wrong today I thought the Rockies would've when I'm now you look at\nAnd say okay the cubs that the advantage of plant in the early game that the the advantage of sleeping\nIn their own beds tonight and and and understanding what's at stake tomorrow where the rocket fly all the way across the country almost all away from LA Chicago it get ready to play that game\nI it's advantages cubs for me 'cause you've got to postseason tested pitcher in last year and a freelance going on short rest so that that's a that is a tough task\nThat ... who has been amazing this year but they go on short rest and they get is difficult in that circumstance after a long flight ups I I Would say guys it's advantage cubs tomorrow but then again it wouldn't surprise me if I'm wrong for a second straight day because\nI certainly that that that is well in my character my friend it's all good oh good rolling dice and and uh throwing darts here [laughter] that's all\nWell and actually alternatives to keep in mind I'm thinking about this more now at the very least the cubs that they use their best bullpen pieces today and it was a close game so maybe the rocket had the advantage there how 'bout that hey you\nFall

on national television people didn't watch it was it was lower ratings because the NFL was having a star problem\nAfter week to in the NFL or after week three Baker may feel became a star everything he does\nEverybody is all in on the jets on national TV the game yesterday against the rate is which is one of the most talked about games of the weekend even though we threw for picks he was still

you want to watch and see what he does root for him or root against him he's got that\nIt factor and then you have a guy who's dominance through the first three weeks which is great and then when you're a dominant on Monday Night football you become a superstar\nChannel on tax\nThis time he goes in front of yours out much changed on this one tonight game tasteless waiting for the end zone on a home scramble\n... sweep through the end zone [laughter] like on a\nDonut now ... ... ...\nDonut nectar in the end zone Mitch holes is happy\nFor hundreds tonight yeah when he's radio network on the call Patrick homes brings the chiefs back to a twenty seven twenty three victory over the Broncos\nHe had a bad game the first three quarters they could not put points on the board the Broncos hold on a clinic of this is how we're going to slow down Patrick homes were going to send a lot of pressure Adam\nAnd we're going to keep them in the pocket and he's going to be scattered and throw the ball early and throw it away and he did he was very inaccurate in the first I was living out of twenty two you saw how many passes did he try to throw to Travis Kelsey that would be below him to the side of the ground and the Broncos at a great job of sticking on Kelsey and on ...\nYou're probably going to call the holding or many uh illegal contact down you know and all these on Chelsea they did a super cut of five or six players when he was just getting bullied Getty still finishes with a huge game 'cause while the philosophy changed\nBecause in late in the second half\nThe chiefs open things up more what it looked to me was the Broncos defense got tired sure because they didn't seem like they could still chase more homes around the way they had earlier in the game and certainly when you're asking your defensive players to cover these guys one on one for most of the game eventually they're going to get tired well and then the first\nThat they did a good job of setting both Hedges writes a defensive and made home showed moms had no room to operate had to stay between the tackles that lapsed in the second half giving you a little more time to dance and let the receivers break containment\nTwo touchdowns in the fourth quarter and mobile homes who was having a bad game finishes twenty eight out a forty five for three hundred and four yards\nA touchdown and our they win the game so you know the excellence of execution that we harp on so many times here there were just there were a couple of opportunities for the Broncos due to seize sees the game and let's face it if you keep settling for fuel goals\nAgainst this team sixty minutes mhm yeah you got to go by fast enough ... is a daunting to try to beat the what'd you say how quickly lake field I mean what that ridiculous are um that ... has any any break in your coverage in the secondary he finds a way you know it it\nComes down and we will talk a lot more about my homes but for the Broncos it came down to those two places at the end the regulations you talked about the hooking ladder play where are they had the first down but still hooking ladder okay the play before\nTo me that's the bigger one sounded a touchdown I mean case Keenan has to ... it's a blown coverage by the chief he has to marry as Thomas wide open down the right side line it's a touchdown their various Thomas is walking in the end zone with\nTwelve seconds left and the game is over and the Broncos will have one but case Keenan overthrows him and as a result the final play they have is the hook and lie to play that doesn't go their way that's one 'cause that's the one where you know what we missed it this is that's the last play and yeah\nIt was a bad call because look ... you had the first one of the question though is you could have got tackled and they spike the ball and I have one more played for the ends on ... but even with the sudden\nPlay right as he makes the catch he's coming back to the quarterback he might already compassion the line to gain as he caught the ball yeah well they they don't show that I thought it would have been a question of a review right\nI think they would have given it to him because it looked like when he caught it he was still behind the line but he doesn't know that at the time he's right at the market and the play called what's the goal and he's about\nTo get drilled so he's thinking about the walk in and everything so I mean there's a million things going on there\nAnd I buy or look and that's why the play was designed that way to say okay we're going to throw it at the stick\nAnd everybody is going to converge on you for the tackle because you're right at the stick and you're going to pitch it so I'm sure that was all things that you're right to say so he's taking the whole time not oh I have the first down\nAnd I could get tackled buddies thinking this is the place supposed to be executed it just wasn't executed the right way but really that missed pass I mean I'm a bronco fans like look I that's that's something where I look at it and go\nI Will think about that place for a long\nBut ... case keen them that's the guy we brought in\nAnd it was everything they wanted him to be on that final drive he converts on a big fourth down\nHe throws a big path for forty hours when he gets absolutely I didn't realize he was getting ... and that yeah the the camera obviously goes down deals with oh I I Need the other one back on the quarterback that was one of those places where I looked at what I'm saying look outlook outlook out and and he just gets\nKilled and what you do it in and delivered a beauty I mean that was it that we feel schemes moment it was I Am the same guys I was last year I could look you win a game like this on Monday Night football when suddenly hey case keen them the Broncos they win the game their time with the chief stop everything is there suddenly Denver's great now\nAnd instead it was a case Canaan Canaan staying case you can do I mean that's how close it was that's how close it was for the Broncos that play of all the things my home's did which he did so many great things and the left hand to pass it's going to get a lot of attention and all of that I I I firmly agree that's the best thing\nBut that pass is when they say this game I'm going to pick up some areas Thomas running go oh my God he just missed them yeah oh yeah I was thinking back\nTo some of those third downs that they didn't pick up earlier it's like I still go no no you can't settle for three this is like when you're playing the patriots within the Randy Moss here it's like if you go to and you know even if it's six minutes into her score\nDo for it [laughter] keep pushing 'cause three three

my as you know the super bowl because clearly there are two great teams in the NFL the chiefs and the ... and there's everybody else\nGreat teams in the NFL and then there's every ... there are two

there are two great teams in the NFL just because you keep saying that doesn't make it sure does but what about Andy Reid smile and Andy met the media few minutes ago talking about the cheese big twenty seven twenty three when over the Broncos\n... needed to tighten up they tightened up one of those before the house for at the end of the game the blitz that then you make something happen or on the ... turns it into a long field and it ended up in our favor and then on uh the office of side yeah Patrick and [laughter] yeah I've worked real hard\nOn that left hand to throw you know make sure they do that but there are some amazing plays Aaron long the artist the choices for a while there were just shooting ourselves in the foot with penalties and we'd have a big gate and then have a penalty in there and it uh [laughter]\nYou know it didn't hurt us but um [noise] and then you came to this uh Irish cream just coming coming out and uh I'm having a a big day to a hundred and twenty plus yards carrying the football and and um [noise] again [noise]\nTremendous job so but I mean I can keep going here but it it's a special teams I did a heck of a job and\nYou need the so you know we've talked about having a lead and everybody's ass about what if you're behind how's it going to react how's Patrick how to react and\nSo um [noise] we've got a taste of that [noise] yeah so what he's accomplished kid he was confident before that it is not going to be who won't be overconfident from but I think it tells you that tells everybody really the ...\nYou're you're within striking distance or you know you have that opportunity to the guy that can make plays guys around may plays too so that's a [laughter] this wasn't just Patrick put some ice was\nHigh so there is Andy Reid talking\nAbout how great patch or homes was even completed a past lefty photography kill for a first down when he was getting sacked in and look of all the new quarterbacks getting the attention we spend a lot of time on Baker may feel the same Donald and Josh Rosen and Josh Allen obviously so because these are the new guys\nPatrick more homes has become\nThe best quarterback in the NFL through four weeks in the national football league there's been nobody better than him as Jared golf has been really good nobody's been better than ... he is in\nA perfect position who succeed he has walked into a team with a good offensive line was phenomenal player makers all over the place and many guys are jealous that they are not playing in that system but my home's has taken advantage of\nEverything that he can as far as throwing guys open he does that a lot because you can throw the ball so far down field where he takes advantage of plays keeps plays open looked at a second in thirty\nOn that final drive and he completes a pass for twenty five yards after you know scrambled to the right and froze on the run and throws a bullet\nI mean this kid is so special and I don't know that there's a way to stop him\nOnly slow him down most guys you figure out okay there's a way to stop well even Baker may feel in a second Saudi through for picks writes Russell should have won the game but he threw for ... you can stop Baker may feel you've stopped saved Arnold really the jets of stops and Donald but you can do that all the other guys but more homes\nThe Broncos put out tonight the best blueprint I've seen yet to try to beat the chiefs they put a lot of pressure on ... homes and kept him in ...\nThe pocket and my home's didn't like it looked nope no quarterback like pressure but the best quarterbacks find a way to find a way around that stay in and make throws he threw the ball late\nLow Easter with early to everywhere but his wide receivers in the first half he tried at Travis Kelsey on five passes and everything was low to the side it wasn't clubs and\nTariq was blanketed deep down field by Broncos ... this was the blueprint this is okay this is how we're going to do it not many teams can it's very simple it's not that I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel by saying here here's something special so this is what you have to do but so many teams\nDon't have that they don't have the personal down to the quarterback and ends to have to do one on one in coverage and and and stay on guys tight while a troubled that you're\nGoing to actually do that right and here you've got the benefit for most of his game is that you didn't get content with Sandy Watkins\nShrinking down the field right after he leaves with a hamstring injury uh so far I mean as you go through the post game analysis that's something that that certainly is put off to the side because of the game that was playing was fantastic but that's that's one other element to the\nChiefs off and they didn't have to contend with in the Denver defense you saw the second half or on\nStarting to get tired can can hold contain on the edges as much got out to that right edge quite a bit to be able to win the ball down field as we've seen even in the past is where he was off he's thrown at where nobody sketch neither is receiver or it's you know when you put it up for grabs you don't see\nAlready got five near misses and and I've seen for a couple of weeks now all the comparisons going back to Brett Farr teammates can bury a matter of you know that's what I kind of see out of him and and certainly trust his arm or like Brett Farr did but he doesn't put the ball in harm's way like Brett Farr did\nYou know he reminds me of and this is this is it it's weird but follow me or for a second he reminds me of Aaron Rodgers\nIn that Aaron Rodgers thing what he does better than anybody else as he is always looking down field he is not going to dump the ball off to a running back he's not he just doesn't have that mentality he is I'm looking down field ongoing twenty yards down field\nThere's a running back here I don't care no I can see my wide receiver on back shoulder or something I'm always looking down feel and that's what makes Aaron Rodgers so dangerous\nAnd that's what allows him to scramble at times too because he everybody has got to be down field that's a lot of what\n... does he's always looking down field\nNow certainly there are a place you want to run a screen to ... you want to get on the ball in the swing fast because he's that dangerous but that's the design play he is never looking for where's my safe option I what's the most yards I can get on this planet feel like that's what it's sometimes the most charges it's eight yards over the middle of the
