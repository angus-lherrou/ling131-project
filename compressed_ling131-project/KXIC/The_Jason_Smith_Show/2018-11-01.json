Derrick Rose in his historic returned to glory tonight for the timber wolves in what was a fascinating game to watch on many levels but certainly his performance\nIs one that we're going to remember as this NBA season goes on particularly with the Jimmy butler saga continuing in the ebb and flow and the anger and vitriol that continues to flow up and for Derrick Rose it was a night or whatever\n[noise] second my role I got a current or high point for\nWorld's radio network on the call you look at the final fifty points career I Nineteen thirty one from the field Dan eight of eleven from the bottom line or a seven from three point range for rebounds six assisted have six turnovers\nBut a throwback to two thousand eleven the MVP season and on a night where\nLet's face it it's all about negativity there's the Jimmy butler what is his hitting down operation shutdown Derrick Bell ... still they're still in the building and that's great but on the whole it becomes the question of well does it finally forced the timber wolves ownership hands you just say you\nKnow what the team can compete without him let's figure out what the best deal is and let's move on with our lives\nFunny on how things happen because Jimmy Butler we believe set up voluntarily on Wednesday night to not play against like Utah Jazz\nJeff ... the ... point guard was out because of a neat confusion so now you take out the you take out Jimmy Butler and his awful stinking attitude and now you're putting Derrick Rose and you have a ... like this it's funny how things work\nAnd it just is healthy tonight Mike this probably doesn't happen right if Jimmy Butler as healthy attitude this probably doesn't happen but it is so great to see a great story overshadow the garbage that has been in the twin cities involving Jimmy Butler and the ...\nFlood twenty eight twenty five your final on rose in tears leaving the court or as you noted on your Twitter account at damned by on Fox me over at swollen do our boss scotch Shapiro this is the night where he's going to get rid of butler\nAll excited element of soda is a zero yeah for for this one this All right you saw team at least for this one moment against equality opponent and Carl Anthony towns coming up with a big performance as well he finishes with twenty points sixteen boards\nIn the dramatic when and and we're seeing that norm again though games finishing into one twenties and that's becoming the norm here in the NBA\n... grade is it that we're talking about the jazz to rules game on Halloween how about that I I mean and to see Derrick Rose in tears into your I mean here's amazing stuff\nYeah we'll hear audio from Derrick Rose post game a little bit later on in the show as we celebrate another fifty point performance in his early part of the NBA season to see a lot of it was the right thing so Dan I'm One of the things people out and they spent a lot of money on candy\nA lot of money on costumes I was at my kids' school yesterday they have the you know traditional parade when they go round\nAnd people were those inflatable dinosaur suits sixty bucks a pop the those are sixty bucks people dress like a ... year jak scaling tip the nightmare before Christmas sixty bucks a pop and you're talking about millions upon millions of dollars but also millions of dollars in chocolates in can factions\n... whatever happened to the mask with the crappy rubber bands on the back that we had oh there's a couple it okay All right good later on I'll\nTell you what the most creative costumes work because they were pretty impressive I might try to replicate it and where it around the office and see how many people try to take a crack at me well we'll get into that a little bit later a top five candy draft for me I Need a uh I I Need to take a hundred grand bargain that all light on it for me\nThat's always the the biggest one there's another like for in a multi bag [noise] if you're talking about wrapped it's

Hubbard tax icy and heart radio smarts reminder Alexa played up or they actually see on our radio\n[noise] Fox Sports ...\nAnd the NBA game in Minnesota's tonight Jimmy Butler set out and Derrick Rose scored fifty points in a narrow victory over Utah one twenty eight one twenty five for the timber wolves\nWhy as you said instead of\nLooking with them and why aren't you looking without ... look ... you know looking outside that's where it's just such a head scratcher the here that three players walked out of the meeting when they found out that third one was going to be back not a good sonnet by the way this Maryland football team\nNot bad ... three a win over Texas three and two in the Big Ten another when they get the bowling alley votes show so obviously this this this culture is is gone All right with the J Dirk and but they sit there and look at this case as\nLet's make sure that we have got all the information so we don't wrongly dismiss him\nIs absurd considering that there isn't a parent I think around the country that would be willing to send their kid to Maryland and play under DJ Dirk in after the lack of responsibility taken for the death of a former player so whatever they would have had to pay at a buyout Mike would have been worth\nAnd will be worth the damage that would have kept him ... that would have been done if they would have kept him on staff and I just don't know how you don't see what's going on may maybe it's a force in the trees you know you know if\nYou're just you're close to it that you think that can't be happening 'cause there was a huge ESPN report\nThe toxicity and that launched another internal investigation that was early August so right is you're getting ready for your first game and this starts breaking of treatment of players and and how from the strength coach and coach Jurgen how toxic it\nWas having him away the plane they were playing good football\nNot great and even last year you saw signs that there's there's talent on his team but it never coalesced and you always wonder\nWhy that doesn't come to fruition consistently and there's a million reasons but then you have this story that broke with all of the details that that roll through and you have meeting after meeting after meeting and your convening and you're getting all the details\nYou come to a decision stick with your decision\nRight now backlash if people decide they want to boycott people want to go and they want to protest outside your office they like don't want to go like politicians and follow you to a restaurant you know what you made a decision\nOn it you don't go and say oh no hey we got this many clicks and Twitter backlash oh and the governor hates us now oh no I mean come on what you have some conviction if you decided they decided based on your findings and all these meetings that it wasn't enough to terminate in\nA couple of tweets and the associated student government wasn't overturned that and how did you not had those meetings with those people before you came to the decision to reinstate the timelines are just they make that decision may get all the way through Mexico so that that's my problem\nWith it of of how you don't gauge the interest how there's like ... put ... put out there or being a K DJ Dirk and make it his job back why don't you send that out\nA week ago or last friday when you have this meeting I have no problem they made that they ended up making the correct this Iraq so even though it was James and twenty four hours look you look like idiots yesterday at least he saved some face today I don't think people are going to say like well jeez make up your mind Marilyn in this situation I actually think they did the right\nThing because they got the right decision down if they stick with the J dark and\nYour program is in serious trouble\nYeah the toxicity and you're going to have how many investigations official or not that will that will carry with the program so his ... for as long as he's there yeah yeah that I did have\nTransfers you would have kids who didn't want to go there you would have a disinterested student ... a body that wouldn't want to take part alumni would probably be ruined other than that everything would have been great at Maryland is DJ Dirk instead it had\nGathered coach ... walks away I I Would love to have you been in the room when they made the decision I coach or coming back\nJust what led to that\nYeah that's really that I I Want to play by play of that that's a thirty ... thirty a me\nAgain in hearing what they said last friday that they had really good meetings with the head coach will of course he did is jobs on the line right\nNow he's going to get your buddies at yeah even job loss is going to do more on\nExactly how many live
