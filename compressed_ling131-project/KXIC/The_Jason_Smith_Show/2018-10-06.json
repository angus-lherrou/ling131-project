Santa Danny west and I'm here to take you back on a journey to this week in sports history that's our way back in Nineteen eighty three were the first World Series begins play\nBoston Americans eat the Pittsburgh Pirates\nFive games to three and a best to nine zero five\nOh this week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call three points to center field before ... into the Wrigley\nField bleachers in the fifth inning game three of the world series and the Yankees won seven to five week in Nineteen fifty one third baseman Tommy Thompson hits a one out three run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to win the national tennis\nFor the New York giants Thompson's homerun wrapped up in an amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series of the Yankees\nBut Tom says miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world\nLeaders several endings in a row with multiple runners on base your only able to late one extra run to get it to five five three before judges home run but\nYou had a number of awful of\nBats and God's not taking pitch right not standing in and and just trying to extend what had become fairly miserable\nOutings are potentially miserable outings instead and the box score it's going to look oh they did just fine you have the ... in a a third of an ending from workman Jew hits and an iron rod and walk a strike out\nAnd then the whole run that Kim role gives up opposite field the judge otherwise it's going to look nice and clean that you know you gave up two runs their sale\nTo in his five and thirty five and a third innings pitched you'll take that and you'll run all the way through it you you spotted a five and a lead in in a way you go\nYou know and who knew he would work that would still be well you know what it gets it done I was I was going to go Vince Workman but I decided to go that's good yeah that's a good weapons too though but here's the thing is is he talking about bad at bats with runners and scoring position\nIs in the sixth inning the Yankees start knocking sail around he comes out of the game they're into the bullpen now\nMiguel into her walks after awhile pitch\nWorkman comes in walks Gary Sanchez on four pitches laboratories comes in and swings that the first\nPitch out of the strike zone and that sets up the entire at bat and then he winds up on a piece on on a full count swinging at a curve in the dirt for the final out of the inning that was a horrendous at bat\nFrom laboratories and I understand yeah he wanted it back to nine foot there's tourists he's one of the best players on the on the teams are all star this year wasn't as great in the second half but still you have to be smarter in that situation you got to get runs a\nGuy just walks the guy on four straight pitches and after you have a walk the batter before\nYou got to realize the rented this whole ballpark now is on edge that their pitchers can't throw strikes and you will help them with that that was a horrible at that stands out that it looked like he he was swing defensively bunch swinging for the fences it was it was it looked like he was completely out of whack and how to sink\nAnd and that ... was was awful as well but they had a few at bats like that's a nice those are the biggest ones because those are the ones that came with the bases loaded but still I mean I'm stunned that's what I'm shocked that the most the Yankees having that many bad at battle you'll you'll like\nAggressive work at the plate especially on a a pitcher's struggling but also here in in a playoff series where you are now crawling back to try to steal one enemy smart gotta workouts and know that this is the weak part of their\nTheir squad right if they're going to need to go to start it was like they did bringing him for cello you know you try to force the issue as best you can so that that advantage plays out even if you don't get back\nTo even and when this one that you at least extend things and extend those arms that they're less able to work through games to through five\nTwitter at how about a ...

I'm going to stick with I'm hoping he can come out of this but\nYou got to be ... you know you gotta managed in the playoffs you got to be short memory you\nCan't say well maybe you can get out now if you don't have it you don't have it I mean if I can tell you the ... that I Know Franco now to tell you the hell but I think\nIf you get to that not necessarily you know as we talked about Clinton Kurdish Ozzie cruises to the middle of a seven frame ear so three nothing Dodgers the history legacy loyalty all of those words in this case I'm Still looking at at plume or and say All right even if he's eighty percent eighty five percent of his\nSelf you still better than most in to that point yes it was to nothing when you come back out for the fish but you give up back to back home runs to get things started the ...\n\nIn the back they have a gym undecided Hanson\nAnd we almost caught I'm\nStanding in the back\nAnd it just felt like such a big switch for you guys were kind of just stay alive after falling behind so early to really kind of sound like an opportunity last maybe towards the end of the game with the with the people that you left home based on that in the back to back bases loaded situation\nUm and and you know I I Do credit them a little bit and the fact that you know they they did a good job of minimizing in staying away from trouble against us and staying away from damage against us [noise] um but yeah we just couldn't get that really big hit that\nTo to have that beginning that really jumped is back in the game in the middle innings and I thought we did a good job attack in a way a good job of giving ourselves opportunities and and just ran out of time there but [laughter]\nYeah we just couldn't get that back breaking hit that that allow us at that beginning can\nAnd when did you think of sailing and was it on the harder and prepare for him just because he's ... couple of months you\nKnow I think it's you know you're\nThe press has the same and what his stuff is you know usually dictates how much success she can potentially have against some so [noise]\nUm I thought he was good and um you know not as dominant self necessarily um but I thought he did a really nice job of mixing his pitches changing speeds you know his changeup slider where a factor\nUm you know he could reach back for a little bit on the heater when he really needed to so you know I think he he gave them a strong out and there's no doubt about it and did a good job I think of keeping us off balance enough\nUm you know we were able to get his pitch count up and get them out of there and then uh\nYou know keep crawling back into it but overall Saudi Saudi pitch pretty effective against us\nBack corner CIA [laughter] Aaron how much of a luxury is to have a horrible and like you do and it's been something you can be advantageous for you going forward in the series\n[noise] yeah um I mean that's one of our ultimate strange you know so [noise] um you know if we're going to get to where we want to go um you know the ... going to play a big role in that\nAnd uh you know they they stepped up for us tonight and and and allowed us to get back in that game and then you know do the job they pretty much done all year for us a chance to watch\nWhile an oil it's pretty well were you surprised to see him\nMake that switch and go to pursue solo literally in the game [noise]\nNot necessarily I mean we saw um warming up and then once we saw um warming up we figured he'd probably start the eighth inning um\nYou know obviously Rick spent a really good pitcher forum and and and we were able to kind of works through some guys I'm In in the set up situation so were you know getting down towards the end so I don't think we're real surprise up or so came in\nAh that's it for the ...
