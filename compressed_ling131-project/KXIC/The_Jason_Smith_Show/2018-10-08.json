children ... all year long I mean they've been calling for Jason Garrett set up surprise is going to go and make it all year again I'm if I think there's going to be the last year especially if

I I Know it wasn't his fault today but I'm starting to buy that and maybe there's a little friction there so I think it throw Green Bay slash Mason Crosby on there today\nI Know yeah and I'm about what that also but I mean would you say there's a little friction going on\nWhat more do you want I mean Roger's threw the ball fifty two times I Know I was twenty four nothing at that time I I understand that what exactly do you want um you know that at all but I don't understand and you know what is interesting I picked up um there was a critical for top play for the browns\nAnd they said and I saw a Jackson go just go for just go forth and Baker Mayfield look this is the place ... they run the plight\nHow come he gets to pick the play but they're still call it it it for Rogers and he has to wait to hear it to see what they're calling for them and that doesn't sound right you know that's not right about that\nOkay I Love you already because that's just because it's not right that's because Todd Haley is on his microphone in his ear telling him what play off his wrist bay and that he needs to call them that you need to execute bakers not calling his own place I\nThought it was certainly look like he was called himself on that forced out play I don't know maybe I Am not with a ... he was saying I Am calling this book is Jack the personal jacks it just looks like he's a guy that that's a good seat I don't think he does but\nOther than that I see I I just think sometimes we don't go that just today I'm just here because I got a free press pass up you know my my my us and other laws really run into the but I don't know it just seems like as a good seat for the game\nI I Will say this I Will say this\nWhen they had that issue on forts down and I think it was in overtime when they didn't get a pass interference call and I did yeah I I get it that it was an illegal contact and I want to catch up all the ... that's what they said they didn't do the flag but I when he didn't lose his mind I think\nWe always joke on the show about there's a time to go you know that regardless when whatever happens in your life something will be sad or something will happen it's like I got to throw hands here\nThat's a moment where as huge vaccine is the head coach at the Cleveland Browns Arnie you got to lose your mind right you got to show your guys you're invested in that and that that to me was a moment that stood out I still found a way to pull it off but I I don't think Baker Mayfield has more freedom as a rookie what the browns than Aaron Rodgers does what the Packers does he\nTake away that rookie of the year trophy it MVP trophy for him also just going to keep it on to the side just for a little bit for for just a couple of more games Chris can we just do that can you do me a favor on that please\nIf I Would have taken a if I would've given you the over I've won win for the browns you might have taken the under a and I don't know man I think he should win the MVP already [laughter]\nNo you're right you're right just like we did with that Sam ... early on just like we did a oh my God\nWhat are you going to get it back now after what happened today starts\nTo be out of ... we ... we always been this I mean I Know you and I knee jerk yet we're literally right after the games we don't have time to sit here and think about it these people that have like twenty four hours after the game to think about it and they're still knee jerk and every single week come on guys\nAren't so are those are that's one of the teams that I Would I Would add the
