{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "You need a Drew Brees in fantasy tonight as he is at three thirty six and three touchdowns most importantly his record breaking touchdown pass from the first half\nThat made him the NFL's all time leading after the pageantry that went along with this award was amazing but let's go back for a couple of seconds 'cause there's so many different interesting angles with Drew Brees 'cause you think about all the things he went through in his career\nHe's kind of a guy that you just take for granted he's going to throw thirty five to forty touchdowns a year maybe the safe will be good maybe they won't be but they're always going to score points\nAnd I noticed is age never comes up I'm like Tom Brady right everything is Tom Brady and how old is that what once you hit forty is that when we start talking about you never know what was your brain is right there and and we're not really going on he's old\nOld Drew Brees is also playing in his living room he's been playing indoors for a good ... hey this is what it's like it's like watching Drew Brees is like it's like he's just comfortable there is I in my living room I don't think Drew Brees even knows what real ... feels like it's just grass if\nI Do it's a fair point that well I mean he had some ... here in San Diego for a bit yeah and\nWell obviously now I'd mountain in New Orleans to a beautiful thing he can run it can be the governor of the state of Louisiana Governor Bobby governors got a bad connotations and the walking dead the governor\nYou know that's that's not it's not good yeah people not like in the beginning of this next guy walking it's Rick Grimes is vital episode yeah\nI'll tell them hey grimy the big as he made it how's he made is that at some religion it's seven seven you know he knocks on the door to see a cure a nightly and sing to her and a zombie answers and eat them Carol or snack\nA liquid Jonah butter off that's what happens is that on there I don't know if they butter okay ah yeah\nThe biggest bit of cultural um currency is when did you stop watching Walking Dead like that but the thing that like when it's not when did you used to be when did you see Hamilton now it's when did you stop watching the walking dead oh I stopped the season and a half ago you seem cooler\nI raised my hand and I said never started\nA I'm On the on the road and feel like your governor [laughter]\nThat one right Ah yes you're right side or do whatever I guess I'm just going to blow up a little path but um\nSo the thing is you remember about Drew Brees and this is really interesting 'cause it's like I said so many things which kind of taken for granted but\nHe is extremely lucky because if you remember earlier in his career when he was quarterback in San Diego chargers he was going to be there next great quarterback he had had a couple of great years he was drafted in the same draft classes lenient Tom Watson but then your talents and went early first breeze was the next pick and he played really well\nThen he busted up his shoulder which are buddy Sean ... put out a tweet about that a little bit earlier\nAnd yet after ... after he busted up his shoulder of course the the they drafted Philip Rivers and and you know charges haven't really looked back 'cause you'll feel rivers is probably going to the hall of fame too but\nWhen Drew Brees after coming off that injury\nOnly two teams wanted to sign it\nThe dolphins and the saints that's it nowadays if you have an injury like Drew Brees it doesn't matter because of medical science the advancements\nTeams would be lining up don't we don't care if you have an injured will will take a long slow you're a great quarterback he had four or three really good years he was if he if that happened now and Drew Brees is gonna be twenty four years old coming off the years he had and he had a shoulder injury that team at the turn the page there would be\nTwenty five teams saying we'll give you whatever you want but back then because this is you know almost a generation ago in in medical terms you're talking about in two thousand for two thousand five words yeah we do know that you can really play again we don't know we don't we don't know we can take a chance on you two teams wanted to sign Drew Brees now does it\nMean that that's amazing to think about how his career could have fizzled because if not for these teams there's only two out of thirty who knows of even get another chance maybe your stock market bring you as a backup you don't know about your arm of you may not get a chance to play anymore we almost could have missed his career because of that well you look at\nEven on his own team right teddy Bridgewater are being there and what he faced in terms of just his lake in his day to day life let alone getting back into a football uniform for Drew Brees and you know we talk about all those great for the past that you know ten to Fifteen Years prior\nWere lost and their careers were done right the most famous always is Gail fairs and injury that would have been kept about ten months now ended his career so you look at Drew Brees you had two opportunities\nAnd while the saints ended up\nUsing correctly and getting their man and well not only has he done great things across the\nThe landscape vary in\nTerms of his charitable output is just dominant for two decades\nTwitter out how about a ... got Mike swollen dome it it's still all New Orleans and all Drew Brees\nAnother part of drew breezes past will on earth

you\nThat's over now and you ruined it for me so thank you very much or nothing left to work for two except slicing tomatoes making dinner for my family putting together the sweat salad\nAlso let the service of congratulations for the touchdown record because as you can see I'm very busy I have time to keep doing these videos for your congratulating\nBut in all seriousness drew congratulations on this record you've done it the right way all your hard work and dedication have paid off\nYou and I come a long way since this picture back in two thousand when you were in college and I was in my third year in the NFL so where to go proud of you good luck the rest of the war\nSo there's a message from Drew Brees yes the picture he does hold up as one of he in a very young Drew Brees are kinda just looks like a young ... high school friend guy\nI mean that's kinda what kinda what Drew Brees looks like a kind of dealing with shirt and a little bit of free safety in high school I Would have won a contest to take a picture with Peyton Manning I went to his passing academy [laughter]\n\nSo that was pretty interesting idea look Peyton Manning having a lot of fun there at the beginning I broke you broke your right which one which one oh alright greatest thousand days of young Peyton Manning's life\nBut one thing to get to on Drew Brees which looking back at the entirety of his career we talked about\nHow close we were to not even seeing it happen because not many teams were interested in him coming off his shoulder injury back in two thousand six is that before this you know Peyton talked fears of picture when you were in college playing at Purdue and Joe Tiller yeah go boilers and uh\nIt's it's\nTwenty years ago almost but I vividly remember how good that Purdue team was under Joe Tiller because if you think about the evolution of the NFL\nWhat what's all the rage now and in college specially spread often says right everybody run some version of the spread and especially in college like I see I see a hurry up versus the spread all the time was Syracuse because\nWhy did teams do this it's their way of competing with teams that have better athletes that are more talented if we give them something different to prepare for we can level the playing field and now\nEvery other team runs it you see some kinds of spread off ... everywhere sometimes to hurry up sometimes it's not\nBut Purdue was one of the first teams\nTo do that and this is Twenty years ago and breeze had a phenomenal career throwing the football at Purdue and became a very high draft and now he didn't go as high as you expect them to you think Drew Brees he didn't go slow is still there ... thirty thirty two so that you know he was not tall he was only\n... thinking about the angle he's grown from his entire career goes back to the that'll magnetic football game oh quarterback with an angle he's going to have neck arthritis bad oh there's no question his life 'cause he's he gets that extra inch by tilting his head up a little bit but\nYou think about that and that was really those were the first types of off and some are saying George Tiller was the guy but Joe Tiller was one of the biggest guys to run that spread often this is back in Nineteen Ninety eight Ninety nine two thousand what with the bigger thing\nWas it was happening in other conferences and the big than it was ...\nWas it was three yards at a cloud of dust still at that point that's really you're talking about Big Ten foot pole evolving you look at those three years under breeze you had a Rose Bowl appearance mix there in but you want to have a little fun with numbers any here we go Nineteen Ninety eight first year starting for Drew Brees\nAlmost four thousand passing yards in the Big Ten for the boy was thirty nine touchdowns twenty interceptions number two on the list you want to get through his number two passing in the big down there Joe German\nOh gee I said you know as you may I add all three thousand three hundred or a you're talking about\nSix hundred and fifty yards difference yeah on a bill Burke third from Michigan State number four celebrating University of Michigan\nIn Nineteen Ninety nine or breathe barely beat out drew and South Asia ... it was a number one recreate country well and he was on baseball cards as a member of the eight oh Janet age there was all that uh Drew Brees\n... year or two thirty nine hundred yards Kurt kitten her number to University of Illinois there twenty seven hundred passing yards so full twelve hundred number three Antwon Randall el number for Tom Brady twenty two hundred another battle\nA final year three thousand three six hundred sixty eight yards the next player on that list and I don't do this just for northwestern but shows the separation 'cause there was still reticence to adopt such a ... a type of op eds that coup stock of northwestern twenty four hundred\n... you have a twenty three eighty nine for here you're talking about a full Thirteen hundred yards more just the way they ran that our pets and made a joke teller a household name in a at a superstar in the Jew breeze got them up into the beginning of a

will depend on how to make them more intense how well the quarterback reading that you're talking about from three years ago yeah so ... you're talking about from Fifteen Years ago no it's a different era and the NFL I see what you're doing I'm going to step on your foot [laughter] but so back then member breezes coming off you know coming off a really good run he was twenty six years old but only two teams were interested\nThe dolphins and the ... and the dolphins\nDecided Dante colpepper was there a guy and I have very thankful for that because I don't know if they're just going to want to game\nGoing up against Drew Brees and Tom Brady for the past Fifteen Years later when many anyway no we didn't know we went on just a little bit about ... maybe it would last more and gotten a better quarterback sooner oh way way way way way now or in the middle of Aaron Rodgers careers\nNow so nowadays people would say well the shoulder will be fixed medicine medicine is there we have no compunction or worry about this because we know and we are confident in medicine teams are confident in medicine they understand when they talk to doctors this guy's gonna gonna be\nAble to come back and play be this kind of player but back in two thousand and six when it was still okay the shoulder injuries like this we haven't really seen many teams can say okay the doctor can tell me but I'm just nervous about it because that general knowledge is not what you think it is\nSo many teams backed away we almost didn't get Drew Brees his career because what the dolphins said okay it's breeze or colpepper they said were signing colpepper so if it's not the saints and Drew Brees then maybe he's out of football for a year when he comes back he's a backup maybe he never gets a chance to get there with a sharp Peyton\nRon doesn't get to play indoors for the majority of his career and throw the football all over the place and spray it like it's a hose I mean so many things that almost didn't happen because of the time\nFrame and which that occurred and had the same not done that we might not have had his career\nWow look at all those yards easy throws tonight a\nRedskins laying down a in a big Monday night game and Drew Brees the pageantry was pomp and circumstance the gift cards and certificates of authenticity and more game balls out of this one give it away and I think in the history of the national\nFootball sweater how about a fresco Mike is slowing down the Jason Smith show in my car and coming up in one minute why he was Drew Brees able to succeed the way he has the last Fifteen Years out of them will tell you but first step cars is going to tell you what's trending PC\nAlready to Capitol things turning the saint of course the forty three Nineteen whenever the Redskins the big story here Drew Brees becomes the all time passing yards leader on a touchdown passes sixty to eighty order\nTo trade Kwan Smith he also finishes the night one touchdown away from becoming just a fourth quarter back to reach five hundred career passing tests downs also had big news and the game that was a blow out the red Sox beat the Yankees sixteen to one of the big news\nHere's the rock star with a night he's had [noise] and he's right that restaurant did the right down the line toward the Connor hooking\n[noise] he has more of a cycle\nMe [noise] that time in his career\nHas Red Sox radio but according to the lions sports there oh that is the first cycle ever hit and a postseason games and that was brought home that's the answer to your trivia

car insurance guys\nBy so much DC that line from the guy goes studios that Jason Smith show with my best friend my Carmen I really that's really hard to believe in the history of major league baseball nobody has ever hit for the cycle in a post season game before\nThat's amazed every night we see something new but that's but that's something that I I I think we've been Fargo's the mind baseball for over a hundred years now and that's never happened and selling a cyclist so so rare it's not like well getting a perfect game and the world series like okay well this happened once before it's like for the cycle we got a bunch of those\nAnd you know well over a hundred years that's never happened\nThat's amazing I I Can't I Can't imagine that the I mean look not I'm not saying I doubt the Elias sports bureau but I just I just find that that is so so hard to think that you know even though you know hey growing up all the baseball history I knew you know you knew all the\nHay who I had the record for most total bases in the game Joe Ed Koch um who almost threw a no hitter bill ... who had the first perfect ... Don Larsen you know I knew all that stuff growing up because that was what I did in the seventies and eighties but but that's I never remember coming across someone hitting for the cycle in the postseason but I still can't believe that never happened\nAnd then all those numbers got obliterated oh yeah I don't buy and and the the Google machine down tells you very fast when I started finding beer well like this particular do you bring up right now rock holding the\nThree hundred and twenty fourth player in baseball history to hit for the cycle\nSo not necessarily I mean not commonplace but certainly a a no circumstance but first in in play off I guess you got guys that you ain't wanted those could be you know more along the way you'd you'd stumble into one what's interesting there was a an article in the Boston Globe yesterday say so with the kids are struggling should the red Sox going ...\n[laughter] yeah so\nI joined her out of out of that and that's a headline the Jason Smith show is Carmen that when you're hiring you don't want to waste time sorting through dozens of relevant resumes you want an efficient way to get to a shortlist a qualified candidate that's why you need indeed dot com posted job in minutes\nSet up screen or questions based on your job requirements then\nZero in on qualified candidates using the two of online dashboard discover why three million businesses using deed for hiring posted jobs today and indeed dot com slash fire that's indeed dot com slash fire search for\nSearch indeed you know with Drew Brees owning the night becoming the all time leader and yards passing breaking Peyton Manning's record tonight ... look these\nNo one game three of the A. L. D. S. the red Sox leaves the division series to be the one hand need one more when to Flint ya [noise]\nNobody I on the call rock hall the first player in baseball history to hit for the cycle in a playoff game for for six tonight with five RBI everybody in the starting lineup\nHad either a hit or run\nOr in RBI many of them had at least to this was the night for the red Sox there no one knew when away from the ALCOA as to what starting to gain a lot of traction is chattering and and and TBS was talking about this apparently and now the Yankees are having to answer questions about it is that\nThey're estimating that Louis Severino who got lit up tonight did not have as normal bullpen before the game and that potentially could have contributed to him being off tonight because look Severino couldn't get out of the fourth inning uh gave up seven hits six runs up I'm surprised that\nAaron Boone left him in there for the fourth inning considering that Boston was hitting him pretty well it had been two innings of runs the stuck with a guy when hey you got to figure out a way to win this game and go to your bullpen instead several comes out for the for the heart of the game is over\nBut Severino said no head as normal bullpen the Yankees said no Severino had as normal bullpen everything is okay a boy I'll tell you what I I picked the Yankees in the beginning I'm not going to go away from an Alka sixteen to one is just one game but boy it feels like the Yankees are close to melting down and they just had a curiosity\nHere that it was harder to broadcast yeah\nUh you know seven forty starts I didn't start warming up till seven thirty two man seems seems like something's amiss fair yeah I'm going to be a bullpen coach bullpen catcher Aaron Boone who you've been critical of in terms of is a\n... laissez faire more just a a at ... manager in that sense you just got an air he's just been a guy the guy\nBut the thing is is that this is what what what baffles me is that\nI don't think this would be an Aaron Boone thing because the Severino would look he warms up the same way all pitchers are all creatures of habit they all have to say I want to do the same way the scan you are and what they do you know they're not all Clinton curse Shaw where at six forty to why I'm doing this at at six fifty one I'm doing this but it's like\nHey\nYou know if if if you look at first patrol car shows after seven ... he's going to boycott well what but we've seen that right when we saw earlier in the area a couple of those on age circumstance kind of things where you can just see how salty one but most pictures\nAll within a couple of minutes one way or another of doing their long toss whenever they are or whatever they like to do to get ready doing they're running in the outfield but wherever they are doing their those creatures of habit so to get out there eight minutes before to warm up\nAnd that's kind of weird but the Yankees say we had normal warm up time and that's I mean I feel like the Yankees are close to melting down here and not that this would be Aaron boots fault but certainly Aaron Boone would be the guy who at this point\nIf I'm Aaron Boone things are really bad and this is where a coach or a manager needs to step up say or do something to take the pressure off of the team\nSometimes in basketball it's when a coach gets thrown out of a gang doesn't need to get thrown out of a game but he does it take the pressure off or you said something really outlandish just to get people talking to him listen I'll I'll handle this I'll tell you this team is overrated that were playing against was suddenly over and over rated and that led to the guys basically\nGet back to what they're doing everybody leaves them alone and they can understand why we're back to playing baseball we need to do X Y and Z\nThis is where Aaron Boone needs to do something like that because this is what the good managers do this is what the good players do when they step up about you know what I can handle this and I'm going to do this I Need to see something from Aaron Boone where he's going to help turn the page on this to tomorrow and\nWhat I if I'm Aaron Boone right or wrong about ... you know I Would be I'd be defiant\nI Would say you don't know what you're talking about this is you know you have a problem with me come taught me this is my team on this and then Severino can back off and do his own thing the rest of the Yankees back off and do their own thing this were Arab who needs to say okay this is what it means to be a manager I Need to do something like\nThat yeah even if it doesn't make any sense and get get bumped in every way shape or form possible because of how you know responsibilities are split up across the board yeah this is one way you you've got to try to figure out how you take one for the team I don't know that you can\nIn Atlanta she's always find a way out by this controversy and there's a way to do it in this particular case I mean unless you want to just light up you go to one of your hitters and just say you know we had one of those early situations we needed to hear from you I'm gonna have to throw you under the bus for not not ... with writers in scoring physician or\nWhatever the cage and Carlos are away with that yeah exactly but you have to go to one of them because\nWhat's ... what I mean it's it's out of his purview right that's in the bullpen that's being managed away from the manager\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Twitter at how about a fresco Mike at swollen DOMA Jason Smith show with my car and I'm just throwing out drink Carlos ... there's certainly many other players you can throw out there but I was just throw him out there because of you know\nIt's fun to say well and it seems like you just got a brush it off because he's been criticized for that far with Russia whatever it's more noise I'm making thirty million dollars a year for the next twenty five
