true story though not just or at your guy listen it's not a true he did say he knows the knowledge about a true\nStory a but here's where this is a story that play again it plays into what's going on in baseball now\nRocco ball deli thirty seven years old young former player we talked about what the new hires in the NBA we're looking like at ... in the last few years and what was it it was younger head coaches who were former players that have caches with the players who are going to come in and play\nThat here and that's everybody that's been getting jobs who are the guys come in and has got cache will\nNow in baseball it's a little bit different because with the wave front officers want to be involved now front officers want to manage as well as being GM's they want to manage that they want to use analytics and they want to be the ones making up a line up they want to tell a Jay ...\nTo do it David Roberts what to do and here's here's a line up we like this is what we're doing they want to manage they don't want to be down on the field they just want to be the ones making out the line now at that school so Rocco ball deli thirty seven years old first time managers and they've been with the race for the past few years in the front office\nLook at the guys getting pushed out my social out he's in his sixties\nBuck Showalter out Joe ... got one more year and he won the leap and World Series in Chicago lotta lotta\nDown where our cat Joe wants it and he's going to be out that's not the wage are already manages either Joe Jr already could only get to an interview with the reds the pulled himself out on ya and I don't I'm not I'm not crazy I'm not saying that David Bell gets gets denied their so bell\nWho are getting these jobs now teams want young enrolled late ... ex players look at the Yankees in ...\nThey want to be able to say this is the line up we have Aaron Boone here's what we want you to do and they were lined the manager to manage the players\nTo manage relationships but most importantly walk out with the lineup card that\nThey put out and make the changes during the game that the front office once and these are the guys getting jobs these four players who have a cache with teams is okay you know I'll listen to rock oh he's a good dude I'll listen to Aaron Boone Yankee legend the big home run up\nThis is now who's got the older guys are getting pushed out the non analytic friendly\nGuys are getting pushed out even when you get to the GM part things look the Mets\nAs horrible as this GM searches all come out that was great stored it in a ... the the looks like they want Doug Melvin former brewers GM to be their GM he had to go overboard by saying we have to increase or analytics department this is the guy who are year and a half ago said\nIt's time for me to give up the GM job to somebody younger now yeah re energized when we got to keep our analytics department bigger\nOkay great meanwhile who knows even knows and any team analytics really is\nBut this is where it is now you have to be young embrace analytics but more importantly do what we tell you yeah but that's exactly what Rocco about deli is going to do in addition to playing the outfield at the same time for me well you can do that as\nWell I mean because what your match GM's search a Tampa Bay rays senior vice president of baseball operation a guy in bloom or we had a productive meeting yesterday I did a lot of conversation I enjoyed the time we spend together that's it they released the brief statement on his ...\nBut I I Am a little just a ... you know just here here's a here's the search right here's the deal about analytics and belief in it where it is there's two schools of it the Mets have three candidates for their GM job right they have Doug Melvin they've kind bloom who was a young analytics driven executive right and they also have\nA CIA agent who just so happens to be the age range where all the big all the big players the Mets ... old is\nThe guy's got no Brody van Wagner it is is this the other is this other guy that's up for this job so hard to stop you real quick what we're talking about major league baseball you're getting to that point I'm getting there [laughter] so here the Mets and they wanted\nThis this guy to maybe potentially come in and be the manage this GM is the guy who else is hiring him to be the gym nobody but what happened\nAfter the interview apparently it went so well the Mets said hey time would you come out and give a statement talk to the press about it no I just want to put this statement out there the one that you read we had a nice time exchanging baseball\nIdeas in other words yeah da da da da da da da da da da da\nSilva is the Mets search for GM is just this awful but you see the different there's really only two schools of of managers right now there's an old school guys and there's a new school guys who will listen to whatever is said\nAnd then you have a guy like Doug Melvin now who's one is a gym that is an old school guy that says well maybe I have to embrace it a little bit and it's just not going to work if you don't embrace it already it's not going to work that way that I didn't\nRemember at a trade and you're you're seeing a lot of the older managers doubts question can they go into the broadcast booth 'cause you gotta lotta recently retired players if they're not becoming\nCoaches and the minor leagues are going into managers are fast tracking or they're going into broadcasting so you don't even have a a boots spot for a guy like so it

LeBron James the only Lakers in double figures as they look for when number two on the season the Jason Smith show with my ... friend ... live from the guy goes studios and look this just makes sense is that when you are scoring twenty more points a game\nWith a line up then you were the previous one well then okay and I know that okay games three and four gonna be a little bit better than games one or two\nBut it looked like a different team they look what brought actually has a place to go with the basketball Lorenzo bowl is shown I can hit a couple of shots 'cause you know who doesn't it shots like that rage on Rondo so rather than have to go Fifteen or twenty games before the Lakers realize okay or continue to tweak are starting lineup\nYou have seen this now and I you know look just because two games one was closed last when LeBron was missing free throws and and the jumper at the end but still you score a hundred and thirty a hundred and forty points\nThat flood if you've got to roll with and if it's\nIn Roman regime Rondo that are coming off the bench and part of that second unit and Ingram says the focal point of that second unit and he's that guy and and and that's how\nThat makes the Lakers the best they are the that's the line if it has to be that's what if that's going to make the Lakers as good as they aren't Jason art started tonight again second night in a row right that that's got to be the line up and and they got to come off the bench and and Casey pi has to come off the bench and be easily is going to play a few more minutes possibly but this is how it's going to have to be\nGoing to feel pretty good about my second unit if I could use Ingram as the focal point right cause we talk about the scoring ability we talk about the all round a athleticism and him growing into his own\nThat's going to be started if he stays on that first year that 'cause it's still going through a liberal and that doesn't mean you're not going to be able to have some big plays along the way but you're going to be able to maximize what he brings to the table when you look at ... spot a shooter that that's just close they got\nTo a spot I'm sure that's it in ... showing a little more confidence with a jump shot only one of five from the field tonight\nBut last year there were times he wouldn't take the shot he wasn't quite mark helpful but you'd have moments where you can see it was on his mind as to whether we should put the ball up or not so\nHot and you try to plan your strength and it looked like anything at the our analytics semi matchup start to tell you something different\nOr this experiment has a five game run into the scoring average comes back down then you start thinking about it but as long as you guys are understanding in the locker room and I got to think Rondo being part of this Lakers team for all the\n... round there was a great teammate talk we've heard over the last couple of weeks I think he's going to accept his role and be part of that that machine on the second unit\nAnd I think I said I said Jason heart if you've been Josh are obvious Syracuse guy Jason hardest on the brain sure oh by the way can just go
