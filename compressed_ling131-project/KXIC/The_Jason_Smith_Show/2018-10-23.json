the fourth quarter when the falcons driving in controlling the ball and other\nAn illegal snap it's a false start because he's already adjustable turned it over the things that he does he has his hand right next to the ball and what he does is put his hand on the ball and then drop drop it flat\nAnd he doesn't say that but that's not part of the snap emotion stay there with the ball\nAnd they reacted to him dropping the ball after being in a set position and he was in a set position um so I think it's a false start now the difficulty is I agree with him I mean this the way he has been doing that um\nThis is the way he did it pretty much the nine forty three market the fourth quarter I think when they kicked the field goal um but when the game is on the line and you have the game car and go to a game winning vehicle\nYou're gonna get a more intense rushed by the deep end and I think that if you do something like a lunch um which is a false start a little simple Lynch\nIf you'd or something like that I think it's a false start even though even though you have been doing it that way throughout the course of the game so I I'm kind of agreeing with the league here um that that they supported the false start um I bet you however\nThat if we watch next week I bet he doesn't do it I bet you that they tell him that you cannot you cannot dropped the ball like that and I bet you could be some pushback internally that says if you didn't call this the first quarter shoot the color of the last play the game well there was no reaction\nAt any other time this was the only other type of reaction they felt that was corrupt the line of scrimmage official that he threw the flag and his judgment I agree the doesn't um but I I Can't say that that's the reason that the cowboys last

also in that game like we had the jak Prescott play coming up the sideline running and takes a vicious hit goes into concussion protocol a and as always we started going others the quarterback taking a big hit in it spiraled into a bit of a controversy as well as\nWell forget about him being a quarterback he's not a quarterback kept up on these runner I mean anytime you cross the line of scrimmage in your head and I feel your you're treated no different than a a receiver a fallback but I mean you are not considered defenseless and that's the key\nSo if you're not considered to be if you're not considered defenseless\nYou can be hit in the head and neck area with pretty short or pass something like that um you can't be the defender can't leave the crown of his helmet\nAnd make that contact because then that that new illegal use of a helmet but it didn't happen here I mean it was actually it was a brutal hit but it was shoulder it was a shoulder and it was not a helmet hit and so there or not a foul and I think\nPeople have a hard time with that but you have to distinguish between a player that is ... and plus that can't be hit with the shoulders ahead area and a player who is

Fifteen minutes can save your Fifteen\nPercent or more and car insurance more info visit Geico dot com so\nWe just watched the falcons beat the giants twenty three to twenty yeah we did and this is where you want to come down on the side of okay\nThe talent level of auto back them and the talent level of sake one Barclay and being able to realize finally that even if you think their world class talents and oh back I'm certainly is and say caught Barclay maybe on his way\nYou can still have a game where your quarterback froze for three Ninety nine you are running back has a hundred yards a total often said a touchdown\nYou have to wide receivers over a hundred and forty yards and you still can only put twenty points on the board and lose twenty three to twenty you want a senior and go oh this is all he lies falls is is that\nHe lived was twenty seven for thirty eight for three Ninety nine and a touchdown tonight I'll be at some of it did come and garbage time at the end when the giants were down a couple of scores but it doesn't mean it didn't happen\nYou can suck with these guys or without them that's my whole point about auto back from junior he is a great player but do you win with him you don't you can suck without him you can be one in seven without him\nYes he finally got a second touchdown of what else do we dropped a to point conversion late in the game that's old old back him he gives any takes and the bottom line is he's not a difference maker when it comes to wins and losses if he was a difference maker\nYou would wind up seeing the giants at six in one or seven in one and this is not about oh del this is about wide receivers in general that there's so few you can say okay because you have this wide receiver you are a great team it takes more than that\nAnd to say I'm going to give Ninety million 'cause the guys are great talent oh my goodness because he made the one big one handed catch\nAll the other stuff he did that goes along with it why would you do that why would you pay a guy like that you dress acorn Barclay guys looked to be pretty good so far it's going to be six in the NFL in Russia is going to drop down a little bit because he had a bad night tonight you only ran for forty three yards so his talent is is there but\nLook where you are right now you are still one in seven so you have to really good players right the rest of your team stinks well how that all the ... the biggest thing here\nIs defensively you're struggling right you look at uh every now and again you'll get a big play out of a guy like the you lie apple and then there'll be stretches where he's toast and he's beating with regular\nUh we all thought that's not\nOften congratulations on the wind thanks to stop by with us here at Fox Sports radio good luck will talk to you down the road\nAbsolute ... that caused them great stuff very at Austin who were there for a couple of minutes I like it was yeah we knew what there's a lot of anxiety on the sideline well a lot of guiding\nYourself into coaches cap I mean obviously one of the things that blows and like you guys are always in the ... year to get\nMore more wraps more\nTargets along the way and then tonight at a relative basis for him that the big ... to head back to back double digit target couch this one the giants have defended died ends pretty well but it had a couple of big catches\nA in key spots for them a show it's it's the all right stay out of the quarterbacks because he's heard enough of it 'cause I Know who he has got to be here and but for the head coach\nAnd curiosity right now because certainly the Atlanta Falcons with the start to the season as you alluded to as Austin came on is\nThey were one of the presumptive Super Bowl favorite\nSo now it's a question can you bounce things together now wins over Tampa Bay and the giants you're saying well they're not world beating teams you know what you got to be who's on the schedule the long road begins with that first step back and they've taken advantage even even if they're narrow victories in the in the box score a win win\nYou know I Know you just off the field they spend a couple of minutes with us and that was great and he's still roll with the question about the two point conversion he's he's someone that the savvy enough to know boy that to point conversion was was a pretty big deal and the giants going for it you know even though they said they knew what was going to happen\nIf they do get it and this is the whole point surrounding the ... thing you don't often said listen there was a lot of anxiety or the finally going for two if they go for two and get it suddenly a touchdown beats us and touched on an extra point beats us instead of just changes\nWhat the ... game plan comes to that next possession and we can get into some other time management another ... miss cues in terms of decision making\nBut here and we're going to hear from pat germ are coming up in a few minutes he's he's talking to the media now and he's talking about his decision to go for two which has become the big story of this game one coach goes for two when they don't have\nNo idea I Know oh they're backing junior just catches the ball nobody cares right and I asked ... gutsy and he was ...\nI told you about auto Beck and this is what you get you get a guy's going to have an forty odd receiving and then you need a big point a to point conversion he drops it but for everybody who you know in the timeline now and so somebody has been saying this is the right call you get down by a touchdown the math works all of these things or you know that this happens it's the right call us the right call\nHere's the thing if it was the right call everybody would do it\nIf it was the right call everybody when you're down to touchdowns you score to go down a touchdown everybody would go for two they don't do it no but it but I\nKnow Jason I mean the the math says that you should\nGo forward on fourth in short I'm most points to the field yet traditionally nobody went for\nSo getting coaches out of that dinosaur era has been hard enough this is a whole other quantum\nWait al yeah but this is the Quander road there and all of this this is also what we talk about gaining and losing and what a coach has to gain is so little\nBy this making baby you get it's a fifty percent place like throwing a jump ball and the ends up so you're telling me well we get the two point diversion fifty percent of the time okay so if the games on the line to throw the jump all the end zone no of course that's a stupid play nobody does it all\nSeems or stopping to do that that's a stupid you wouldn't do that but you're going to go for two when going for to still put you down a touchdown late\nYou're still doesn't cut you've got to kick a field goal to you're still down a touchdown when you're only going to get the ball back one more time you're not going to be able to kick to field goals you're going to get the ball back one more time you still need to go down the field and get a touchdown\nSo that's all you have to gain is just oh if we scored a touchdown another one we can win what you have to lose is incredible amounts of criticism\nAnd you're bringing in a whole bunch of attention on something that really isn't worth it it's it's to to do that when the gain is so minimal but what you lose by that is is so much bigger\nThat should stop people from doing it because you know what everything is played on a field and you can say yeah for some time you would get it you would think fifty percent of the time oh back and look at your past writing those numbers and he didn't catch it\nWell the other side of it is also it's going to be magnified based on where the giants are record wise\nThe giants are are foreign to it's a different animal altogether\nTwitter out how about a ... good microphones dome we got ... and a big thing from twenty twelve it affects the world

hundred cats I see what I heard\nRadio [noise] Fox Sports trendy and\nMy Night Football action the game is in the south and tell them off the giants twenty three twenty and the law so down back um junior became the fast history he reads the five thousand career receiving yards market in fifty four games but again it was that landed on the twenty three twenty when\nIt's always a key 'cause you're still going to have to play defense they don't on side kick incidents in areas as well which is leaving me confused yeah one of the ... not going to get ... and quarterback sneaks when you've got no time to time management clock management sure she'll be getting murder for those not necessarily for this particular call 'cause\nWell here's here's why does here I'm going to go math I I Love all the maps were doing your your your don't do math um it'd be interesting and\nIs that what's the what's it easier to do you have a fifty percent let's let's put it right at fifty percent to get a to point conversion right so that means you're going to get one and you're gonna miss when you don't want to do math sure so if you get one and you miss one then that's still going to be fourteen point still\nThat's fine but here's the thing Jason is then we're still tied right if I get my fifty percent right then you're taught by man I've got another coin flip for overtime which is another point what I don't want to have if I don't\nYeah but you still both a new rule changes it's not as big a deal is okay we're we're gonna we're going to give the ball up a team's going to go but it's maybe like mystic well\nI mean obviously it's a new world order with a ten minute clock and we've got a few ties to show for it but you're you're still adding the extra variable of an overtime where you can still news\nOr you can win I mean if I didn't let it to another ... even if the coin flip at this point statistically it's it's if you wanted to do\nThe two point conversion is it easier\nTo convert a fifty percent play twice\nOr is it easy to convert an eighty five percent play twice because that's about what ... what extra points\nOr they get eighty but again we're going to the philosophy of MIT playing for the extra ten minutes\nOr do I want to win and when you're when you're playing like so now you're going to win if you go for ... counts going to overtime I'm Sorry that you're down to two touchdowns but now if you're a scoring two touchdowns late you have the momentum going in you moved up and down the field\nYou're trying to win to put all of it on a fifty fifty play and that's really that's not what have you here and that's what my ... he put it on a fifty fifty play to win or lose the gator I Need I Need a better percentage of that if I were to put it on that plane is\nGetting a to point conversion what say Seventy five or eighty percent yeah I'm with ya okay that's the math I can say look three to four times you're going to get it All right fine but fifty percent it it's it's not worth it well but\nIt but that's that's a different scenario right now you're playing it to overtime but you're going fifty fifty you're going fifty fifty\nOr between converting the two point conversion at the end of the game like the titans tried and then whether you can win and on overtime or sugar didn't match don't make sense\nI let's listen to ... try to explain the math and going for two here he is a couple of minutes ago explaining it to the media\nFrom an offensive perspective it got to score touchdowns we get down there and again we did a good job of moving the ball we got a score touchdowns and\nI'm sure you have some questions about the a to point play I just felt like you know we've discussed you know internally the math on that I just felt like I felt like we had a good play and I I like to point play selections and we just didn't quite get it done but\nAt the end there you saw had they not kicked a field goal I felt good about our second two points lay which we scored on a gym so [noise] um [noise]\nYou know I felt like I wanted to be aggressive for guys [noise] ah you know I saw I saw where it went forward on 'em for them they were struggling to move the ball we're that close again we felt like we had to play [noise]\nYou know I think initially I thought oh deli popped open for my view I the coverage is probably a little tighter than what I've seen 'em and so uh so\nEli extended the play a little bit you know you saw Iran on one of the negatives earlier in the dry maybe thinking it could run and then um and it was a little tighter coverage on the rest of the guys so\nWe didn't get it done [noise] um [noise] again [noise] shouldn't be any questions about how\nHard our guys fight we just got an extra ... percent a nice place to place and I'm\nSo those are things that we can point to as we move forward we aren't doing the ... we're getting ready to play Washington Redskins here in about six days standing in the back immigration chatting about fifty percent if you go for it and make it there [noise]\nSo that's that's what you do because then if we scored a touchdown we just kick the extra point when that felt good about the two point play you guys saw that I think we've got the ball in Iraq and we just didn't connect on [noise]\nI went right here and so I'm like how he just says I like it says you agreed to by fifty percent if you get it ... the word in there that's the operative is if it's not like it's a fate accompli or it's a great chance it's a fifty fifty play and that's an unnecessary risk\nYou know if it was like I said if it was higher I could see it but it said what if what if they're okay it's it's this is outsmarting yourself and thinking okay this math I'm going to try to embrace it and see if it really works but as you can see that's not the case\nAnd I understand everything you're going to tell me about this and I understand every bit of math but now he says well if we got it we just need to get that one at the end and then as you saw we got it\nAll right let's go back you didn't get the first one\nSo now you eat a fifty fifty play just to tie the game if you get that touchdown you're also going down and feel getting a touchdown and men having another two point play that you're going to run\nSo now suddenly instead of an extra point that makes it twenty to Thirteen\nYou need a to point conversion justify it just to get the overtime which is the coin flip you say it is\nSo that's still is it worth it to me because it is a toss up play and that's what that's what nobody wants to continue on to go well if it's fifty five or forty seven or forty eight or fifty sometimes at six ... that's not good enough that that that's the I I don't want a chance like that if I mean if I Need something to succeed\nRight do I want a Ninety percent chance of something or do I want a fifty fifty three percent chance of something I wasn't ... percent ya I'd rather do something Ninety percent twice than fifty percent one out of two or two out of two that that's just just how I look at things and I understand\nYou know when people talk about the math says yeah in a vacuum it does but there are so many other things that you have to realize could derail that play and there's more things to derail a to point conversion then there are to derail an extra point well\nObviously this is now another part of the statistical sample that'll take it to less than fifty percent\nDriving you could Jason ... now it's under fifty ... you'll you'll feel slightly better about your your your Mike Mike under coaches who are really smart they would do a Bill Belichick would do it all the time\nRight now by if certainly if there was a better chance for them to when he would do it every single time we're going to hear why well matter you know he would do it other really\nMike Tomlin would do it many of my time on already does almost always ... when they when we got rid of where they what they may go they go through a lot in life but that but that was just saying we're going to do it every single time not when the math tells us we're down where here where this with that but I noticed they don't do it as much anymore\nBut many other teams would do it it would become a it would become a bigger thing other coaches they would say hey okay\nBut that's the question of in all sports in all of life you need first adopters you need those first couple of coaches just say you know what here's what the math says here's what history tells us about\nAbout over time periods and wins and losses and whatever else and and do we want to put ourselves there and and I think for patch on their part of it was what's the limit at one of those burials what's kick overtime to the curb because we don't we can't stay for another ten minutes now used to be Fifteen\nYou know who else needed new adopters new coke never got it well I was a bad product\nThis was the last big trade of the former Dodgers for an office now Andrew Freeman comes in and things are run differently\nWith the Dodgers ever make a trade like this again of course not but because this trade went so bad the Dodgers D to well we have to change our philosophy in how we do things so now they're more Moneyball came in a bit of a different attitude a different way of doing business and what are the Dodgers done they built the team that is very deep\nSay a four guys on the bench every night that could start for almost any other team in the major leagues they had a pretty good bullpen\nAnd they've they've been able to develop a couple of young starting pitchers so they've not relied on ... and now where are they back to back World Series\nSo had they not gone through this really bad time of\nBoy the bloated contracts and the and the and and the guy's making twenty million a year is not working out for us they would not have changed course and they don't change course there are still sitting somewhere trying to compete in the west and they're just a team like the Mets were going to sign a bunch of guys give them some money for a couple of years and see if they can hit home runs\nThat's not how this team is built and now you can take it a step further\nAnd say All right the team is built this way do you think they're going to give many channels three hundred million and the off season you think they're going to extend Clinton Kurdish offer seven more years of two hundred and fifty million do you think they're going to go give Bryce Harper three hundred million\nThat's not what this Dodgers front office does so not only are they built the world series caliber team two years in a row but they've also giving you a window into okay maybe we're not down for these guys were seven eight years like Bryce Harper is going to want like what ... going to want if the ... and like what many McDonald's gonna want\nSo there's that there's the the current part for the Dodgers and the future aspect as well and that's the\nBiggest part of any of these organizations you strip it down to the studs you go back to what the cubs did they changed out their whole scouting team changed out a lot of the front office went to the analytics and all of a sudden what did you have a total\nGrowth of homegrown players that became major contributors across the board ship good draft strategy and then throughout their minor leagues they they ... up and changed out a number of managers and coaching\nAt each level to try to do at Dodgers same thing right where you you you have a you still have money to guys I mean you you have a you're printing cash\nOr when it comes down to it and you have the brings truck at your disposal given ownership and what you want to do but\nYou needed those home drunk guys and now you get to have the the ... decision making process of a Machado of a harbor you can do it you want to do it for eight years were you looking at hey we'll we'll give you a little extra juice but what's what's agree on three or four years we don't want to be locked in especially because some of these younger guys you're\nGonna have to pay them but that's a decision that the Dodgers had to make and that the Yankees have to make a going forward is that you've got a lot of his own drone Taliban hasn't gotten there the big novelty check yet\nSo there are all lining up soon enough so we'll see what the next generation of is but certainly going back to that trade you saw the organizational philosophies differ and now here we are ready for what should be a fun fall classic\nTurnaround on a fresco Mike at swollen don't the Jason Smith show ...\nFriend my garment\nTonight Show brought to you by discover card we treat you like you treat you\nComing up in a minute we'll give you our official picks for the world series who the biggest X factors are but right now speaking of X factors there's a couple of big ones going on right now in LA the Lakers and liberal on a big nip tuck battle with the spurs Deb Carson has that and more with what's trending that ain't right\nIn fact the Lakers had a and they just tied the game is one of five apiece now for the Lakers and the spurs\nOf course Brennan anger ... suspended tonight so Cal ... he leaves the Lakers with twenty eight points LeBron James just Seventeen\nOn six at fourteen shooting and again right now as I look at it it's one of five apiece for San Antonio and the Lakers eight fifty six to go in the fourth quarter warriors are the ones while they find home lead over the sun's fourth quarter early overtime in Portland\nWizards lead the trailblazers one fourteen one Thirteen we now know the starting rotation at least for the first three games for LA in the world series Cleveland curse shallow beyond the hill for game one\nTuesday at Fenway aid eastern first\nPitch and I really want to win the world series I think that's no different than the other fifty guys and both locker room so I think it doesn't [noise] I think the only difference maybe as a because we've gotten so close in the past because we've got to go to the post season are a little bit spoiled and our expectations every year with the Dodgers which was a great thing to crush\nOn starting for the Dodgers Chris Sale on the hill from Boston game to ... versus David Price\nAnd we now know Walker Mueller will be on the hill friday back in LA for game three no starter named just yet for Boston online car shopping can be confusing not any more of a true price from drew car now you know the exact price will pay for your next car visit to car to enjoy it more confident car buying experience and Monday Night football finally falcons\nEdging the giants twenty three twenty Atlanta improving their three and four\nGiants a dismal one in six to start the season\nWell this'll unless your tank condemn it as you're happy wanted [laughter] yes how are you going to get from quarterback this time no no no no I don't want her to get another running back because that's so good we are always got a couple more years then I don't do any of them\nWere alive and the guy goes studios were Fifteen minutes can save you Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance more info visit Geico dot com\nHey Jason there was a a big moment in this Lakers first game right before the fourth quarter they bring the fan out and a half court shot drained it for thirty grand wow that tried to head over to the Lakers bench security stop them from getting any closer\nTo really try to get to the best wanted to go get high security just then I'm going to die way past the other way like oh hey I I'm ready to go look at first shooter ready to go ready to go look at my age I'm going to turn out to be the best head\nCoach the Lakers possibly could have after what could turn out tonight your Lakers and the spurs no absolutely one hundred percent my idea of what I said could happen is actually happening at this moment for the Lakers\nSeems like you should go out and buy some lottery ticket might be a prize in it for ...\nReally quick I told you the\nBrawl on Saturday that saw this is actually the brand name drugs and rage on Ron do you may not be the worst thing for the Lakers because number one sometimes brawls like that brings teams together number two\nThe Lakers may need the shot making of ... more than they need the athleticism of ... this is because the team is built about around LeBron James and he knows what he needs to succeed\nDoes it mean Brennan anger is less talented than ... ... what it means they'll this may be what the Lakers all fence needs and so far tonight what's going on with the spurs and the Lakers won ten one oh nine\nKyle coups my has thirty he's twelve for Twenty one from the floor the Lakers were down by Eighteen and the first quarter they have battled back to take the lead LeBron James closing in on a triple double twenty points nine assists and seven ... so\nUh I Will be replacing Luke Walton has Lakers head coach end up probably will sort of the next game\nGive it a couple more games they LeBron might decide to do that anyway [laughter]\nBut we'll give you more on this again there is still six and a half minutes to go in the game Lakers and the spurs versus the big three ball so now they're up one Fifteen to one ten days but with the world series coming up tomorrow give your official picks for the fall classic and\nOne of the big X factors as what's going to lead me to my pick okay for the red Sox bullpen is a very big X factor because\nThis is a bad bullpen and they could regress to the mean in the world series they have been the second best bullpen behind the Dodgers overall the playoffs and I think that's no coincidence the two teams that are playing for the world series both have the ... the Dodgers bullpen Red Sox bullpen\nBetter than the brewers bullpen but but how do you think they know is right on the\nLine over the course of the regular season what do we talk about here in Los Angeles where we come from the guy goes studios [noise] a lot about that both at gambling ... health but also is a\nPropensity to give up ... shot mhm

do that night towards the man I'm going to play that guy again\nWhat here's what's going to happen I like the Dodgers in five I Know they're the underdogs but it was good they had to grind the get here [noise] it was in the year they had last year where everything went right you want a couple of guys got hurt it doesn't matter they grind it again here\nThere are more prepared for the world series and they were a year ago [noise]\nCraig kimbrell is the biggest of the Boston X factors he has been very on trustworthy in the bullpen supposedly his issues have been fixed he had a conversation with former Dodger closer Eric ... not tipping pitches\nAnd supposedly the issues are six foot still Craig kimbro is a high wire a Red Sox fans cringe every time he comes into the game
