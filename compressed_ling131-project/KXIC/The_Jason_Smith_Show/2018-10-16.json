Sam's Adam caplin cap I think over how healthy as Aaron Rodgers questions and go away after tonight right\nEven if you play on one leg it's incredible the balance that he he knows how to cut a manipulated body you saw that on the left drivers really incredible but there was some sort of thing this threat because of the bad they've got an emcee all spring and fall and Bruce and that left me and it's it\nIt doesn't get better by players just going to take time to heal and its own uh he's definitely sword you could see with thing but the fact that matters discuss a superstar truly a credible what he's been able to do and [noise]\nI feel bad for the matters they blew that game I I I hate to say because I I think how can how Shanahan the head coach\nThe great play color but when ... when they started just trying to run the ball man you're playing it right the Packers hands because if you don't score touchdowns when you run into football you're given a right back to Roger ... soldiers able to do both about\nI was curious the the interception at the end that there wasn't much of a review to it because it looked like it it kind of rolled off his shoulder towards the towards the ground instead were quickly lined up in a way Aaron Rodgers goes and once he had the ball there were there was no stopping him\nYeah I was surprised by that yeah it's funny I saw that and I\nSee a replay I didn't hear that they they they actually voted interception other than what we saw so look the bottom line is I'm\nCal Shanahan was being aggressive there and I don't blame him at the end I mean he again where they were running the ball a little bit too much then\nThey're like you know what we need to go forty finally did it and could ever had a really good game and that the the one turnover Beth or had a ... unfortunately the most important one because of that got Rogers the ball back in this crazy thing was from a time strategy standpoint\nMike mccarthy called us time outs way too early he caught all three of them between three and four minutes left\nWhich really didn't make a lot of sense but\nRight [laughter] I really didn't seem to need any time left as credible just incredible to me you know\nThe fun thing you know Rogers play well but you talked about it you know here's the thing cc method when he played last year he was pretty good you know ... was on the bench raw before he got the job and that they're getting it for ... this year he's been even a little bit better than he was last year I think the niners have a guy that can play\nHe definitely um when you look at him last year lucky play before like they wanted him to but because of circumstances Brian hoard and play well then you're left the team wants to wait in line and\nHave the kid got to play and I think all that viable time has really helped him and that that strike actually both throws were great to Markey's going especially the first one a good one as a ... touchdown passes in game\n... this is again but they're they're going to look back and see how the heck did we lose this tonight that that that one's going to be I mean they're going to want to five now the Packers go to three to and what I mean the ... this last night the niners really their defense for three quarters of the game was actually a very competitive but in the fourth quarter Aaron Rodgers took over like you you normally does\nFound that separation by sports radio the Jason Smith show with my current company and the guy goes studios on the hotline with a serious XM NFL insider you follow him on Twitter at capital N. NFL somebody Adam capital and make\nUse weekly visit with us here a following Monday Night football and Adam when we look at the situation going towards the well we're getting to the midpoint of the season which is frightening to say as much as we wait for the NFL in ... in a blinding speed goes bad says oh we're still waiting for maybe on bell to walk through that door\nAt one point with James Caan are dominating like whole Khamenei and the eighties or do they just tell him to beat it [laughter]\n[noise] well look again and we talked about this probably three or four weeks ago last shows up on which I still think it's going to be next week because remember\nAnd it's the SPN reporters that was done by Germany or something and I had heard it was going to be in before the before the the team returns from the by now if you don't do that I wave the flag I've no idea what he's doing\nA cup but that's what it is ... it's called on much longer than we structure um and I talked to a couple of agents are actually yesterday and today said their clients and these are some prominent players have not heard from Les beyond bell\nRemember now we want he told us teammates you've shown up you know the three of us have talked about this sure we fast forward it now and those same teammates who thought based on his word that he was showing up\nThey have not heard from so they're not really sure what to say to the bottom line is is a drag on but you you make an excellent point here because when it comes back look he's going to be making\nEight hundred and fifty five thousand dollars a week so he's going to take over but eventually I don't think it happens early on because he has been practiced a since last December so he had to kind of shape is then they'll have they'll have a ... they will request to Russia exemption which will be two weeks and um\nIt's gonna be fascinating to see what happens here because they're often to look the officers not the problem with the Steelers defense is is the issue a you know they're they're starting to get it to get a little bit but the bottom line is take nothing away from ... really quite well but they'd be on bills but a football player and that's why eventual takeover once you've returns\nAnd you see one of the other big stories coming off yesterday we saw the raiders have a very an inspired effort in London against the Seattle Seahawks and there's all rumors now that there could be a big big sell off and John Gurdon trying to buy and sell some more time to be ... Cooper on the trading bloc could be some others what do you think happens next few weeks with Oakland\nYeah a lot of players are available in fact it's hard to come talk to them several personnel people around the league it's hard to find one player who they are not willing to trade of maybe their car than their cars a guy that they want to build around\nOr John Gordon does this is one of the things you wanted to she wanted a franchise that quarterback was never really worked with\nUs if you look at over screw with Brad Johnson and and ... and ... and others and rich Gannon though we he would he would he would really help rich Gavin no question but who is rich Gannon before he got was younger it was a journeyman this is the first time he's worked with a really talented quarterback and the timing is off in between\nA car and and as and receive some towns yet I mean this was a new often said he's wearing it's very structured and it's it's taking some time\nBut the big story here is that John us personnel control and they're going to blow up the defenses I understand it after the season's over going into a frenzy that directly bloated defense up a ... in a big way or they just don't have you know they have a bunch of young kids on on\nOn the line but at linebacker on the secondary they're going to make some ... sort of a veteran changes and if they could just get some trades done by the thirtieth get some extra draft picks\nFox Sports radio show at first I Want my heart wearing shorts herbal herbal underwear purple hat Gerald Jersey\nOn this side of ... you are

missing grim is about ... not a good it's not a good connotation for positivity\nNo I I agree with you you wouldn't you wouldn't know oh you know you're going to go there for for dinner tonight oh yeah have you seen the majority of commercials 'cause you don't want that it's it's I Know grim is is a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad character\nWell which is why he didn't get a lot of run no man and they really tried to feature the hamburger or\nWherever they could and all the coloring pages everything there's always going to have you on your and your name and everything and every day if anybody does own any of those those old figures that used to align the McDonald's play lots that have been retired let me know if you got a line somewhere I'd love a hamburger\nOr at about a fresco Mike at swollen dome we're coming off a thrilling Monday Night football victory for the Green Bay Packers Aaron Rodgers ends up going for four twenty five through the air to touchdown and leading the Packers with no time outs\nNinety or really eighty yards down field from just inside of his own ten down to the nine or ten yard line in about a minute and a half\nWhere Mr Cosby then kicks the game winning field goal\nTo give the Packers the thirty three to thirty victory and for Rogers his second phenomenal game in a row is now five touchdowns no picks the last two games he's thrown for nearly nine hundred yards and even though Rogers was this good tonight this is my\nPoint we talked about this last week on the show for a little bit is that this is probably the most mediocre the NFL has been in a long time even teams that are really good\nHow much do you believe in that the only two teams you believed in more than anybody else coming the games this weekend were the cheese and the rams patriot now you put the patriots in 'cause they beat the chiefs and it seems like they have they're often rolling again\nBut even if he liked the Packers me there three to one and do they look like real bitter still they escaped and I guess a forty nine or seen the quite frankly at home and Monday Night you should have beaten by two touchdowns\nIt it's still the good teams that we expected to come into this year or just okay so far the Packers are okay the Minnesota Vikings are okay the Steelers are okay two teams that are high profile the Seahawks the cowboys they're just met all the teams that are normally good or the expectations are high profile\nThey're they're just under achieving its you know everybody likes parity in the NFL is I Love it and everybody wants you ever felt to be an eight neatly\nYeah yes and no because you had to exciting because you think your team is in it but if you're looking for a really good football really good football teams\nIt's hard to find teams to believe and there's less than four teams in the NFL you can say I believe in these teams one hundred percent you got the rams you have the chiefs and yeah the patriots falling off that list from last week or the jaguars and now look like they don't even know which end up after getting drove by the team that has no weapons at wide receiver\nFantastic effort by the Dallas Cowboys colds easily underneath the running game\nOf Eliot I'm Prescott maggots plays with his legs so ... and ... and we've talked about all or at least at least\nTried to ban the drum for the Dallas defense against a wondering when the fickle and debate comes in in the form of the league office on your mark sports but otherwise you'll get out of ... that can do some damage Cincinnati falls off a little bit\nYeah but still it's forty points against the jaguars defense red often I mean defense great but that's forty jaguars deep forty point\nWell but a lot of effects that we're expecting to do great things I didn't and it's a good thing that we're up against it so I Can't go on a forty five minute rant about the bears and unless you're a sad Enron pressures and making ... Wyler walk on water\nThat's okay we have time to get\nTo that and the fact the jets or a game out of first place how about you Sam ... and say oh\nWe have more on Monday Night football more on the you know the ads were just getting started Fox\n[noise]\nJulie Leslie seal oh to Howard group Oscar with my fourth and our ... director of operation it was overwhelming running again today and being yellow with scientists in the job I can hit with impressive what really connected with me when I'm passionate Oscar was about ... logical this operation\nWe started to get the next town that led to process blown databases match al development when he became a geek I ...

weeks in a lot of these issues are age they reduced to embers [noise]\nSome [noise] go into the room can you hear a tornado fire to like White Heat so\nI Love the passion and the willing to say that knows what the intensity of the if he died [noise]\nGetting that note [noise] then gosh darn die [noise]\nYou'll get it [noise] and it sounds like that 'cause you can't get it sounds like that unless you're willing to put all of it and it's good to to the point of like if you get a stroke by goodness they get the stroke [noise] new to the list of ... when we play like that people are going to feel it keep\nListening to my heart radio for more Santana ends all your favorite artists [noise]\n'cause I guarantee you if that play doesn't get out of bounds things go a little bit differently for the parents they go a little bit because they you know they they still struggle little bit to get up to the line of scrimmage and run but he gets out of bounds so they can run and call and then it's the big Aaron Rodgers scramble up the middle of the field it's to have that kind of\nGrace under pressure in the final minute or two minutes of the game is is is just\nIt separates everybody and it separates Rogers and Brady from everybody else because not everybody can do that Peyton Manning couldn't always do that\nYou know some guys are good at it some guys are better at the end the games and they are in the middle of games 'cause they think too much\nAnd they you know they they don't process information is fast they ship at the end the games\nThings beat up and they're good at it other quarterbacks a really bad at it\nAnd they're really good but you get to the final ... minutes it's like\nWe're not getting down the field but just not the kind of team he's not the kind of quarterback we can't make the big throws we can't make the throws on time we're not going to get up to the ... up to the field and time is going to be a question about play calling play calls you in the coming from the sidelines could be a late play call so were you sitting there working out the signals 'cause they changed the play whatever's on the field\nAnd there is that indecisive ... and some people never get it\nAnd when you have that kind of advantage I mean you wonder why these guys are winning so many games during the playoffs every year because of that how many times have you seen them at the end the games nothing is too big no time is is too little even with no time outs going up and down the ... well that's\nOne of the things that we've heard from breeze and radio a lot of their quotes about longevity particularly Brady and all the interviews he's done that that Tom against time and all that stuff is just everything's slower right you just you've seen every situation so your mind\nProcesses it added to normal pace instead of All right the clock is running and you're feeling that pressure it's go let's go up and make a play on what's going execute and\nHowever they're able to convey that to the other ten guys on the field that's the amazing thing right because those guys are hall of fame Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady type participants and yet they get it too and it all slows down that they're able to get that calm in what's left of huddles\nAround the NFL but to get their players in the proper proper\nPerspective and performance and and getting guys to to do things the right way I mean we've seen how many teams beset by running backs you fight for an extra yard and then they're held in violence\nIn this case Montgomery who's not even I mean I guess he's still the number one they must really hate Aaron Joan de count your average over five yards and carry but you're not getting on the field\nNow not getting on the field sit down and you sit next to me you're sitting next to many okay that's\nWhere you're going to come after the guys averaging five point nine of caring for the year yet he can't get more than eight touches\nIt's you know what ... and and you wonder at the end it's because we trust time Montgomery more than we trust Aaron John whenever Jones have gotten out of bounds stomach I mean okay gotta get out and enjoy the getting back\nTo the right a guy who's been as effective as Jones is yet it's Montgomery again on the money\nWell and ... and it's also McCarthy being for all the criticism he get whenever the Packers start going bad McCarthy gets criticized like McCarthy's fault is calling at everything all these bad looking at is they're all last meanwhile live across the is a heck of a coach and he always\nIs able to have his players not so much being well disciplined but always knowing the right place to make knowing when I Can't fight for the extra yard I'm not going to be a pile on here and try to put the ball over the goal what\nThis is again what Bill Belichick and Mike mccarthy do that many other coaches can't get their players to do they can't get them to stop being heroes or to or to realize I'm going to fight for this extra five yards and that's the wrong place to make\nBecause now you're stuck in ... and now you're spiking the ball but it's it's making the smart plays and being able to do in the final minutes look\nThe three best quarterbacks I've ever seen as far as at the end of games right\nKennel Brian Richard ... the three best quarterback\nAt the end the games in my life ... they took their helmets off the disgust better than anybody else [laughter] this is going back to when I started really been able to watch what's been going back to the modern era like the eighties and beyond when I when I really started watching football and the three guys that are the best at the end of the game I've ever seen Joe Montana\nTom Brady Aaron Rodgers and there's no coincidence that on the list the best quarterbacks of all time these are the guys that are going to be up there\nI look in Reno was great in the final two minutes the fourth quarter as well you know Peyton Manning was pretty darn good these guys are just a little bit better because overall their teams function more as a as a as a whole better\nThan their teams that cause like Dan Marino lost a lot of shootouts Peyton Manning lost a lot of shootouts but these three guys and there's a reason why hey ...\nWhat do they have in common there all different styles of quarterbacks but they all do when in the final two minutes they can get it done time outs doesn't that three times know tend not to makes no difference give me a minute on the clock that's all I Need\nAnd you know what it's just appropriate on this day we're celebrating all things Milwaukee because of the Packers and the brewers they're\nLike ... ... ...\nThe American advertising federation present an ad week DC\nAn annual conference primary a marketing advertising in communications professionals this year's event be your friends like Mars National Geographic envy mom oh sure such as box Daily Caller in CNN speakers from agency said just be adamant in whatever way if you're a member of the marketing and advertising community there's no better\nPlace to further your education and\nFive times the most iconic brand and the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now pie time investor dot com dome is your chance to be part of history and uh making busy at high time investor dot com that high times investor dot com high times holding\nThe same thing especially if you're a team is a not putting runners on or when they are they continually fail to either get 'em over or get them or get them in as the the Dodgers did over\nThere they didn't get them out either no even get on an early it didn't get them over and they didn't get them to end up\nYou attempts that they had a failed miserably in ... that pitches well out of the strike zone\nI just don't I mean at this point if I'm Dave Roberts I don't care about what the pitching match up is\nCody balance ... I Can't put them in the lineup well Cody Ballenger is one for twenty four in the playoffs and his final out that he had the night that he runs a second and third\nYou know possibly a slams his bat down really hard mentally he is lost\nAnd I know that it's ...\nAnd he's great and he's and he had a phenomenal rookie season but he looks now like you did in the world series last year where he got lost\nAnd I can't wait for him to figure his way out of it growing dollars just an energy suck\nHe can't field you can hit I mean it's it's tough I mean these are the tough decisions it's not like you don't have guys you can put in the Dodgers have guys on the bench where it's like boy there for starting caliber players that are on the bench every game because they're playing the matches and I get playing the match ups\nBut with the way the brewers go to the ... lefty righty lefty\nYou're gonna wind up having left these bad against left these righty bats against regularly you read that week about against already\nThat electric because he's got kinda reverse splits but it really doesn't matter at this point it's like you have to put guys out there that are getting hit and there's not a lot of guys can do it so when you look around and I go to the two guys that are just absolutely killing you in the order or ... back to back\nAnd it's really hard ... tonight\nEvery time you came up with a runner on base every single time and he grounded out into a forest play or a double play or struck out or popped up Ron Dahl Canfield can't hit you did have a a double life but it was one of those blue doubles at that saw the the the you know that saw the ground and bouncing the stand\nThose are the guys I say you know I Need something else you need some kind of energy and that is always what will\nPush a team to the next level is that if you don't have energy like he can Hernandez says it's a lineup overhaul and you're ... you're not you're not putting guys in there sitting on your bench you're putting guys in that would normally play maybe they don't play depending on the pitching match up and I'm thinking oh begins all is maybe a game for\nBut it it doesn't matter you have to put guys in that you think you're gonna hit that can jumpstart the office a little bit that's where guys after that\nThere is the second part coming from ... as they had to do a great job of showing up impact in the stadium every night and I think a lot of passion for the team tonight for whatever reason I guess as contagious as energy can be from the fans of the players was players from the fans Tonight Show he went back in the fans saying they had no energy so we had no ...\nYeah it's it's it's their fault I mean he doubled down on its yeah the fan you know I I get a jumped on your back and made you have runners at scoring busy that I didn't know that I see that's what I mean hey it on I buy\nEnergy like can I Do that like if if me rooting Sam Donald on so bravely from three thousand miles away it's waiting on social media can I get the energy of social media and the jets up so much that he throws a touchdown if you really are you might get his hair to move can I Do that now he's at the helmet on so I don't even hear to move because I mean when our\nOff he's got Hartman hell he does he does yes he does have Hartman late it's higher than I later liars high and and it's back a little bit\nAway he almost looks like Todd for breaking [laughter] have you seen the trailers with a new a like a movie no that was pretty pretty fire will take a look\nOr Tonight Show brought the abide discover card we treat you like you treat you you'll hear from Dave Roberts Dodgers manager coming up in one minute but first let's check in with Deb Carson and find out what his trend in DC\nWell guys it was a pretty exciting game actually forty niners had control most of the game until the late interception by CJ that there and he threw it Kevin king take it off\nGave Aaron Rodgers time to drive down the field set up the game winning field owned by Mason Crosby said the Packers would be the forty niners thirty three thirty San Francisco false one in five Aaron Rodgers and the Packers improve the three to an wind the cue the after the land\nI don't know if it was the seasons and I mean when for us but they're definitely um was an important one especially with the uh front
