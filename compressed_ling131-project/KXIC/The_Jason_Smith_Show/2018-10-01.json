down\nBut I'm I'm intrigued by this this is around the time of year where we start projecting who might be on the hot seat who might be gone and obviously huge accent falls right on that all you had to do is watch some of the plays that Cleveland is made and apathetic they've been consistently under his watch until they brought in Baker may feel with\nThat said you see urban Meyer you consider him to have a style that can be successful in the NFL is going to translate to the NFL game I tend to think so Arnie\nBut I'm not a hundred percent sold that uh Brian Kelly would or even now you start looking at Stanford and kind of how they've struggled well I mean they often Notre Dame yeah I don't know if if that would be a guy that you look at it instead of an urban Meyer I think he's the one guy you look at it right now you can bring in and be a good coach of the NFL\nIf you're going to bring somebody and you want to make a big splash you want a name you want that everybody knows in the Ohio area or somebody that is going to get the brown fans excited a coach or that you that you may run out and get season tickets just to go ahead\nAnd you know somebody like the way the right has brought in grew in somebody that's got a massive name names urban Meyer you don't have to look much further than that\nYou know do I have found as we segue to the other side of that Brown's raiders game today man when it gets out how much a guy makes that is held over them as far as had coaches concern over anybody players or is that oh my gosh and\nAgain I'm not sitting here booming for John grew in his salary a salary in English but when I get my goodness you would ... you would think I was reading I Love my frame and he's one of my favorite NFL riders\nWhat you would think that the Mike Freeman needed a point to the ... to let someone no where John grew in touch them based on his most recent article that he wrote about him I mean I'm just sitting back and thinking\nWe really will take it to an ... degree\nWhenever we see a guy that's making an exorbitant amount of money and you would have to think earnings we take this full circle back to Cleveland might do they would have to play pay a pretty exorbitant amount of money to go swing for the fences with a guy like an urban Meyer or David shark whomever it might be needed to try to get them out of either Columbus or\nStanford or if you do go after Brian Kelly Notre Dame if that's what's next in Cleveland right you got to pay a lot of money\nIt those two things you know you did to pray away a coach one is obviously the money or to is his interests um interest to me has to be like one hundred percent because if I'm ever in my I'm so bitter over what happens if he thinks he's so right that he was wrong by the university and everybody in charge here\nI don't see how we could even stay I think the interest level is higher than it's ever been as for money or about that's chump change when you're on the NFL team you do that Chris\nCouple of quick tweets and you may be right Oscar writes already did you notice the lack of ripping the pastor's call Yasser caused this Sunday I think the NFL hurt the fans and told the rats to find a more balanced with\nThis one isn't there an emergency meeting on Thursday heard somebody say\nYeah yeah they're they're trying to do whatever they can to at least talk through it now they're doubling down publicly right they're doubling down publicly and said oh we're good on this\nBut based on what we saw today they let a few things slide so maybe they are trying to adjust them a little bit in JR checks in on the conversation about jumbo he said you know you're right the NFL players or ride jumbo wouldn't do that\nTo them because he does it uh college football players because he knows there's no repercussions exactly the judge jury and executioner and they want to play now again like I said I'm very much offense straddle are on this so I'm no fun\nBut we have seen those types of actions end up leading to coach is being done looking Illinois\nLook at what happened at Kansas with mark me and Gino there's about three or ... obviously what happened out of Maryland yeah with the way they treated players so Arnie these aren't just situations now where you can say like I tried to at times oh he's just trying to reposition him\nI mean no these usually are traits of bigger deeper issue so it'll be curious to see over the next five to six days what comes out about Jim ... Fisher as it stands right now I don't know is even addressed it and I haven't seen anything from them view\nI don't know if it was addressed the I mean it was actually addressed after the game um I don't know if it's been addressed today and I'm sure somebody's going to say something on Monday and who knows if there's not going to be some type of\nA penalty I'm not saying that suspension or anything but that he gets some type of a fine or something like that\nWhen we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios he is back yeah and we're working to get on the next to him can taught

capsule\nSports fans of than us and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history\nWay back in Nineteen twenty seven where the NHL Toronto St Patrick's become this Renault maple leaf this week in Nineteen thirty eight Don Budge becomes the first tennis player to win a grand plan this week in Nineteen fifty seven the Brooklyn Dodgers play their last game at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn\nThey defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates to zero\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy two jak Tatum of the Oakland Raiders returns they fumble one hundred and forty are against the Green Bay Packers\nNew NFL record this week in Nineteen Ninety eight Sammy Sosa his homerun number ... sixty six to take the lead in the major league baseball home run race less than an hour later mark Maguire also hit sixty six [noise] and this week in the year two thousand of the United states Olympic team beat the favorites\nI think when you go through and try and figure out where there might be some value I Love what I saw tonight from Baltimore to be quite honest\nThey look much more dynamic offensively Joe Flaco getting time in the pocket has three receivers none of them that are going to blow your socks off like a ... in and out back him or Antonio Brown but when you spread the ball around to Willie need Michael Crabtree and John Brown a chance to take the lid off the defense you get some of those tight and factored in\nAnd be running back in ... and Alex Collins they can at least keep a defense honest\nThey'll get Jimmy Smith back in the fall and I think the ravens are for real but I think there's a major gap still to get to the patriots atop the AFC I think Kansas City if they can show up their defense a little bit will be there at the end\nAnd then do right off the Jacksonville Jaguars just yet as long as they get them consistent play from Blake for those we know that defense is going to make every game a little bit ugly and I think it makes for very fascinating football game next Sunday and arrowhead no in Kansas City will come into that one off a short week\nNot less thing just wondering I mean you got the red Sox with a hundred and eight wins yet there are ... are they even one of the top two three favorites out there I Am I getting you know some good value taking the red Sox are just a you know go into other some other long shot\nYou know what I don't know if you're getting a ton of value with the red Sox I mean you look at their price aren't either listed at three to two are actually me\nSeven to bet on line that HGF scenes in three to one throughout Vegas the creative part about the red Sox you look at their starting rotation to my knowledge not one starter that they could throw out there as a postseason windows credit and you look at Chris sailor kind of limped to the finish you really have to be concerned about where the red Sox are going to go to get their inning\nAstros price slightly behind them right around four to one and if you believe it a little bit a long shot magic the Indians Yankees both at nine and one and then the log jam and the national league between the Dodgers the cubs\nThe brewers and the rocky the brewers hurricane for me I think a lot of people are sleeping on yeah the MVP and Christian yell at you have an office cables exploding and they remind me an awful lot\nAh the Kansas City royals were the bullpen you get to the fifth inning you turn the ball over to Josh hater ... ... and the other talented arms that it's going to be very difficult to scratch runs across matters\nMine remember us by phone number case you need to get a hold of me when you want me on the TV show I Do and already\nYou know we have a a celebrity guest segment every Wednesday you know it's a third segment of the show so you have to have your age and call and haven't talked to some of the TV folks will pipe right in their Burlington, Vermont or wherever you're calling home\nNow when you see when you got HD up there

I think we appreciate you guys to keep up the great work\nOut as you guys think talking yeah\nUh I didn't want you know like that come on lock it in on fs when I Would be horrible betting either ... or ... baseball Steve to say is in the house running a little bit behind he'll catches up with what's going on in the war a lot more than ... she's\nNot much often the Steelers tonight and they're one two and one on the seas in Baltimore one at Pittsburgh tonight twenty six four team the Steelers on twelve drives just fourteen first downs\nJustin Tucker for for for on field goals for the ravens all in the second half on third down conversions the ravens often eight for Seventeen Steelers often to for twelve on third downs\nSeattle out of fifty two yard field goal on the final play one twenty to Seventeen at Arizona New Orleans gotta win at the giants thirty three Eighteen and the chargers speed San Francisco when it come back twenty nine to twenty seven LA with a very slow start\nPick six in the opening minutes by Philip Rivers and later they were down fourteen nothing early the chargers by late first half rushing as a team eight carries just twenty yards and they still wind up winning the game\nMelvin Gordon not only Fifteen carries a hundred for yards on the ground for the chargers overtime win for Oakland Houston and Tennessee Dallas kicked a field goal as time expired to edge Detroit\nCincinnati a touchdown pass in the final seconds for a win at Atlanta blowout victories for Chicago in Green Bay for New England and Jacksonville Europe took the Ryder Cup easily Seventeen and a half to ten and a half Europe's one seven of the last nine dating back almost Twenty years and Tiger Woods went over and poor in his matches this weekend\nRyan blaming the NASCAR winter on the Charlotte road course Lakers exhibition opener with LeBron James was denied he at nine points in Fifteen minutes Dodgers won easily Colorado won easily they're still tied for first in the west\nThey'll play at one game tie breaker tomorrow afternoon at Dodger Stadium LA rookie Walker buell or on the mound against the guy wasn't bad for the Rockies now you're her mind Marquez\nHe's very young but it's this third season and he's been up with the big club and he was fourteen intend this season easy wins for Milwaukee and the cubs they're still tied for first in the central they'll play it one pm eastern time at Wrigley\nIn a Monday tie breaker so these four teams the winters are today that I mentioned there in the play offs but there is a huge advantage to win the tie breaker game tomorrow and then\nBe able to rest until Thursday and open the best of five division series\nAt home on Thursday guys [noise] how about this for protection as we come do you live out in the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance so what does it mean it means you probably should have gone to a guy called ... Fifteen minutes of go on a daily gasping for air well the singer was doing the update\nWhile I was going to give him a pig go ahead yeah what what what to them by ... or a second I I I saw that video again [noise]\nThe ... or ... for videos did you see that I'm not familiar with it so what would he broke his ankle at all I profile and he brought oh\nOh oh I\nI I don't know why I had to see the GED I Would just take us through the others like oh\nIt's just it's horrible for a guy like him wow I I notice for being a regular\nUh with Tyler high for at home I stupid fantasy football uh gives you stop that right but he's had so many injury problems it's just you you can't help but feel for them because he has the potential to be a breakout player\nAnd unfortunately he hasn't been able to stay healthy he put this on Twitter a ... I I keep saying moments ago everything's kinda flown by going after about an hour yeah he said quote this was the hardest I've worked to put myself in a position helped his Team Six young and\nHaving this happened crushes me I continued on Twitter if I've learned anything from before it's not a time for self pity negativity the only thing to do is to move forward with optimism with the sport in my family friends trainers and teammates and I was just he just comes right now that\nI'm not a doctor but death\nWho have you watched the video and slow mall or you just can't\nI watched it once and then they'll just have to hit the way it was\nLike I said I'm not good with those kinds of things that I have an incredibly weak stomach you wouldn't be a good doctor\nI Do know that is why do I still have nightmares about Napoleon ... with the raiders\nTim crumb Ryan the Superbowl Joe nice little Lulu a joke I I was very little dies and we got her and I'll never forget that what about those are words guys I was born ward yeah last year yeah oh they're all in our new job and get from Louisville\nOh yeah the yeah the shooting guard shooting guard that ended up going down in the elevator trailer there yeah Shaun Livingston whenever there's all these little injury\nThis was I don't want to say the worst than dollars but this when he was laying there and his ... you know as it is nice we're pet ... you saw the foot turning one way I just it was horrible because I've\nHad a horrible he added thanks to everyone who has said prayers in well wishes my waste a lot of tweets obviously to coming out I for it but yeah very scary ugly moment tonight for Tyler I read in the NFL All right uh see the cigarettes going to get caught up on everything coming up here and just a bit but only a kind of what will be able to go more in depth\nIn the final hour with kind of our buy or sell will take a trip to the locker room and what we've learned but we have a hand of a handful of interesting teams right now at three in one they include the New Orleans saints the Chicago Bears sitting at three in one I guess for all intents and purposes we can included to one in one team and this makes like the Green Bay Packers are\nAt Tennessee Jacksonville is at three in one and of course you remind me ... long with since the in Baltimore so seven very interesting teams at three in one maybe half of those not teams people thought would be three in one through four games\nDo you have the stat on teams that started three in one of the chance of making the playoffs because we do the start if you start over to you that you're like ... percent chance I only just started three in one what your chances are making the playoffs\nA we'll find out here and just a second but I'm curious you are you most intrigued by who do you think has the potential to end up making a run at three in one right now will go the opposite side of it maybe next hour by ... as you look at it right now who's got your attention\nI well forget the rams are for no so I Will just bypass them I Know people that you know they were picking them before the year Superbowl favorites all that we know they got a great deep\nUm two teams that really surprised we won the Chicago Bears I didn't really believe in ... um but once obviously they got called back and now that we see the ... may be the right deal with of course they'll live with that defense\nI'm very surprised about what the Chicago Bears could do but that's a very tough division so uh we'll see how they do to you know through the rest of the regular season another team that caught my eye or especially in the division\nUm where there are a little bit better is the Cincinnati Bengals um I thought I pretty much having pets for third maybe fourth of the roads were better\nBut now sitting at three in one and they had been up and they could score just concerned about their defense um but they've got a shootout I I'm really thinking that maybe the bagels could make a little bit of her on this year\nAnd they didn't have Joe mixing healthy today right he was in an active\nAnd still be the falcons on a last second play thirty seven thirty six you'll hear that call that one guy is just a bit and\nThey've got the dolphins coming up next week and then they've got the dolphins Steelers than a road trip to Kansas City those can be some high scoring games a ton brought up Baltimore and I'm very much intrigued by them as well because\nThey're only loss is to Cincinnati yeah but they had already surprised though well I I agree but based on our conversations we would have in the pre season about Joe Flaco is in trouble they draft the Jackson so it might be a situation where they're kind of moving forward\nI think they've been pretty much in control you know Steelers were never able to mount a rally on this last night\nThey were able to beat the Broncos by two scores two weeks ago they destroyed the bills in week one they go to Cleveland next week Tennessee again\nWhen I say I'm not necessarily buying Tennessee I'm saying I'm not buying them as a team that I think it's going to end up uh Lebanon ... really really like him on it I really liked the titans but I just don't know I'm how was my ... doing this right now it's like with some chewing gum the patch all here in Bailey wire and he's he's making it work", "year":
