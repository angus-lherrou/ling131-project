better team the entire series there was a better team in the regular season you lost to a team of played better than you who pitched better than you and hit better than you I mean they they did everything better I'm Astros fan I'm pissed at Joe West\nBecause he caught because he cost us to runs ridiculously but I Can't say oh Joe West costs us this you know I\nDid step my my team for not holding onto a lead after they reestablished after five innings given it right back up in the six that's that's where it ends up you got it to where you drew even you you're pulled ahead and you're able to at least for the moment curse out Joe West and said we're going to win in spite of you\nAnd then you're bullpen gives it right back up that's where your your anger should be but you didn't have enough down the stretch and then given an opportunity to try to to come up with a big effort tonight against the guy who is struggled\nAnd we've mentioned it tonight and certainly we're not going to be the only ones that bang on the playoff history of David Price but here's a guy who's been awful what did he do he motive down that\nThey were first pitch swinging getting out of his own he had full control and they played into his strengths and he was was able to put together a magnificent start and get that elusive when right after all this time this is the guy that you add\nEverybody's got to history to jump by you certainly have all the scouting reports or whatever photographic evidence you needed from your advanced scout\nOf your Spygate a process is certainly at that and the and

and um they all play those you know they they they did a really good job of\nOf having an excellent game plan and going and executing it and and and they were\nI just which was the bigger crime do the job west call or the fact that they baseball open and shut case in less than a one day when five teams are talking about Spygate too\nI thought what they were worried about was that the Astros if if they if they say that the Astros cheated in some way that the astronauts would win three in a row\nAnd then they would have this being written about for two weeks but that's what I genuinely think they they were worried about they didn't have credible evidence I'm not saying that there's no signs being stolen and I'm not saying that the Astros are the only team to do it\nI don't think it's as
