Iowa City it by heart radio station [noise]\n\nBut all it takes is a couple of breaks it I mean you start looking at Jacksonville schedule\nTheir hosting Philly next week that suddenly no fur coat match up by the way that they played recently\nAnd then they go to any so next thing you know we're sitting here dumping all over them and Blake poodles but in two weeks Arnie they could be five and four and sit in the top that division right now saying things speaking of the eagles and the NFC all wow how do we how do we make sense of what's going on in the NFC East right now only three of the four teams that win the championship games last year\nAnd the AFC NFC championship game their garbage this year\nI thought we and seen a bat loss for the eagles when they lost that game to the titans\nThis one that ... that ... that compares\nIn comparison to what they did today up Seventeen the nothing and then they were there that whole game on the ... Newton throat for over two hundred yards and the fourth quarter I mean you've got your eagles fed right now you got to be pulling your hair at it that was in Paris the laws today\nBad I mean bad horrible because you see the eagles Twitter account put out they had a sponsor deal it's a vote for your player of the game was let's just say equal than a little bit salty but much like Jacksonville player they burn is Cam Newton [laughter] exactly we vote for him Noone\nBut earning much like Jacksonville there ... there in the division right now we're no one's running away with it you're not looking up at an undefeated rams team you're not looking up at a\nAt a one last Kansas City or\nI don't know if you want to throw maybe kind of the way things are going in a well I Can't even see the NFC North okay you're not looking up at a one last New Orleans saints team\n... years struggling if you're a Philly you only lost three games all your last year you're three and four and you're only what game and a half out of the first place right now and it's Washington in front of you at four and two and\nI don't know how you feel but I don't think they're going to run away from it so are\nWe breaking down two teams one that won a championship one that played in the AFC Championship game last year that are in panic mode on anyone they really don't have to be quite yet\nWell Jacksonville or Philadelphia Philadelphia has to be in panic mode because there are three and four in the season is about to come to a quick and one more last they dropped the three and five you could write that season off\nAccident ville a little bit different because as you said that division is absolutely disgusting will be bad and the Texans actually lead that so when you're only one game behind I wouldn't be that though you don't want to go to three and five also in Jacksonville but you've got a little bit more leeway because well every game you're going to be favored in\nBut I mean how is the AFC South so much more of a balanced battle than what you have an NFC East I mean you're looking up at Washington right now Washington the Redskins now granted they play at the giants next week but are you are you taking in Washington is going to run away with this now\nI just wanted to say the only reason you're look it up at the Redskins as big as Jason Garrett decided I we're good with the fifty two yard or let's let's go ahead and kill the last twelve stuck into the game were okay with it instead of you know what maybe we could pass and gave it an extra ten or twenty yards make it a little bit easier for the kicker otherwise you'd be will get up at the Dallas Cowboys right now\nSo again that's my point I I don't I I'm actually buying in to what they were selling post game what Doug Peterson was selling post game for the eagles and nobody nobody wants to hear this after your team loses but\nHey three and four I'm not going to try to tell you to this good thing in your galvanized now but in all this panic that I Would feel as if in maybe not as bad as we might be laying it out of ...

have power five in group of five ... the conversation I Love when you see a team make a run like this the problem is I think they get so caught up in the look at me mindset that they're going to trip

oh after winning thirty nine to ten at San Francisco\nTampa Bay and overtime be Cleveland road wins for Carolina and I come back for a New England and Houston which has one for in a row\nNBA the four games are all final now Chris Paul starting a two game suspension tonight Houston still want at staples center as they did last night against the Lakers no they didn't win without him it was the clippers can you believe that clip while eating Houston that I'd failed on one Fifteen one twelve\nSo much for that narrative everybody just assume but no these clippers beat Houston James Harden did have a thirty one points\nAnd fourteen assist in defeat Denver big Golden State one hundred and Ninety eight nuggets are three into Cleveland oh and three after losing it home to Atlanta Oklahoma City owned three after losing it home to Sacramento and Russell Westbrook play at thirty two points guy\nBy the way a that Steven Segre he'll be back in thirty minutes with everything that's going on in the world of sports we really want to remind you that were brought to buy ... what does it mean one guy who says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well it means you probably should have gone to a guy called outcome Fifteen minutes you\nBy the way it went up to come up with a new nickname for Chris Paul you know those like the three fingers more the guy if he would have stuck his finger in my face oh he would have been missing a finger I promise genetic Raz because there was no spit I'm a firm run though I think he's full of bologna\nWow you just dropped a three fingers more to ...\nYeah I don't know how I got that one but I you know ... you know you don't put your hand in somebody's face like that come on down\nOut they spit in my face time I I mean that's kind of what they're trying to show what they are they ... as you have video but I didn't see it I mean I'm Sorry everyone was like watching the you know the NBA is looking at this and they think he's spit in his face and I watch it at like twelve times and I didn't see any no no I didn't see it I think\nJust Chris Paul was on the line there a point ... ... what was he thinking what was he talking about about\nBecause he uh he doesn't eat he needs to eat what he was mad about [laughter]\nHe skipped too many mills he's angry so he needs to eat so he can put some meat on them bone I you know I'm gonna I'm gonna hide behind the door so you guys can't throw anything at me but as I look back around this on what I mean I've watched every minute just about last time I was flipping around a lot\nOf just about every minute above Lakers game so I'm going to say this and and then I'm gonna hide back behind the door she could throw things at me ... playing very well but when I'm going to go hide there's not the numbers that are out there where you can say like tray young did tonight against the ...\nHe was a sort of thing\nUh but I I think he's playing really well I think this is going to be a nice little breakout year formula brown there are I got to get back to football but yeah I get all these hate tweets I'm just a good point and I'm\nWe talked about the UCF statement of Danny wide released tonight or who is this this is a way Hoover I take out an ad the reason for the statement was a rebuttal to an ESPN college game day segment yes I understand that and I get it but\nI also think if someone says who cares to a twenty and twenty game winning streak there just idiots I Can't think of any other way to put it I don't care\nIf the the sacred I coined that phrase back whenever we were working the graveyard shift together go there's good and if you put together twenty straight wins no ones out there playing just guys that are throwing with the wrong hands every single week so that that's\nThat's you know what ... pump the brakes I pump the brakes I see that here in Vermont when I watch college basketball and I see Vermont dominate the America Eats next thing you know or would they played in the tournament your one and done yeah you could dominate your cup friends when you have teams that are equal or or or less are far less are\nInferior that you but when you play the big boys is a different story it's don't give me ... and all that stuff come on now\nA loyal to Chicago making the final four this year what\nKind of old and already hey I before we accept that let's see there's always a rule you know what I mean\n... the year before our well but what conference today play and you know you I think you're really selling short how we're starting to see that bar get a little bit more do you know who's the preseason top five team in some people's mind the sheer\nNevada yeah they they just lost a Washington by Fifteen and up preseason game that I had to come back with something off the ad I thought that was pretty good that they even know something like that a\nVery very young and how quickly you turned on that uh they gave you the answer no no that's right you could have just a dagger in and out on the ...\nAre made something up and I wouldn't have known anyone ... and then one more quick one since we did bring up the the punch yesterday a Eddie right cp three couldn't help but get into a fight with the guard that actually has won something significant to bat he can't have a at\nHaving class to his resume I'm Glad the clippers dumped them only wish we could see less of him in ads I guess that's the state farm conversation right [noise] um I I don't\nGo to Beijing for me in Studio ...\nTeam grow I've watched this a thousand times\nI don't necessarily see a spit he's got a mouthpiece in that he's talking to him through the mouthpiece I mean that's not that I I again it's out there you guys can determine and Paul gets in his face and then of course the sponges are handed out\nToday yeah it was it RCB yesterday she I didn't even notice I didn't even know what it is I found out I was watching it but I guess the point is Arnie did you can't you feel like when you put a team\nIn Cincinnati whose foreign one and an undefeated oh I'm Sorry I have five in one Kansas City chiefs team who was undefeated when you flex them to Sunday Night Football feel like you're going to get a good match up when you look at San Francisco unfortunately even though they play very well against the Green Bay on Monday Night and you could argue they should've probably won that game\nThey lost a lot of their ... whenever they lost Jimmy ... for the season so it made sense to flex out but this is always a a hindsight conversation which gets we don't want to want to ask you may I ask\nYou about that second who's got to beat the rams\n[noise]\nYou mean in the playoffs or the rights\nThey don't go sixty to know or you could bones [laughter] honestly I've started the boat\nI ... I I tell you this I think the rams lose at New Orleans in two weeks so okay uh I think that's good to be their last they may even lose to Detroit on the road also and then back to back up games Detroit and Chicago so uh I think they get up three losses when it's all said and done when it comes to the playoffs do that\nThat's a whole nother story I I at this point\nUh you know when you have a great up and that's one thing but we know that defenses win Super Bowls do they have a Superbowl caliber defense I think they do\nSeven sex and four turnovers today by that rams that defense in Aaron Donald I mean my gosh you're talking about a rounding into warm it helps when you got sue next year but that deep and just ... good ah so here's their their ... right or the dolphins when they had to\nA ... day wait Philips found a way Arnie yeah they they were willing to pay him a lot of money and he didn't have air and Donald next to him and I guess that's made all the difference in the world\nPackers next week right and they got the saints then they've got the Seahawks than they have the cheap and they don't have their by until after the chief's game so they've got four games before they even reached they're buying as you brought up\nAt Detroit at Chicago home to Philadelphia at Arizona and against the war\nYou know what I'm going to be a desperate situation oh by the time to get to that game was considering the three and four right now\nYou know and it's also pretty amazing when you see what ... doing because this now sets the bar for every single new coach right every single team that's looking for a coach\nIf it's Cleveland or what Mark Davis expected with John Gurdon in Oakland uh or I I don't know what the expectations are probably in New York with a new coach everyone looks at the rams and go\nWell when they when you took over obviously that was a that was a four five six when team and now they were the best team in the NFC last year and they're undefeated this year everyone looked at Sean ... I Do as a fan\nAnd I said what's he doing that we're not doing right now do you ever go up everyone thought he was a boss after the first year now he might be one of the best quarterback from the NFL said the same thing about being Brad Stevens\nSure of course I that's just how it is you see these guys that have success in situations where maybe they were struggles beforehand and you think All right everyone should be able to do that right because they're showing McVeigh could do with Iran and Brad Stevens could do it with the Celtics\nCome here and do it for me in Oakland come here and do it for me in San Francisco come here and do it for me what the giants it's that's a really high bar and that's a huge praise to a guy like McVeigh but only it's incredible what he's done with this team\nHe's also the talent you know I mean jeeze for quite a while they look the way everybody goes oh look what the whole just been able to do well no Sherlock what'd you got you got all all pro caliber running back\nYou got to kill I mean you've got weapons all around you and you got a great coach it's good to nurture you Andy Reid you've got everything in your favor\nTrue but it was pretty much the same roster last year that fell short losing the titans in the first round as\nWell who has all that well I I I Would say who saw that coming back I mean I'm Sorry I'm wrong way\nTo go before we get to that point I was debate this more but when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios we've got hot seat that apparently has reached boiling level of big news potentially tonight we're tracking stories out of Cleveland could this be the end for Hugh Jackson\nAnd what that really make that much of a different will go more in depth on the uh intense coaching situation and Cleveland next with Arnie and playing on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old male maybe a bit\nPorgy and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month\nCalled term providers speak with big Lu at eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight big Lew will find a term my policy for you even if you have type ... diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure term providers helped thousands of people like you think they can't afford term life insurance\nTo buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you all you need to do is called big Lu at eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight ... will make sure the scales are tipped in your favor\nGall eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight ... we'll answer your call and work to fit you into a term life policy that you can afford remember big lose IQ he's on meds to\nGuide hundred seven hundred and sixty eight Ninety eight eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight\nDon't miss meat Fridays with the damn Hedrick show on K ex icy\nOr done in Iowa joins us on this Friday Hi Don when you have poor me\nDan thanks for taking my call the truck driver running across the country and I just thought I Would regalia with my uh Barney version of meat ready\nTo give me a little horn here if you can on your ah your regular\nSalad I like it and I don't love me you'll you'll owe me real sure he can do with the place to go back in the back row [laughter]\nDon Don's drive in his truck cross country and just took time out to do a mean friday and not only that law Arnie or yeah I'd want to end it live yeah this is just to be amazed at the Grammys so mean there's no lip sync and here there is no tracking\nNo way then Patrick weekdays nine to noon on eight hundred gay exercising and heart radio station\nI and more with the help from the new documentary series asked the doctor and illusion is Darren Brown is back on Netflix with a new special called sacrifice\nSome slick getting out of the Amazon Prime this week include the claustrophobic horror movies that'll die young jak yelling all in the weird cool Donnie ...

long but before we get to all of that\nFrom the Geico Fox Sports radio studios state to state or is in the house what's going on Steve\nWell the easy Kansas City when that I but did you see the Jason lock in for a report this morning that of course Paul Allen\nSuddenly sadly passed away this week not only Microsoft cofounder but Seattle Seahawks owner\nHe has no errors he's not passing on righty hawks to anyone rights and so the Seahawks will be sold one day and for a record price no doubt his sources said\nThe exchange of the franchise is likely to follow a similar path that we saw with buffalo in Ralph Wilson finally passed away and there were provisions about the franchise remaining in that region\nWait a minute route plus that airs yet had siblings yet children what they they\nGo on to his own now what the goal is on the\nBill right but they wanted they ... the family wanted to sell the Buffalo Bills they couldn't sell the bass up it was like he didn't have any airs or

moving up to Toronto and Donald Trump wanted the fire and I don't know what was going on\nWith that that's right former ah arena league owner but yeah you're right and you mentioned the giants at

yards chiefs are six and one Washington beat Dallas twenty to Seventeen Dallas missing a fifty two yard field goal attempt on the final play\nYou guys mentioned this was a a CBS game even though NFC packages on Fox yeah they have this thing called cross flexing in recent years where to kind of balance it out since the NFC teams generally are the larger markets they actually trade some late afternoon games\nAnd that's how it worked out so it went to more a greater audience a larger percentage of the country but that's why it was not on Fox\nWild Dallas Washington no longer the prime game unbelievable\nAnd Dallas by the way had that false start yeah the play before he'll call terrible and that's what the blown snapper and horrible ... talks and it's been there long snapper for fourteen seasons in Dallas\nHe's only at five penalties ever yeah and uh know poor snaps in his career and he says I was telling the ref this is exactly what I've been doing every snap for fourteen years I'm not trying to draw them off sides he thinks as long as the balls on the ground the whole time I didn't lifted up it's not a penalty\nAnd yet there was a five year coal so instead of a forty seven year kick at the end fifty two yard field goal attempt missed by Dallas hit the upright they lose by three twenty to Seventeen at Washington chase LA at the NASCAR when angels new manager Brad Smith the late NBA game once the clippers over Houston one Fifteen one twelve\nAnd a Houston to not have Chris Paul two game suspension and finally Ohio State failed a number eleven in the new a pie college football poll after last night's loss Alabama and Clemson or one to Notre Dame is three\nWashington state up to number fourteen in the country Oregon is down to number Nineteen NC State failed a twenty to Utah is in at twenty three I Believe that yes the endgame\nNext weekend is a\nIt's the friday night is is Utah at UCLA so while the rose bowl is hosting college football there is a little thing called the world series at Dodger Stadium happening though and that means also that they're going to be televising this pact twelve game\nWhen the world series and they're not going to be going to highlights or interviews or anything like that [laughter] wow so congratulations us a Utah is right now they are at twenty three then stand for twenty four an Appalachian State AS number twenty five an AP\nStuff Ah yes lap state showed up in the top twenty five no and he loves those mid major schools to get an opportunity like that by the way up\nA cording to so why you gotta hey Arnie listened just because Arizona always loses to them doesn't mean you can't give them respect a quick note to kind of tag on since she had brought a college football's most recent rankings the twenty eighth team playoff predictor from Seth Waldor who runs ESPN's analytics saw that\nThey still have Ohio State with a twenty five percent chance to make the playoffs ... down one ... considerably way down though that's the second best odds for a big tent team with\nMichigan as a matter of fact in this whole stupid little phrase we have in the radio world if the season or two into two day which it does and so why am I wasting your time with this because we have time to fill Clemson\nAlabama Notre Dame and Michigan would be the four teams in the playoffs George ... of the other teams on the outside looking in Georgia in Oklahoma both with a thirty percent chance and we mentioned Ohio State there were twenty five percent\nWhile El Al shoe is at fourteen what was it give central Florida\nCentral Florida is not listed whoa they have a Washington at six in to what the five percent chance elicit a head of central Florida\nSo central Florida and they even have a five percent chance\nThat wouldn't be affirmative Arnie that would be affirmative what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well it means you probably should have gone to a guy called outcome Fifteen minutes ago cannot looking good\nFor you isn't that funny how we love to see uh the underdogs play the the big boys in basketball void it comes to football right guy come on let's move it along here we don't want to see this\nUh and and then when it does happen for instance whenever UCF goes to a ball game and beat someone like Auburn Auburn fans oil we didn't care that boy they're\nRight and so it it's kind of like Hawaii in Georgia oh wait a minute that that's the way that one doesn't fit that would that doesn't work that we're not in well it'll All right I got a couple of other uh buy sell stock up stocked stocked down here for you real quick Arnie\nBecause I I Do think there is some intriguing things that came out of Sunday today on the west coast yesterday on the east coast are you\nIn that the saints might be the number two contender in the NFC 'cause I mean come on the rams or definitive number one but is the second best team in the NFC the saints\nYes absolutely it's the second best team one if you take a look at them their defense is not as bad as people thought it was going to be especially what was that first gave me gets Tampa is that what it was\nLike oh my goodness this even though the beds\nGee if you came away their deepest ... pretty well offensively their second to nobody at least in that division at least in the in all that and see the only team other team with the up it's like ... or the rams so yeah absolutely the same so the second best even the out of say\nYeah they held a Cleveland to Eighteen even though that was an incredible finish they held the giants to Eighteen held the Redskins on Monday Night to Nineteen and then of course had that battle back and forth with ravens now I\nDon't even know how to talk about that or or what to say but I still can't fathom the numbers around Justin talker he had made two hundred and twenty three hours straight extra points but only goes deeper than that\nHe was Seventy eight Seventy eight in his career from thirty three yards in on field goal attempt so basically he had made three hundred field goals in a row from thirty three yards in that's the ... and then he misses his first one and it's tied the game with seconds left", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "22"}
