I mean it was thirty seven at one point in this game\nI ... first of all that may be fake news I'm Still adding up the score you saved forty I'm double checking on that I I find that very hard to believe I Know that is that is incredible did they put up so many points and Ezekiel didn't even get over a hundred yards told us carries so wasn't like he was tearing it up also\nWe are monitoring this chiefs patriots game with three fifty to go in the fourth quarter New England is holding onto a thirty seven thirty three lead out to the one yard touchdown run\nBy Tom Brady there's three fifty left in the game did they just pick up that flag warning I Hope so yeah they were going I'm never going to call catch interference\nAnd I think they picked no foul thank you uh he robs watching it back and the guy could Fox Sports radio studios\nLosing his mind you hurry Amazon is do not get a get recalled in the book I thought about those other five\nMinutes left we know when the when there's that little time we've got to go to a booth review and we've got to get a recall for the patriots you know that and I know that\nBig gain or right here to grow up just absolutely ended some poor said these career who tried to attack on a better job tackling rock on that point\nSo New England burst into Casey territory in one other note on that point party that was the first one of the night in this case so far beyond me ... and then when I was I\nHave more teams to get to that I can view is that you have to help us settle me on and we'll get your take on it as well to Twitter already blown up you get hit us up at stinking genius one that's at\nSci and K. I. N. genius and the number one plank show everybody should be following us at Fox Sports radio but aren't even real quick\nBefore we get too carried away here we did have the red Sox bounce back in a big way tonight as they be Boston are extremist they beat Houston but do we have more controversy in Boston with this ... thing what are you hearing right now he was taken in the hospital tonight he will ill or is this a a lingering concern right now you think for for the red Sox\nAll I Know that he has some stomach illness I I figure they're probably going to give them I. V. and uh you know who knows what's going to happen when he comes back he had an injury and he's been on and off or what has come to the second half of the season matter of fact in the last month he made a couple of starts but there were like spot starts rarely pitched a couple of innings or anything like that\nI was more afraid of something wrong with his shoulder\nAnd that's what am I co said watch when the seasons over we'll find out something was seriously wrong with him or a stomach illness though is a lot better than maybe information or definitely better than any information on on the shoulder or anything like that so ah hopefully they'll give him ivy and it'll be okay oh we should be okay to go into the next are\nRed Sox wanted by final score of seven to five a kimbrell still are a little bit shaky to some but I mean I I don't know why he got the job done in the division\nHigher is very ... very shaky I I may have to go to somebody else a before I start bringing him into the knife I I've I've got some serious problems with them\nWell when we come back to the guy could Fox Sports radio studios we have more NFL but as the show goes on tonight will give you a preview of game three of the national league championship between the brewers and the Dodgers and already I don't know maybe maybe I'm a little bit old fashioned in this but both row teams did what they needed to do I mean you always want to come away with the sweep\nA but everyone wants to be up to all everyone wants to enforce it but just split on the road like Houston and the Dodgers did I think that's pretty huge we're both teams going forward they basically take over a home field advantage that\nOh yeah but a ... pump the brakes pub breaks my friend we got a long way to go and never this Red Sox evening when a hundred and eight games because they just rolled over and they were not for the two in this one and hit their way out I think they're both going to be really good series the rest\nTo either two and a speaking that Houston one one oh three so they're not too bad either when we got\nTo do that at me back there well I just again I I think Boston has been set up for the implosion I think they've been set up for the implosion all off season I when we come back it's a week to week week we gave the example of the dolphins and the cowboys\nBut perhaps the most ... example of any team from last week to this week we'll get to act with only in\nThe\nThe\nFor teams to move the mouse\nHosts the Fox sports radio\nEven if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you

might have found my third wife that sitting right there given the middle finger in the [laughter]\nThere you go but in the end the patriots end up pulling it off forty three to forty alright listen I've got to get to another team is confusing me maybe we'll have to change stock up stock down to are they good are they bad\nUh later on in the show but right now Steve ... is in the house to help us recap that thrilling amazing Sunday Night Football in between the patriots and the cheeks what's going on Steve\nHello gentleman and what an evening for bone in Fort sports fans let's let's put it in this context first if you had a baseball playoff game or David Price started and you won yeah that has never happened before [laughter]\nAnd then he got the ... I don't know if you guys don't get that when we had what\nHe's all for nine in the postseason\nHe had had ten career post season starts the IRA over six but his teams had lost all ten and yell tonight they scored enough early especially against scare colon one seven to five and then about thirty miles or so south\nYou get to the game and Fox borough in New England gives up forty points and wins I always look it up if we were going to have the highest scoring tied game ever because remember it's only a ten minute overtime now and the chief tied at forty all late and regulation but\nNo still the highest scoring tie game ever was the first ever overtime game for NFL regular season it was thirty five or Nineteen Seventy four Steelers Broncos oh of course the record but there have been plenty games where each team scored at least the kicker that really want to get ideas seventies of course it would\nBe very out of my head or a\nGood no wonder they didn't weigh relatives guerillas are short field goal fight all play for a New England to win this one tonight even though for Kansas City\n... three touchdown catch is seven receptions a hundred and forty two yards including the the late Seventy five yard TD when he put on the after burners down the sidelines and it looked like the defenders were running in mud as he tied the game forty all but guess what the twenty eight yard field goal to win it\nSo in the end a New England victory and Kansas City suffers as first law they had been five and know the rams now six and over in the NFC after a win at Denver today twenty three twenty\nNo snow on the field although that's only because shoveled it all off there was flooding the day before the game twenty five degrees and the LA teams still goes in and when in fact they lead Denver twenty to three late in the third quarter\nTodd girlie two hundred yards rushing into touchdowns Dallas in Baltimore with victories Pittsburgh delayed TD pass to win at Cincinnati Miami in overtime over Chicago Houston and the chargers with victories\nOhio State is up to number two in the new college football pools behind number one Alabama NASCAR when for Eric Elmer role at Talladega is Kurt Busch ran out of gas on the final lap\nOverall only led one lap today the last one so he gets his first kind of see\nOr years so he clutches a spot in the round of eight back to you\nThanks day we come to life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios which begs the question what does it mean when\n... says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well it means you probably should have gone to a guy called ... Fifteen minutes ago that was insane tonight [noise] good good game good night as Steve said oh he's not going to like this 'cause both Boston area teams one you need a little bit of negativity right\nAnd I have one that she was three and a half so I I feel good about that I always got that going\nFor me by the way the browns were really a favorite today against the chargers did ... amazing so unbelievable with what happened in that game hey speaking of that we're getting into this week to week lead conversation and trying to figure out you know what what's really the bleep going on in the NFL and trying to figure out who's good who's bad\nThe jaguars are still a team and I can't figure out Arnie and I know it's funny I go back to about a year ago this time when when I brought up the jaguars to open the show and you openly call for me to be fired for even try to talk Jacksonville Jaguars football\nBut they start out to him they destroyed this New England ... forty three destroyed them then they lost the three of four\nIncluding again to Tennessee somewhere that makes no sense to uh to Sean or resident Tennessee Homer and they've been scored in the last two weeks by Kansas City in Dallas Seventy six to Twenty one and I think I heard the stat tonight that it's like forty four to zip in the first half\nThat they've been out scored in these first two games yes they are in a sea championship contenders question mark but every\nOne this pilot I'm Brock by them listen to me ... all over my head thank you English line Blake portals you're not going to make a deal for the quarter back in the middle of the ... you're not and not coming up a champion\nNow with the money that you're paying him right and he hung up so you you're in a no win situation there's nothing you could do it took you to the AFC Championship game and\nUh he was rewarded what the year before that or was it after the after the seas after the season just as easily was he ended up for the for the contract so you know you're between a rock and a hard place you're you're not going to be able to get rid of him you're not going to be able to cut them you're not going to be able to trade 'em and you're not going to be able to bring in another quarter back to take his spot so\nAre you gonna have to live and die with like ...\nI see some people do get ... that's going so well oh go get tried to make a deal with Denver to get ... okay well whether contracts might be similar I mean\nCome on I mean I I don't really necessarily know if that's an upgrade right now and it's just it's hard to make sense of a guy who looked as good Arnie as board all did and that went over New England to see how awful they suddenly become in the span of just the two weeks but again\nThey go out next week and they play the Texans and it's quite possible that they could end up feeding them thirty three to Fifteen or something crazy like that that this week we asked those in\nJacksonville fans are yelling at the radio right now but we are a little bit of an injury problem we don't have a running back you may have heard of him you know let her for that he does ah is pretty good we you know good credit could use him so I can see that going on in a little bit\nI understand that but I mean it's not by forty point man I I don't I don't care who you have in fact that's on your deep and that's not necessarily on your off Anthony TJ yelled and is averaging six yards for carrying five yards for carrying his last couple of games but when you're down forty four to zip\nIn the last two games in the first half Arnie what good is running game do you got to get back in that game\nWell but it also sets the pace allows you to keep a you know your defense off the field you know that and you know gets points on the board puts pressure on the other team or the to come back out to the I mean really a ... and sometimes a good defense is better off it's like they do in Kansas City\nWell I'm I Will say this much\nI I I don't disagree with you one iota that for NASA difference maker I don't think he's the ultimate difference maker right now in Jacksonville I really don't I understand that he's hurt I understand that he can make a difference for you but then when you're down like that you can talk about setting a tone you can talk about doing things but\nIt's just it's missing now in addition to it by that I mean the attitude with\nThis it gets to the Mike Powers that was a big one just left for dead and couldn't score to get out of their way and we've already adjacent Garrett fired for crying out loud\nI did have one team though that I'm very perplexed by and I think this is going to be number one and are are they good or are they bad conversation next our army but what do we make of Baltimore who gets beat twelve to nine last week in Cleveland and arguably arguably what was the ugliest game winning field goal any of us have ever seen\nThey then go out and destroy the titans Twenty one does dip and register eleven sacks today with one of the highest paid lip capitals in the game the ravens register eleven sex good luck trying to make sense of that in a sea north in general right\nWell it's not like the titans are up in some juggernaut odds you know what I'm saying is you know ... if you take a look at the last couple of possible they are the Thirteen twelve game\nUh with the bill so you know it's not like they're going ahead and are putting up a lot of points on the board that nine six game with the jaguars so they're not not fence of jog or not you could expect low scoring games when it comes to them\nAnd we said Thirteen and twelve game against the bills I thought you were talking about the ravens I was going to put up forty seven points are saying what the titans right now and to the fence and see I don't think Mario does a hundred percent\nI was gonna say what happened to him member he was just all of this young quarterback profit margins Mario ... oh my goodness I've met this guy is it this guy's about two years away from not even being starting quarterback anymore\nAnd then we have a Washington who looked completely inept in the Drew Brees game on Monday Night I'm pretty sure there were a couple of other players on the field but judging by the broadcast there was only one and honestly only I have no problem with that was the hooky thing everyone I handed him a certificate for breaking the NFL ... I\nI I Know that the Internet's been blasting that for the better part of the last what six days I still can't get over that the first thing they do is given the game ball and give them the certificate but in that game on the other side of it Washington is destroyed humiliated absolutely ridiculous\nAnd then they go on the Carolina today I mean\nOne of the world is going on how can you make sense of teams that get destroyed in one week come back and do the destroying the following week teams that started out to window\nAnd suddenly are getting smoked forty this dip at one point and the teams that can't even put three touchdowns on the board suddenly exploding like we saw in ... I don't know Dallas today Arnie how do people ever make money gambling honestly\nThey traded their pass rush start ... Mac\nAnd he suddenly turned the bears into a contender well I mean again the bears have a good supporting cast defensively around them often simply man but still I mean you get to first round pick said I mean I don't know what the way things are going through the bears is that he's going to be a top twenty pick that right now see ...\nAnd guess what the raiders can't do on against what they can't do it offensively they can't rush the passer so what do you trade your bath threats or you know what else they can't do or any they can't get a field goal\nAnd they can't put do you know why they can't do that because they they they cut their kicker and they cut their punter before the season started now the whole Marquette King thing obviously he got cut by Denver as well too but men whatever I don't have\nWe gotten the port in question to ask you Chris ... well I'm not but you can go well about the rate is we want to know\nIn two years when they moved to Las Vegas are you going to be opting out and now as as well as as your favorite team because what a team moves from one city to the next that is that that that window of opportunity for you to pay a lot of that team and joined something else\nYeah no no no I I I realize I joked about it last week and as soon as it came out of my mouth I realized I Can't quit them I mean it's like a it's a really bad relationship right now they cheated on me they told me that they're going to quit cheating but yet you know all happen to check their Facebook profile or like a grandmother she voted off I mean I just can't do it right now are some other guy stuff I\nI don't get this I don't understand what's going on I\nDon't know how you can pay a guy a hundred million dollars you know honestly the money doesn't really matter to me to basically come in and try to take that next step with arguably I mean a a decent roster a decent Ross I'm not trying to tell you they were patriot level\nAre hell even ... what's he talking about the the raiders before John ... to go\nAnd now now he's basically anything that has been built he's taking this little pick acts and he's just top down and they want to go to her to now huh\nNo I mean he's off I mean you can have him I Know they were they were they want a trade a couple of guys off the team it's so funny whenever Jake laser reported that today I kind of laughed a little bit because I was like a trade those two guys keep ...\nGo back to Chicago and say here we want will Mac back because Cooper hasn't done anything consistently since he was drafted by the raiders might be their fault and coal Joseph for goodness sakes the shorter than I Am so I don't know how he's going to end up being an NFL safety so it's really hard right now\nFor every one he wants to say what about the raiders what about this it sucks because you basically took a roster that was in position to compete\nAnd you just absolutely scripted away their car's broke I don't know if he can be fixed I I was thinking to myself huh I Wonder I Wonder if maybe the jaguars with one car for a couple of first ... hours away for not being a starting quarterback anymore being about two and a fell to might be one game\nWell Mr two years ago it was going to be the MVP\nWell I wasn't alone on that one army Sedona\nSilver and black lung back then everyone was but here's the deal I'm convinced that the goal in Oakland right now is to get their car hurt that's the only thing that they're doing good right now\nThat's the only thing to do what good right now there oh I just I Can't even get started with their first round pick their cornerback that everyone talks about in camp Gary on ... oh wait till he gets going he's losing ... Dominique Rodgers ... yes the same do the couldn't remember all those kids names he's a writer now and he's playing more than their first round pick last year\nAlready what in the hell is going on how can you pay that much money for a coach only to have him come in and have every it's like the most recent one in all these back to the track and all of a sudden one of your buddy shows up and you start losing every but that's what John\nI was the judge said to himself you know what one year Ted Miller I'll just take that will call [laughter] I was joking about that would vote during the activities are out now I don't think I'd go through nine more years of as I I think my TV gig back please is if they show I could host or something\nIf he does not ... enough hundred million dollars\n... I Hope you're right All right uh see that's that's why I don't want to talk about the issue people want to troll the way this is why Comey it ruins the whole show it's ruined my energy\nIs ruining my

apiece and Fox borough New England be previously five in Kansas City forty three to forty out of short she'll go on the final play\nThat he caught a ... on the big touchdown that I had to take our new house and you're right they they've got so many different options with grant instills in Wilson and that was a beautifully throwing ball and he just ends up taking it the rest of the way I mean unbelievable performance from ... to ... you know what\nPaint me absolutely shocked that it ended up playing out like that Arnie absolutely but congratulations to your boys your back on the super bowl train feeling good about\nAbout how about Frank Gore with over a hundred yards and now what does that guy fifty I'm thirty five years old and put up over a hundred yards rushing that's incredible\nYou know what I I Know this is so many captain obvious things I can throw out here today and I talked about it a lot of kind of the theme of the show tonight a two week to week league everything we think we knew last week we throw out the window and that goes to the same for even two weeks ago\nBut only if there's one captain obvious statement we can make when when you wonder how ... while or whenever those of us who are constant and chronic ... if you wonder how he was able to have some success it gets to Chicago a defense that through five games we'd put up there with the monsters of the midway\nRunning game I mean I Know it's real simple I Know it sounds so captain obvious but when you're able to establish the run like the dolphins were at times today it opens everything up and you're right if it's spring Gore doing it look out I mean that's a good sign for that often supply and it gets to a good deal like that\nYet but just not going to win with a running game you know you've got the air it out right yeah I mean that's why I was like okay let's see what brought Scott and when they got behind them like I don't know if this guy's got to them or to lead the dolphins do uh come from behind victory that see Ted Hills smile and on the sidelines\nI'm like what about your smiling about your down by eight and they just scored a touchdown you just took it back I really Chicago's got to go back in and say themselves they let this one slip through their fingers because it with a ... point lead\nGame over a and they had a penalty called up that touched on that was taken away otherwise\nI think there would have had this one and they wouldn't have looked back from a fifty importantly\nThree hundred and eighty or it's passing for ... today three eighty heated turned the ball over twice was not fact which is a big that but you and I can debate the importance of running game because I absolutely think are running game is essential to end up making a run in the playoffs yes you need to score points but\nYou also need to control the clock when you run a hundred and sixty one yard it's not a massive\nNumber but when Fifteen carries on a hundred and one of those come from one guy like they did from Frank or today I think that is paramount to be able to consistently convince you look in\nKansas City and and and you are saying well this team's not going to get to the super bowl because of their running game right I even though ... a good running back um ... we're not that it's not the number one option we're looking at all when it comes to the Kansas City chiefs in the running game\n[noise] uh no no no listen I I'll I'll tell you when you when it gets to the playoffs only what do you need you need that ...\nYeah well yeah I Do yes what did you get to that but again if you're going to have a crappy deepest like the chiefs have if you think you're going to win by putting twenty four points on the board your solely mistaken\nHey when we come back to the Geico Fox Sports radio studios I Do want to get into some of these tweets also though\nA you and I tried to carve out some time to talk some college football so when you say we do it next because as we mentioned on he was on the air whenever the man this happened last night or at least for the most part is things started to wind down crazy finishing the Michigan State Penn State game what is it all mean who's still alive and the four team playoff chase and\nWill debut a new segment because again I Know no one else in sports talk radio is doing stock up and stock down and no one else knowing who you're buying or selling but I Need some help tonight theme of the night is weak the weak link so help me figure out who's good who is it I Know two teams who aren't\nBut who could we throw into that good category based\nOn how out this week a sneak a genius is play your brother you both seem to have a high IQ genius of sports radio\nI Would agree with that I I ... a silly right but and they get all your tweets coming up as well to it too busy night we're recapping a pretty wild week six which wrapped up with the great finished between the patriots and achieved as Kansas city's handed its first law of the season\nBut let's look back on the day that was in college football and that would only and Planck on Fox Sports radio\nHere\nOf college football after the break already to have Clemson with the best odds according to south Walter this is from the SPN analytics in their playoff predictor to get proper credit\nThey have Clemson with the best odds to make the playoffs at eighty two percent right now at six to know\nThe second best odds are bam at eighty percent but damn\nIt has the best odds to win the playoffs they might not have the best odds to make him but it had the best odds to win the title at thirty three percent right now so deal with those numbers as you make\nSense because of the conference that they play them yes you see a lot harder out lately so there's a you know not as much margin forever for Alabama\nWhat what are we going to do if you end up with a couple of one last teams from the FCC and the Notre Dame is sitting there with either a loss are undefeated right now I don't know if Notre Dame can afford along with what they had down the strain could undivided\nI think it's going to be ... Alabama Georgia Notre Dame constable choke somewhere along the line there we can only hope could you imagine as well there's is there any possibility that Michigan and Ohio State get it I guess not that the plane the end of the year that's not going to happen\nWell um I Do have a scenario can I laid out for us to have you seen that about that uh well I don't think the committee would ever let that happen but I have a scenario where we could have them come pretty damn close but before we knew that ladies and gentlemen boys and girls Steve the savior is in the house with everything going on in the world of sports what's going on Steve\nWe'll get to the red Sox and patriots victories but you're talking college football Alabama is a near unanimous number one in the new polls out today at Ohio State is up to number to\nLSU up to number five Michigan number six in ... Texas Seven Georgia fell to number eight and you mentioned Oregon there a number of twelve\nJust the one last if they had taken an e late and they're ... they have one that can develop bumble they've and a six and they would be six in West Virginia last they're down to Thirteen Kentucky fourteen Washington Fifteen\nPenn State down to Eighteen Iowa is ranked number Nineteen and then there's Wisconsin twenty three Michigan State twenty four Washington state's debuts at twenty five you mentioned earlier the London last for the raiders there was twenty seven three to Seattle\nBy the way London record attendance of near eighty five thousand for that game at ... stadium why we want to grow the game and send our best and we said that twenty eight oh wait a minute [laughter]\nA however Chris one good thing it it doesn't help at all for this year you're you're a emotion is felt from earlier talking about this team this year but\nWe all assume they're going to have a tough five draft pick for next year writers in addition there are getting that first round or from the mayor's traded away when you have a ... however most of the top five a draft prospects for next year our past Russia's what if the writers wind up with that all of her university accused her what Nick ... from Ohio State becomes a writer all is not last year\nI don't know where they're actually going to be playing next year and I'm not sure they do\nBut up San Diego yeah exactly that's why all the road as he is Cal is amenable to sharing for a season or something but and then they're going to Vegas and a couple of years so I'm just saying those nine well you've I appreciate you add one note I\nWas at the U. S. C. Colorado game last night and there's a star pass Russia or for the Trojans Porter Goss then he got hurt late in the game out for the year with a broken ankle this is the guy who has seven sex the rest of the U. S. C. team combined has six\n... on the field with his hair flying out of the helmet reminds me of clay Matthews except that he was never played this budget USA so bad news from the Trojans tonight\nGreat news if you're a Boston sports fan this evening David Price started a playoff game and you won\nBoston seven five over Houston even up the AFC Championship series at a game of peace Jackie Bradley nearly three run double up losing pitcher Garrett coal\nAnd the patriots gave up forty points and still won beating previously undefeated Kansas City forty three forty on a short feel go on the final play Stephen Kowalski five for five on field goals including from forty eight and fifty yards out\nSo the only undefeated team left in the NFL is\nThe LA Rams late wow gentleman in twenty five degree whether they be Denver third twenty three twenty yes that was a road game Todd girlie two hundred yards past are rushing and two touchdowns meanwhile case Keenan the X ray and three hundred twenty two yards passing\nDallas over Jacksonville forty seven\nBaltimore one Twenty one nothing at Tennessee sacking Marcus Mario to eleven times Pittsburgh with a late touchdown one at Cincinnati Miami the overtime win against Chicago Houston and the chargers with victories NASCAR when for Eric Elmer ... and the NBA regular season starts Tuesday night with two games\nMost teams will open on Wednesday in Los Angeles fs one will have the Dodgers stadium games in the NFL cs Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nThen in LA all eyes on TV fertile bronze debuted Lakers don't open till Thursday how convenient while and then they\nWill be as just the ... if if the rams were playing the chiefs today and they were both five in oh\nActually they are playing each other on a Monday Night game next month\nIn LA well yeah but I went to both feet undefeated if the Dodgers were playing a playoff game tonight or Ron weight and look ... was making his debut in the regular season opener which would be the highest one\nWell because in LA it's Lakers Dodgers and then everybody else why everybody else's fighting for scraps after those two litter Andre to live with ... fans wow now do you develop and I mean the chargers are going to be very exciting I think this year and get both to back it cetera et cetera but\nYou are fighting for scraps there is no denying that it's it's a loaded [noise]\nI'll say this much I Would love to see only put a pull up on this as thinking genius one on Twitter nobody does that either on a show yes I Know right it's very unique only we deal with things to say what does it mean one guy says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well a major probably\nShould have gone to a guy ... Fifteen minutes you I'll I'll make this quick there's a lot of good stuff coming in on Twitter I didn't realize you guys dug the college football talk so much I haven't gotten my give back to the NFL tweet yet but I like this from Colorado guy\nWho says the Big Ten is working interesting east is wide open Wisconsin he's still lose another so I can take it a boy could you imagine Iowa when the Big Ten champion Chong miserable I hate that the million dollar a man who's a guarantee that Texas will make the play offs I kind of like this from David in ... I Hope that doesn't happen\nWho cares if you get in trouble if they want you can call them the central Florida nights it doesn't matter\nHash tag name means yeah what I said what central Florida right yeah you know you're you're not incorrect in their actual name but the brand himself as you see a kind of like for instance\nAsia is happy that we're mentioning you I don't care what we call you one hundred by the right wow wow\nNow if we were doing it over under on ... ... what would you add ... to the total for a army no okay this is what is going to do\nThat is that is cold blooded so let me let the scenario here real quick before we get back to the NFL Arnie let's let's say hypothetically will will use the SEC first Georgia runs the table the rest of the way yeah Alabama finishes undefeated the two teams play in the S. E. C. championship game in Georgia beats them\nBoth have to go right I Would think so since Georgia one you said the east tap Alabama wins the west tap and if it's a close game\nWhich hopefully it is and Georgia doesn't take too much of it for that twenty love the show which I don't think that what was that up so early ah yeah I Would think they would take both teams Georgia and Alabama\nAnd and also they won't take much of it because they got demolished by Auburn during the regular season last year came back and beat him and the SEC title game\nAnd got it okay well what happens in the ... in the Big Ten conference championship if Ohio State is rolling undefeated in their final game of the season they get beat by one point he gets Michigan and a thrilling game\nAnd in Michigan goes on to win the Big Ten championship over either north western or Wisconsin are much Wisconsin team\nHad by the way Wisconsin is not a good look they've already posh guard we wish we already must have had money on\nNo I was I Know you you're going to win a gay completing what seven passes enough\nWhat would you do then you have an Ohio State team it finishes eleven and one has an incredible game it gets Michigan Michigan scene that will finish twelve in one has to conference championship is this a year where you think the selection committee will come out as a conference championships matter what would you do\nWhat would you do it could you imagine if they took Ohio State Michigan Georgia Alabama Notre Dame outstanding on the subway which oh what happened at Notre Dame came up with one last night they would be screaming bloody murder of the game at the end of the year I don't think this is what you can be without the guts to do that\n[noise] I don't I also will say this to and again I think any one that listens to the show knows I might be a little bit of a home or for my Oklahoma sooner is just just just just maybe a maybe I'll throw maybe maybe but\nWhat helped Oklahoma last year more than anything else was they had to win over Ohio State right they they had to win over Ohio State and that was huge and that might have been what got them into the playoffs army there's no one that really has that massive non conference when right now and that it in that interview\nReceiving but what but LSU has got the path laid out for them if she wins out the rest of the way they're in okay so you know they ... it to me I'm Talking about the teams that might need some help if it's Texas if it's Oklahoma if it uh I mean I I don't know I guess hypothetically you\nCan ... you you just told me about Georgia when all the rest of the games they've got thrown ... they're going to go out to vote today with all their games are going to go with um that everything that wins all their games are going to go on it and then the Alabama wins all their games are going to go on in", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "15"}
