here please studios Tammy Hubbard cats I I was sitting in my heart radio station [noise]\nFor twenty five late game the rams are nine to nine and a half point favorites depending on where you look over the Green Bay Packers Aaron Rodgers has never been this big an under ... in his career big story all week long right\nBut it's Aaron Rodgers is the Packers if the Packers are going to get both raised the Packers are gonna get bludgeoned it's going to be thirty eight Thirteen you can say what you want but the image of the Packers as winners is really greater than the reality of what they are that's the team where without Aaron Rodgers\nThis a team that's two and fourteen every year we that's where you want to talk about taking a guy away you take Tom Brady away from the patriots they'll still find a way to win at least nine or ten games I mean that's what you saw what did I was eleven when team yeah I mean that they'll still do it they'll still find a way to win games like that if the Panthers last Cam Newton\nThey still will find a way to win seven or eight games I mean you you still teams with with really good quarterbacks they'll find a way\nBut you take Aaron Rodgers away from the Packers and that's a two and fourteen team maybe this is a bad football team in Aaron Rodgers has lifted them up all by himself for his entire career he's never had the weapons around him that the elite weapons of other teams doesn't matter he's turn them into\nFunctional wide receivers with fantasy value\nBut that's not going to help him on Sunday because the rams are the best team in the national football league and mayor just blowing the doors off of everybody they are complete top to bottom coaching\nOffense defense special teams it's it's up there like a machine they're almost impossible you slow down right now and they're playing at home against the Packers good luck\nI mean I Know people say oh can be a shootout there no that's not going to happen the rams head injuries doesn't matter\nThere is about games where we run the ball what doesn't matter we went oh we throw the ball on it but it doesn't matter we when the rams are the best team in the NFL the reds played the cheese right now the rams and win a game over the chiefs and they beat them by at least ten to fourteen points that's how good the rams are that's where they are right now at this moment in time the only downside for the rams\nIs that are they peaking now right near Peking we gateway right on and you want to be picking a little bit later in the schedule but this could also be a team that just rolls it all the way up the week sixteen weeks Seventeen year old boy rams are undefeated we really want to hear but what are they going to lose a game but you know go to\nSmoke a pack but you go through their own thing defensively they haven't played particularly well for for long stretches either I mean you you're looking at a team that's been run on well\nBut the Packers don't trust the run you got a couple of their their alignment on the injury reporting Aaron Jones is still in mothballs\nLead to a lab in for Justin prospects are prospered our executive producer he's a Packer fan and every week we have the same discussion when are they going to actually let Aaron Jones and his six yards and carry average seem more than seven or eight touches and we still haven't seen it we're halfway through the season Jimmy Graham\nIsn't Jimmy ... years ago developed a Adams banged up and you look at those secondary receivers beyond him they'd been non existent so at that you would suspect defense where you've got some players that still get their\nTheir name recognition but our shells of their former self you've got a the formula even with Cooper cup out\nThat they're going to be able to do whatever they wanted this team I mean Todd girlie is is just putting up another ridiculous scene and you thought the touchdowns would have a a bit of a regression after last year's I Know he's got crushed that total and he may do so by week twelve\nAnd then they rationed just shut down because they don't have to play for anything any more but you could just be absurd level at which there they're performing and now you get the defensive line perhaps with the opportunity to tee off on Aaron Rodgers yeah this could get ugly in a hurry\nIt's going to look it's going to look close for a little while and Rogers gonna throw down field you're gonna think maybe then you're going to realize man the rams are like a surgeon's precision\nI mean that's the way you know some weeks they struggle a little bit they still find a way ... runs for a hundred and fifty yards and they when they go through the it makes no difference this team is absolutely loaded and I made it when they when the super bowl we're gonna wind up getting rings because\nJeff is you're got fired 'cause what Eric Dickerson set in our show so we should get Super Bowl rings and I mean the good ones the ones

they get thirty points can the Packers score that many against or you know a decent ramps defense if not great it it's pretty good luck we nowhere and Donald gets going\nCan the Packers handle him on the interior of their line\n'cause you don't worry too much about the outside passwords with a range is really inside\nIs where they caused our problem so I'm just I'm curious about this but I just think ultimately the ramp just have too much they're not gone undefeated go look for sixteen and they're not that good a team but I just think they're they're better overall I think they're also better on special teams that what the Packers have going right now rams will have their day that they lose and could it be on Sunday\nThe over under for this next game I think is it a hundred and Seventeen New Orleans and Minnesota I look this is what these are two teams we expected from the beginning of the year to be good it took Minnesota a little bit of time to get going but now it looks like they are how do you see this one\nWell with Minnesota the return of Everson Griffin a significant right I mean this this is big I just have a thing with New Orleans where you played such a hard fought game against the Baltimore Ravens and that was a physical\nGame right and and you know of course the emotional and when you have you know obviously Charleston Tucker missing for the first time since he was six years old out on a playground or you know that I mean you know for the saints to get by that's great but then they have to go all the way home\nAnd then go back and play in Minnesota I Know that they're inspired you know two events that playoff loss but I I'm just not seen it I think the Vikings have corrected the problems that they had on defense of communication has gotten better Griffin's return a significant you know the game is needed by ... you want to have that balance because as I can just throw it out I'm feeling\nI mean I don't feel and I can't believe I'm saying this looks almost unstoppable you know right now is simply these hundred yard game so I think the Vikings take this one I mean New Orleans look there'll be around toward the end but I just think it's really tough to ask them to have to play you know the Baltimore Ravens come back and then go the next week up to Minnesota to try to feel this way\nFor him on Twitter at Alex Marvin is that
