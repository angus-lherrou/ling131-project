{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KXIC", "content": "Uh bought the Houston Astros could be fine for shooting video that monitor the red Sox\nI look let me take you back to that before I Would say you got to expand on that monitoring the red Sox before game three of the A. L. C. S. tonight major league baseball's looking into an incident in which in game one of the ... there's not from tonight this is from game one\nThat during game one an Astros employee was shooting video from the photographers pit next to the Houston dug out\nThey were shooting video of the red Sox to see if the red Sox were doing anything outside the rules on their side of the field\nSo the Astros had a photographer\nShooting the red Sox to see that the red Sox weren't doing anything illegal or at least that's the cover story the ... putting up a you know we know this is just to make sure they were doing anything bad oh God it got see that's another that's how the patriots missed their whole big Spygate says\nHey we just shoot video to make sure no one's cheating us\nOh now I get it oh lawyer the Astros holding it you were the good guys well\nYou know that's it it it's like a the karate kid right Ralph macho uh-huh was the bag right he was the bully yes it was it it wasn't Williams Africa\nWell in a in an alternate kinda reality sure if you want to if you want to look at the movie and go All right well into\nNo believes that really did not act well in the in the first movie he said some things that was definitely not okay with with Elizabeth shoe no actually we're just not oh no that's right Ralph macho stuck his nose in 'cause he liked Elizabeth ... Elizabeth shoe is the incredibly gorgeous I had a done that\nWe're having gotten more cobra guy yes and more how I met your mother episodes\nTalking about that a bit more but they had the employer the Astros removed twice by security from the photographers pit during the game three twice\nAJ Hinch said after the game tonight I'm aware of something going on but I haven't been briefed thoughts very political or something but I don't know exactly where the current official briefing someone mentioned it to me right now that's a baseball issue they'll do what they have to do this is Alex Cora or who mentioned is following the game tonight\nOn the red Sox side of things so here are the Astros\nShooting video of the red Sox\nYou I think they're shooting video to make sure the after Red Sox are doing anything wrong come on man I mean I was born at night but\nNot ... well no it's the Eric mangy anything right cause allergy court was never bench coach last year it well and also it's look look\nWhat what is the red Sox do in the last series right they were able to tell when Severino was tipping pitch it was so now some think that that was going on for about a month right that there right now there was something that several of a natural starts with that\nBut this is where the Astros like okay are they picking up on anything we're doing the red Sox I mean they they can't be doing anything illegal from the dug out they would have been ... look there's advance scouts and look at these say\nThis was okay do they know anything that we're doing and we want to make sure we stopped\nI mean this is just a way for the Astros this is going to be a fine\nIt's something that everybody is talking about I'm sure that the actors are fine with it 'cause there's no way a guy with the cameras not going to be caught when he's next the Astros dug out this is their way of trying to slow the red Sox down for stealing sides or whatever else they're doing that are within the rules of major league baseball that's exactly what this well just remember\nThe the cardinals didn't exactly get the hammer lay down numbers dealing all sorts of stuff from out any material a lot of stuff they did a lot of jobs and because nobody could understand a lot of it it just got rushed to the wayside okay if you can do that and nobody cared I Can't imagine there's much going on it\nDid you see that again it was right\nAround how about a fresco Mike at swollen don't the Jason Smith show with my business read my carbon where minutes away from tip off at the oracle and a little bit of drama opening night regarding the free games speech given to the crowd by Steph Curry\nAnd oh by the way to do that as an Eighteen Nineteen chance for an action tonight and that's the Celtic yeah we got more on that coming up next fog [noise]\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know the first who were actually peach basket or going to war basketball is bounce you're than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game\nWell here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to

teeth so\nI Love the passion and they're willing to say that\nKnows what the intensity of the if he\nDied [noise] getting that note [noise] then gosh darn to die to get it you know and this sounds

Google Home a smart speaker just say okay Google Play eight hundred and ... and I heard radio\n[noise] Fox Sports ...\n... just to raise the Dodgers one nothing leave they had the lead on brain does yours too loud army I single and at first but the mango Santana\nThis is the deal with the warriors their their dynasty is on the down slope simply because\nEventually you guys are going to need to get paid you can't pay everybody and Kevin Durant is someone who\nObviously wants to scratch other issues in his career but he's doing exactly what LeBron did he didn't want to get criticized\nAs being someone who could never win a championship so I'm going to go to a ready made team I'm going to win and check that box off my resume so men wherever I go after this there's no pressure I've won championships no one can question me I mean that's what he's doing I mean there's where there's smoke there's fire and if Kevin Durant wasn't thinking of leaving go into the mix\nWe wouldn't have these conversations member we didn't have last year and the drive like Kevin de ... well what are you going to do he won a championship you're going to go someplace else there were no conversations about that last year not because Kevin Durant keeps things around his inner circle pretty tight lipped\nAnd there's there's no guys that say you find out something about Kevin Durant many other guys the league you find out about all the time but you don't find out stuff about Kevin uh rent or know stories now this year suddenly it's hey wants to reunite maybe with Kyrie in New York it's an into\nThese stories are getting out now whether this is to soften the blow when he does decide to leave at the end but the if you put a if you put a gun to my head and said where would you bet your money I Would say this is the last year for to rent in Oakland\nAnd you know baby book because there's someone they brought in knowing full well that he could leave we can reinvent this team around staff clay and ... you know we can be can play here for a few months we like them sign them long term whatever it is it certainly seems like that they're operating around that possibility and that's more of a likelihood that a possibility of cousins on the\nCheap for this year you know you're not counting on him to come back until after the the turn of the year\nAre entering get him into shape and then see if it how it works right in terms of that low for a few moments where he's at physically\nHe's at mentally and and then you make that decision and certainly for Kevin ...\nAll all the cards what it's all said and done but certainly for the the warriors who watched it last year you your your first unit continues to dominate\nBut you can make them a against the second unit in now that's the question of whether that shows this year or whether they're chasing another ring and and we get to see if it's a a three sided dungeons and dragons like die\nOh one of those twenty sided ones role for hit boy that was the ... role for charisma have done the comeback man you go into shops now you're going to accomplish that he knows that you do any NBA again back see eye to eye infections a dice and cards and stuff yeah yeah it's it's it's a new life see I always like being the dungeon master\nMore than I like playing so I like making up the rules and everything and being able that surprised the adventure I like doing that did you have a cat on your lap that you were stroking during the then the whole faith labs\nYes Mr powers we'll see what happens to you when you lose the black razor\nAnd our dirty they just go right through Iraq really went a little bit too far that raised it was really power nicely done really power hey we got baseball updates a there's a good gift going around the ritual punting\nA cooler yeah it looked like candy oh yeah yeah yeah there's like it was like a bubble gum cooler or our body are Eric Roberts works here ah is tweet was pretty funny one there's only milk judge left about Halloween bucket yeah has really gum and everything is flying gave all Iran and ritual comes to the dog out\nGrabs the gum cooler\nIt looks like a kidney cool to like one of the spectrum and walk around with the kidney I already got it all six back and he just started landing it to the game is not good for anybody anger look this ... this entire series like I said I feel like the Dodgers are the frustrated team and the brewers are the team that has that are\nPlaying from a standpoint of\nBeing the favorites and of being more under control and it's like the Dodgers really did not see this coming that they would struggle like this in the end all cs against the brewers starting pitching because you look at now that this has been I Believe sixteen innings\nOf starting pitching from the brewers in this series and the Dodgers have two runs off what is the biggest weakness the team had so when you want to point if this turns out badly for the Dodgers and the brewers are able to win\nThat you point to that the brewers right now sixteen innings from their starting pitching in the first four games because of starting pitchers out of the game now gets all of that and it's and it's one run\nAnd it's one or two runs have been allowed that this is where the Dodgers needed to make hay against the brewers before they get deep into their both but I don't mean they got to do it in the first inning but you've got weighed Molly going five in each of the guys going three innings right\nFour innings and relievers coming in who weren't there best guys and the Dodgers just have not played with the sense of urgency you get into the brewers bullpen and when they come into games that are\nTied or they have a slim lead they're going to protect that because their bullpen is really really good\nThey show the graphic earlier in the game or I don't have the updated numbers but at the time seven eight nine ... for the Dodgers three for thirty three in the series with eleven strike out and you look at it tonight Machado tried calling time out in the bottom of the best didn't get time out\nAnd me called third strike lucrative down so not I haven't seen it batch for the Dodgers hitters tonight to hits\nEight strike at Twitter at how about a fresco might get swollen DOMA Jason Smith show with my business friend like already got Jay

Celtics defeat the Philadelphia\nSeventy Sixers one oh five eighty seven\nAnd I said at the end of last year but it's opening night and they play again so I got to continue on because like it is with the show we say something\nPeople going all crazy about it and then a few months later it happens and they don't know I like that ah yeah just watch just watch when she Jay ... is playing great in December people are going to go when you know a a you know maybe he could be the quarterback for the niners next year drop below might not be yeah yeah we're we're we're a little bit of ...\nUm bought Celtics win tonight on a night where\nThey get back Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward and may combined go six for twenty six from the floor Hayward scores ten points Kyrie Irving seven on just to uh fourteen shooting he does dish out seven assessed and the Celtics when easy this should\nBe a game that sends shivers through the rest of the NBA where your to quote best players combined to go six for twenty six Seventeen points and you win by twenty\nThis is why the Celtics are going to win the NBA title their collection of talent is deeper than anybody in the NBA Hugo one through nine\nAnd I don't know that there's a team that can match up with them right now one through not even the warriors you get one through three okay well you got Katie got hurt but then you get into four or five six seven eight noticed\nBoy that Celtics benches still really good Jason Tatum is going to become one of the top ten players and the game this year he led the way to make what twenty three point nine rebounds three is says he's just that superstar kind of guy he makes clutch baskets he makes big basket he makes the big plays he's going to become that\nGuy but\nWhen you see what the Celtics bring off the bench and you know we talk about the raptors bench last year was great and you and I talked about how good the bench of the Lakers are going to be especially if Alonzo ball is running the second unit it's him and coups coming off running up and down Stevenson I used to be a pretty decent bench coming into people at all even on the way 'cause\nThere was only find when he when with nothing right out of the best player in the NBA hey guess what yeah and if it even though when you looked at the additions the off season it's here's a bunch of spare parts whenever they're spare parts only in comparison to the guy leading the charge [laughter] and the rest of the west\nAs much as we talked about competition last year it was two teams and then a muddled mess of seven or eight squads and the Lakers can cut that line pretty easily with that second unit like was you look at the Celtics it's that same thing I mean are you scared of of loony and you get a dollar\nAnd living in our cars ... dollars at the same guy you know he's a big moments in a big game now and again but you can't bank on that consistently or well not ... years ago yeah ... ... eventually boogie cousins comes back but what's what is the health wise and how does he fit into the system\nLook the east is weak LeBron left and yes the Sixers are pretty good and the raptors may be pretty good depending on how why Leonard comes and we have to wait and see how that\nManifest itself is he going to come in and be\nThe team and he was in San Antonio when he was playing and he's going to be a great guy or is it hard really not in it and we're going to get stories every couple of weeks how unhappy Hawaii as he doesn't leave his hotel room because it's too cold out you know we've got to that that we have to see how that plays out but the Celtics clearly are the most talented team in the eastern conference\nAnd when you look at their bench that every night coming off the bench plan twenty to twenty five minutes or Markus smart and Terry rosier and every night\nThese guys bringing rosier tonight was plus twenty two off the bench every bad nights for these guys off the bench are plus five seven points five rebounds forests this\nAnd most nights they're better than that look mores came off the bench tonight sixteen in ten and Twenty one minutes beams has eight and four and three in Nineteen Minutes when the Celtics bring their guys off the bench they continue to play just as well\nOff runner on they left six on in the first three innings they have scored one run in the last sixteen innings in this series the brewers starters and bullpen\nAll doing their job will keep you updated on both of these games got more on the Astros Red Sox as well but real quick before we get to a job I could do with no experience okay go a when YouTube went down tonight\nYeah it was down by night YouTube went dead it was you know it's still now and I just ... down\nSo many YouTube stars there going okay okay

deals whoever owns the cat either that or you have to steal the cat I mean there's a lot going on there\n[noise] meanwhile under the category of jobs I could do with no experience I could be the prime

different teams\nTalking to major league baseball about it the ... the Dodgers the Indians and oh by the way the red Sox now finally caught man genie who finally caught the guy doing it\nI mean this is this one from being a this is the miners' story and maybe the guy was said who knows so now it's what kind of role did this have in the Astros winning the world zero and\nYou have the allergies score a writer who's now in the dugout for the red Sox who was the bench coach last year in the planet who's done\nSo in the Eric man Jeannie effect going on there and like now you know we got to know some things so now you add more fuel to the fire\nIn so major league baseball Rob ... not going to be able to just do a ceremonial handing off of a trophy at this point they've got some legitimate work to do and this is really potentially damaging here now we joked about it earlier but it is true the cardinals did some really terrible things in terms of\nElectronic espionage and stealing scouting reports and all sorts of the guys that are tied to the Astros by like a and [laughter] really nothing happened Mm Mm of any substance in that regard that kind of came and went without much\nMuch reporting and much handwringing on anybody's part this one\nAs the playoffs are are heating up\nNot what major league baseball had mine\nThis tells me this tells me that I've been doing sports talk radio for a long time because you know they always say history repeats itself but usually when you get when you get a crazy story like Spygate it takes a generation to repeat itself that were there\nWere there again you know we had we had it and football in the early to thousands of now we're getting close to the end of the teams and and we got it again and major league baseball now the ads this deal inside this is how they've got illegally stealing signs illegally stealing sides using a guy with a cell phone camera stealing signs\nThat level stuff going on here this goes back to January twenty Seventeen cardinals had to give up to picks and two million dollars\nFor hacking into the email system in scouting database seems really a man that's not even half of the middle reliever\nNo but if you can get all kinds of debt it's worth a million dollars or a draft picks sure most of whom don't get off the bus in double A. anyway and this is the big thing now ... what this is a story\nThis has become a really big story in just a few minutes because of the number of teams that have been reported to talk to major league baseball about it again I'm not make it up Dodgers\nA.'s the Indians warned the red Sox now the red Sox are the ones who do saw this and got major league baseball investigating this now you're going to say\nHow did the Astros get so good this fast yes we spend a lot of time all on all their young players getting good and that's awesome but now it's going to be hey how much is it have to do with stealing science how much of their successes because they either knew pictures that were coming they knew plays that were coming whatever it is what does this have to do with their success\nOr you like this from from past ... column and there'll be sent\nPeople from his baseball operations office at another six security personnel to monitor the game league station employee in each of the teams video review rooms according to the source\nAnd

they they have they have done things and and it might be the one as well about the about the uh the data being stolen it in the past with the cardinals and ... and and being a victim on that and the things\nUh as the Astros were it it it causes them to the question of why why why is this necessary to even try to do\nAre many ways candidly that that uh whether it's still in the field of play that ... if if the question is stealing science\nThings that are that are much more above board and and on on the field or there are different ways that again the parts of the science feeling\nHas been going on in the sport for a very very long time but as long as long as it's on the field of play as long as it's not being done with technology a Middle East technology and that in that capacity is it's very much um [noise]\nIt's very much understood it's very much a part of the game this is not part of the game and I think this this if it ends up being proven to be accurate and and and uh certainly doesn't look good for the Astros in this moment but if if this ends up being a proven and document it it\nJust it looks terrible it looks terrible for it seemed that is that a lot of success has so much talent\nAnd and candidly does not need this is the team it does not need to be a searching for edged in this area again if this ends up being what uh what it appears to be on a in many ways so I'm really this is a story that were just become aware of right now today but\nThere there's a lot to it and I think a lot of questions to be asked\nAbout a team that that really is not it should not be in a position where it needs to do something like this because the talent level that they've had a book about for several years\nLast weren't going to be real quick um why can't the Dodgers either at least take one for the team or or do anything with runners going position and continue to strike an animal arming rates\nWell that that is the story the series right now and and the brewers poison building to make pitches a big spots it's been a big part of it and and despite the youth of their\nStaff but that's where you look at the game tonight already a pretty broad and corporate burns that the two youngest pitchers the brewers have used all season long combining for five scoreless innings and and many of those high leverage pitches ... with with men on base\nAnd the Dodgers simply at Johns both with one of the broadcast I think he's absolutely right it's a team that that last game seven of the world series\nLast year and they now know they're supposed to win and they're playing like a team that knows it is supposed to win which is not always the best thing to do this is the the one sport I've made this point before and I'll I'll I'll make it again as long as a cover the game\nYou think about our major sports in this country that we play if you include football basketball baseball hockey and soccer uh this is probably the one sport that you can play better by playing harder you play harder you try harder often it's to your detriment and I think that the the Dodgers right now you guys are living in a little bit of that right now here and they had all the U.S\nWell except for many Machado because he doesn't hustle whenever you know what else you know you get your point\nThere there there are different contact in general uh we we we should all it's a struggle and the way they manage ...\nIndeed you can follow him on Twitter had John rosy that's had John rosy MLD network Fox Sports when did you sign up for your baseball more Michigan will varies football needs following the beat down was not very\nGo hey I got to tell you what it and certainly I I look for them that conversation with them by about this but a very impressive whenever the maze and blue they're most thorough performance against the ranks quality team and a long time you got to do the will not have a big one on Saturday I guess as far as we'll see what have\nYou seen it on and you'll see it on Fox\nDid a big big big big big big than I Do think they take the\nComing up in one minute we'll have more on the Astros Spygate first everything that's trending right now with Deb cars in DC\nSo much and we'll start with employers in al cs game for and not want to be still Milwaukee at the Dodgers there in the top of the ninth inning right now\nHe leaves the series games one will keep you posted on this one earlier this ... sounds like the Astros aid to Boston now in that series games to one game for Wednesday at age thirty\nMonday bigger story seems to me a story that has come from ... one on this series major league baseball now investigating an incident that happened during Houston's when it's an ... an asteroid simply appear to be shooting video from the photographer ... into the red Sox dying out in the league is\nSaying they want to handle the incident internally that report by ESPN master only says the ashes assigned the employee to monitor the red Sox to make sure they weren't breaking any rules\nAnd the ... and Dodgers abuzz complained about the same kind of issue before in the Asian complained that are back in August and Houston players were stealing signals\nAJ hinge the Houston skipper was asked about it after tonight's game and he said he had heard that something was going on but he was more focused on the games and this is going to be a story that isn't going to go away anytime soon rate news there's a quickly to save money switched in thank God I ... and ... minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on your\nCar insurance and other based on who's the Marlins will remove the guardian mechanical home runs culture in the left field the Marlins Park outside the stadium to make room for new standing room only tickets\nAnd I think seven stories high commission by former Marlins owner Jeffrey L'Oreal costs two point five million bucks I like as much as the warriors rings evidently things are pretty\nIt was a lot better than than that\nYeah they don't they don't look like they belong in the Gulf\nYes I found her in warriors by the way our is still under way if the Seventy five seven and went home lean for Golden State over Oklahoma City for to go in the third earlier tonight Celtics when their season opener over the Sixers while five eighty seven\n... live from the studios the Jason Smith show with my best friend my Carmen all you had to walk in the Dodgers tied one if he says the brewers back in the top of the ninth inning but a little bit more on the Spygate thing look this story is just starting to break wide right now because we have major league baseball teams that are documented to have\nEither approach major league baseball or the red Sox with the fact that the Astros were getting video of teams\nThat as they were playing and using that information to relay signs to the team in the field one report said it was collapse that the Astros were using in one report said it was was beating a I'm a trash can yeah scanned in in the ... out and that was either giving you a fastball Korean or whatever it is now look\nThere's stealing signs and dares doing it illegally right it's just the comparison to Spygate it's amazing and when everybody else takes that tomorrow You're welcome are just like people took our chargers take but that's fine so\nAnd that's the only two or three weeks so that's right so here's the thing is that\nAs I said with John Paul morose the Astros who of course the night were accused of a ... illegally shooting video of other teams and taking that video during games and giving it to their players so they could steal signals and and know what what pitches another uh you know plays teams we had had put on we're coming is that\nIf you're stealing signs on the field great it's like if you're stealing signs from an opposing side line\nOkay I get it if you're on the sideline and one of your guy sees hey coach I just saw you know we were doing this all game what this this is going to wind up being a past the flat whatever it is that you know what that's completely\nOn ... you got to figure out a way which is why you see many teams in college football I've have\nPlayer signaling in plays and they used dummies the gummy some guys are stealing stuff faded some stuff doesn't work\nYou do that's on you if one is the head of Peter Griffith mean on one side I mean yeah there's a lot of stuff going on whatever you do on the field anything goes it's the same thing for major league baseball you see this all the time where for some reason there'll be a big mountain conference in the eighth inning of a one one game ... runners on second base\nAnd a team is wary that someone is stealing signals either because they're stepping off the base with the with a certain foot they're touching a part of their body whatever it is\nThis was a way to steal fun if you're doing it during the game yeah that is legit\nBut when you're at the point where you're like the patriots you're shooting video of the other teams to break it down so you can use that\nIn the game and then disseminate that his preparation for Tom raiding the patriots office or the defense yeah no that's a load of crap that's illegal the same thing here using a cell phone to steal signals to be able to get it out so are there so so they know if you're the players on the field know what's coming no that's a load of crap\nAnd just like with the patriots\nThey wouldn't be doing this if this wasn't giving them a huge benefit they wouldn't be doing it the patriots wouldn't have been stealing those signs all those years if it didn't give them a huge benefit because the chance of getting caught was really great it took me and Jeannie to finally do it\nBut the chance of getting caught was great and once the jets reported the patriots were Spygate we had what the lions the rams other tease the eagles all say oh yeah we thought they were doing this\nFor a long time but the jets reported it so now the teams are saying yes this was\nOn the other shows that are just throwing things into the way they're doing with the the play clocks are with our transmissions or like they they came up with a list about thirty things like hey we're going to try and what do you think you'd find anything on this this this of this because we all had problems", "show_name": "The Jason Smith
