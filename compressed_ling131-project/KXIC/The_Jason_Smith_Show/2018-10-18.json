back in the bottom of the fifth inning we'll get back into the job west controversy coming up in about ten minutes because\nJoe West took a home run away from ... to ... and the first inning and it really fails to pass understanding how that happened\nAnd it looms large here as we get deep into this game\nIn his major league baseball who when we talked about these stories last night we realized at the time that well you're hoping major league baseball will do something but it is a major league baseball Rob Manfred likes to do nothing and that's what we got today many Machado after stepping on all you are foot running down the baseline last night\nWas not suspended was just find an undisclosed amount by major league baseball\nHe's been out of control for the past few days\nAlso major league baseball says that the investigation into the Astros Spygate scandal which involves five teams who I've talked to a major league baseball at the Astros had an employee stealing signs the eighties the Indians the\nRed Sox Yankees the Dodgers all of this has happened the story broke less than twenty four hours ago teams all saying hey we think the actors are stealing signs they employ a player a port a person who was taking video with this camera phone and we think they were giving out signals to players on the field\nSomehow after this break last night major league baseball besides we have investigated this and it's closed we rented this thoroughly we've told team's not to do this practice anymore because we feel that the Astros were just taping the red Sox because they were concerned the red Sox were doing something badly\nAnd this is what I'm elder\nYou go to the conclusion of look\nLast night this story was poised to become a really big deal and major league baseball I Can't do anything when major league baseball decides we don't want to do anything and we would rather look embarrassing\nThan actually do something Rob Manfred wants to do nothing just didn't involve pizza place we doesn't care he didn't want to do anything nothing you are too big controversies and they just swept under the rug today and look I Know and and many people on Twitter saying to me\nOh geez I get I talked to is going to be a big deal is big story I said yeah I did too but there's nothing I can do when major league baseball decided you know we just refuse to invest it really you had a full in this story is less than twenty four hours old and you said every TV detective you good to investigate it and they all came back and said you had nothing to see here\nThey just decided to say you stop it and we're not going to cover this anymore and we're moving on it's embarrassing but that's made a they were just\nPlaying defense they they just wanted to make sure that they were videotaping in case someone else was videotaping it I mean it makes perfect sense yeah I Know\nAnd now the red Sox actually there don't wait so we're the bad guys do people think they're suspicious of us just because they put up is lame excuse and and they'll be wants to sweep this away now they're hoping that the\nGames of today we'll give you a a a bit of a mind a racer take another shot 'cause we're not going to discuss it\nRight the game is proof Rob Manfred makes Adam Silver looked like Paul ...\nComing up next\nThe big joke was controversy and what else are you talking about oh yeah

their latest album was automatically added to the library's them all I to users\nAround the world saying the move was a drop of megalomaniac and a touch of generosity high to users complain that the eleventh songs that they had it to their music library without permission and then it was not clear how to delete them\nIt was a rare symbol for Apple can you to\nLook back at\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it\nI mean every day I see I always cities luck I sports station and now all the University of why what sports we Gary are available via streaming at ... dot com\n[noise]\nThis is what it means to get a home run taken away and call them that this was a home run this was not a case that this was not a case of hey\nI understand this sucks for the Astros but the call was right on the field this was a dicey call and there's no way Joe ... thought\nSo now this is what the callers on the field and then there'll be says yeah we really don't want to overrule our empire because nobody wants to overrule umpires less the major league baseball they always want to stick with the call in the field at least in the NFL\nOfficials now I could get overruled any moment they're going to go we're going to look at this year's a challenge I could get overruled they are finally comfortable with that they didn't like it at first but they've got a long time to get used to it now know MLD umpires want to get over all\nAnd it's like they're taking care of each other and for major league baseball to kind of thing and this and go well yeah we're going to stick with Joe West on this rule I'm like that's just ridiculous you can't tell me that that wasn't a home run and as I say this\nLittle Red Sox have just gone deep jak jak gladly\nJunior another homerun another one another one and now the red Sox lead the astro another one six five in the top of the sixth inning so suddenly the answer's gonna really really really use that Jose all to buy a home run\nIn the first inning no interference shall be allowed on a field or reaches over a fence railing rope or into a stand to catch a ball he does so and his own risk now\nIs glove makes contact with the fan and closes all sales in\nIt's a home run period now here's what you have to do now we have to have hockey glass\nIn front of the the fans from now on because otherwise they can't sit there\nAnd they can't be part of any of these type place so for all your ... and\nAnd and my trout and whatever else and now we just can't have fans in the first two rows or wherever a guy can potentially leap is really what you're saying with this because if if he interfered right if this guy interfere with the ball that was in the field of play you should be a jacket right isn't that the rule yeah yeah I'm going to throw them out they didn't jak this guy\nThey may have come over and talk to them so that kinda sucks so he didn't get to keep that souvenir whatever else but that's it\nRight there and they didn't they inject him and he gets to sit in his front row seat and everything goes on so\nLet's be consistent with what the the verbiage is and the rule was quite clear here I mean that's in the stands quite clearly just do they we we watched it as a bird or film probably about fourteen times\nIn the last twenty minutes alone that he not not even going back to the thirty times before it's like All right here's another angle and here's another angle and now here's the super slow mo close up like all of that's available to be looked at in time and time again you see we're ... love is before it makes any contact with a fan\nIt's into the stands it's it's really there's no argument whatsoever that that holds up west call\nBut I get major league baseball makes the most curious decisions right to to to take the anger out of this call 'cause this'll be all anybody talks about it the red Sox win this game by a run that's where it's going to go and and I understand that baseball does curious things but\nIf they were just more consistent with how they would rule things I Would get it ... like I said with the NFL I may not agree with stuff but I get it but with baseball I don't because there's there's a place where All right this is clearly\nAbsolutely going to be over rules and it's not for some reason sure or okay this play is going to stand because they know and then it's overall\nAnd there's no rhyme or reason why\nI Need again major league baseball after this game to say how was this call made to make Joel West available or to make somebody else available to say this is why this call was made because I Love to see them say yeah the fan was in the field the puck is a fan was in the field of play it said we're going to get\nA job I said to a pool reporter which means there's no audio it's just what somebody wrote down I mean there's no way you can say he was on the field he was in the field that the fan interfered with the ball the fans stood up\nWas standing he actually had his had his elbows in at his side and had his hands out like he was like right by the cradle it like someone was going to give credit where someone's going to put a plate of food and his hands like how you put your hands out for that he's not reaching out at all\nNo one is reaching out if he was reaching out I'd get it nobody is reaching out and the fact that major league baseball wanted to stay behind Joe West on this call I mean it just it makes no sense but Jay I'm going to be a ... they're going to be so incredibly pissed off after they see this\nWell you you see that and then you have the decision as we talked about the would be Spygate if they're going to punt on that\nBut how much effort or they get put into a review of ... home run in the first inning of the game and say All right play on and so that's exactly what we have and now you've got a one Ron game going the other way and as we we push for Jackie Bradley junior nine RBI\nWith two outs in in his last three games so coming clutch for Boston and now we'll see if they can make that hold up\nYeah you know and your point earlier to to the whole fact that that when bats went out to try to get the ball yes his hand in glove does make contact with the fans hands who are trying to catch this fall\nBut part of it is it's part of it well he closed his glove way before the boy\nTo catch it looked like he was closing as well I mean I don't know I don't know if that's a part of it though is that I I mean I don't know if that's just 'cause I'm I'll tell you what I Know and don't know I don't know is that something they can look at a review and say you know what he wasn't going to catch it because he closes love too early he was sleeping in this this was it\nI got a bead on the ball and I'm going up and I'm going to get it this was on running I'm jumping on leave because I was not even looking just got his glove up and he closed his love too soon he wasn't going to catch that ball I mean I don't know if I don't know if that's I don't think he was either\nA I I think the the glove was closing as the embrace it ready for contact with the wall and and the crash come there\nRegardless it still comes down on the the letter of the law the rule that just says if you're leaping out of the field to play if you're into the stands it's not interference Gary\n... end of discussion as to whether is gloves open closed anything else\nIt's it's not a judgment call at least as well as as this rule is written it's not a judgment call of whether you would have still made a play once you're going into the stance\nGet ready for the owners meetings to announce on every wall and major league baseball is now going to add to feed to it to stop this from happening all add the glass is hockey glass and other banging on the glass\nTonight Show is brought to you by discover card we treat you like you'd treat you\nStill six five red socks

those are two things that are usually mutually exclusive either you or a player's\nCoach or you're in the analytics and I'm Sorry but this has got to be a relationship that is you have to understand after make decisions that are cold and calculating but he embraces both of them\n... is a phenomenal head coach and they bought into his vision and teams like the next should be like this they should be a team that their results on the court is greater than who they are individually\nAnd that's the nix showed tonight yes it was the hawks but don't win games like this over the course because because there's always going to be hungry guys out there that want minutes don't want to play and ... there was a good coach and its east well\nIn and I hate to bring up the the past but look at last year's Lakers team one more time thirty five when we can talk about how nobody took it seriously that was a night often maybe give away a game on occasion whenever the excuse you want to make is they

Dodgers playoff game you can hear a pin drop at staples Centre much of last season and they still one thirty five games and that was in the west\nSo we look at the Nixon and you could pick a handful

down in the bench for whatever reason the Celtics we talked about a word or event you can monitor their minutes an hang out whatever with the Nixon the playing the hawks but but the idea that we might actually have some teams looking to extend their benches as me a bit excited\nYeah absolutely I mean what what what certain teams that you know not really competing for you know playoff position as of this marathon see that you're going to see a lot of guys there are a lot of quality minutes because you got to discover or figure out what you actually have\nYou know but with some of the teams that pretty much a symbol of you know what you got you want to see those guys just trying to\nYou know played a rotational God they know exactly what you know are expected of them and how to move forward

Shaw a day ago\nPresident of baseball operations Andrew Freedman was asked about ... hey this could be as last start coming up today 'cause if her shawl was bad and the Dodgers lost they could lose the ... maybe as last game as a Dodger\nWhich suddenly all of a sudden that's hitting you in the face\nAll you need to say at this point is well we're not thinking about that\nClinton was our guy we'd love for Clayton to come back we want to build around him continually we want Clinton back if you want Clayton curse shot back\nAt over thirty million dollars for each in the next two years it's easy to say because it's not your call you have no bearing on this oh you have to do is say we love you and what you want you to come back it's like when you're if you're dating somebody and you don't know are we going to stay together you break up and you say to her\nHey just tell me you want to be with me and it will stay together and instead of saying of course I Want to be with you she says well not thinking about that right now a lot of stuff going on in my life I don't know where I'm going to be you know she doesn't love you and you shouldn't be together all Andrew Freedman had to say was of course we want Clinton back\nClinton's our guy clear we want Clinton back but he didn't say that\nThat's an al ... thing to say we're ready to move on without Clinton crush and Clinton were kind of pushing you out of the nest now she can go someplace else we told you this week and a half ago it was unpopular what it was said and now everybody's coming back on you know this could be the last time and crucial could be testing free agency\nLook sometimes were just way ahead of storylines and I'll tell you when we are we're way out of this one\nWell going all the way back to the game on start and\nIt's all float from there to good storage one bad start from ... in the last two or three bad but I think a little bit maybe we'll go just a karaoke after the show\nMaybe at DJ I've poured in sorry go ahead but Friedman in his comments\nIt it seems to me it for a team that has been so calculated right the new business side of baseball and taking care and ... things up and going through the analytics and here's your line up and lead shuffle up and deal time and time again that you would have that statement\nMhm just pouring gasoline on what was already a little fire\nAnd being in California you see a lot about forest fires you see a lot about things rage you got to control here's an opportunity to say you know what we got some meaningful bay baseball and Clinton's got a couple of starts left it in this year we did when we got\nYou went in ... you could say oh you wanted to say but just say of course we want Clinton\nBack that day it's like I said but you know you you put gasoline on a fire you've got people now more columns getting written them well let's read between the lines a little bit more what's that ... availability for her shop what's the next question is already a chat bass so now he's going to have that again\nAll Andrew Freedman said was we're not thinking about this now we're focused on twenty Eighteen were you having internal dialogue we're talking and we'll deal with this at the end of the seat right\nThat at all I can watch them there is a human response and there's a gut check hey we watch your back you think all the Dodgers one Clinton to stay forever be a Dodger forever that's not that important to the front office\nIs certainly not the message push for Fox Sports\nRadio that Jason Smith show with my bag friend my

with the pick six the jets three\nThe Packers sixteen so I'm so excited there's no way you can see that as interference especially on the replays but major league baseball who never wants to overrule an umpire if they don't have to says yeah we're sticking with the call in the field\nAnd and that ah it's ridiculous I understand that you want to make sure you back up the referees an umpire's as much as possible in all sports but baseball is the worst for replay because they don't have anything that is\nThat that's a pattern that you can say okay this is a home run because this is not a home run because this is out because it's really at the whim of whoever is in the booth and and I don't get it there's no consistency like we get I may not like what roughing the pastor is in the NFL but I Know what it is when I see it now\nAnd I may not like what a catch not catch was in the NFL but I Know what that was one I saw it but I Can't tell what's going to be overruled what's not in baseball baseball needs to make sure that Joe West and and and baseball is transparent after this game and someone is available to explain just how it was fan interference when clearly no one reached over\nThe edge to get in the field no one did and still they said yeah interferes no one froze out to you\nKnow they said the rule is explicit very clear ah there's no ambiguity in the first part of the statement right in the way it goes through its the player puts himself and his own risk\nAnd its own peril I I don't know what that is supposed to mean in terms of a larger and you know what happens you're you're gonna end up crashing into their bodies in there but we saw bats glove go past the wall\nDefensive position by the\nThe fan as the ball's coming in because let's face it all coming in

with one of the fans and get shot I think he was shutting it anyway and wasn't going to catch the ball but they decide that's enough\nIn the stands to call it out to him to run on road is just allowed and in major league baseball if we're gonna do review let's let's do it right\nI I don't I don't ever expect consistency because we still have so many it's like the NFL you're good judgment calls all over the place you know you're never sure exactly what you're going to get because we we look at interference calls and we look at some of those things that go to reply or we can still\nFight about those but for major league baseball here this one seem fairly obvious what are you going to do put up Plexiglas like you're in hockey and you're not going to be able to have um a play or go and Rob\nA home run because of the ... on the off chance he crashes into a fan 'cause a fan wants a souvenir Mm it's ludicrous\nTo see the fans are the beer banging on the glass like they're out of hockey oh that's what I mean I bet you suck mix so early that far but they didn't object the fan now when they talk to him but he ... the action so in theory just got up and you know you interfered with the ball\nIn play he rejected mhm no questions grab your stuff and get out just got ejected exactly in this case it saying a server can you not do that again\nIt's kind of ludicrous say when you when you look at it and the way a major league baseball has decided to abandon or any true reviews of anything on or off the field this point\nI mean really baseball I ... I Need something more from them on on plays like this whether it's Joe ... Hernandez there's somebody more than that on this I mean really if you're talking about a call that could conceivably\nKnock the Astros out of the post season because Joe us decides Yup I saw it and this is the thing about umpires in major league baseball like Joe West an angel Hernandez\n... what you're supposed to do as an umpire is you're supposed to\nOfficiate by the rules you're not supposed to interpret the rules to how you see it you're supposed to enforce the rules and when the rule says\nIf a player reaches into the stands\nThere is no fan interference I'm Sorry that's not Joe wants to go yeah but to me he kind of jumped up no no no\nYou have to interpret that as there is he reached in this day and that's not fan interference I don't I don't see how you can say that but that to Joel West is that to angel Hernandez as it's not about the rules I have to enforce its Mariah interpretation of the rules\nAnd this is where anybody that's got to follow rules for all living in any any sort of profession always gets in trouble\nOr was it because now it's been my interpretation of what I Need oh well okay then it's your at your interpretation\nHappens everywhere just wrapping happen tonight and major league baseball in this particular case\nRight this isn't a hey let's put some overlay of a strike zone or a yellow first down line or anything else like you reached into the crowd\nIt seems pretty obvious that this is cut and dry ... this isn't a a judgment call this isn't you know have fair fall due to catch in just a little bit of shock\nOr a play at second base where we're talking about all rides bikes and it did the tag beat the runner they're so ... in auto it's an automatic out 'cause that's the way it used to be ... by we got a little bit of controversy and this one also over a play at second base where Korea doesn't touch the bag right a seal neighborhood play\nAnd instead it extends the any you get a walk in another run so that gives the red Sox and insurance run by\nYou know that's interpretation and go through it's clear he touched base but in the past that wasn't review nobody cared like he was close enough\nSports radio the Jason Smith show with my band friend my Carmen I'm former warrior star Matt Barnes just came in\nThe fair point to this to this point I think we just seeing him a do everything he can to denigrate the legacy of Reggie McKenzie is working\nThe national football [laughter] who's called out any player he doesn't like I mean he's making the bills looked like a ... well run organization and they got Jared ...\nWhile he's making a making a joke slick like\nOh well I'm Out of her life that look\nHow well you know don't don't even don't even like go whoa whoa whoa wait a second okay after you did the broadside army Andrew\nLuck [laughter] just tolerate it I have one word for you\nI ... if you want more arteries and I don't want to hear your one where I was just one word you're\nI'm tolerate a couple of thousand all the words of Europe in federal you are rich or don't want to know one before this is like this is all of a sudden changed my outlook yeah Jason Smith while his old yeah this was we're on alert this one word rhino horn I got one word for simple um [laughter]\nIt's all the Andrew Luck well ...
