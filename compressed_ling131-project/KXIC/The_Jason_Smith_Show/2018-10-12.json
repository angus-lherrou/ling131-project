my heart radio station [noise]\n\nFox Sports trending\nBarclay finally has something to show for his two hundred and plus all purpose yard adult part\nBecause they had done everything right for forty years figured no no no we know what we know how to do it and now they make the bad decision they tripled down on fake one Barclay was the right guy meanwhile all they're going to do is say boy look look what's going on with us when we think and we really need a quarterback\nAnd that's the writing you're not going to get a trend transcending figure at that position unless everything else is working in harmony and you've got so many other holes as we've seen over the course of this year and they ... every week we seemed to see a I'm a new gaping hole or open up for the giants but you're also looking at it it's not just saying do\nYou look at an all the other quarterbacks that are playing pretty well like Allen got no chance playing behind that buffalo off at the line\nBut I'm a few occasions that he actually gets tied to deliver the ball down the hill you you shrug your shoulders ad this guy can be pretty good once they actually build something around you look at Josh Rosen in Arizona not a lot of talent there yet\nBut the same thing the all kinds of wine gives them sit down and the ball he threw jak Christian Kurt to get things started last week\nI mean that that's what you're looking for you're looking to open things up and push the ball down feel something the giants can't do it and do it next year I mean Ohio they drafting mean you while they were drafted number one getting to the point where like I'm\nHearing you just take direct steps going forward and we're going to see what's gonna happen here\nBut this this is this is the part I don't even know how well the giants evaluated the quarterbacks in the offseason\nWhat did they I don't think about how much did they evaluate Arnold and Rosen an album these guys like ghetto maybe was ... at that because there are big thing was boy the browns could take and this was where the browns theory the one thing that would have scared them was the browns pick one in four\nThey could take Barclay one and then come back at a Cold War and get quarterback whether it's bigger Mayfield or Josh out or because they ... they were split on may feel the Josh I'm there like both these guys they could do that that was the one thing the giants were afraid of I guarantee you if they took Barclay it number one giants trade out a number two\nBecause they're not going to spend all kinds of money on a guy who's not they would attract oh Barclay was our guy were trading out we're still going to go all in on the line man\nOh you're right and part of it is it's going to be ... they bring him in and the idea was that he'd be able to fix what ails you with these parts and with the top and it dominant at times running back and take one Barclay to take take up the the workload and instead we've seen you either no masking\nWhat's going on with Eli Manning at this point no matter how many good skill position players you have and we can blame the bench of why we can blame a little bit of the ... the fact of the matter is you can't cover up\nFor the fact that you like doesn't push the ball down feel there's no threat at all in opposing defenses are starting to ... even the eagles tonight\nThey they weren't coming in and the position of strength and being the eagles defense that we've seen in the past but they can pin their ears back 'cause they know that you like eight can't move and be he can't go over

... walking off the field at half time he lie manning or ...\nOh boy ah what's behind door number for a\nI guess all the above I'm\n... and they're all tied together uh obviously to to one degree or another but this really hasn't been a functional fence they had a few plays they strung together a week ago against Carolina that provided some points one of them being a you know sort of a gimmicky\nGadget play roe do\nReally had their best down feel for the entire season and unfortunately he was throwing it not catching it\nThey're not a good football team they're not close to being a good football team and uh they they you know may have you know for themselves as to what they thought they were going to be this year but they didn't fall\nA lot of people around the league and and it starts with the quarterback that let's be real they they pay him big time money to be a big time player and he hasn't been\nFor a long time and we can point to being an address here in there and yadda yadda yadda but they they tried to prop him up as much as they could this off season with a running back on the left tackle and a fortified offensive line\nAnd a commitment to run into football and ... still not very good\nSo what do you go back genetic devaluation was it just you love snake launched so much we're building statues ... who was blind loyalty and we got to give you my one more rounded see if we can resurrect him ... humorous to a degree\nI I Know this is an ownership decision I'm a law they hired guys who they knew through the process we're willing to go along with with what\nOwnership felt like was the plan of of due process and that did it have to do with football to some degree sure that it has to do with business and sort of where they were as a as as an organization more than anything else yeah they they were not\nComing in this to tear it down and rebuild and do what probably um again to a lot of football people was painfully obvious\nThey wanted to keep it together put a band aid on it we're paying Eli a lot of money yeah we sat him for one week last year for Gino Smith but\nWe made a mistake and when the fans and the media reacted to how we treated Eli we ... we were treated and rallied around him and said our apologies and now you know we got to try to win something in the next couple of years with this guy\nAnd we want to put some ... and the seats and we want to contend and compete or at least give the appearance of such\nAnd not start over with the young quarterback and um people who went through that process uh they felt like that was the only really way that that ownership was going and if you didn't want to go that way than this probably wasn't the job for you\nThe other thing the giants are going to have to deal with following this game is over do back in junior and the big thing is before half time he walks off early while the giants all fence is still on the field this on the heels of him being fined by the team for his comments an interview a few days ago how do you think the giants deal with this latest chapter in ...\nI mean I don't know like\nThey can't get them to catch his marine passes I mean we can talk about it he left\nThe field early two weeks ago they said you know if they told the sideline reporter um he went to get in ivy who\nWho knows um they they don't have a functional off fence and it's not because of voter back I mean we you know we we he's not the only guy on that team was attacked and in that I'm an object\nOn the sideline [laughter] you know like what\nAre we going to start keeping tabs that like they just watch the game just I mean he's not under intense duress every single throw I mean there are baseline sort of\nSlants and screens and and you know little we'll routes that you're expected to be able to complete most of the time dress or not that's that stuff's just it's a it's an adventure as to whether he's going to hit the guy in stride go look at some of the screen tonight\nAnd what it took ... Bek um just to catch the ball like [laughter]\nI I mean ... whatever like [noise]\nThe guys on that team no where the problems lie in an office and between the lines on Sundays\nPeople are worried about oh del they're worried about ...\n... radio Jason Smith show with Mike Armageddon even the guy goes studios I'm a hotline when CBS Sports NFL insider\nExcuse me Jason lock it bore Adrienne or somebody just lock in for a as we wind down ... we just Thursday Night Football game start looking ahead to the weekend we've got a taste the over under sitting at sixty\nFrom Kansas City in New England Nobel jak already in postseason mode of saying it feels like we're playing Kansas City\n[laughter] yeah I mean look this may not be the last time we see these two teams face to face each other it kind of reminds me of Jacksonville Kansas City the week for the team that wins this one in this circumstance may not be the team that\nWins the same game come January if they do meet again\nAnd going up to ... in a week where you know they they still don't have air berry and now they're down in office of linemen and they're not going to have just in Houston and let's face it the last two weeks it's it's it's still been great for the chiefs but\nIt hasn't been easy street it it's it's been tougher to move the ball teams have taken some things away they've adjusted to that office um I think this this kind of to me lines up where this winning streak goes to die\nDoesn't mean that if they host you know the the patriots in January ... arrowhead that it's the same outcome but\nI don't love this situation for the chief as things are shaping up right now with the injuries and and you know do they do do do both teams are over thirty I mean that that's possible\nUm but I think if if Tom Brady is April ... able to score early in the chiefs have to play from behind a little bit um you know I I don't know I I don't know that that you know they're going to put up thirty five\nEvery single week and I don't love New England defense but this is a big game ballot check stress you them it's a big game and it it tends to bring up the best and the way when\nYou can follow him on Twitter at ... for that had a lock and for CBS NFL insider extraordinary all those be more than you needed podcast as well the website is the most show\nAs always buddy region and my friend well thanks for having me guys who is good stuff from Jay Salaqin foreign\nAnd look this is when we get into the conversation which we're going to do coming up next about ... sake one Barclay because this is this is all about the difference between the philosophy of what you need to succeed as a team and what not to\nI'm not anti sequence Barkley I was anti drafting him at number two because the need the giants have more so much greater food in the ... coming up next it's not about sequence markets about Barclay and eat\nLet's just say you think sake one Barkley is great you can have him he can give you two hundred yards a total often send the game if you don't have a quarterback you're going to score Thirteen points like they did tonight they never move the ball they were never a threat\nAnd the eagles just rolled right over them yes they have all sorts of line problems that's an issue the giants are a bad football team do you think they're going to be great because you have the star power of you lies name sake one Barclays Damon OPEC um juniors name but that doesn't make you a great just makes you have three guys that everybody has heard up you have to have better\n... competition on the offensive line to get the best players out your defense asked me veteran not give up at times\nBut the number one thing is if you don't have a quarterback you don't have anything when you're drafting number two overall you had your pick of four or five quarterbacks at the top of the draft you only got you were gonna get whatsoever the browns picked it number one but you had your chance of Darnell\nAt Rosen Josh Allen whoever else you want it these are all very highly sought after quarterbacks and this is when you go get your quarterback this wasn't a hard decision for the giants he like many when you're in your late thirties and you stink for two years 'cause that's what he has been\nYou have to go get that next guy despite the fact\nThat you live in New York and when you draft that quarterback that people are gonna want to know what is he going to start how long have you like in a play and I know it sounds mentally draining to go we got to go through a whole last season of what is our next quarter back and waiting going to be the star for the giants and the whatever forever reason they didn't want to go through that\nBut that's when you take the quarterback it's not rocket science it's easy all the teams that need a quarterback ultra quarterbacks teams took quarterbacks after they sign guys to be their quarterback the off season we saw in ...
