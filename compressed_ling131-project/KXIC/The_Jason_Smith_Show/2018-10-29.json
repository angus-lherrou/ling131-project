I'm not quite not quite sure why he has\nThem drink I don't get this either I mean again sales nasty don't get me\nWrong Clemens the warm up or is he not only that on the roster\nHe should get is three outs rather easily you would think but what if he starts to struggle a little bit you know what I was out a lot of ... about yes then you get kimbrell up and then you've got Mary Hart dancing\nAround behind suddenly you get a little\nBit hotter again outside of Red Sox fans but it's been it's been an interesting link managed series and I I don't know I Am very frustrated about hills coming out last night and then you bring in another left hander though when\nI was quite an egregious error and then you hear the drama about what led to it and what didn't lead to it and whether or not there was a miscommunication about how tired he was at the Robert saying well I didn't hear from them what I wanted to hear from him so I mean it was just a it was a a\nCarnival of errors from the Dodgers in the way that they handle things\nUh last night in game five or party party game for the series no weight gain three of this like\nWhat am I here I don't even though we're just talking about it anymore yellow at Eighteen any game came this up for those coming in the ... the bottom of the night\nIs that on your got tonight is to bring up old players from the theory was\nTrying to make you feel better I mean what do you want me to do say how much that your team blue is a two years of their own way back\nYou said your Dodgers so you have to live in this as well to us to own it or\nNot jurors when they fire and they might say per se stadium\nDidn't quit giving us the damn kiss up to quit picking our teams you do it on purpose because you want to see us miserable I've come to death and by the way I saw it somewhat I saw someone give you credit for picking Arizona over Oregon your real life he picks Arizona every single [laughter]\nArizona could be playing Alabama with what would be a forty two point spread it already would say I don't want it to a point I don't see that point has on his\nGot him I was right about your just have not while I Can't but she would have gotten in the air\nEnough times eventually you're going to hit a duck is Scott I'm way I look at it and you hit a damn dog yeah on Saturday Night holy smokes by the way just decide college football no while we watch the Dodgers disappear into the pit of misery\nUm what is going on in the past twelve right now two weeks ago yeah Oregon game day Washington state people talking about them is maybe the team for the pact well that could end up representing the and the four team playoff\nAnd now in back about games not only have they gotten beat or any Arizona your voice destroyed them last night destroyed all\nI have no idea what happened in that game was I was on the air and I thought maybe I was seeing something wrong because you know in the world series on I'm like this this ... subject going on the spot Arizona thirty does the ... to make this right eye as sick as I Am I was looking up how Arizona can actually win the division\nAnd and see if they could still do that that's how crazy I Am\nWell no you're not crazy because it's very much alive because of the pack twelve is not necessarily living up to the hype\nIn their division right now but we'll talk about that a little bit later on when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios one of two things will happen either we'll be talking about the start of a dramatic comeback for the Los

C. S. man he was nails\n... some of that criticism was brought on by himself\nA when he criticized the fans for no reason or out of the blue at the beginning of the year um so I was a little shocked about that last year the rift he got in with Dennis Eckersley um so that's always been easy of course the fans of always given back to David Price because of the amount of money you make it on his contract so\nIt's been a little give and take on both sides on that park wrist\nAlright let's set up the phone shall we ate yeah I've been seven Ninety nine on Fox let's start by talking about the Dodgers side of it David is in Maryland wanted to break down many Machado what's going on David\nI got a good day rate\nFirst of all you know I'm just not really for like the world series from eight but first of all I'll tell you I'm not really a fan of the Dodgers are the red Sox especially the red Sox 'cause\nThey play in the same teams you know in Maryland but I Will say one thing I'm going to shock you know and I like college but I'm caught a surprise Steve Pearce actually play many Machado nothing gets the parents you know he had a wonderful series\nBut I Am kind of surprised many Machado he played actually worse than somebody oil ballplayers got now and that's kind of shocking because [noise]\nAnd many Machado is with the oil is you know he was one of our white spots and like we didn't have to make bright spots when you know this year before I met him a child was trying to you know he was actually something I look forward to going to war and I'll tell you I mean he looked like a complete bump tonight and wow does he is I mean it's amazing that Steve Pearce would actually be many Machado\nI'm like I said well I don't know I appreciate the call I don't know why he's comparing peers\n... over for bad it only one eighty to a lot of criticism coming on his part about the lack of hustle a spike somebody else again um he said that it was by accident\nBut it wasn't only Machado there was a lot of guys on this team about just war that even as the red Sox ... years was phenomenal I thought that was fantastic picked up by the red Sox when he got them\nWell and to be honest with you I I Know it's painful right now I Would say to be honest with you like I'm going to lie to yeah I Know the guy was sorry my bet it's a crutch oh I'll get over it at some point I'm only when I read a but already the Dodgers aren't here if they don't go get Manny Machado ... I mean they're they're not in the world series they might not even end up\nWinning their division Manny Machado picking him up this law since this often she wasn't going to be where it ended up being even though it struggled in the world series or an enduring even the you know ... they're not here without it now\nDavid Price or even though he only start in one game Chris Sale or the Steve Pearce is of the world or the shady Martinez is\nOf the world you know JD Martinez yeah this this game this game five is going to be so in a raging to me because the Dodgers had so many just little small opportunities to get some momentum going and it couldn't happen\nOr what was it the fifth inning when Martinez misjudged the fly ball\n... comes out on the first pitch instead of driving in the run from third I runs up the shortstop you've got to run home on that anyway because it wasn't like the shortstop was playing in um it was probably half way it's I think you've got to make them throw you out at home at that point\nWell it it was right after Joe buckets that if you want anyone out there with less rights you out around her third out driving mom you weren't just in turn and lo and behold the grounds that the shortstop so they had that opportunity to have some opportunities to try to get momentum going and\nDon't I don't know it just it seemed like as someone watching at home and as a fan in the stands they were trying to win the game with one swing of about this whole series now worked it worked in game three it took a while but it worked\nUm but in the party gave when ... when was the Eighteen any who now everything's starting to run together thank you it worked whenever max Muncie hit one out of the yard and we met Kim hit a home or to get things started but\nMy word aren't ... they just never were able to put together that big inning to threaten the red Sox pitcher consistently just never happened in Boston was very comfortable\nNo they did of course you want to you know yet but Red Sox overcame not one kind of easily when they had a three run Homer to get back in ... and make it for the three at that point\nWhen they when they when they had to force spot last night you I really honestly thought to myself we've got ourselves a series this has got to ask you where are you going to we're going to win tonight and I'll be talking about the Dodgers going back to Boston I really thought\nBut then again they they pull off a guy in more than off the bench that ends up going yard and when he had no business going you argue serve on on a platter\nTo Steve Pearce I mean it's just it's frustrating part if you're a Dodger fan\nBecause you feel like there were opportunities in the series now again you have to stand back take inventory and realize that from start to finish the red Sox were the best team but\nArnie you can't help but limit missed opportunities if you're the Dodgers to make this a more competitive series not saying you would have one right on\nTrying to disrespect the victory but those chances were there for the Los Angeles they were just unable to take advantage\nOf how do you think ratings are ah across the board for this World Series overall I think we're going to see pretty good stuff on this one\nYou know the ... and you know I'm a I'm a door for this kind of stuff I Love talking about ratings but they weren't good early on um as a matter of fact some of the some of the early numbers were low and react to the Eighteen any game three crazy stumble to an absolute new\nLow no ... did I must have misheard because I thought they said that they got better ratings from like one to three in the morning eastern\nWelcomes what what are you normally if anyone even normally watching TV and one to three already\nBut the my point was that they have better ratings than than they normally would have gotten in prime time earlier at four o'clock or so it made it sound like the ratings were good I guess that's my point is what I was rather say Chris\n[noise] ah well I'm sure if you looked at it from that perspective but\nA according to who was this a deadline dot com righty the the result was down over four percent in early numbers from last year it's not to ban same here so it's again it's not some massive\nDrop that you've had so far in the ratings and it'll be real curious to see what last night's games numbers were liking what tonight's games or like I mean\nYou do go up against the NFL and it wasn't necessarily ... no offense to New Orleans from Minnesota but it's not like you're going up against the cowboys and\nThe giants you're not allowed to go out to the eagles\nMust see TV with any of the law you know like programming on Sunday and we haven't had that in a while because people watch it their own leisure\nYup absolutely and you just you you you watch TV differently now but I'll you know when we come back to the gecko Fox Sports radio studios only will get an update on the ratings will check in from Chavez Ravine with Steve the savior and we'll hit these tweets that are rolling in ...\nAnd I just want as T.

New York against them wow that wasn't too long ago when the Mets were in the world series wow fame or the cubs did it in Cleveland and now the last two teams have pulled it off in Los Angeles the Astros last year the red Sox tonight\nDo you know Arnie ... yeah the last team to clinch at home then was\nNo not off the top of my head who would that be the Boston Red Sox intolerance or seeing gas that yeah so just so at that ... not going\nTo have straight World Series championships clenched on the roads and then one other quick note before we grab a break and I I keep trying to get to football I keep trying to stimulate\nShould I go to the parades and I take like Thursday off but I was probably when the parade is going to be so I go down there for that of course you should why wouldn't you say there were like a tiger ... should see how that works out or\nI Would probably go against that [laughter]\nWhere are you know they might ... something that they might ... kids or you might just want to where kids were Jersey ah the red Sox spent just to twelve days out of the first place all season they were the best team in baseball wire to wire absolutely dominant and they finish the year\nIf you add in the numbers from the post season to the regular season numbers\nOne night teen yeah and fifty seven that's a bad one Nineteen fifty seven that's ridiculous ...\nHow many
