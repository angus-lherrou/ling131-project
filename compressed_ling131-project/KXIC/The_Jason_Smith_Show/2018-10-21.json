your Amazon smart speaker Jesse Alexa play eight hundred tax icy and I heard radio\n[noise] Fox Sports trending\nGame seven of the national league championship series is on a fast one right now two outs bottom of the apes Dodgers leading at top seeded Milwaukee five to one\nTrying to find that he went on Twitter ... and he basically said I'm trying to find the exact quote here\nUh where he's okay so he basically said this just in Michigan state's pre game walk was six yards longer than what they had in the actual game go blue so while he got them now yeah that's pretty good right\nYeah I like that but um yeah I mean right or if or if we can find the cut of Harbaugh are actually ripping dead totally wait to hear this because he takes a big shot out of you could tell there's a lot of animosity between those two you know\nAbsolutely and and it's funny because this has been\nI'm kind of really one sided rivalry I mean I Know you and I you know we love college football and for years Michigan just absolutely dominated Michigan State and really since uh since day in Tony got things rolling then Tony I get the Antonia Tony ...\nUm since the Antonio got things rolling down there it's been really one sided in but it's ... it's one where it seems like there's genuine bad blood some of these robberies there's respect but I think Michigan State still feels like they're the second kind of program in that state trying to earn that respect\nThe Antonio allows his players to to what I thought it was kind of a silly thing to do that during the warm ups in our book comes right back at them and it seems like there is some bad blood or going to the rest of the season\nAs for the game I thought Michigan was nominated at least in the first half\nAn inch should have been up more than seven nothing miss feel goals a missed opportunity is next thing you don't Michigan State tied up in seven they have all the momentum\nAnd I think it is Michigan going to let this what slip through their fingers going to be tough on the road\nOr none of course they get the long touchdown a big break their goal fourteen seven what a Twenty one seven monster victory in this one horrible game from Michigan State will work in the way he had like five conclusions\nThey could move the ball great defense of effort by Michigan I'm just a mobster victory every which\nAround there and yeah I don't want to look too far ahead but let me ask you Arnie I I Know the games in Columbus but if these two are on a collision course I think Michigan is a better team right now and we all everybody gave up on Michigan early in the year after that Notre Dame game but I kinda just reference\nDid the right act that another name looks a lot better I don't know where you stand but I think Michigan is a significantly better team right\nNow I think they're better much better obviously the defense of here I may have there's much better defensively but I think Ohio state's the better off fence of team and\nUm you know after ... wins that game like that well they usually say defense but when you have enough it's like Ohio State and I noticed in show against Purdue I'm not so sure that that Michigan the overwhelming favorite and that when like you're making them out to be era\nYeah I don't know about overwhelming but you know the Ohio State thing you know they're gonna have to get things cleaned up their their only ranked fifty second nationally\nIn rushing um and that is going to be a lot lot lot worse after today\nThey ... they got to figure out a way to be more than one dimensional I mean look we're watching the game right now aren't there getting him ... pretty much just had a safety there uh uh you know I mean they're getting the\nOhio State with all those five star guys that they recruited are getting dominated at the line of scrimmage it happened last week as Minnesota it's happening again today\nI'll say this I Know they got smoked by Iowa last year this is about as embarrassing as it comes for Ohio State\nNow I Know people are screaming at me right now but what about after the game if you're going to go ahead and ripped Michigan State for their shenanigans before the game what about after the gate when Michigan celebrated it midfield jumping up and down I didn't hear horror by complaining about that now did he was all you know what's good for the goose is good for the gander air and you know what I mean\nWas it was it a little revenge for for ... maybe they will be wars when did you think of course maybe they would have been a little more respectful at Michigan State had been a little more respect for I'm just saying you know\nIs that the way to do it though if they've just respect us we'll come back to disrespect them and start stomping on I mean because that can cause the riot I could I could achieve Michigan State come running out and you know all of a sudden there's there's this the cubs going on you know\nListen I mean if if I'm doing my show prep here and you walk by and you just close line me I'm coming after\nYou after I'd do a good show that's all I'm saying All right if you want to get a hold of him Aaron underscore tour as um ads stinking genius one Alabama wins big uh why are they always win big why are they so much better than everybody else that's what I really want to know how do you beat this Alabama team\nAnd who did what the coach saving at half time we'll get to all that that's covered up back here on Fox Sports\nRadio what's the story of this story is we have opinions on the line who think they think Todd hey I didn't get the most dominant wrong in the history of sports\nThey have no fear definitely yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but you haven't taken that you were asking me to believe the unbelievable\nFor grey morning talk we are Fox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know\nWhy did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that award basketball's bouncy than the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles to get a game well here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if

make sure the scales are tipped in your favor\nI agree with you or any I mean whether it's Notre Dame Michigan ... I mean Clemens in whoever it would be and I said LSU and obviously you want to be LSU I guess in theory it could be LSU ... probably very very unlikely\nBut it's just really hard to find a team that that is going to to be able to challenge them and I think the biggest difference this year as we've discussed over the last eight weeks\nThey're getting great quarterback play and they've always been great on defense now they have the number one off at the college football they seem absolutely unbeatable um it it's just amazing to watch we can and week out I mean you know Tennessee coming up and went over ranked team on the road they beat they won at all burned and\nThey're down whatever it was twenty eight to nothing about eight minutes into the game was unbelievable watch\nAll right we'll finish up all the other top twenty five a lot of action going on a couple of games still going on also so we'll check the scores on that first though let's check in with the snake or see what's out there what's going on to say\nSomehow the Dodgers are going to the world series they take game seven on F. asked one time he was going on right now too late on the bandwagon already hit a championship series is over\nThe Dodgers when a top seed Milwaukee tonight five to one ... with the key three run Homer in the sixth inning he had three hits Clinton ... comes out of the pen\nFor the safe or not technically essay but getting the last three outs as he had done an ad in the bullpen the last to post seasons in deciding games he pitches effective\nWay to get us look at that\nI'm saying it has happened to me only three years in a row including game seven of the world series last year and the clincher against the national the year before where he got to save this is a Dodger team that in mid may had a record of sixteen and twenty five they were already eight and a half games back in the division\nThey fought back and finish tied for first Indiana west\nWon a tie breaker game with Walker buell or on the ... game one sixty three of the regular season that got 'em home field advantage for the first round and now here on the road a game seven when to go to the world series in Boston for game on Tuesday night\nOn Fox TV and guys the stat amazing as it is it's still true when the Dodgers have\nA lead a four at any point in any game they have always won this year the ticket in the world series Dodgers Red Sox Red Sox won a hundred and eight are you kidding yeah wow\nI mean they are because the one game the red Sox a hundred and eight that lineup is phenomenal and remember we're going to have both the ball was in the division to relax just oh I agree that some of the wind says not all of the winter when we\nThe three games potentially three at Dodger Stadium next weekend JD Martinez the da and the peak Canada is going to have to be in the lineup so they're already talking about him playing out field and runs the defensive great ... maybe into second base to get them both in the line up and that is at an\nEarlier in the year once Mickey used to be a second baseman in the minor leagues but he looks a little shaky out there a little bit\nOf Houston second baseman Jose all too they had knee surgery today the front runner for the reds manager's job is David Bell son a buddy bell according to Fox is John ... has for college football the night in college football is just about over and it includes the upset when a Purdue over a number to Ohio State\nForty nine to twenty wow also USC loses forty one twenty eight at Utah the Trojans are four and three and quarterback\nFreshman star JT Daniels left in the second half within a parent concussion\nUCLA up in the late game ten nothing over Arizona in the second quarter of play earlier wins for Alabama and Clemson for LSU Michigan and Oklahoma in the top ten and there is a night in the NBA as we have Lakers at home home opener losing all night while his forty seven forty six\nRockets lead mid second quarter in LA already earlier wins for Charlotte and Dallas\nBoy allowed to get to in one NFL note patriots tied in ... he did not make the trip to play the ... ankle and back injury so officially listed as doubtful right now\nAll right thanks a lot to say good we're coming to you live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance with Geico\nOr just go to guy could calm or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the hard part well let's figure out which way it's easier just for the F is for the ... off on the Dodgers Mike or tweets and\nYou guys are surprised that baseball manager over thinks up they have not baseball managers over think decisions more than anyone other than maybe an idiot coaches does a pass on first goal from the ... had a greater and hash tag Seahawks nation that's Mike out there um\nYou know I I look he felt comfortable bringing her son doesn't make a difference it got the job done they're going to the world series or nobody's going to talk about that but what a great world series we're going to have ratings through the roof exactly what will be needed Dodgers and Red Sox are great is that\nIt is how about the fact by the way as much as you and I've just spent the last probably what four or five ten minutes crushing Dave Roberts the guy that's basically responsible for the red Sox bracing breaking that eighty six year cursed Dave Roberts with that stolen base in two thousand four\nNow managing the opposing team I like that on bowl we look at you look at me at the stuff I've joked baseball I'm an AK ... or whoever\nChocolate or whoever outlets go through the rest of the top twenty five just a little quick notes on each game you make a little comment um let's get back to Ohio State they lose forty nights when the\nUh that is a fight or Haskins threw the ball Seventy three times I'm sure that wasn't the game plan for during seven yards two touchdowns they get clobbered Purdue twenty eight points in the fourth quarter they would've forty nine twenty\nThis will drop Ohio State I'm not going to stay out of the top ten but probably the number eight I'm debating if they're going to be out of Texas are not not a good look when you lose a forty nine twenty that's ... a lot of points that we always question that defense for Ohio State now we see is the true meaning of them right now\nYeah by the way last segment remember Arnie you mentioned why is Alabama so much better than everybody else I don't know what the answer is but if we agree that nicks that urban Meyer is universally the second best coach and college football how about this that that your boy air tourist just pulled up\nNick Saban hasn't lost to an ... ranked opponent since two thousand seven wow eighty straight games\nThis is now the second year in a row that Ohio State has lost by twenty five plus to an unwrapped opponent last year I Would just how many games how many games eighty straight Arnie or he still had hair on the top of your head less time saving lawsuit on right to own\nThat is unbelievable so you're saying it's all said and why their head and shoulders better than everybody else\nIt is and you know it's amazing to about saving I was thinking about because when you pitched you know we've talked about this on on other shows but I was thinking about this he loses assistant coaches every year to I mean he lost Kirby Smart a few years ago he lost lane kissing a few years ago he lost Jeremy ... with the guy that he faced with Tennessee today\nIt's the guy just keep losing assistant coaches he keeps those employers and he keeps on winning it's incredible I Know you're asking about Ohio State but I thought that was kind of a fit in kind of thing to bring a full circle\nI Want you to know something well everybody's watching the Dodgers go to the world series well everybody watched um Ohio State lose while everybody was watching a bronze season opener in Los Angeles\nFor some silly reason I'm like why can't I just leave well enough alone just enjoy again but no I have to put on the Arizona game at the same exact time where as old as running for a long touchdown and they fumble at the five yard line and they went to the end zone as are running on and\nJust just for a touchdown nobody around them they listen to the end zone but nobody can meet grief over that was nobody's watching that one you know what I'm saying yeah I live about\nFive minutes from the rose bowl I think I Need a clothes hangar to put on one of these TV is to get that game on on the TV here 'cause nobody has watched\nYeah the opposite way you'd be prepared to be ripped would you like me to start with that with David who tweets on an errand tour as arm in arm disrespectful thought that was a sign of unity stinking genius said that the Michigan player stopped on the logo sounds disrespectful to me\nArmored Arbor stopping the more post game stopping and ... comments not an eye for an eye at all ah well\nIt started with the arm in arm thing it wasn't they didn't do that as a retaliation for stopping on on the um none that happened after the game yeah\nI mean it started with Michigan State Michigan was out on the field in warm ups minding their own business preparing for the game maybe by the way Michigan State should have been doing their own warm ups because they didn't they didn't do much once the game actually started to take that David\nWow yeah yeah you know I don't bring there's a lot of bad blood but but you know what a horrible for him to get all upset\nAbout it and then after the game his team does that how come nobody brought that up to him I don't know if anybody the media said well what about your team stop it I I'm not at the yarn line\nYeah all I saw was that a he said it was Bush league or childish or whatever and marked Antonio basically said yeah well it wasn't it wasn't a big deal at all I just you know look I I'm all for good rivalry but when you get your butt kicked you just kinda got to take it you know and exactly that's all I'm saying\nAll right a couple of the games consumed with the forty one seven over NC State notice that were just ignoring quite having trouble Lawrence and not one twenty six of thirty nine over three hundred yards at a touchdown I'm Still not sure there was a third best team and now they're probably going to move up the number two unless somebody seems a jump up and I don't see that happening but\nI don't see them as the second best team in college football right now\nNo I mean this was their first went over ranked opponent all year now they did beat a ... uh they did beat\nLeBron move the needle in a different way so they're still is like the vibe unlike the excitement about it but ... errands right there ... there is different because obviously the Dodgers are going back to the world series the attention is going to be driven there so\nIt's a little bit there were it was like the dorm I had last week with the radio station or by local station or do I err Red Sox are a game what was the game for\n... yeah that's right yeah so in the air the Kansas City she was going to the New England patriots what was that there was like ... and it was a game one or two right yeah yeah I was getting too I think it was game to yeah oh you know and I ... and ... and that was literally they were like right across the street from each other right yeah yeah so that was because\nThe the baseball game got to start like an hour early and then the football game which is obviously the most important thing because it was she's patriots you got to be defeated team coming in there so seem dilemma yeah\nRight but I Do look obviously Dodgers game as dawn everybody's now tuned in to see what's going on with the Lakers are not a good first have for abroad\nSo we'll see what he does but it does and I feel like a playoff game ever and it really does guys I I you know I was like oh my goodness I got to make sure I have another point in the rockets LeBron's first game I mean I I was excited to use them not as excited for a regular season game Aaron\nYeah I was into the trailblazers game the other night to when when the brown opened up I mean look there there is definitely a it is created a you know I think just to a new storyline I think it's good I mean that's the thing about the NBA right is that\nWe all know or I think we all know who's going to win this league again it's the warriors I think there are painfully boring\nBut at least ... at least there's some buzz in at least there's some excitement and I will say this I Do think the Lakers it'd be really really interesting this year with those young guys with ... with some of those vets that you know what what is a nice way said there are a little quirky I guess it would be and I say I like ah\nI think you know at least be entertaining here over the next couple of months\nI let's just finished a couple of games in the top twenty five Oklahoma which was up I think twenty eight seven I'm\nTwenty eight twenty four and you're wondering if maybe Oklahoma was this one slip through the fingers that you wouldn't even that for going into the fourth but did they pull away fifty two twenty seven ...\nI'm a okay gave it to four touches but only a little bit over two hundred yards passing was Nineteen twenty nine I'm but I guess good victory by Oklahoma they'll just move up maybe a notch or two a week maybe a notch or two or because of the Ohio State Los\nYeah what a weird game on I don't know how close you watch this one I Know probably to poke your buddy cursed plank or you're probably watching closely but uh now what what what I think they're going to lose I'll watch it all at least I Know what I think they're going to win and move on to something else was going to say it was a weird way because Oklahoma jumped out to this massive\nLead TCU makes a quarterback change cuts the lead to twenty eight twenty four and half time as you mentioned and all of a sudden it's a game and then she sees quarterback gets hurt and Oklahoma\nPulls away and it doesn't even look like it was close but it was closed and interesting there for a while before Columbus all the way\nI can give a little love to your mythical are defending champion yeah a central Florida because you're you know we've got to give them a little well got to give them or do we have to give them a little up I don't know well there's certainly better than Arizona I can tell you why are they better than that what ...

I was watching some of his also a Colorado and Washington\nJust drawing back and forth especially the uh uh the the Colorado quarterback has ... ... every time something why she did with the defensive backs by knock your way of past\nThey would jar with him and he would come back and jumped back I'm like you're the quarterback dude [laughter] don't pay attention to them but\nA very chip you couldn't win for Washington though in this one well\nAnd it's one thing to to to ... and run your mouth it's another thing if you're a quarterback and it's another thing if you're getting your butt kicked like ah like like Colorado did only two hundred and sixty three yards a total offense hundred and forty four yards passing for Stephen ... I mean this is one that when he tries tries out for the NFL next year is going to be on his\nReal so ah you know I have no problem with with talking a little smack but you got to do it when you're when and you've got to do it when your head and yeah it's just it's a bad looking and frankly it was a a bad day overall for packed twelve who now is\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nUses for terrifying interaction one location to sign\nTo law ... yeah and it's hard to quantify who has the edge there\nYou know I mean as far as the travel go professional athletes um is these guys are used the traveling granted you're changing times on you're going to another continent\nIt's a little different than going from the east or west coast but with that said it very difficult to quantify\nAs far as this is how many points it's worth and which team really does have an advantage over the other um with that said we've seen this line go up and down what I mean by that is it opened around six six and a half got Bette up to seven at seven you saw Tennessee money coming from some sharp\nAt six and a half you saw charge money from some sharp um so it seems like that's the right number um that that the books have up there the public's going to be on that the chargers so far they're already getting a lot of chargers one sided\nUm money that's the obviously rarely rarely early game and it's going to be tied into a lot of later games meaning there'll be a lot of teenagers on the chargers and money line parlay is with later games to weigh the chargers just have to win this game pretty much straight up\nSo that's what they've been getting mostly on that one uh books are going to be open Tennessee could keep it much closer than they did last week against Baltimore\nBiggest further before I let you go real quick a extra money coming in on the Lakers ... bronze double the money triple the money nothing really more you told me\nI mean listen here's what's gonna happen like we see all the time that the market overreact\nUm and and you don't make money betting those teams that that everybody jumping on especially early on in the season when you're paying a premium and that's exactly what you're seeing with the LA Lakers win or lose it whether your cashier ticket or not right now you are not getting the best of it that in that team\nThere's definitely a ... attack because they're getting volume and money from the public every night\nI Know I was gonna say real quick I notice you started is there money coming in on anyone other than the warriors or is there a hot topic right now with the other teams\nAll the way I look for in a way I I\nWould say so somebody bet sixty seven thousand dollars on the warriors just to make the playoffs the win six children\nSo that that's what you're getting exactly what you're getting and actually it's been a negative it really has\nBecause people aren't even wasting our money where what the NFL even last year when we had it was kind of historic that the patriots won and it said in such a favorite they when they when the season kicked off they were down to around two or three to one\nFavorite to win the super bowl that's unheard of\nPrior to this season and even with them being that top heavy um there was still a ton of future money because people thought their ... but with Golden State that's where the problem lies\nThat the rest of the the teams aren't getting money that most think you're not feeding them you know maybe ... ... that second team or a third team at the most maybe getting a little money but that ... and I think that's been a negative more than a positive as far as MBA futures market the last few years with Golden State\nYou can get all the biggest one of the big moves dot com that's the big moves dot com you can tweet them\nA Greek underscore gambler that's Greek underscore gambler great job my bread enjoy the games tomorrow we'll speak to you next week\nThanks for at me guys enjoy the games they are becoming a new\nCard member and discover card will much all the cash back that you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learned more at discovered dot com slash match that's discovered dot com slash match limitations do apply the Sago\nWhat's printed out there are tons of games do going on in the battle\nAnd do we have an F.
