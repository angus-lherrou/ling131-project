tonight as we said look like the Dodgers were off to a great start they add ... on the ropes and the first and second innings they threatened they get the one run on David freezes home run\nBut young general you pitch game six tonight was abysmal he gets batted around in the first inning gives up for runs\nAnd from there on the Dodgers were playing catch up they were never able to overcome he comes back out in the second inning gives up or run finally after three innings Dave Roberts goes to the bullpen and brings in ... and were used night is over I Would bet\nA lot of money that we'll find out some time in the next few hours that review\nWas tipping his pitches tonight and the brewers knew what was coming I mean not in a\nNot an a stolen signs kind of way because we had the story earlier today the brewers think the Dodgers were stealing signs everybody's dealings lines where everybody used on my side used all by just about not that but in a way where he is tipping has pictures like last year in game\nSeven in game two of the world series we found out you ... pitches the Astros knew what was coming because of the way he would move to grip the ball before his\nPitcher all the talk of Severino going well September and into the play offs was well\nIt always baffles me the teams can't figure this out like why are the why is that team the last one to know like out of out of a not oh boy why is this guy getting hit so hard you know they watch a video and they look back how is nobody figured out oh yeah I think he's sipping his pitches right here it's always a curiosity\nRight why isn't the pitching coach noticing something maybe the bullpen catcher watching what whatever the case may be that there's there's not somebody\nIn the dug out in the organization that that doesn't pick up on that\nBefore the damage has been done right were here first ball swinging multiple times and just battered around as we've talked about over the course of the night they weren't she pitch again one blue otherwise it was a lot of hanging balls in the zone that they've just tee off on\nAny time a pitcher who does it normally get hit gets hit like this early on that's where I think pitch tipping right the first any free went like this can get Saddam infield single I mean not not sharply it but he gets on on a single yellow grounds out the third Turner makes a pretty good player that would've been a base it\nBraun walks after Shaw strikes out argue are hits the double now that wasn't\nA well struck ball but it was a well placed ball then three consecutive pitches after that\nFirst pitch to Mike moose stock is double the right field it's three to one\nNext pitch crotch singles to right field Mustafa scores next pitch arts singles to left field\nBang bang bang all hard hit balls all off of review this is the guy who gave up three runs in the first inning all season long he gives up for the night he was taping his pitches somehow somehow the brewers figured it out and they went to town on him and the first couple of innings Spygate\nIt's just going to get dismissed by major league baseball anyway it doesn't have to be illegal I mean when you find out a pitcher is tipping pitches that doesn't\nNeed to hold on to say and then they they they got the guy from Houston since he's been eliminated oh on waivers the quota set and a brewers code on him now I think you're I think it's actually the later\nFront who is now reinvented himself with a new identity how about you that the guy from Houston is gone into witness protection and now he says he's like Henry Hill now he's the witness relocation and here he is now he's reinvented himself as a a guy to take video with cameras\nWalk it out in his bathrobe to get his newspaper in the morning I got it right but that's really where I'm at with\nWith that because it does the rest of it doesn't make sense ... too good to see them yes he was away from Dodger Stadium tonight\nWhich is not where he pitches will will with three five eight yeah regular season away from home you know not exactly a a a butcher when it's all said and done\nThis was something where I I I Would almost be positive that's what we're going to hear\nAnd now if you're the Dodgers worried about ... games that were you to bring anything out do they know they're going to go to town off you 'cause this is first inning first pitch in and they know what's coming they know what he's going to throw they were really really comfortable especially in a game in which they were on their heels going to the bottom of the first inning\nYou don't know park is crazy everybody's going nuts freeze leads off the whole running than everybody sitting on their hands and that's\nOkay what's gonna happen to rise and now they come back in the bottom of the first thing that's bang bang bang bang bang and suddenly it's four to one and the game is basically over at that point\nBut my only in is twenty batters face\nOnly at a first pitch strike eight times so hitting advantage as well and just didn't make him pay\nTail of the tape though right we are we look at the Dodgers last couple of games get 'em on get them like doing their best to play small ball especially uh in game five where you're extending innings and trying to get the just put the ball employment ... with a base hit the opposite way\nOr in the in the what was that the second inning right so we we look at that age he was the only one doing any situational eating everybody else was swinging from the heels again and we got the same results a whole lot enough\nLet's say you listen to some of the day Roberts who is meeting the media now talking about the Dodgers failure in game six looking at the game seven tomorrow night against the brewers guess other than review or any of the pictures that we thought stage ... tomorrow [noise]\nUm [noise] outside of of a review every move you agree\nWith that we're we're a good spot [noise]\nQuestions I don't [noise] our guy\nThere is that said even taking in game seven into account ... how much do you have kind of having to do that though that\nKnow this is still obviously\nAnd I don't see a game six are you guys weren't totally out of it right within striking distance and how how this\nBoth as the no ... it's tough um but when you're when you're down three runs after the first inning and your movies [noise]\nFor me would have been right this is\nMuch food or my horse them to bring him at all [noise]\nMean they're they're best reliever obviously\nYou know you'd like to to to getting close to\nThem using [noise] so [noise]\nThey got away my because of the Iran differential they have to use them so\nThis is important for ever seen them and why in your opinion [noise] um\n[noise] he's using his um curb Baltimore um\nKick the ball down well I'm\nObviously has a slight are really tough on writing earners [noise] um and he's got to see where that that runs so um we've seen him a lot um we know how he's going to attack us and now it's about chickens are taking advantage of a potential stakes\nStick to more starting with doing what are you expecting from the kid tomorrow I I think Walker's I'm prepared for this moment um\nAs far as his is rest or he's ready to go and as far as his heartbeat the weapons all that stuff [noise] we're in really good shape but yeah man I'm you understand the magnitude of this moment this game and\nHe's a good person for us to take the baseball hall flash up a\nCredit counselor said before the game tonight that their offices have been struggling as that may be the fan energy could get I'm going to see like the first inning ... exactly what happened was that sort of from your side of the worst case scenario", "year":
