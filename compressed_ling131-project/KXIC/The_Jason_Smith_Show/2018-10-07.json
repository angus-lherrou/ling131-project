I started\nYet why he is he of course lives there is the Oklahoma sideline reporter I ah I've been to a couple of them having in Dallas and um I got to tell you it's an absolute blast I mean you're going to the Texas state fair you got the game going on\nI've never been to a game or it's split right down the middle I mean it is absolutely intense and you know it's one of those old cliches you throw away the record um it's it's one of those great traditions you know I hate to\nGo ahead and and be one of those guys I'm Wondering how much better this tradition would be or this driver would be\nIf we had a home and home series instead of playing it right down the middle and I know it's about the same mileage\nFrom Austin a I Believe that that was as it is for ... hours but how great would it be if we at home field advantage in a game like this\nI kinda disagree oh come on I mean I think it's one of the cool things look there are ... there are a lot of great home and home rivalries and college football the ones I mentioned Auburn, Alabama Ohio State Michigan\nI think it's pretty cool it and listen you're the the expert that's been all these games are I mean you know I'm told that the scene outside with the state fair going on is an unbelievable dating yeah yeah so why don't we just keep it the way it is because that that that's what\nThat's what college football's about though that whole field hell no you know what college football's about what tradition and this is an unbelievable tradition or you know and you know maybe it's kind of like 'cause I've I've also been to the uh Florida Georgia game\nAnd I I prefer that would also be a home field advantage to be honest with ya I don't I'm not too crazy about these new neutral site games I don't know what were the Texas and the Oklahoma fans feel about that and you could send us a tweet Aaron underscore tour as um ads thinking genius one\nBut I think the fans of those teams would love to have it on their on their home campus I think they were just enjoy that\nI mean I think it depends I mean it's just one game it's another game or maybe a people in the town in the city maybe can't afford to go because we know some of these uh these good seats in these big stadiums he's on campus stadiums are owned by the big donors\nA plus you know there's plenty of people in Dallas that aren't that close to Austin that are that close to the norm and it's a chance to go go there to chance to make a weekend out of it go to the state fair I'm I have no problem with it and I think\nIt sets up for you know an interesting scenario as far as just what a winning last means going forward as far as if that games at Oklahoma is there may be a different\nResult today and then if there is now all of sudden Oklahoma there in a position where they maybe have probably have to win out to be in the mix for the playoff conversation I'm sure we'll get into kind of where Oklahoma is later on the show\nI like it the way it is I mean why can't why can't we just keep some things the way you know we just we do this in sports so much we change so much every we try to improve the stuff that's already awesome I don't get why we always got to do it this is one this is fun I wouldn't say it would work for every rivalry but this is one where I think it does\nRight when we get back we'll take a look at the rest of the top twenty five ... not happy with his defense so all of that coming up there and tourism already Spanier says Fox Sports radio\n[noise] one will be the thing goes off\nWe'll have a

members of Aerosmith bailed thirty bands out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum suffering for them\nUh basically I I I actually agree with you as I I think that this is Nick Nick Saban his team is so much better than everybody else I mean here's the thing about Alabama they have always been so phenomenal on the defensive side of the ball not today obviously but in general\nNow they have the number one scoring offense in college but right now and I ask\nYou quarterback that they know no disrespect to jail it hurts but a quarterback that's part of astronomical numbers\nOh absolutely I mean to a today ten of\nThird team over three hundred yards and for touchdowns three under thirty he average thirty three yards per completion jeeze forty\nPercent of his passes one for touchdowns today so the point is is that I Do think next David is looking for ways to motivate his team I think I don't know if it'll be until that as you see a championship game but I think he feels like look at some point we're going to be challenged maybe it's LSU\nI guess in theory maybe it could be all burnt although Auburn did not look good tonight they lost again\nAnd so whatever whoever that opponent is Nick Saban needs his team ready and I don't think he wants it to try to click in a place a week or two before that game or the ... the week of the Georgia game I think he wants his guys focused right now and needs them focused\nBecause eventually they're going to run into somebody that can at least give them competition and he doesn't want them coming in on focus I think that's why it makes comments like he did\nToday we will continue with the top twenty five first though we'll check and see what's happening with a buddy

easy to say fifty percent or more car insurance with Geico or go to guy go dot com or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well that's figure out which way is easier you know you just said that if there's a faster way to get the eight teams\nThat's the way to do with um you know when you're getting two teams from one conference\nBut doesn't seem to such a disparity in you know are such a gap between number one and then two three and four\nDo we really want eight teams when we think five through eight really is not even close to the same Parr matter of fact teams five six seven eight would all be double digit under dogs to Alabama\nWell I'll tell you this Arnie first of all I'm One of those guys and I don't know where you stand on it I don't really have a problem with the four team playoff like I think it's good the way that it is and and\nI understand we always want more we always feel like we need more but I think it's the the reason that I'm okay with poor instead of eight is because of what you said everybody says well if you're a conference champion you deserve to be in\nWell there are teams that play for these conference championships because the conference and the divisions are imbalance search teams playing for conference championships with three four five losses I mean us see a few years ago played for the pact twelve title was for losses is that a team that deserves to automatically get in\nUm so to me I've never had a problem with sticking with\nFor well what do you have no problem in college basketball though when teams or some five hundred or five hundred that get into the into the boy tournament what the conference champions ... yeah the conference jeopardy from these small conferences that tradition\nWell this is the everyday everything stripped isn't to you this is tradition what do you like first of all but yeah of course\nIf if the NCAA tournament if they wanted to expand to a hundred teams and lead in you know the ninth place team from the pack twelve although they actually did that last year and right right but if they want to lead in tents placed team from the pack twelve and the thirteenth play Steve from the ACC I'd be don't I'd say don't be ridiculous\nAnd so to me I just don't like this idea I don't have so much of a problem with expanding eight I have a bigger problem with automatic conference champions in the case of football I see that's all say every situation different that's\nI I I have no problem going with the top five ... go with the five majors and then maybe like three of large and and work at that way but I'm I'm certainly one that was like to expand from Fort a just a couple of the scores you mentioned Georgia you know this was not as easy as it looks like on the school board forty one Thirteen if you didn't see the game\nAnd easily miss because there was so many other great games today or this was seven to three at the end of the first than a Twenty one of the six I Know sounds like it's well in hand but that's the scored after I've been to them about a couple of drives where they could have put touches on the board\nUm obviously they're they're often photos it gives a great Georgia's defense but I just wanted to say was that much of a route like like people were expecting\nWell say this for Georgia they got a big game next week against LSU on the road that's the one I think that well first of all the look at the back in uh Georgia schedule depending on how you feel about a couple of these teams yeah they play at LSU then they get it by\nThen they play Florida in Jacksonville where America wants to keep that game or a Spaniard don't dare don't you dare try to make it home and home\nAnd then they play Kentucky I mean those are three teams that are All right now ranked in the top twenty five Florida is obviously going to jump up after that LSU win\nBut I can forgive Georgia if maybe there are looking ahead a little bit to LSU because that was you came into the day undefeated ranked in the top five they obviously did lose but I Wonder if George was maybe just looking ahead a little bit\nAlso Ohio State and let me tell you I thoroughly enjoyed this game in the ad a head cough that they had taken the lead they were done early they'd come back they had taken the lead they caught the ball up right before half time they gave it back to back touchdowns Ohio State\nThe score was twenty eight twenty they did their best to hang around after that I'm Still had a chance going into the fourth quarter Ohio State just too much for the they run away with the two touchdowns in the fourth\nForty nine twenty six Haskins was just I thought fantastic\nA foreigner and fifty five yard six touchdowns a thirty three of forty four I'm just did everything without those type of numbers this is a whole different game that one turnover I felt was so big but Indiana hung around Ohio State do flex their muscles I'm not going to be ashamed about ... said this was this was a good at the end of team\nYeah well I I don't know I mean I thought it was a little bit of a sloppy effort by Ohio State they had they ended up with nine penalties for almost a hundred yards\nUm they they they just you know the defense wasn't as good as it usually is gas over four hundred yards Offit has kids was phenomenal\nAnd they won the game and I do wonder again it kinda the opposite of what I was saying with Georgia, Georgia maybe looking ahead Ohio State kind of what that hangover game after that wild when it gets Penn State last week\nYou when it you know I always say this and I I think it's true in this case with Ohio State it was a little bit sloppy they still ended up winning by three touchdowns and then the bigger thing is\nDoesn't matter get the wind move on to the next one nobody's going to remember if you were sloppy this week or you are good that week or it doesn't matter just get that winning keep racking up wins because you do that you'll find yourself where every Ohio State fan wants them at the end of the year which is competing for national champs\nToo big upsets one Florida will not big but for the ... B L issued twenty seven Nineteen um that dropped out of five and one\nI was going to say the theme of Tonight Show is tradition\nI a grown up in Connecticut I grew up as a Red Sox fan but there really is not very much like a big playoff game in the Bronx oh no no no and I know I I you know it's crazy I haven't actually been to the new Yankee Stadium yet because it open right around the time that I moved out here and maybe not maybe move like two or three years earlier but anyway\nThe point being I haven't been there yet I heard it's not quite the same but it seemed like last year\nFor those playoff games everybody was up for it I'm excited to watch them excited to see and it's been a far it's been a ...\nIt's been awesome so uh we'll see what happens there\nOr Washington state of thirty five thirty over Oregon states are about to start the force that when are you going to criticize Washington state because they're given up thirty plus to Oregon State I couldn't care less about watching as well I see that there are a good team for and what coming out and I'm surprised that executives cause I thought they would go ahead and en route Oregon State I think the games in Corvallis so\nMaybe that's why it's it's closer than I thought\nYou know I have a great can I tell a great get fired for talking about Washington state Oregon State I think can I give a great Corvallis story really quite yeah go ahead now really gets fired but go ahead\nNo I have a buddy who was an assistant coach up there I won't name the sport\nBut apparently Corvallis it's a little it's a little hard on the eyes let me put it it's not the most scenic place and he was talking to a buddy his who was an assistant coach at an opposing school the other team came in for a road game and he stops them in the handshake line before the game he says\nThis places so awful you got the NCAA should allow you guys to cheat to get players up\nOff that I'll never forget that that's my only valid or yeah I'm also later tonight we're waiting for the McGregor fight I mean how long do we have to wait for this what is it is it going to be starting like after three o'clock in the morning on the east coast or what\nI Know well I Hope I Hope it's on by the time we get off I think that Jonas and all of them will be doing the recap after I think it'll still be going on we're going off air here\nUnbelievable so we'll keep you updated on that I've got it got a lot in front of me so uh we'll just wait for the start of the fight if they've got where's that been our producers he's sleeping again\nNo I'm I'm I'm right here are so\nMany more fights so we have to go till we get to the ...\nI Believe we have one at Tony Ferguson against Anthony pet is in the uh Kobe an event that is the one fight before I'm assuming this is going to determine who's going to face the winner of the main event\nSo are they worried about a sudden the east coast is going to be like one in the morning\nYou know how it is already was boxing they don't care about that like we may whether we'd come out and fight or some of these big name boxers would come out and fight like nine o'clock Pacific time it would be like midnight on the east coast that how it always has been in the fight games\nDo have a ... latest odds on this ...

it's so funny you know have you ever heard\nClay Travis our buddy who's out in the morning of course have you ever heard his uh don't juice bar me bro theory have you ever do that no no I've not heard that so he tells a great story and and the point that he wants to make is this is that you know everyone he so when Bush Jones who's no longer the head coach of Tennessee when he got hired at Tennessee\nAll that Tennessee want it to how it was oh we put all this money in our facilities\nWe have this juice bar now where everybody's yeah do you get a juice they could get a smoothie whenever they needed\nAnd and clay was like yeah but which Jones is still our head coach and none of it matters and so the point is all the schools have money\nAll the schools have facilities they can all pay assistant coaches so the one thing that Alabama has that nobody else does\nHe's ... and the point that clay was trying to make was stop spending all your money on fancy juice bars in waiting rooms and lounges for the players just go out and spend it on the coast because whether it's Nick Saban to a small degree urban Meyer dabble Sweeney whoever\nThose guys are worth every penny that you\nWant so then what makes the same in such a better coach and everybody else I'll ask you the next question what what is he on the cutting edge of coaching history does he have a you know is his plays or you know ... is coordinator is better than everybody is going through how many offensive coordinators in the last four years so\nI I'm not I'm not quite understanding what makes him a better coach that everybody else\nWell I think the thing that's different about him that I've noticed just from an outside one he holds everybody to the standard of perfection I mean first of all we talked earlier about what coach doesn't but go ahead but I don't I don't actually agree with that on every coach says that they do\nBut Nick Saban is the only one when you're up thirty at the end of the game he's yelling and screaming at his players that his assistant coaches at\nThat that show is and why do you really badly yeah see six\nFifty six to seven and they get scored other making fifty six for the does he really going oh I'm going to show them in practice were running around to borrow\nNo but if you remember um\nRemember when he Nick Saban when he um lane kissing and I don't remember I I don't I don't know if I can say this word on air but it was uh something chewing that he gave to ... yes I remember that yeah it was with which I Believe he did that just a just a flex its muscle but go ahead but\nThey won the national championship that year nobody else did they were up thirty eight to ten in the fourth\nQuarter under him in a buck chewing makes you with the national championship is that is that what was that he didn't get that yells at you and your son jumbo Fisher grab one of his players by the bass bass that means he's going to win a national championship no well\nMaybe who knows I mean first of all the player said he had no problem with it but the point with Nick Saban if you had let me get to ask why is that you're you said oh 'cause he yells will no other coach is going to yell at his authentic coordinator in the fourth quarter with under a minute to go but you know what\nMaybe the next time that are offensive Cornell does the exact same thing but instead of it being a thirty eight to ten game\nIt's a thirty five thirty two game and he ended up losing a game and so you hold everyone to such an insanely high standard they actually talked about on the broadcast today Greg Mac or who played for next save and he said yeah the hardest part of every week is Tuesday Wednesday Thursday practice\nAnd so when you hold everybody to such a high standard ... and like I said every coach thinks that they bust their but look\nI like to say gee I've not heard that on any other program that the hardest days of the week or Tuesday Wednesday Thursday right you know\nWell it yeah and so you play Alabama on Saturday I Can't and so no and I mean I think that's every walk of life I mean why do you and I have a national radio show when there's a there's a million guys that whole hosts sports talk radio it's because we held ourselves to a higher standard we did something that um you know we\nHave done something in our careers we have worked harder got pictures we got we got pictures as well so the other guys don't have pictures\nUh I like it I can read that says saving them are the best of cheating plain and simple oh my God oh heating are we going to go up that road are we going to we're going to be beneficial well hold on to that thought for a little bit will will come back we'll finish up the top twenty five\nWill finish talking about why Alabama and Nick Saban is not better but head and shoulders better\nThan everybody else he's Aaron tourism only spend your this is ... sports are ideal [noise] [laughter]\nCollege would fall [laughter]\nSevering catch every fumble hammering touched down\nWhen it comes to the LA football coverage on your radio\nMoney ... face is Fox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or is that a war basketball is bound to the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during the game well here\nIt easier to talk to you it sounds like coffee so when the patriots finished ten and six what am I going to get from it but\nI Will I Will send you some Vermont's fine as I'll go through like some maple syrup\nUm some heavy topper beer which people with people\nThat uh eight o'clock in the morning for Syria that they'll do all this and that's called a having a problem\nWell because we don't have that much you know there's not a lot for sale so ah people get up early and wait in line there's probably about about a hundred people in line at the uh uh the outlet uh uh the liquor outlet\nOkay so that's what I'm going to win when I'm when a when the patriots win ... games are more during the regular season yeah I don't know if you get shipped here but all of a sudden it anyway what the heck yeah I mean whatever as long as you're not going to get arrested right exactly\nI when we get back we'll do our top what for top five I'm for college football I Want to see what it is right now a plus I Want to talk about the patriots and what is going on a obviously from Thursday or with their victory over the call so we'll get to that
