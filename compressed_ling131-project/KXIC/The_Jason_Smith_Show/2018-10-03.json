over the nuggets\nAnd a LeBron did not start this game you're engine review actually stole nine or ... yards and my mom or because that's the really big thing is that the big news coming out of the major league baseball players right now the Rockies and the cubs going to the top of the ninth inning a Colorado and the cubs tied at one piece\nIs that the Dodgers make their decision for game one of the LDS against the Braves the decision comes down about an hour and a half ago and they will start young general view\nOver Clayton cursed Shaw nothing is wrong with ...\nSimply has been the better pitcher he's been the better picture at Dodger Stadium is erased one point one five that's half run lower than drums been all season long show ya young so I can only when you can't win asylum just that you can't win a home Cy Young yet not yet anyway not yet maybe at some point get to that not that anyway\nBut here's the thing is that her show of starting game too it sounds crazy\nBut this is the right move\nBecause the Dodgers need to start move themselves moving themselves away from relying on ... in the postseason because\nSimply relying on him in every single big game has not worked out in the last six years his erase four and a half in the playoffs something awful but he's not been the Clinton ... of the regular season he's been very Peyton Manning ask Peyton Manning as always had a phenomenal regular season\nAnd then he had his ups and downs in the playoffs he still was successful her show's been successful but he has it been lights out and the Dodgers and Dave Roberts were this is the gutsy decision Roberts is leaving himself up to be questioned big time\nYou know he's saying you know what we tried it for six years it hasn't worked let me try something a little different and you have are you going in game one and if it doesn't go well then you're coming back with Sean game too and the Braves don't have any time to rest and go hey we just be cursed Shaw now we're swing and free the pressure is off us you have a guy that's\nBeen through it before to come back and pitch game too but make no mistake this is the Dodgers saying\nWe are moving away a little bit and getting used to the fact that we are not going to rely on Clinton Herschel missile I've aftereffects into the off season\nHas curse Shaw his contract is up\nAnd you can get out of it if he wants to he has a player opt out he's got two more years on his deal but he can get out of it in the off season and\nIt reality without Clayton Kurdish off for the Dodgers isn't the worst thing in the world\nYou see the way the team's been made the last two years they missed him for wide stretches last year and still won the west by the time he wasn't the best picture on the team this year you can argue he was the third best picture on the team this year binary when Walker bealer and still Ninety two wins and they are in the playoffs\nThirty three million dollars and go a long way for it to buy a couple of other players to help your both at whatever else you want to do resign many Machado go signed Bryce Harper whatever it is you want to do that money will go a long way\nIf you think about the future with al ... Shaw it's not that bad you can you think in a positive frame of mind that we're moving on we couldn't move on from a guy who's been great and he's been ... novel and he was the best pitcher in baseball for a long time but he's on the wrong side of thirty he's got back trouble\nAnd two more years of him at thirty three million dollars a year\nWe might be able to do things a little bit differently and we may be able to achieve a little bit more\nBut you get to do all that stuff irrespective men and women without consideration\nOf what's going on with with quake Kirsch that thirty three million that that hamstrings a lot of other teams that's not a a a deal breaker to the\nDodgers you think you're still getting value and he was still a great pitcher just when you look at the overall body of work at least recently healing or were you did over the month of September and what he did nine own starch that's enough to sell me that I play the hot and theory and I'd give him the ball for game on knowing that\nThey have to go with ... with ... ... for the first and then they don't have that number two what what are your match up ... with Clinton Herschel\nGlavine that are going to live in small medics Avery if it go I gained five dollars sure yeah but you have to show their coverage and then Terry Pendleton is going to oh I live now I dont nicely and like\nYou have the the luxury right it's a different different animal in a different Dodger team where you've had you step up and now Walker buell or is everything they hoped it would be ... right we're talking to and a half months ago on All right is he going to be on an innings restriction now he's arguably the ace of your staff\nAnd you're looking at him becoming a superstar on the global stage as everybody including those in Los Angeles will get to watch him\n... ... ... ... so big things ahead for the Dodgers I like what David Roberts it here I I like he set himself up well he'll get some early criticism with it because of loyalty and all those fun things for getting your play into when\nTwitter at about ...

[noise] for angry people who have agenda [noise] okay because you've been told by a lot of people [noise] that ship Kelly is over [noise] for the chip Kelly can't come after you've been told [noise]\nBecause you've heard it from eagles fan [noise] and because you heard it from forty niner fan [noise]\nGiven that you've heard it from other people in the NFL or around the NFL who say [noise]\nYeah that guy can't coach he was exposed pretty quickly right\nThose are the the old mines in the NFL that's the old guard that doesn't want to acknowledge an innovator with new ideas gay so the reason I bring this up is UCLA got blown out on friday night by Colorado on Fox for their own [noise]\nRegardless of what you think for what you're hearing or what people are saying the I told you

crow well learned after that after costing the jets with a stupid penalty against the brands that helped contribute to their loss you didn't really carry the football on Sunday but here is now making money to do what thing becomes a big punch line for him the players don't respect Todd Bowles they like him\nI guarantee they like Todd Bowles but if they respected Todd Bowles they wouldn't commit stupid penalties like this which they've been doing now for four years so nothing has changed they wouldn't come out flat for games you're going flat for your first home game and the next game after that are you kidding oh you didn't practice all week for the jaguars we know you didn't pride for bigger may feel\nBut this is just another thing that tells you the jets are going to move on from Todd Bowles and they're going to fake and rightfully so we need a\nAn office of mind to coach to bring Sam drawn along he's our franchise number three overall pick and we got to move away from Todd Bowles 'cause we can't keep 'em because bad penalties and and a lack of discipline continues to\nWork and hang over the New York jets and that should not be the case they should be a team that plays greater than their talent 'cause they don't have a lot of it they should be playing hard every week they should be a team that loses games because you know what the other teams there just a little bit more talented but it was because they quit and they do stupid things and that's on the head coach\nI say this simply you knew you were going to New York you weren't getting a lot of wins so I Hope you get

by the way the next one and over time last night did yeah they do when they when when one big and beat the number but curse\nShaw getting bumped again to for review is only one\nOf the crazy stories of the day as we talk about the major league baseball playoffs\nThe Ames and the Yankees who will be going out of tomorrow night me AOL wild card game you're going to see something a little different this is because the A's are going to make their game a bullpen game Bob Melvin\nToday at the press conference for the wild card game had Liam Hendricks out\nBecause he's going to start the game or a lever who may pitch one inning he may pitch to winnings\nDoesn't matter but it will be quote a bullpen game for the ages they're going to use as many relievers as they can\nOr maybe starting pitchers as relievers but that's how the game is going to go Melvin did not give anything else out about his rotation you could wind up seeing Hendricks pitched the first like I said at first inning first two innings they could go to another starting pitcher\nThey could go to another relief pitcher but that's how they're going to treat this game against the Yankees the Yankees go with Louis Severino\nI Love this strategy I Know it sounds crazy and it sounds outside the box and it's something that we kind of talked about ingest for a while but if you don't have good started ... their best started with Jon Benet who's now out for the year he here to shoulder a couple of weeks ago\nThey don't have anybody they can say okay we're going to throw you out there and think that we get an even match up with the Yankees so we're going to do instead is we're going to go and make it a bullpen game because I'm going to put the pictures I have the most confidence in out there to pitch and it makes complete sense and I'll tell you what\nEventually a team is going to have some kind of saber metric breakthrough and they're going to have a manager that's going to say here's what I'm doing I'm taking Thirteen pictures\nI'm going to go with all relief pitchers\nAnd every day is going to be a bullpen game and I'm going to have three or four guys pitching one day\nAnd then three or four guys pitching the next day three or four guys pitch in the day after that guys that can go two or three and I'm not saying they're going to go you know five and the guys are going to go two or three days and that's going to be the rotation and pictures are going to have two days between games relievers left two days between games to pitch\nAnd you can certainly move guys up and down hey we need a fresh arm from AAA to come up to pitch this game whatever you're going to see that eventually the teams are going to go you know what that's what we're going to compete we're going to sign a bunch of good relievers\nAnd that's how we're gonna go we're going to have guys like and I just say this is the Mets because I'm familiar with the guys guys like set blue on Robert dissolve and who were ...\nForeigners to relievers that it's pretty well that could pitch two or three innings you know and then they come out because then you're you're effect of this kind of goes away or you will see a team decide you know what yes you're my starter but one time through the order you're out and bring in somebody from the bullpen because really what are you doing\nYou're just going to say okay I haven't you go another\nTime and a half through the order and then the sixth inning upbringing reliever anyway ... you're going to go to the order one time that another guy's coming in to go through the order one time and that\nAnd that's we're going to do you're gonna somebody will do that at some point and it's going to revolutionize baseball yes we've seen the rays do it a little bit this year but somebody's got to do it this is going to be our plan for the season yeah but I think a lot of it isn't\nGoing to be necessarily the saber metrics of it which is nice a residual effect I think you're going to have more teams like the raise looking at it from just a pure cost perspective\nRight now it's more cost efficient to have a bunch of middle reliever is not that they're\nCheap like they were ... years ago but still compared to starting pitcher salaries we brought up the the number of thirty three million back and looking at for a Clinton crush are by no means do I compare one of the other\nAs a one to one but that's one slot in your rotation versus half a bull pen [laughter] you're going for and I know that money can be spent on eating and that's one of those things where at the age go after it here is you only want to see the hitters to see a picture once and that's it move on\nYou get the most prolific home run hitting outfit that we've ever seen in major league baseball a veritable conga line dancing around the base paths audio slow it down\nKeep them on their heels keep bringing in different arms different all angles change it up to speed however you can do it and that's ... Vegas miss direction\nFor the baseball mound is basically what we're going to see them or I Can't wait to see how it comes to fruition quite long haul shore I can totally see a team saying we've got Ninety million dollars a barrel\nYou know what we can get twelve pictures for X amount and now we can actually afford a couple of hitters and we'll see if the sociological experiment works see I like it\nThinking about this thing about what the Dodgers are paying Clayton Kurdish are right now between thirty and thirty two million dollars a year right I mean that's a lot of money\nYou could conceive of every dollar by the window [laughter] every single or how does the measure up to Keenan Allen yeah but he's the third best picture on the Dodgers now prosper\nYou know that's not true [laughter] you know you're lying through your team who's your on having a big game right now are you at home Walker you know it's I Know you give her saw the ball bealer Mueller is he a buell are but I respect you give it to twenty two\n[noise] yeah yeah respect gets your seat on your ass sitting at home but don't you think about this I can think about this I mean I like the respect game they'll get their own\nWe get to the top of the eleventh ending and I'll tell you what it's been entertaining\nIt's likely Kevin Bacon says in a few good men he'll cut to do a few officers will throw around terms like code red and I'll tell you now have no evidence mind you know I bought it will be entertaining and that's kind of where we're at right now we've had horrible replay reviews that didn't go ... guys out of games it's entertaining and they're\nSaying well on at this point Madden proven right by the move for Rizzo right takes them out for the pinch runner and and they get the run home oh I'd almost backfired when you got Murphy potentially butchering the ball at first\nBase but everybody got out unscathed and we keep moving on to the top of the yellow\nA meanwhile it's been two days it's man it's it's been it's been two days since the United states lost the Ryder Cup yeah and\nSay really brought up a fight to lie about it but it looked good for the first half of day one kind of like the jets we look good for the first half of the first happened that they look good for the first half from day one does it go\nGeez I remember a route in a it was introduced a disco fantasy talk uh with Jonah notch Saturday and Sunday before my fantasy show Fox football fantasy with a a buyer six am Pacific not am a nice uh and Ralph was all excited saying\nThis is going to Trump all all football stories I looked out I got out of your mind [laughter] like\nCome on like even if they what it's\nLike beating the NFL what I'd give you that there'd be more interest and then they they lay down\nBut the stories coming off the Ryder Cup\nPatrick ... who is the big villain on the PGA Tour or said he was very upset to be taken off a paring with Jordan speech because they were so successful Ryder Cup presidents cup\nAnd there were rumors that speech ass out of the pairing because he didn't like Patrick greed Patrick read was really upset said Jim Europe didn't captain very well today on identified player said Patrick reads full of crap he begged to play with Tiger Woods and Jim fury wouldn't do it\nAnd then we get this story on the heels of Patrick recalls and all this controversy that Dustin Johnson and Brooks kept good nearly got into a\nFight over there and play on Saturday [noise] we\nWe got to go first wanting to fight each other along with that I heard it was an over planet Gretzky ... well it could have been ... by your throat fest for that right I I you you will ... yeah but I like to think this is limited to the to the Ryder Cup are you sure I Know but I I okay I'm Seventy five percent okay that's good enough [laughter]\nI mean it just doesn't get any better than than a leap golfer millionaires who want to fight\nDoesn't get any better than that but I mean everybody's got a little fighting an annoyance in a while\nAll right I'll tell you that I'll tell you the speaking a fight about love or not ... than anything else but sure\nWith all of this going yeah here's the golfers I wouldn't fight right I wouldn't fight\nBrooks kept are doing the guide any of these guys I Would feel especially now you see Phil Mickelson swinging his leg over the top yeah he will have a bottle of nail scissors kick you in the back of the head you know we've got a problem I wouldn't buy ... obviously the guys that I mean he's been doing that slow play with those commercials and then he's all flexible and get\nYour head I wouldn't fight still true because you they all feel no bill is tall and he's big\nAnd I I think bill could just like fall on me I think by ... pyramid schemes any of that pyramid scheme and all all your cash already [laughter]\nVaporize you with his leg\nI wouldn't fight Patrick read because he would fight dirty\nThere's no way I Would fight there is no I'd fight Patrick rate I wouldn't fight Dustin Johnson because he'd be crazy and unpredictable he'd he'd like do stuff that I like phone with the mouth I Would do what the hell's

coverage\nWith ... six am eastern three am puts it back on Fox Sports radio\n\n\nFox Sports ...\nA Chicago Cubs appear to have gotten out of the bases loaded and jam Colorado\nLeave comments were not at at one of these Rockies had to laugh at the bases loaded and she has I just got the third house we're headed for the\nA format killer on Twitter who said the players will tell you who is safer out that's why nobody left their position the players will tell you who is safe or out and that was a that's why it was a horrible call by the umpires and go back and overlooked that now again\nThis play now plays into this replay play plays into what happened last night between the chiefs\nAnd the Broncos not throwing the flag on the cheese for the delay of game penalty\nCertainly that play being allowed to stand gave the chiefs a huge advantage is now first down inside the twenty yard line\nBut if they did get called it would be Thirteen twelve from fifty which still two minutes left to go on the game there's still a lot of game left you don't know what would have happened it would have been a different game but the point is to get the call right the same thing here tonight\nIf not Cole was allowed to spin ... at second base with two outs next about a could pop up ground out certainly it's not like balls are flying out originally tonight runs around a premium but the thing is getting the call right and be able to explain yes this is why we did it X Y Z and I'm not I don't see that anywhere from this so far\nCan't wait to see what the explanation is in the post when we get it from the pool reporter always pull reporters all at once you get to the playoffs whether it'd be major league baseball or the NHL NBA and certainly a\nMajor league baseball and they will will get the pool reporter notes I mean we always get that from the super bowl you always get\nOh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean 'cause it's a big honor to be named full report\nThat got to go to court and things are always said notice this came out from a pool reporter it's like oh my God this is this is the\nBest way he's got an extra access you know ...\nYou know it's not like Jim hill or anybody is walking around go you know I got this exclusive\nOne on one interview and I got this great thing to say you know I don't have that\nYou guys in your gym held [laughter] how can they get to the rest of you we thank you for listening to us here and the guy goes duty as as we take a deep into the night with LeBron James and the Lakers beating up on the ... and continued free baseball\nSo while we keep an eye on this cubs with runners at first and second one out bottom of the eleventh I hit would win the game for the cubs the Dodgers make an interesting decision\nFor game one of the LDS it will not be Clayton Kirk Shaw throwing in game one a shocker it will be young general you going in game one against the Braves curse trouble pitching game to both pitchers will get their normal rest if they want to go in game five so Dave Roberts has made a really\nGutsy decision and it's not gonna sit well but quite honestly it's the right decision\nNow for the straight rotational perspective or it gets real working both guys will pitch on one day ... whereas if you'd walk them then you'd be looking at two days rest for review and it'll be ... or ...\nBut this is why this is the right move\nThe Dodgers have relied on Clinton courage Sean every postseason for the last six years and certainly it's not his fault you can't say all they all lost to go but it's not like Clinton ... has been regular season plate and Kirsch all they ever lied on him to pitch twice in a series when ... maybe come back on three days rest and it hasn't worked\nSometimes things are as simple as you know what hasn't worked six years so\nLet's try something new and this gets the Dodgers away from relying on Clinton curse you ought to win games it gets away from the mentally relying on Clayton commercial it gets away from other teams thinking if we can be ... we can beat the Dodgers we were moving downhill if we'd be crushed Sean game what\nThis is not the season the Kurdish always had in the past\nYou can argue he's the third best picture on the team right now\nBehind Walker bealer behind where you pitching at home it's a big deal for you pitching it home where's your raise one point one five for the season but this is the beginning of the Dodgers and this is Dave Roberts realizing we can't keep relying on you we tried for so long\nAnd I mean when I said there's a lot of the last Eighteen months instead of the few times tonight\nIf the Dodgers had a future without Clinton ... it's okay if you opt out after this year and goes to pitch in Texas was someplace else the Dodgers will be fine without him they blitz to the world series last year and he missed a long period of time in the middle of the season they one Ninety two games the ... this year and he was just\nHe was good he wasn't great they will be fine without Clinton crush of who's over thirty with back problems if this is the beginning of the divorce of of the moving away this be the official\nPoint where you can say okay the Dodgers are contemplating a life without him they will find life without him is going to be OK\nWell and I'm like years passed you actually have people I started at rotation making step it\nYou look at what really has done a on the road at three five eighty eighty IRA but at home and nine starts absolutely dominant and huge in the month of September and then you look at Walker Mueller who is a star ready to dominate we watched it the last couple of months\nWondering about his innings usage at this point does it matter he's full on and is prepared to become the AIDS going forward so for the Dodgers a big move by David Roberts I'm sure there'll be plenty of criticizing but at worst quake Kirsch us sitting in the two all your series yeah advantage Dodgers\nFox Sports radio that Jason Smith show as
