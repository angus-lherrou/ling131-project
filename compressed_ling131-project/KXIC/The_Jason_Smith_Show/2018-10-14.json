involved or or the office gets above ... we'll see what happens but are certainly not a good look I wanted to read this one uh Mike in\nJacksonville Artie did I just hear your cold hard say that he thought the season that the season the big was the best coverage before the season I mean North Carolina guy and an ACC guy but my God and what fantasy land is the SEC not far and away the best the Big Ten is average as grits\nIs what makes it well Mike in Jacksonville pay attention because before the season every one thought the the the Big Ten was the best conference in college football they\nHad five preseason teams ranked in the top Fifteen\nOhio State Michigan Penn State Wisconsin and Michigan State also people like Purdue to be improved people thought Scott Frost would do big things\nAnd oh by the way we're proven wrong hey already you know what's great a lot of the fence of you or I was just they know what's great about the ... and versus the regular season was that you actually learn stuff\nIn the season and all this stuff in the pre season doesn't matter because games are played and right now the SEC is the best conference in college football\nYes yes but I'll I'll do your defense before the season um we did we did think that okay Michigan was good that there are still good team but they were going to compete for the four teams Ohio State was Michigan State was going to be a lot better Penn State of course still with a good year even though they lost to Michigan State\nSo I mean there are top heavy I disappointed in Wisconsin I mean they do this every year I get a couple of when's the next you know they've got to losses are three ... very very disappointed with everybody else really\nAverage or below average I mean North West is okay and the ad is okay but they're not going to do a whole heck of a lot Ira\nYeah and you brought up the point earlier on Wisconsin is shame on us for believing in them with the quarterback play the way that they have I
