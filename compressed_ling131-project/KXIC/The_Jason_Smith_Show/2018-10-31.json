struggle a little bit early offensively they're fine they have to learn how to close out one they'll find another foreigner how close out and\nFinding other shooters somewhere off the scrappy beer but when we look at the the western conference as a whole it's the warriors and everybody else is there is no division between\nHere in the Lakers and timber wolves wet while Jimmy Butler's there until he traded meant things go here's has got to go get Ginny butler now is that for drastic thing has to happen there's your draft pick some players\nAt you know the eastern conference version of this or the Washington Wizards ... good basketball but I you know and they lost again they log on to twelve at least move the ball for a while and it looked like a team that actually wanted to play together Dave also lost the clippers so the clippers are bearing you know the fruit of hanging out in the early they yeah they go after the big game hunting you're seeing\nNow that windows that were open for a long time could be rapidly shots\nOn many teams in the NBA we thought coming into this year we're going to be good because we're starting to see a bit of a changing of the guard because of the number of teams that have been able to adopt that up and down the floor we're going to score a lot of points\nMilwaukee a seven to know or this is a teen are how good of a playoff team on it I didn't know here they are now they're on top of eastern conference scene Toronto wow how good are they going to be or we should know ... their top of the eastern conference Boston is still very good but we've seen them jump up so now as a result\nPhiladelphia struggling a little bit we've not seen them play well watched as a team that is normally a four or five seed they're not playing well then you go to the western conference as you go boy Denver who is legit thoroughly losses to the Lakers they can go up and down to for this one a hundred and Fifteen points a game\nPortland is better San Antonio looks like they're getting things right and you look at the team to the bottom of the struggle you didn't expect Houston to be down there then expect Minnesota be three and four sitting around and\nI mean you're seeing a bit of a changing and the window for some teams that we thought OK still know it may not be open anymore that's open to new teams now\nWears a great quote from corral Anthony after the game quote I Know what it takes to win let that sink in for a second\nHe ... he won in two thousand and three you on the national titles Syracuse remember you know and I look I've\nGot one of his new signature hats so I Can't ... no id\nAnd he said all of a million getting paid them exactly still has all those millions of dollars from Syracuse said no that's right ...\nAnd all the money he got from Phil Jackson uh I also know what am I on it likely that I had to do I feel I also know what it feels like to be in the situation we're in right now it's easy for the negativity just started seeping into the room\nYeah ... yeah when you're when you're one in five and and you've only beaten the Lakers won\nThis just saying he's opening the door [laughter]\nThe answer the question is what it while these under achieving teams have in common let's see mellow mellow mellow but yeah he was asked about\nThe yet he was asked about the veteran leader stepping up and that was his response like\nDon't just say we've got to work harder we've got to do something more don't start talking about negativity springs a room\nThat everybody just going to go on a sale him negativity is not coming into any negativity negative negative negative and here we got negativity\nLook that's just the reality when when a window closes it closes right away I many teams we like to think that okay they're really good for a while you see slowly All right this year not quite and then there's some kind of playoff series where you go oh well this is where we you know we lose four to one and we thought we'd be do better okay\nThat's where we start over again no most of the time it's like this what what just happened to us what what what's happening to us and it's not getting better soon that's how it\nIs that's how it looks for Houston and the wizards right now that things look because you're seeing new teams look Anthony Davis has injury ... remember the pelican started out like gangbusters right you know but he's been hurt the last couple of nights too so forget remember that's a team that could be at the top you see this is it now for all of this\nHey the wars are still dominant is great and the warriors still are great\nBut you realize that they're nearing the end of their dynasty because Katie is likely going to leave and you can't keep everybody and there's there's three or four new teams that are like well this is our time now well in the words\nDon't necessarily have the debt by it so if if you get into long series their their bench isn't as strong as it was and we saw that a little

any day now the thought of it will be networked insider John Paul morose CJ what's often as\nI Am not a candidate for a executive position\nWith any baseball team I Am fairly and executive in my own household let alone and executive or a baseball team\nSo uh I Try to stay within my very narrowly in of what I Would I Know about the universe that has to do with right now the U.S because again we if it weren't for a couple of points there over the weekend and maybe if the Dodgers owner leading game for\nRight now a game six of the world series we're wrapping up at Fenway Park but instead we have a new world series champion at the red Sox with the most World Series title of it you know baseball the century\nOurselves we look for the two big questions number one we know there's only a couple of days for Clinton Kurdish ought to make a decision if he wants to stay with the Dodgers Willie opt out we try to look for greener pastures\nEverything that's gone into what we saw this off season jade this postseason they gets pushed the game to against the Braves did not make them happy he's not been the ... of years past what do you think happens what what you've heard what happened with her show this off season\nQuestion and and the actual the ticket tired of it are literally twenty four hours from right now so uh uh I guess twenty four hours and thirty minutes or twenty seven minutes from right now it's midnight eastern time tomorrow is his deadline\nOpt out or not as is the case for David Price as well so I bought that ironically enough\nTwo game five starters both have opt out as of the stroke of midnight tomorrow night so I I Love the drama there to begin the off season I think we have not yet heard obviously an any sort of information from the Dodgers camp or from Clinton's camp\nWhich makes me think that there's some real negotiating happening here are some real fought back and forth about what Clinton's going to do and they give it was an easy decision\nIt would have been public find out that he would have come out and said ... exactly what he's going to do now he may well no in his own heart of hearts that he's not going to leave the Dodgers a man that ill they'll try to get an extension up until midnight tomorrow and if you can't he'll\nJust maybe he just said declines the opt out and stays there but I I still think that there there is a likelihood probably better than fifty percent that either by simply not opting out or by opting out and and instantaneously signing an extension for\nThree years four years so that other words that they would tear up the two year deal and make it a three or four year deal probably at a lower at average annual values and what he's got coming right now at more than thirty million dollars a year\nThat I think those I think still the the likelihood is that by the end of the week one way or the other that he's still a Dodger but there's still a pretty good percentage chance I Would say about forty percent\nThat are that he actually goes the free agency from what I've been told and\nI I think you're right Jason do illustrate the the the dynamics of the playoffs and how starting game to influence that decision I think there's a lot there but at the end of the day I come back to this point what's the one thing he has not done\nHis baseball life and that's when the world series that's it that's the only thing isn't done he's pushing too he just hasn't won one yet and and to me as appealing as it might be to go back and and pitch for his hometown Texas Rangers or an open a new ballpark there in in twenty twenty\nCandidly guys they're just not going to be that good for a couple of years and in the Clinton crochet I Want to spend the two of his remaining prime years ... even as we acknowledge that probably is not as dominant as he once was are you going to spend those two years with rebuilding team\nI and I just think for him what a competitor he is I think the answer that question is no I I think in many ways it had he won the world series last year maybe he does opt out and go home I think that's that's a more appealing thing but he still has to check that box\nHe hasn't checked it yet and big picture right now guys one of the better places to do that and the chase that dream of baseball is is the place where he is right now so I think for that reason one way or the other I think there are still better than fifty fifty fifty fifty chance the Quakers are the Dodger or in the next couple of days\nDavid Rice with the hashtag I hold the cards now to eat the other day my fourth radio the Jason Smith show with my current company when the guy studios with us our money much more general be network insider jump on the roads you find him on Twitter at John Rhodes you leave off each receiving\nHi mom ... odds winter\nSo you'd be willing to stay with one guy we just watched the highway cheese here in Los Angeles I was wondering if it was a mini Machado on his way out of town and we're\nWell another big topic ah certainly as ah the off season begins and we'll have next week the GM meetings there in San Diego everybody gets ready and the the agents begin their sales pitches a I think the other point might get a little harder pitch to make for Machado now that it would have been two or three months ago\nUm the numbers are there but uh the numbers were there are certainly for the full season he had a decent playoff certainly not a I I think at least for the first two rounds that of course not a very good World Series at all um and and the the ancillary parts are becoming more and more of a conversation\nI I think is is that that ... to the question of whether or not he hurt his market value the last month or so\nI think he did in so far as I cannot imagine to your point the Dodgers recon figuring their line up\nFit him in for next year right uh I don't I don't see them moving Turner to first base or or secret a second to it with a wherever they would do I I just don't see it and so as a result that that's one big dollars sooner that's no longer really a factor for him so there's there are a handful of teams I think the Phillies makes some sense\nBut again when ... with the Phillies and they're they're blue collar fan base ... they're so proud of not hustling this kind of a problem and and I don't think it's going to totally turn off the Phillies pursuing him but it may diminish a little bit how much they're willing to pay him and\nHow comfortable the fan bases are seeing a maybe a three hundred million dollar deal there their competition on that is wait a minute we've got we've got somebody that we're paying more money than the athletes ever made in the city and he he doesn't like us in the first base as this kind of hard\nI I understand you take the talent and they're still going to pursue them don't get me wrong\nBut when you see that number there and it's the face your franchise it means a little something a little different than just being a two month rental\nOr or three months rental in Los Angeles so there's a lot going on there are guys I still think there's going to be healthy interest from him or in him rather from the Phillies are also a a fit for Bryce Harper but I I agree that that over the last month or so much ... value as come down maybe not by a lot but it has come down\nOne kind of what kind of value does he have now is it going to be two hundred million dollar contract is it a shorter for a hundred million like what is it for him\nHe may have to find a way guys to scrape by on two hundred million dollars\nTo do that under that\nI mean we're talking about some pretty serious monthly expense sacrifices for for many Machado at two hundred million dollars a hit all seriousness I I I I Do think that the I think the ultimately his deal is going to start with that too I Do\nWe've got got what did he get arrested for prey job he was one of the fans who threw a sex toy piano last night during the patriots twenty five six when over the bill has has become a tradition when the bills play the patriots bills fans throw\nBill does on a field okay and this guy through one and he got arrest now here's the question okay going into NFL\nState as we all go to games prosper works for the for the chargers and he's got to go through security whatever and even as a member of staff you're going through all these different detectors you can't bring your bags and lost their leader now they check your pocket at the lawns whenever\nI get that in a I don't think it probably wasn't and electrically operated I don't think it was I think it was probably one of the game and he got through a metal detector today and on your ... you know you\nDon't know well I probably know where he hid it\n[laughter] yeah yeah and I'm pretty sure what he wears a part of your way here paths like whoa whoa he gets borrow for throwing it onto the field yeah even in the night in jail\nThan pled not guilty and was released on two hundred and fifty dollars cash bail two hundred and fifty two hundred fifty thousand he was charged with disorderly conduct creating a hazardous offensive in\nAn area is going down the side it looks like a touchdown and oh my goodness Julian Edelman has slipped on along object that was thrown on the field let's\nGet a look in here at well that's certainly a Cinderella killed in shape and it looks it looks like it's got to what is that let's zoom in on is that a farmer and she's like let's take time out see you blew my punch lives like a farmer Jon thoughts of\nOdds are that way\nThat we work in the other for years you blow it you know I I Do blew it I thought you were going after you blew a chance and you blow it hey I was already working out for next year who blue and the fire blew at least you didn't call me mad Louis mad [laughter]\nOh I just was a dagger but and I I really want to know what was what was behind the genesis of this he's become a thing you know the patriots play what do we got to throw a build on the field\nOh well that's right it's not like I don't remember there being any but there's no nothing it's that's how you're going to be a build up oh\nOkay that's normally there's something in the background right somebody embarrassing with the patriots mhm something you know Gronkowski or Brady or whatever like just randomly that becomes a thing\nLike when like when Brady has the ball on like the one to ten yard line fans just show pictures of ... like you know from the runway they said that the big posted the result they show up for him to see you know something like that but that is that's not distracting uh but you could do that though\nBut that's not a bad you know at at least makes sure but yeah we're going to throw a bill do on the field why oh oh All right\nAnd what I mean it's all ... to ... I think there's no place to do what I might as well throw it on the\nPeople have good they don't know what I'm gonna get caught is the third one I've thrown out this month everybody in the house was looking for him I Can't it's too hot right now too hot you somebody else to get one\nBut then there was somebody who toss it didn't make it down to the field so you had to kick it back up by the official so I mean there's multiple people trying to bring these things in I tell you\nWhen you're hiring you don't want to waste time sorting through dozens of irrelevant resumes you want an efficient way to get to a short list a qualified candidate that's why you need indeed dot com posted job in minutes set up screen or questions based on your job requirements then\nZero in on qualified candidates using a to an online dashboard discover why three million businesses using deep for hiring posted jobs\nToday and indeed dot com slash fire that's indeed dot com slash higher for greatness surge indeed coming up next we hit back into the order of the the big day in the NFL trade deadline deals why I'm feeling really good about my Super Bowl pig after what happened today\nAnd believe it or not I have another big problem with something Halloween or a straight I mean the movie Halloween okay yeah we'll get that back now this is Bob\nBob [noise]\nEverybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pickups milk full day well here's an idea what's at St hundreds of dollars on car insurance\nAnd the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything oh you have to do is go to guy co dot com and in Fifteen minutes you can be saving Fifteen Percent or more car insurance\nExtra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding too do you do today Geico\nAre you considering a safe or gun safe to secure your valuables and firearms if so before you spend any money on any typical running all male safe check out the amazing handcrafted rhino iron works", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "31"}
