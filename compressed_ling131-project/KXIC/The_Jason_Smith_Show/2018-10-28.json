somewhere and there are fifty one forty one so Syracuse gets to a victory their South Carolina\nThey beat Tennessee twenty seven twenty four so a big rivalry and not when you're Notre Dame fighting Irish Aaron forty four twenty two I Believe about five and a half minutes left in that one Irish up by twenty two they were dominating the first step and kind of let their guard down a little bit in the second half and this one\nYeah that is the gifted in the curse of playing against the triple option team is that\nUm ... they can break off a run on pretty much any play and sometimes you just don't get the ball back because of the way that they can control type of possession ... gonna hold on to win this game and he got to feel good right I mean I Know they were coming off of by what you travel across country you play this kind of quirky team and I know Navy is a good\nBut Notre Dame they're going to hold on to get the win that they need I think I mean technically navy as the ball but\nIt's a solid performance by them but like you said aren't you a little flat here in the second half but I think that's part of play navy\nWorse sleep it on the possible big upset of the night where Oklahoma State leads Texas\nThirty one Twenty one it's through three quarters they're about to start the fourth Texas with the ball deep inside Oklahoma State territory I think it says about the

hard at work today he and I were talking but did not work at let's be honest na ... doing nothing he's actually helping me right now so he's not going to chime in but um but\nWe're talking and I I don't think anybody thought Texas was really the ... best team in the country coming into the game today that look they got that big win against Oklahoma the a couple of other teams bell or in front of them in terms of the rankings and they moved up kind of\nA just because that's kind of how the rankings work sometimes but I don't know that I'm really surprised by this result they're a little kind of early in their development I feel like to just go on the road and we feel super confident that they're going to be a really really really good team are even a decent team on the road like Oklahoma State tonight\nAll right Bye bye Arizona Wildcats who I Would have been a a a couple of fingers or that they were going to lose against Oregon are up now pet nothing over the Oregon Ducks a four O. one left in the first so still a long way to go for my Wildcats\nThis one are just completely a slip through their fingers Aaron but nothing Wildcats up to a good start in that one oh yeah no wild in the pack twelve by the way Washington and a\nWashington loses Washington state Stanford comes down to the wire a USC loses to Arizona State what are we packed twelve it's always weird it's always goofy but yeah and then by the way Arizona leading very bizarre bizarre day for the fact well\nBig big three by Washington state by the way over Stanford or which puts some seven and want to know talking about that they should probably be inside the top twelve curious to see when the BCS\nComes out on Tuesday a worry where they're going to go and find themselves and that was just a couple

air and well I mean come on now at the guy was begging me for the night off so we can go to the Dodgers game what am I going to say no\nWhy ... what does he get that type of guy or what\nWhat a slacker that goes by the way Arnie did you see all four or four of the major teams will all be playing in downtown Los Angeles tomorrow or let me correct you uh five\nFive who's the fifth Oscar yeah yeah there are a little there are a little out of town there but ah why should I be Carson you know that that's you know that's the difference between a Vermont and whatever\nFor modern wherever yeah wherever you about it yeah yeah I was gonna say wherever the next town is with a a a stop light that what's really do have and you live in Burbank or where I actually live in Pasadena okay so the traffic\nAre you is it going to be like Carmageddon tomorrow tried to maneuver through the freeways are you staying home or are you going out the venture to go watch a game or go check on in life\nI Am staying home but there are four games the kings I Believe at twelve thirty at staples Centre right the rams that won\nThe Dodgers at about five and the clippers at six and for people who don't know the layout of Los Angeles staples Centre and Dodgers stadium or probably five miles apart from each other\nIt's gonna be miserable so I Will be staying home like one of your snowstorms Arnie where you can't leave the house for days up there in Vermont I I've packed the canned goods I'm not going anywhere tomorrow\nThe sports Carmageddon is that what we're getting it to me is that is that what they're\nCalling it or what yeah yeah it is and I guess I I don't know maybe things change a little bit with the Dodgers are being on the brink of elimination actually but uh\nIt's right now Red Sox lead five for\nA while because as you heard ... tell you the divers had the RBI single\nOr that brought in ... cold who had the double beforehand down the third baseline runners on first and second richest pitch six to the third gave a one hit one run seven strike outs the bullpen and two and a third for heads for runs\nA in that time anyway there's two outs runners in first and second of the top of the night uh the Dodgers have to close it down here ... up for the red Sox\nDodgers can't afford to give up any more runs they got to come up in the bottom of the night only down five for 'em and tried to scratch went away or or get lucky and hit a bomb otherwise you know hit a home\nRun otherwise ah they're down three games to one and that it's really going to get tough this this was there they were up for nothing you just don't blow for nothing weeds in the world series I Wonder what the record is I'm Aaron for a losing a weed and losing a\nGame in the world series it like that yeah how about a a a U.S essentially a\nMust win game for here by the way you said that they got they got to hold the the the lead to five or the deficit to five yeah or I was going to say I just assume that the analytics are probably going to tell Dave Robert\nTo pinch hit for many Machado maybe with Clinton ... or something so I I have no doubt that even if they do they Roberts will find a way to screen\nSo you're anti analytics is that what you're saying I mean especially I mean I'm a little anti analytics too but it's hard to argue with a team that's made back to back World Series appearances and and and by the way speaking about the odds are analytics if I told you Steph Curry\nWas over twenty from the field and they were down by two you would not tell them to stop shooting what'd you that you would say well ... it's going to go in the odds are in our favor that just shots to go in so keep on city do you play the odds there don't you\nYeah but if I were if the situation was\nWe need him to make a half court ... there's no real comparable thing in in basketball because what you're asking Kennedy Jansen to do tonight is something that he hasn't been asked to do all year and so the point that I Am trying to make about analytics and this is my belief in analytics in general\nIt's a piece to the puzzle but it can't be the only deciding factor it's\nJust that it's also supposed to be used for the course of a season not just for one game I Believe\nYeah but I but I think that you know at a certain point you have to go with common sense and we saw what happened last night with chance and um and I just ... and there's been other instances to wear the right analytic move has not worked out and so I think sometimes look\nPeople in and this is the only thing that drives me crazy but analytics all these people that say oh you know things like being clutch aren't analytical or getting nervous in a tight spot and so I don't think analytics can account for the fact that can lead Jansen knows hey last night I had a six out saving I blew it\nAnd I got to come in and do the same thing again now I'm not saying you don't pitch Kennedy chance and I'm just saying don't put him in that situation similar to what happened last night that's all I'm saying is I think analytics or important they're good they're valuable but they can't be the only deciding factor\nI'm right that tend to get an infield single he beat it out a base hit so the bases loaded\nIn the top of the night with two outs the five four leaf for the Dodgers\nAnd they'll make a pitching change so uh they'll go ahead and see if they can get keep it to within five four right or just a couple of games that are going on Texas has closed within three but Oklahoma State that just got a touchdown extra point good there are thirty eight twenty eight\nThis is I mean I'll be kept it obvious on this where they are in a a crush or for Texas this was a team that was you know right there that would have been maybe a top aide when the BCS came out on Tuesday a last year or you will find them anywhere on the top fifty and ... probably\nNo I don't think so and I think kind of the top Fifteen that's probably a little reflective of where they are I mean they're they're not a finished product yet I Know they beat Oklahoma on that neutral field by the way as your buddy ... Chris plank knows as he I'm sure you guys talked about on your show that led to Oklahoma firing their defensive coordinator and they've looked a lot better\nSo I think even in just the last few weeks Oklahoma has re assert themselves in the big twelve\nBut yeah no Texas will not be in the top ten going for it and I look at it it's not a knock on 'em it's Tom Herman second year it's been so long since they've even been this nationally relevant I think the key here not to go corny like coach speak but\nThey were up at like Eighteen points about six minutes to go or something crazy like that you're like oh it's right then it'll be a Penn State fan and then here comes Ohio State they end up winning the game oh I Can't\nI'm never forget that one to yeah I I met a few of them I don't know if you do that but I've I've had a few of them are right now it's not pretty they finally get out of it the red Sox are just going ballistic I mean they're really talking the fans you know the Dodgers troll the red socks on Twitter\nAfter game three putting some mouthed about\nYou know obviously about the victory what are you going to learn you just don't poke poke the bear you don't do something like that especially when you're still doubt two games to one\nYes sir I get distracted because uh the president of the United states just tweeted about this game and I'm not making it up whether you want me to read when he said it's pretty funny I go ahead if I die it's in the ... it's a very presidential tone he said watching the Dodgers Red Sox final innings it is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher\nWho is loose and dominating through almost seven innings rich hill of the Dodgers and brings in nervous reliever relievers who get show lacked\nFor only gone managers do it all the time\nBig mistake exclamation points so apparently you know I don't know the president wants to call him but he's in uh the tourists camp here about uh about uh Dave Roberts in him being the blame so Mr President if you are listening You're welcome to call in we'd be glad to ah talk to you about this because I agree with\nOur president on or how this bullpen was managed matter of fact why to Donald from washing [laughter]\nThat'd be pretty wild member of the day we tried to get does Brian on the show does Bryant was tweeting up your arm and he's got to know how could you know I'll do any media interview I was like it will take you on the show right now and uh we have\nHeard of course but make sure those winds are open and case Donald from Washington doesn't want to call at eight seven seven night on Fox ...\nNine nine six sixty six nine though I got to feel we're not going to hear from dirty Dodger fans are into obviously when this game gets the third out and then they're going to be calling in droves of questioning day Roberts is I Hope they're not going to start the this guy got to get fired routine because\nThat's the furthest thing from the truth or why are they going to start that or what the\nTwo most powerful men in the free world the president and me are calling for his head I mean if if those two voices can't get change I don't know what would\nWrite the real quick go ... and I know we're short on time or did you watch any of the Florida Georgia game and it was kind of a\nA struggle earlier there was a good back and forth game Georgia the ... uh uh you know a got a bunch of turnovers a Florida just turned it over left and right and then it was too much too late they benefited from that and it was all George dropped out good victory for them\nYeah absolutely and and I was a little dubious about could Georgia bounce back there were so physically dominated a few weeks ago\nBy LSU but you look at that game and I will say this to Jake from the quarterback making so many plays with his arm if Georgia wants to compete with either Alabama or LSU or whoever they are going to play for an S.

I just watch isn't all that for the state of course loses the clubs and by forty nine that's their ties are worse to feed in school history um their coach though will be tiger\nObviously had some big issues and he said that some players quit on the team he vowed to make changes he goes that can't be tolerated one thing you can't you can't quit you quit you don't play 'em\nBefore we tell ya break clubs and look\nI mean of course some kids are\nGoing to quit a little bit but you know do you blame him that he was blaming the kids or should they be taking the you know the punishment themself and just you know say I'm going to have to make changes I think he's on the line saying that the kids quit\nI mean he has a better pulse and the law on the locker room than other people and it but that's not for public consumption to the media I Believe you don't think so\nTo call out your players when they're college kids look if they were NFL players NBA players major league baseball players one thing I'd never heard college coaches really call out their players like that\nOh it happens all the time said there are a bunch of ... I ... that Jeremy Pruitt to Tennessee coach said it last week against it when they lost Alabama that he doesn't remember he didn't remember do you remember he actually I thought he had a quote that

want to do this I mean\nI have a problem or any I mean look life is tough life is is a challenge and you kind of brought up the point earlier but Trevor Lawrence the clubs and quarterback it's not like he was to ask I mean he was twenty or thirty seven\nBut it wasn't a game that if you look at the box score it should've been a forty nine point deficit in silver coach wants to be hard on his players I mean I don't have a problem with it I mean it is that what you said it's important they're not being paid\nBut they are earning a free college scholarship and part of the deal is you've got to perform it to your best abilities on the football field and coach doesn't feel like they perform their best I have no problem with it right\nGreat knows everybody does a quick way to save money

already who wow\nI'm sitting in a chair today or tomorrow you man my ... my head right\nThank you guys got appreciate that\nCome in July of from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more a car insurance was Geico\nI'll just go to guy go dot com or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto when the hard part well that is figuring out which way is easier a freighter right as a little bit of music maybe we could do or top for real quick though I don't think there's any suspense or it or Tom war\nMaybe Fifteen minutes going to be out there thank you but I have to say once I got Alabama one one person to\nIrish three I have a ... number for it I think they deserve that were right he was there one last [noise] doesn't mean that Michigan not far behind at number five and I even though in Georgia number six Texas is going to drop on down um and then there's this dog fight after that what do you say\nWow you you crushed cleansing the entire first hour say never played anybody put them in at number two ahead of Notre Dame\nYeah I mean I had no choice at this point why does it mean they'll finished ahead of him I think they have a better resume Notre Dame is as you said they bad you know I Do look at the margin of victory and\nGave those redeem as bothered me by a with a small margin of victory so I'm not great games either but that doesn't mean that that's always the degree to read the big deal\nIt is and it doesn't really matter I Will see where it matters is in my rankings because I have ... one [noise] I have Notre Dame too I think a combination of the winner gets Michigan wow in undefeated I think they deserve to be their number three [noise]\nI have adds up today and this will not be the same as of next week but as of right now\nI have LSU and number three you get ... whenever it doesn't mean I mean should I Do I Need to put central Florida head unless you know but that's\nWhat you do central Florida is undefeated though it's not about what they don't have the resident come on they may use that in our crushing Clemson resume saying how soft they are not going to go out and put a behind the team with one loss but\nA LSU I Would say a first of all their losses on the road to a top ten team in Florida\nAnd their quality of Windsor better\nI mean is this what did you say what do you think the BCS five is going to be what it comes out on Tuesday I think uh in the war for yes I think it'll be I Do think they'll have Notre Dame and number two because I Do know won't ...\nWho you want to bet will you quit your job as well you know I bet your lunch on that if you okay send me some uh some farm to table stuff farm to table to mail to tour as that is what we're going to do [noise]\nUh I think they'll have Notre Dame and number two in clubs in number three I Do agree\nI don't think that they will put a a one last team like head of an undefeated clubs in but I just think Ellis used body work is better\nBy the way I Know you didn't ask me number five I have Michigan although I think you could you could argue for Oklahoma they have look so good coming out of that by the last two weeks or so a lot of good teams this year Georgia's look\nGood again I get the pumped out at the match ups today and as you mentioned what was it four or five teams in the was it the top ten weren't even an action today\nYeah by ... yep go ahead and you can either was Ohio State Michigan LSU and central Florida demoted central Florida nights five of the top ... so\nWhere I went all the college football that we have you would think that even without those teams we still have a pretty good weekend but [noise] man you take away that sparked in really went downhill there was nothing for us to really high ground on other maybe Georgia Florida coming on it and\nAnd the other thing too is I Know that Florida State was bad last year but you\nUsually Florida State Clemens is one of the marquee games and obviously this year it was a total died or some of the other one's Washington state Stanford could have been good but Stanford kind of really fell off the map the last couple of weeks or with two losses in their last\nThree games coming into today and then they actually took a loss as well so I get it but I I just think look the bottom line is when an Alabama LSU Michigan and Ohio State all have a by weakening it'd be the equivalent of like the rams the chiefs the patriots and the Packers all having to buy or something you just viewed it would just feel like a weird weekend in the NFL\nAnd of course the red Sox up three games to one after eight nine six victory over the Dodgers is going to be one of those signature losses at Dodger fans are going to be talking about\nFor years to come saying man where you had them on the roads were up for nothing we're going to tie the series at two games apiece no doubt we would have one game five and went on to win the world series all of a sudden one inning won three run Homer another Homer ties up and all of a sudden it's three games to one in favor of Boston\nI absolutely think that it is a game that Dodgers fans will talk about forever for all the reasons you just mentioned Arnie I'm your head you're at home you have a chance to tie the series maybe take the lead flip the series on its head on Sunday night they lose so let me ask you this I mentioned\nDave Robert I think he's got to go you know you can't you can't let go of guys meet\nYou how you fire and some guy that what it takes a back to back World Series I said this about John for over Boston I hear a with the red Sox who took it back to back aways titles are they replaced it with corps but obviously that was a good move\nYeah I I Would say first of all that's a great example of someone that sometimes you just know and the example I was going to use ironically was a different Red Sox won remember Grady Little right gee I'm for people don't remember obviously used was two thousand three that was the Arab ... ear\nYou left in Pedro for too long Pedro Martinez\nThey end up the Yankees make this massive rally Aaron Boone hits a home run and win the game and it just felt like after that last they couldn't bring 'em back they didn't they Brian Terry friend Conan ended up winning a World Series the following year\nI just I mean how does a Dodgers fans feel confident that in the big games Dave Roberts going forward is going to be the guy even if you get back to the world series\nI think the Dodgers going to have a tough decision ahead I I can see your point Ernie I'm not going to argue with you and say you're wrong you are often but not necessarily on this one but I Am kidding but I could see the argument from Dodgers fans and I can't look at this guy I Can't watch this guy why is\nThis because that he loved one guy in two long or pulled one guy too short or you know I ... I I don't know if I'm following you because of what happened in today's game that you're based in the last two years on is that what's going on here well I think\nIt's the totality of the last couple years and and I know look people are going to say that that she is\nA you know working on behalf of of the the front office in the front office hired him because they wanted to work with somebody that really believes in the analytics I get all that but I mean when you go back to last year starting you ... fishing game seven when you have clean ... obviously it would have been on short rest but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "city": "Iowa City", "day": "28"}
