Mac he's trying to take so I could just get my guys in I'm going to build the team even though I've never built a team before and now the John Bruton experiment looks like the biggest train wreck in the NFL any worse than the giants and that's saying something\nThey gave them a hundred million dollars usually it's like oh we gave this player a hundred million dollars but you know contracts are guaranteed they gave coach hundred million dollars and now\n... outside of that contract if you said over under for John Gurdon at two years to be the coach of the Oakland Raiders I Would say under while he's at least getting them to Vegas and I think you're\nGoing to Vegas wherever they play next year still doing it and then whenever one year in Vegas is the minimum you look at this team and he made a big point to look at all the rookies on my Roswell they're still the oldest team in the late\n... guys finishing up their deals and looking to build and so when you look at Mark Davis and what the open bras is done and whatever happened with the Cooper deal all of a sudden everybody felt like they had to give Reggie McKenzie\nDoes some credit I how much he was involved I don't I don't know I don't know what to believe in terms of their the wheeling and dealing its cars to that point it at all been groomed and then it's like no no look what the kids eat he said they had to have a first from already Cooper okay she'll find you've got five for Trump picks\nThrough his career you look at an overall he's a five twenty seven for winning percentage you've got\nThree great years to in Oakland and then Tampa right where he wins a Super Bowl and then he had one moral Evan when season in two thousand five otherwise you're talking about a sub five hundred or five hundred coach pretty much every other year\nOf his NFL coach occur and that's going back to two thousand eight and then a decade in the broadcast and\nLoved the work ethic you tell me oh you want how much you work in his ass off at three forty five in the morning\nRight now you got to a locker room quite evident the fact that Derrick car feels compelled to start responding to tweets and have a big long soliloquy as I Know he he he's had a few interviews now talking about\nAll the media a firestorm over his emotion Ben Roethlisberger got asked about it whatever else so you you've got a fractured locker and you gotta lotta guys looking around wondering am I next but as we talk to Adam cap on a little while ago\nThe scouts are looking at that roster and they don't see anything of value I don't see any\nGuy they committed oh it's a fire sale yet we don't want anybody oh yeah there are already left to okay that did nothing left to pick\nOff that carcass I guess would be what you're saying at this point that doesn't mean that there isn't some master plan just a matter of do you believe in said plan given his history and the jury is most definitely out in that regard I'm curious as hell to see it five first round picks over the next few years it's got to be a lot of fun\nBut coach at all that up and making them contenders and what is already look Denver's a rat in many ways\nThey're still light years ahead of where the raiders are all they need is a competent signal color and even see them at times is functional\nYou're still falling on their own choice because he's not there and they know that that's John Elway could keep screwing up the quarterback position time and again the rest of the rosters good enough to cover up for it I Know Sunday's chargers aren't going anywhere chiefs are just getting started or the hell's grew gonna come from the\nNFL has passed him by when it comes to managing players and managing situations that's what he's not ready for\nYou to pro ball players drafted in the last Thirteen Years you tried to both\nTrying to both gosh twenty four years old you said I'll see you in L.

entirely right there\nI knew this was going to be my favorite moment of the day\n[laughter] All right well obviously it's not been the favorite moment of the playoffs for the Dodgers in Dodger\nFan guys are in LA you have to understand that yeah no I I mean Iran and markets that are loving life right now\nI Know there's many well say look here's the question is going to be with my my point is that look the Dodgers you know and you can be upset in and talked about the Roberts curious management you know saying hey we're going to start with you on the road and not at home and I'm gonna\nTake by as out when he's pitching well and bringing Alex ... home run but you know we talked to a few minutes ago bottom line the red Sox have just been better so far they gave me a bit better yeah\nYeah there there are better team I I don't you know the the the ferries will be a series if it goes six\nAnd I do think the Dodgers will take two or three in LA so that you know and then the ... the red Sox would come home up three to the question will be is already three one after four and to the Dodgers have to stave off elimination with her show\nThat could be technically his last started as a Dodger so there'll be drama there but this is not a World Series so far that has buzz\nOr joined on a controversy is not a thing like this was an interesting game ... daughters had a lead but you know price was pitching really well you know is Alex core going to blame Evan Robert forget on W. of\nMy work [laughter]\nFor all the minutes that he spent on Fort might think about that all the minutes he spent on Fort [laughter]\nIt was him over the network that motivated him who knew\nWhatever it takes ... whatever rush you to postseason greatness where do you find out how to do was motivated by the hall of justice podcast etc or ...\nYou know Linda Carter follows me on Twitter talk\nNicely done wow or ... or do they just push the release date of Wonder Woman named ... ... you you bring up going to do can I tell my story\nYou have a ... okay sure you've got just ... I've lost it for the rest of the night if you had some really around\nHere who is really accent and she can't do anything other accents so in Wonder Woman what they did was they had all the Amazon's have an Israeli accent so it all founded the fate that as my Hebrew school fantasy\nOf all I needed\nWith God can do to save ... Shaw because that's what they told me in Hebrew school all the time Justin right now if he was in the studio will be falling out of his chair\nWell did did you wait it now I Would believe you if that translated to Mr ever please sit down and we're ready to begin ... sit\nDown and shut up oh that sounds about right now we're going to go bad habit right there you guys that I'm\nSure heard that one uh with some regularity but you know yesterday we we at least had a little bit of a hand wringing moment in terms of David Robertson analytics in bullpen management here it just looks at you bring in rye imagine and and you walk in the tying run ...\nYeah look I didn't I didn't have the only thing that this is something for the saber metric debate which is you know when you're using and pitch counts and things like that you have to define what a stressful and ...\nAnd if you looked at the first four innings in game one every inning was stressful there were two men on for both teams I think every happy ending of the first four\nAnd that's a real stress ... today wasn't like that because they had to pay to it they had a rhythm to it that was a very different game\nAnd yesterday I thought everything was stressful and that's why you couldn't expect any more out of either starter plus I don't even think either starters a hundred percent\nSo when David Roberts has faced with five innings against the light up like that he went the way he thought he was going to do he was damned if he does damned if he doesn't\n... with us long time baseball inside of the Jason Smith show with ... are you speaking of pitching we watch David Price that the second good sort of in the play on some of his career are you buying into these turned the corner\nYou enough or the network that wasn't from you\nKnow we have to go back to David Price list you brought up pitching endemic lays the smartest\nGuy on the field that there's two things about him that I I Love to report he is the smartest guy on the field and he's the first guy in the clubhouse and these last got to leave the guys\nWorking ... when I got ya you when you were the ... yeah they do list and\nLive tacos um Fifteen tonight to that's all I think the idea\nThat David Price would be bad is that dumbfounded thing because he knows so much about pitching he is such a smart guy and I have never hesitated to say that I never liked him in a Red Sox uniform\nIs the first time I think he's felt comfortable wearing those colors and\nIt's amazing to me because don't forget when he pitched game five in Houston up three one there's no pressure in the world on him there's a lot of pressure on them today because they know that if the Dodgers got split today they go back home for three that whole World Series changes\nAnd this so this was a vital game for the red Sox I did not think it was a\nVital game for the doctor said he wanted as the Dodgers come back home if they take two or three they're down three to go into effect\nIf they can manage to win all three at home there are there on served that just come back to ... you know a three to go back to Fenway\nIt was the group's Eighteenth south forty hitter but its first

the red Sox have scored half mayor runs this postseason\nThirty two out of their sixty four runs with two outs including three of them that they got tonight fifty\nPercent of their runs they are driving in with two outs what they're doing with runners are scoring position sometimes it doesn't matter if you hit forty homeruns knocking hundred and thirty runs sometimes you can be a guide was Seventeen runs sixty five RBI says to sixty but your one hit of the night is going to be a baby sit with two outs in the seventh\nThere's playing clutch and there's the what the Red Sox are doing and

Kim role to come in and finish it out you're not\nDrawing watching not adding to the pitch counts I mean that was the thing with prices you'd extended him back to back any you've gotten some pretty heavy work out of him and then you you let him let 'em off with a very quick inning and he's able to extend and finish six strong\nThey looked like he was going to be chased him the fourth\nMaybe you get to the bullpen a little bit earlier maybe that's the difference either way the bats have gone silent and it's one or two defensive plays one or two lapses that are making up for it and you look at polite I don't know what David Roberts has in mind for what the analytic saved for game three but\nI can tell your Dodger fans and anybody that watch the series have to wonder how you Karen end is find his way back into the line\nKnow and and the other thing too is is that look you make a good point about the red Sox bullpen because you know earlier this week I've been filling in on AM five Seventy LA sports Dodgers flagship station\nHere in LA and I said look when we're talking about the biggest X factors for the world series I said the biggest X factor for the red Sox is their bullpen this was coming into the playoffs the worst bullpen in all the teams who qualify if you're right I'm sure it wasn't even close yeah they were that bad and suddenly\nThey became great they shut down the Yankees and you want to say OK was kind of uncharacteristic of the Yankees to not hit for two games in Yankee Stadium it okay we can we can do that by the wayside then the bullpen comes they take care of the Astros and you go\nOkay the as the other both but I I mean eyebrows to raise your come the Dodgers they lead ... home runs and\nWhat are we seeing so far all of a sudden\nThe red Sox bullpen can do no wrong you guys coming out of the pen throwing a hundred miles an hour yet Kelly yeah how do you have all the you had kimbrell and none of them are having trouble at all with this Dodger lineup out the best thing you can say for the world series with the Dodgers okay\nThings change you go back home it's not nearly as cold\nAs it was going to be the red Sox are going to lose a big bad out of their line up and do you think the Dodgers can gain some footing and went to out of the next three games in the world series so you said but still to this point that's really been something that you're gonna have to solve if they don't solve the red Sox bullpen they're not going to win a game\nI mean some point they got to find somewhere to crack and they can't\nBecause that's really the big because for the red Sox nobody is heading out when you get outside of the number for battering the lineup but what's everybody hitting you know what what are the first three batters in the lineup hitting they're heading for the series they're eating five hundred five hundred\nAnd four twenty nine right you've got three of the force three of the Ford first batters\nThe three of the
