one of the other oh the the the moustache\nAnd then we hear that there was a fight between Kelly and Corey Corey Lewandowski\nOver something\nSomething's wrong inside the picture because General Kelly

Constantine originally beat back a raid of the guts the guys you know about ... you know what I mean the gods with black makeup and San Francisco they beat Baca right of the gods\nWho are trying to come in from the Balkans but he didn't have the will or the power of the government behind them to protect the frontier across the down you why he was too busy he was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation\nWhy he was too busy he was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation of a weakened empire from within and invasion from without you following this\nIt's a very big story to take me a couple of hours to go into but I'll summarize it for you in a in a thumbnail sketch because what happened was\nConstantine did the best they could but then he died trying to reorganize Rome and what happened right after he passed was the borders of Rome working ruptured and the visit God's invaded almost the Constantinople\nThey defeated the emperor of el ends at address poll they built the settlement in Bulgaria and from eighty seven three seven nine to three Ninety five there came the emperor or the uh do see us the great and he was a ... a formidable ... emperor up\nAnd over the armies of Italy and only a presided ... he was a van dull\nAnd he presided over the army's in the Balkans peninsula lark a God and I could go on and on and I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to bore your history has to bore me as a kid but the more I study these things I realized that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways\nWhich is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay as was ancient Rome at a nation being pressed on its borders by armies from without as we are seeing in ... in black and white and every color imaginable on our borders\nWere being pressed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after ... marched into Italy and after a short sheets took ... for ten Rome fell apart and what happened after um collapsed did life go on for the average Roman listened carefully\nThe opening half from the fifth century this was remember hundreds of years later\nYou saw the entire Roman Empire in Europe become prey to Robert armies of barbarians does that not sound like gangs\nListen to what I understand this that area is outrageous some history as the Roman emperor empire in Europe collapses in the ... century robber armies are barbarians were praying on the Romans citizen\nThink about that\nThink about what you're seeing in America today\nThe ... century robber armies are barbarians were praying on the Romans citizen\nThink about that\nThink about what you're seeing in America today where we as middle class citizens\nWe lock our doors we lock our cars we have alarm systems we carry guns many of us\nThink about this why you know you walk around a suburban neighborhood and look at every house they have an alarm system I'm not going into an ad every house has an alarm system every house is fortified like a little for\nBecause people realized that at night somebody could break in a while they're away at work paying the taxes for the illegal aliens to enjoy their lives or something like a break and\nSo they protect themselves because right now we have the equivalent of rubber armies going around the country I Know it sounds\nRather hysterical but it isn't it's out of the ... is rather accurate if you actually read the crime there was as I Do and look at the data as opposed to the fake data put out by the fake media by those in the fake news business\nSo\nCould tell you what went on in the life of the countryside half the room was invaded and what happened to the nation their roads and forests became infested with robbers\nThe barbarians went into the forests stop right there you're in California the barbarians have almost destroyed our entire ecosystem\nThe barbarians who've been raising marijuana in the ... national forest these pristine beautiful ancient forests have almost been destroyed by drug drug cartels or raising marijuana\nNot only drug cartels we have indigenous criminals who have been destroying our ecosystem what's ironic to me as all these green left us who care so much about the environment have said nothing\nAs are sacred and pristine streams and waterways had been destroyed with toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers in our very national forest not one more from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the man who spends all this time conniving to hate Trump\nConniving to bring in more illegal aliens\nSays nothing about the army's that have destroyed our ecosystems and on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these plants and the waste is going into the streams and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nPlants and the waste is going into the streams and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to

Mariel boat invasion of Miami in the early eighties and I'm asking\nThat Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador empty their prisons and they're not houses [noise] it's a rational question that needs to be asked and answered\nAnd I'm asking that Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador empty their prisons and then not houses it's a rational question that needs to be asked and answered I'm not going to rely upon politicians to answer anything I'm not relying upon the fake news to answer anything\nI'm going to rely upon the Savage Nation 'cause I had a call yesterday\nWho was an undercover DEA producer who told me what's going on on the border by the way if you hear my poor dog coughing in the background that as the mascot in a Savage Nation little chatty he just came back he's Fifteen Years old been with us from the beginning if you remember he was on stage with me at the chronicle pavilion when he was a little black\nPoodle and uh he has his issues what he's doing fine just came from the vet and she did an X ray and he has no fluid on his lungs and no sign of anything see just getting older like you\nAnd that's it so that's what is life goes on so America's getting older and the older people in America are losing their will to live\nAnd they don't know what to do they came out to the polls in the last election with one last hope that one last candidate who was not a politician would save the country\nAnd thus far they're not sure what's going on they love the rallies they loved the speeches they like many of the policies they thank God the truck that Trump is there and she is not there but they don't know why he's not doing anything more visual for them with regard to the border\n[noise] they don't know why it's one thing that give a speech with Ted Cruz and inspire people that's very important but I think the next thing you need to follow it up with some action biggest each day that we lose is it that we can't replace\nIf you'll see an army coming what is a general do let us put it in military terms with or without weapons you see an army marching towards your frontier\nWhat does it general ... what are you taught military academy you sit there and give speeches or you'll line up your troops you build fortifications you build barricade what do you do when you see an army coming to you see a border\nYou can't just when I get through your way through this the whole world is watching\nAnd the entire nation and our future is on the line I Know you've heard this before but this is so clear to me now I've tried to visualize this for many of you in some of you got it that's why I'm Still successfully after twenty five years in radio while you're still make my books best sellers and thank you for doing that would stop mass hysteria without any promotion whatsoever\nExcept on this program and very very little else do you see of the most prominent conservative writer in America right\nCourse I thank you for doing that would stop mass hysteria without any promotion whatsoever\nExcept on this program and very very little else do you see of the most prominent conservative writer in America right on me but you don't see me because I don't have a TV shows you got to understand that people do listen to this program and we're very important and the government then in the world and my ideas on that last they listen to but then I think after the fall asleep right now\nThat's good enough that I helped elect Donald Trump now we need to help Donald Trump protect us from the invasion to the new Mariel boat in Beijing whether it is or not I don't know what would you do to stop this mass of humanity coming to our borders\n[noise]\n\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and bingo surprise you hit

man of action they say you know that's a good idea let's do it that's how we would work\nHe would work but see if I was with it but I'm not invited I'm not invited because I'm not part of the Fox news gang and it seems to me right now only Fox News people are being listened to particularly that educated genius uh\nPart of the Fox news gang\nAnd it seems to me right now only Fox News people are being listened to\nParticularly that educated genius of who speaks to them twice a day and advisors and everything probably advisors on things we can't even imagine given his lack of education they probably are considered even smarter than people who actually study these things\nGiven his lack of international knowledge he's probably considered a bit of diplomats and train diplomats given his lack of the use of even the English language properly probably considered a better linguist than linguists\nSo I I wouldn't doubt that um it would be received with\nWith a very ... very keen interest by their president be actually heard it\nBut ever since they put pockmarked in there I don't know but since ... went in there I don't know that anything I say is being heard that was the last straw I mean once they put ... in there it was all over how can you take people from one network and use them in your administrator and exclusively did Obama ever do anything like that\nYou know I'm a ... a very sensitive issue right now in the middle of all of this is not even personal it's worrisome to me what if Obama had hired the former director of I don't know CNN let's say let's take CNN what if we woke up and said oh she Obama's talking to a Wolf Blitzer every night twice tonight on telephone\nAnd Wolf Blitzer is the only one advise them if this went on for years let's say a whole year on them or that and then the guy who was fired from CNN I met imaginary uh guys fired from CNN has no job the next thing you know he's communications director for Obama tell me what tongues would be wagging on the conservative side like all\nSo how can you sort of thing you can't be blind to what the other side is seeing if you are then you're going to lose and this is what's worrisome to me is I think that not only way we the core base of this whole thing\nWe the people the core base of the whole thing I think we've become blind to the other side we may think we know what they think but I don't think we do and then if we were blind to what they're saying about us them were really in trouble\nThat's why I have to be the independent I Am and that's why I sometimes a great many of you people who wear the hats forwards or backwards it upside down even on Sundays\nBecause you don't understand what it means to be an independent commentator in this country because so few of us exist there are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean it means I have to be critical times even up demand that\nCommentator in this country because so few of us exist there are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean it means I have to be critical times even of the man that I admire so much and who I back it's that simple [noise] if you have a family member who you think is making a mistake\nSocially or economically or in business\nAnd he said wait a minute that's not a good idea Johnny can't do that because here's what's gonna happen that's family isn't it family don't families disagree with each other whereas this blind loyalty this idea blind loyalty coming from\nThat's not the world I grew up in I grew up in a world of free thinking and vigorous debate\n... actually a very American idea [laughter] free thinking and vigorous debate those all the way back to the founding fathers it goes back to the constitution of the bill of rights free thinking and vigorous debate but seems to have gone out the window right now people have circle the wagons it's like wait a minute don't you dare talk to the Indians\nYou know what I'm saying that's what it's come down to stay here stay here in the inner circle in the kind of struggle wagons I used to call them Calistoga wagons but the ... circle then all of us wearing hats after stand in the middle and we have to wait for the flaming arrows flying over the tops of the wagons\nI don't see the world that way I don't quite see it in those terms\nAnd I still think it's good to have a dialogue with your opponents otherwise\nYou'll get increasing tension anger and rage hatred hostility leading to a total of breakdown of the society which is the last thing we need bravo Michael thank you very much I just applauded for myself and my own head because that's what we need to hear more about we didn't have more people saying what I just said\nLike give peace a chance you know what I'm saying like let's play a little beetles music together give peace a chance let\nCertainly listen to the other side not the ones who were pushing and shoving hit them back hotter as my position\nShe I say if we go low and they kick us kick them even harder kick them into the gutter it's that simple we go low they kick us and I got to kick them how to kick them into the gutter that's number one but if there are people that wanna rationally discussion discuss things that's what I'm saying we should do\nAnd I would hope that the other side still has some rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something missed the liberal from San Francisco are you telling me you really want another choice\nSome rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something Mr liberal from San Francisco are you telling me you really want another twenty thousand or so mainly young men strapping strong young men\nFrom the Central America that come into this country right now do you think that would actually say yes\nYou think that the city of San Francisco so liberal you'd be mistaken if you actually spoke to many of the middle class working people I mean professionals they may have money\nThere may have property new cars families you think they really don't know what's being done in the city you think they like stepping over human trash you think that they like seeing that windows broken down on their cars when they go to a restaurant\nYou think they like seeing them as managing the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption in the construction industry here or that van that's avenue is so broken up due to contract corruption that stores are going out of business you'd think they don't say this\nThey don't see if they do see it and they say to me with a few times I run into and talk to them is I Can't say anything because most of my customers are liberals and they wouldn't patronize they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nAnd no none of them want the illegals here\nNone of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country an screens on vetted some of whom are very dangerous some of whom may be diseased\nAnd certainly the social service systems which already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good old San Francisco want more of them that would be a complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you so I'm going to open up to one or two calls here on the Savage Nation\nRemember my solution I didn't say force to stop the world's biggest uh I have a bit of the Confucius I'm a

prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence\nFor over a decade money and just say Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush to joke we don't know who did it we have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been tone deaf and silent to what has been unfolding now in this country\nWell it's so hypocritical the same people that have been tone deaf and silent to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nHow many women have been confronted and restaurants movie theaters how many times as this happened with you know the chanting in the restaurants with with politicians in their wives even this weekend with McConnell happened twice the Ted Cruz over a conspiracy\nTV MSNBC there just despicable insinuating lives suspicious packages can be tied back to the Trump himself and that the intended recipients have all been criticized by the president\nYou've got to be kidding me\nIs this how twisted let's just take the rhetoric of of who they are everyday approach will just last night alone I played a bunch of tapes of you know lower thirds of the president he's a liar\nHe says is he's a lawyer fraud this\nI'm Sorry the president flat out lie same Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election it gets hotter lie he changes his story again and so if we're going to get sort of eventually the president thinks you're stupid things people are stupid\nClear officially and parents and in fact France on\nPresident Trump tries to play to his ways with also\nNot even trying to hide his lights in the morning just putting all out there he's writing a lot of lines about non why is this\nAll you hear every single day from the mainstream media\nLies about why look look this is every election season you get it that we did have an\nIncident if you recall when Steve school eastern others the shooting took place on the ball field\nAnd I actually I remember saying and I asked my step to go back and find out what did I say when we found out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting that nearly killed Steve's college was Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said\nNow I Am I'm not going to do with the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but his most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him there so it's Ryan McCarthy ... right and this individual this assailant that we are now getting the information on that you're just shared [noise]\nRight and I believe him there so it's drying McCarthy ... right and this individual this assailant that we are now getting the information on that you've just shared\nBy his own and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because he was the Sanders supporters suppose but what they want but you know what that they do it I don't blink Bernie Sanders of course not they would say would blame us yes of course I have to do what\nI Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh and the radio and then Oklahoma City bombing and you know they got out there were made him up and over and say\nWell this is because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric that they can get away with it and they get a free pass nobody doesn't matter if they do it so here's what you have today right here in Washington DC\nBut attempted assassination I Hope it's not and I'm praying that you know he's in as we know Shawn he isn't very serious very very critical supported earlier that he was upgraded a critical condition and upgraded from critical to good but he's been critical what they said well he was in\nStable yeah the stable condition I get into what I did back where he can't blame Bernie for that\nNor can you blame any conservative but we don't know what the motivation is just it's all ... and now it's being used as a political weapon to bludgeon talk radio Fox and Trump it's just outrageous\n'cause that's not who we are where are you know what did I say yesterday about George Soros I won't play it again now but I said hey not this has to stop George Soros spent as millions of dollars paying groups to get me off the air\nWe that's not how we settled political differences\nYou know when the sun is out there apparently blaming Donald Trump Donald Trump is not responsible for packages that might have bombs and anthrax or\nRice in in it it's ridiculous\nYou don't see why you know let me play Hillary Clinton today and Hillary Clinton just what a week ago let's put this compare\nWhere they are not ... political party that wants to try\nTo stand for what you care about her only from the Republican whom to\nRecognize armored train\nTime in a deep divisions\nAnd we have to have to do everything we think we can bring our country to get together\nTo but we weren't supposed to be several

governor of New York you know we must be simple where Americans All right that's not what he was saying in a while back when he talked about conservatives that live in New York people like me listen\nComplements me and it stems streaming right\nWas that there are actually the extreme conservative state of New York city and I don't know where you're\nAt the end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans he pluribus unum out of many one and keeping the faith and the dialogue civil\nLaw says is very very important for elected leaders who in many ways that tone this specially important\nHouse did not New Yorkers there's no place in the state of New York it'd be a pro life pro Second Amendment I happen\nTo be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it I Want to tell you a little story so I had this group and and window\nLived through this and window you know we're still very great friends with police who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things were really proud of them are unhappy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yep we just saw\nUm it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office of Fox right\nUh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over and the sad thing is when she was in isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even though it was just horrible for her and she was cordoned\nOff we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us than we couldn't see her because they didn't know for the anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN's reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I'm Linda\nA scale of one to tend the anthrax incident being a one how ...\nRight for the people over CNN Today I've lived through\nThis and I and Linda\nOn a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about I mean you know we got ten that threat today via letter yeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWho's going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and I picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about\nChasing people at restaurants and attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nFor shows up at your house or spent on you or threatened view of war follows you I have had to them all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we gotta keep up our politicians have whoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative wants anything to do with\nBut this rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible by immediate that China exploited for political gain when it is a serious significant threat they said well the president says fake news\nOr they aren't fake news you know truth is the words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to do that to sound incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable they uh ... how

to become violence\nIs outrageous what they do they do this every time they'd been their silence has been deafening in recent months in days or anyway Sean Spicer\nIt's outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been deafening in recent months in days or anyway Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action\nAlso former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris Kobach is back with us and uh he has penned a piece on them my ... is the elected\nSecretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration and uh by the way it's been very successful at what he's doing and uh and\nUh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas who was a big win that you pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of Kansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you'd be a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated\nUnwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately um but if they and for weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush ... across that border as in as one we don't have any problem of choice we will have to arrest them\nThat will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more state denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens meanwhile you got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more benefits or if it's a federal and state response or the fed to build the wall and states have to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich cater to the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric throw it in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but\nTalk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government that they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling or incapable of doing so ah what should America's response be well\nI think America's response to the fact that the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country why they're coming in\nSponsors exactly what the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons or to either harm us or this day you know but there's a variety in the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official to protect his people in the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said that the other day that so much on I Want to be clear your agree with me I Know\nChrist will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump don't temp temp because he's warned them African government he's warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening\nUm and I I guess I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse course\nLet me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I and I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people people that don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families\nI Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody ...\nNobody can vouch for anybody and it would be unfair and a massive risks to the American people\nTo allow people in ... no idea what their their point of view of world view happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWill and that's ... that's a very good point you know in the there's abundant\nEvidence of terrorists using the traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border to get into the United states\nGoing all the way back to before nine eleven ah people from countries where al ... was active allow countries where I suspect tactics have used this this flow this migrant flow to blend in there's no question that that will be the case again the only thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is\nI think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there in the third stage of open borders psychosis just\nFollow this for a moment in the nineties but Democrats are were pro enforcement Bill Clinton\nOf here there in the third stage of open borders psychosis just follow this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats are were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here legally then in the two thousands they became pro amnesty and they no longer want it to the port they wanted to grant amnesty ... million plus year\nNow they're taking the position that we weren't there cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous ... people before they're even here to become unlawfully present in the United states\nAnd when you play and what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\nIs let me switch gears to these packages the president said he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror\nHe said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages at appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down in full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em spoke before that show and we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd wondering what have we seen we've been witnessing Saturday I talked to\nOne quick point before and they cause I think you're making an excellent point but one last thing it only takes one\nAnd that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have Ninety

so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I consider myself I was a Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia has been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist and a bigot and\nHomophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and his followers or no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job fearing people making people believe these stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people can vote for for this monster and on one particular day I posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody reached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation\nAnd what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back\nTen years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice and that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation\nHis that this is a a voice in a bit but Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid and our son but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really\nRealize that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do is news or the truth brand\nAnd let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... experiences myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that wants to see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women\nYou know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened but they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running\nSuddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that a conservative more support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'll be giving your best shot\nYou know I noticed it either happens to a guy with his wife for\nOr an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist sexist massage in is that there are homophobic dino phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama used\nOther Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is that they're a homo phobic dino phobic Islamophobia that they want dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike drone granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's\nWhat they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true\nThere's not one thing that is true about that look look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think that most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're\nSeeing so called him and how many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty on the rest of the ... all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey're telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this was forming like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson who's we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a
