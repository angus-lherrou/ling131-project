you name it\nBut if I if I really can't if I don't really feel good I play classical music because it humbled me to the point where I Am a breakdown inside saying that's impossible at a human being could have lived on this Earth like Mozart and had a brain that was like that that could conceive music like that\nTo me it's as ... as close as you're ever going to get to God and it goes back to the fact that there are differences between people and unfortunately for us we're living in a time where everyone thinks they're equal to everyone else because of social media that's the tragic truth\nIf you saw the kind of idiots who are on Twitter or on Facebook will comment on things they do nothing about but because they can fire up a one liner suddenly they're equal to the greatest scientist on earth in fact they're better\nAnd this is the problem with social media you could say it's very democratic and it levels the playing field no the opposite is true they haven't qualified to comment at all it's like having a moron in the classroom let's say if you're a teacher and having an idiot in the back who keeps interrupting you\nAnd makes the clash pay attention to him because he's got a big

let's be clear\nIt's a different story with the park is you get a chance to expound in a little more depth with a little more you know inside\nIf you get that chance but anyway I'm not complaining I'm

a FM acute flashing my light is which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating\nThis increasing they up to him which begins twenty fourteen but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC I'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know what kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean pay for if you don't get out of there what do you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses\nSo every every article says the causes of a of them are still unclear\nIt's unclear we don't know anything\nBut it's thought today if I may be a communicable disease really well as one link oh in maybe a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses that viruses West Nile virus may even cause a FM we're the west Nile virus come from west dial it doesn't say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from or where you can pretty much see what I'm going with this right\nWell you understand what I what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came here a great grandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading it into the healthy population well those are antiquated ideas\nYou can quarantine anyone them I don't want this these they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population\nIs an increased risk of diseases\nLike this from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a disease pressure then your country I common sense if you have a house or apartment we let someone with a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably sleep with a person with a communicable disease to show the good life just they were they ... a kiss them on the lips the show with good good people they are that's how sick they are\nBut if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying to you there's a relationship\nBetween some immigrants from some countries on some diseases and if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union member I told you run into a woman last week and then just walking around them all such from Hungary yesterday shocking when she said this to me she said I come from\nThen you're not living in the Soviet Union member I told you I ran into a woman last week and then just walking around them all centers from Hungary here so shocking when she said this to me she said I come from the ex Soviet Union and she said\nPeople are more afraid to express themselves politically in America than they were in my country under the Soviet ... under Soviet rule I was stunned by it you are more afraid to express yourself at home or at work than the Soviets were under under under Stalin\nAnd I put that on the radio two weeks ago and I woke up and it was an article just the other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because of the insane communist laughed\nThey're afraid to say one word at work for free they'll be fired\nAfraid to say anything about anything so you're now a prisoner\nIn more feared the ... the Soviet era in America today\nYeah okay well what can you do it's just one man one man against the world shoveling against the tide is very very difficult odd see\nI write the book stop mass hysteria America's and sadly from the sandwich shops the Trump which on its it's doing well but not great it's not doing as good as the comic books and the comic books\nNot as good as the comic books on the left in the comic books on the right people want simple books and simple ideas they don't want to read they don't want to think they don't want to history all they want a polemic ...\nI'm not complaining it's the marketplace let the marketplace determine there's nothing I can do about it\nI tried something new I went from politics to a history people were not really ...

that wasn't the reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it\nThere's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership of stations do you understand that I don't own the stations they could run Mickey Mouse playing 'cause you if they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was and we're not going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse or they can do\nWell and you can say what do you want but you don't have any control over it it doesn't matter if the show loses money doesn't matter and all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when they get they're gearing up ready for the presidential election\nSo the only reason you listen to me at all is why well you figure this guy's a little different sometimes it comes down on this

extra clear it's like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not\nTake a call I got this one of these days I don't know why it's so good\nI Know why I feel good extra extra clear it's like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not a psychologist I knew one guy was in it early on back in Queens he went into it one of the nuts and the crowd he was like one of the biggest already made a fortune became a top guy and sign that I was surprised it went so high up in this thing\nBut he wasn't like kids Eighteen everyone's trying to find himself he became a Scientology I'm Talking ... like in the sixties\nAnd I'll wake up and ... and he's like one of the chief goal Rosen Scientology movement but I remember the guy to a certain things they said they were really good like about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid\nAnd they try to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me\nReally helped my migraines and self cured was reading Georgia showers and macro buyout accent I went on to the ten stage diet\nOf elimination I was Eighteen years old and on my own I found out which which food\nTypes triggered by migraines and I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out with its my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn too fast and burn out that I think that's great feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states have health that you could never even believe were were possible\nBut and hears that bought\nMost of us have lost contact with the signals we don't want to hear them we we've eliminated them\nAnd we put ... or whatever what he would do so I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message [laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know I don't want don't drink that rockets not good for you today whatever but I I listen to merge close relationship and\nSo I took his andme acrobatic diet didn't elimination sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer and\nHeart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want people do crazy things today based on science so the reason I'm

hair and you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy and become not so good looking and you're middle aged man while I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy I was like and not known as handsome I was okay\nI had my share of fun but what I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing on any no education and no no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and look like I'm Lou Costello\nIn order to to cover up to the thinning hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young and you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the whole ... manhunt thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean

everything some people are in doubt mentally somewhere in doubt physically someone that I Would vote someone that I Would nothing that's the human condition what are you gonna do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving based on what you're good looks you're a good guy looks and you had asked us to stay in your face starts to look like Jerry Lewis after it tell us on a in the

enough that doesn't mean the book is not valid you can go out today and do an Amazon related book or on the ... the other services and they'll they'll Britain publishing promote your book for you\nAnd you don't have to show that many copies to get some attention and then the then part of it is a good part if the book takes off on its own you can then go to a publisher and say look I sold twenty

through that service as well by buying some ads and what happens is people will read it if they like it\nYou'll get noticed and then it'll sell and then you go to a publisher at that point where the

people just aren't ready for it I'll give an example as ... as successful as I Am\nWith my commercial books stop mass hysteria being example number one right now going back God faith and reason Trump's war and the other stop becoming civil war you name it\nI self published on Kendall a couple of books last year including xenon actually and I went I actually think it's the greatest work of genius I've ever written\nIt's hasn't sold more than a couple of hundred copies it actually makes me happy to understand that the book is so far ahead of time in that it's not popular enough for the times I had publishes look at it they they were terrified of it because it shows a post feminist world that's act\nAbsolutely indicative of where we are going especially after the Kavanaugh hearings if you're talking about a mass killing men that was about a physical reality rather than a a psychological reality so having a soul but it doesn't turn me for thinking it's one of my best

the secretary of state Mike Pompeo was I think is one of our best you know said that he told the president gave the Saudis another day or two so we can get to the truth don't rush to judgment but it's beginning to look like they killed the sky\nAnd probably the only way they got 'em out wisdom pieces bits and pieces that means they chop them up and that the I think turkey and hairdo on probably has some evidence because you know they would probably have wire the Saudi embassy\nAnd I'm thinking there's no way that happens without the crown prince knowing that's what my gut tells me now\nYou say Hannity well you don't know\nAnd I'm saying you're right I'm I'm whole withholding judgment but that's my guess where we're headed with this\nAnd I'm watching Democrats because they think they've got

has\nBut here's what's frustrating to me all through the election and twenty sixteen on this program I sat here and I told you how much money Hillary Clinton took from all of these countries the

took millions and millions and tens and tens of millions from these countries for their foundations and guess who we never heard ever criticize any of the policies\nThat treat women horribly gays and lesbians horribly Christians and Jews horribly Hillary Clinton\nThey bought her silence nobody ever talked about it I think put me\nAnd it's the same with the immigration side of the equation I don't if you grow up in that culture that abuses women\nThat is the antithesis of our constitutional republic I'm Sorry we need to know that you will reject those values that are the antithesis of the

making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people that Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took\nWant to pressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people\nThat Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis she never brought up their horrific treatment of women killing gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in Saudi Arabia\nUm and the same would go for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what are you what do you think that's\nWhy I think I mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious\nOr do you indicate clothes that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on and that I I think there will be very foolish\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key\nTo containing Iran or what but I think we have to get to the bottom of the Columbia also point out to vote oh I'm just now of working on a novel for next year called collusion and watch the Russians are decide they want to poison the U.S Senate\nOr if I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed\nAnd circumstances are just strange that they're going to kill him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul knowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time\nThey're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um it's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them on their sloppy and stupid and you know a ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies\nAnd you're right we have this unprecedented alliance against the Iranian had Gemini with the Saudis Israelis Emirates Jordanians and Egyptians and you know now that creates massive complications\nPlowing but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain and to lead to very specific sanctions\nOr I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming and there's the Saudis have at least ... secretary of state Pompeo because if they are going to give him the full report out again or they may well be lying but here in the end oh we\nLeast promised secretary of state compel because if they are going to give him the full report out but yeah uh they may well be lying but\nYou know in the end oh we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia involved I suspect it will be sanctions but that's different is one thing that sanctions and it's another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear\nThat they regard Saudi Arabia has such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful and this process\nWe got to go but I'm Mr Speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi ism\nSense right now and I think sometimes you just said you know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British\nOver killing ... trying to poison several people but we didn't we didn't go ... I think we may have to take significant steps ear and sanctioned some people and blocks some people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly the crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nI missed the bigger thank you for being with us we got to take a break by David shown and Carter Page will join us as the deep state ... gets a little deeper eh my buddies de do see we're going to get a lot of your calls that we have the other news of the day and what do we do about the caravan Nineteen days out of election day\nHow many parents angel moms have we put on this program and angel dads on this program and they tell the stories about illegal immigrants that were in the justice system that were let out on the street because they were in a sanctuary city\nNow the sanctuary state of California with a with a sanctuary state free health care for all legal or illegal candidate Gavin Newsom out there in California they talk about ...

Penn when she was a I guess teaching their road this this was a disc for her was a calling card or the\n... and remember Shawn you go back to a a month ago before she imploded like this\nUh you know the the mainstream media regarded her as perhaps the one democratic standard bearer who could at her age with her stance take on a lot of the Bernie Sanders positions up and and she was a senator and she was relatively young\nAnd and then she does this so now in the past week essentially the mainstream media kind of turned on her it's like they they called her up that was a dumb idea why because they want to find somebody who is a viable alternative to Donald Trump\nAnd they can win and with this kind of baggage she's not going in place\nWhat do you think as you look at and we look at polls every day and I watch Fox and friends and I watch you guys you do a great show you the number one new show on cable news by far in your hour and you have been for years and then like me you've almost been there from the beginning not quiet went up ... how many years that you've been on the air and Fox\nI actually started two weeks after we went over there\nSee I have two weeks seniority on used\nThat oh I I don't you know Rick regarding the current congressional races\nI happen to know a America's favorite political correspondent Peter do see who is at this minute I\nBelieve the way I used to let me interrupt here you've got to be so proud of that kid he not only is they are great great kid that I've gotten to know and yeah he's been on my show many times in a great reporter I mean he's a you've got to be so proud of that\nShowing you've known him since he was can I Know\nAnd I know and yeah he's been on my show many times in a great reporter I mean he's a you've got to be so proud\nOf that showing you've known him since he was can I Know it's crazy crazy it is crazy but a ... like his mother [laughter]\nHe's got his mother's hair I'll just say that I'm Peter told me that he was a you know he's following the elections very carefully and he's got a sources on both sides of the ... one of the guys who is in charge of buying the ads for the Republicans in Washington DC said that over the last two weeks they have seen a essentially\nA five point bump across the board for Republicans and they're basing that they they attributed to Kavanaugh\nThey attributed to taxes and they attributed to immigration\nAnd so given the fact that uh the enthusiasm level is higher and both suddenly the Republicans are spiking\nAt exactly the right time the big question is and I know a Newt Gingrich I think he resigned with us like you said the election comes down to two things Kavanaugh and the care of in in the Caribbean and of course of course of action by the United states hey Mexico do something about this or we're gonna have to put troops on our southern border and shut it down\nWell I think the caravan is it really does highlight the case here and\nI got to tell you something the way the Democrats abandon I mean when you become the party\nOf all we want to raise taxes we want to open borders we want Obamacare we want to impede Trump a and I'm telling you if this is not the gender that's going to work and in hiding who you really are which is another problem but what lives in the book is phenomenal what what was the recipe you Brian and ...\n... see the the cookbook is all about foods and make you happy and use utilize your uh Hannity's corn beef and cabbage because it reminds me of when you were a kid\nAnd you have children and it's my ... you know like ... ... it was so full of it but [laughter]\nUh Brian's who takes him back is his mom's meatballs ... is her mom's a chicken demand we've got a Sarah Huckabee Sanders pecan pie remember the famous pie last year people said that's\nKind of humor they totally you know that she really does but her secret oneself Iran but she ah she crushes them with a hammer which is appropriate I remind you of my mind is my mom's pot roast bomb powder all that's real issues\nSteve do see I saw your cooking one morning thank you for being with us said hundred nine four one Sean is our number listen if you're like Linda and let's say you're Twenty years old and you're taking a vacation of uh\nSteve do see I started cooking up one morning thank you for being with us said hundred for one showing us our number listen if you're like Linda and let's say you're Twenty years old and you're taking a vacation I'm a lifetime and you're in Mexico and you kind of a little bit hammered you might be a little bit of ... and", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott", "day": "18"}
