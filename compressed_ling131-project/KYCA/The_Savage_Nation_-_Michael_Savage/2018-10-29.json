but it was his administration if it were Trump handing kids over to people that use them as slaves on a chicken ranch in Ohio which is what happened during Obama with kids living in a in a chicken shack with a bucket as a bathroom\nBecause the Obama people handed him over to the flavors\nAnd there are literally slave labor\nIn Ohio the children that were handed over by Obama and that story just got nothing nothing because I don't care about children they don't care about human life they don't care about slavery they don't care about the sexual abuse of children and their documented cases of\nThe Obama people handing children over to people who are not their guardians who than a serial a sexually abused them but you know let's not get all caught up in that so that we as was watching

pressing the Israeli ambassador germ are to blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten you know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political violence no he's not\nBut I guess it's an easy blame game so now we've\nTaken the predictable every two four years Republicans are racist and sexist a massage therapist and Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff and now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true\nAnd it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue he was a very ill and anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop

everybody I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman and Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor in that state\nTo the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor in that state in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in mid term election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen T. one by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in mid term election work turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to as few as twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelicals are pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got an email about half of them are we\nWe have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they vote or not and then we can follow up with more phones or email us more tax and more door not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the houses\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tipped the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and\nMinnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power but then I say that and then I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on in a daze in any one of them could tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right now we really see how it on the bubble we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now\nA hundred seats in play and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had all stop up\nYou know two three four five and he lost by four it's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers in the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do art\nWe've got the ability to communicate to voters directly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking an election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shock the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally what I read the exit polls at five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and at that moment reading the exit polls Trump lost Florida he lost North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he lost Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost it all new ... D barely won state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls the five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with the Sean I got to give credit where credit's due first of all a to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats sport during the cabinet nominations trying to smear and destroy a good man and his family\nAnd we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood\nWe had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted\nA ... a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenity at her she sent me an email later and said not only am I not that church she said I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's\nThat kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country you know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of decency and character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nI think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their work in twenty sixteen and that is the use of\nWorks and I think it works from the beginning one of the things I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media I don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know a ... bomber was the first social media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president and the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer\nI assure you Trump's has mastered it or not only and his use of social media\nPlatforms but also the thing is that his campaign ... dead in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms\nSeventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact or on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get\nDropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing their social media accounts then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything is possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening because I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic and you can see CNN fake news and\nThat mess that they're just desperate then they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision where Republicans get seats in the Senate\nBut below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a vote from below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for below sea and Schumer\nYeah and I and I really believe Sean ... the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination you know you see different polls would ...\nThe intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination you know you see different\nPolls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there\nThat I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president with a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and this\nOne gentleman who was volunteering told me she was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThere were over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on the jumbotron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity of quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nQuick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security is layers of protection spread across computer networks programs\nAnd realize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices\nLike keeping software updated in staying informed on cyber safety now consumers also need cyber security to protect their digital lives in today's connected world it just takes one weak link criminals get in a thank goodness there's the all new life lock identity theft protection with the added power of Norton Security that protects\nYou against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see or fix on your own now new life lock with Norton Security\nWell you can get it now like block dot com you need it in this day and age protect your name your reputation your finances life lock dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code ... get an extra ten percent off your first year in for a limited time may twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment that's life lock dot com one eight hundred life lock\nPromo code Hannity we'll continue\nOur roundup did not want to miss it as they do vinyl our overall Sean Hannity show\nI miss it as the final hour forever Sean Hannity show [noise]\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word nighttime again dial pound to five zero and say the key word nighttime\nThis is the news fourteen Ninety eight one oh three point five F.

way and I think it's a rich nominee the Democrats are getting fed up with the lives in the in the ... the exception\nOf you know okay Larry and all of them and that's where we get sick and then try to like didn't mean Trump so I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I Am I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we lose the house by about five seats but boy\nIf the election were held with the Senate today we're we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call\nMontana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know here we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results\nOn the morning after the night before and it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house\nAnd that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nNow already Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with a third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all in one of the big problems for the Republicans if they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBut is Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters of the\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam Schiff has a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman [noise]\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back

watch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing close he's Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district ... million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in the Lehigh Valley Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody and said their foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you both for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for below sea they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nTwo points back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're and we're gaining momentum uh we we debate at several times I made an average debate she will not agree to any additional debates recall her actually listen as we caught her in the debates talking about\nSupporting open borders and she'd correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border twice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was running on a ballot\nEyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to pin it and then we're going to and we're going to expose her for what she really is\nWell this is really important race a now Mardi no Stein is running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election boards you know this many presidential election is what they told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned in so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any orders feedback as though you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in ...\nBut I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes and I have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and the laws and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise]\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American come back the last two years have given a lot of people hope in this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they won opposite went freedom and liberty they one opportunity that's what we want that's what we have and we must continue it\nWell we wish you the best Marty all the best thing I Know you bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of\nPennsylvania and Lehigh County uh we'll be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you gotta understand this is now well how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nOne point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that of everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're gonna vote\nAnd you're not going to stay home and you got to put in the effort and you're not going to give a half of ... to ... below zero half a boat to Schumer there could be you know shock the world again kind of night is happy you stay home than it's you know maybe we split split the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we said we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our busy telephones or let's say Hi to Katherine\nIs in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just\nAbsolutely I think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us about the cause of your courage and the hearts and prayers\nGo out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that said our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage and by the way you are right up there with President Trump\nAnd his entire family and those that stand I Am I\nI have a point to make about courage and by the way you are right up there with President Trump\nAnd his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country is to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but maintain your credibility by being civil and stand up\nTo all these bullies and oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing and the lie said telling about our gear president I'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem is with a lot of\nA lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back\nAnd all the corruption in Washington and then some\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner who have to call it a surgeon five years ago and I'm Still fighting it today that's that's fine but I just want to say if if the conservatives had some shared risk and still together and consolidated\nGotta let me tell you why are we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they'd been so wrong Ben Sasse was one of them Bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them\nYou know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh he was Donald Trump that did it you know doesn't matter that he's transformed the economy all things that they say that they use conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation\nA energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of these things it doesn't they hate it all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they want somebody to do it in a way\nThat that that that everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old establishment way of doing things gets nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington\nAnd he exposes the swamp but he fights hard but we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know ... they're the type of Republicans the basically want to just sit in power in the corner and\nAnd act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and I don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top\nThe corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs at you so I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of them I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system and paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest battles military and that we can handle any threat that the world throws at us and we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil\nWhen evil you know raises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's going to happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically\nYou know temper tantrum politics of never Trump or his they're they're still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we wouldn't have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards the energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why in eight days when people go out and vote this fall matters a major question people have to ask is are you're better off than you were two years ago\nIn terms of the economy peace and prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain the leader on the world stage if you're not afraid to have a president that is willing to be a tough negotiator on your behalf\nBe a trade or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't give anything that Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back a shot at peace\nAnd denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know if you want a president that says he's going to respect our constitution the rule of law are our laws on borders and security and respect our sovereignty first\nAnd demand that people respect our sovereignty first then you know where to vote this year All right so in the midst of all this chaos and whining and election season um you know what we have so many different\nRespect our sovereignty first then you know where to vote this year All right so in the midst of all this chaos
