control of the Republicans and that the Republicans have picked up two three four five seats in the United States Senate\nWhich would render by the way Collins Murkowski and snow flake irrelevant\nAnd that even if they stopped Brett Kavanaugh he could be re nominated and next\nTime he would get a vote up or down and he would become a Supreme Court justice in spite of the slander and the ... and everything else and all of those anchors that had been for two years trying to destroy the president as an extension of all things Democrat\nYou can see them spiral into their state of shock and

com it's on Amazon dot com and their bookstores everywhere a one quick say I mean you do have that amazing talent but as\nI look at myself as a guy not spent my life studying the Bible um I read it now more than I ever have and you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes I just when I uh I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I know you are\nThis is a part of your life study\nYes I just when I uh I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I\nKnow your car jumbled jerk like me like Brett Kavanaugh at a\nShower and I know like a like a rock Obama's was part of the June gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drinking in excess yeah\nThere you go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept looking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that uh I thought were intellectual obstacles and I don't really think they were ultimately\nThere are intellectual answers and reasonable answers and we can give reasonable answers to why we believe and were encouraged by uh the Bible\nPeter fact tells us to always be prepared to give the reader that you believe\nIn there are rational reasons to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with rage and\nSo I wanted to share with the game because I'll make this quick quick I I got on fire for the Bible in theology so I've been reading it pretty heavy on and off for Twenty years and I have a passion to share what I've learned and help people accelerate their learning curve reduce their\nUh intimidation about scripture\nSo there'll be inspired to read it so they look at least Christian themed books I writer encouraged to are designed to encourage people to get into the Bible themselves\nWell it's worked for me although I have a long way to go obviously anybody that knows me\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered\nIf you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez was calling former yelled classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't sure sure her cell civil is Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News any more if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate\nThe stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats have declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat next story but on the original story that Christine forward a story\nI think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI had the same thing I told the Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections uh remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal of this party entry and the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two\nThirty six years in three months ago by the way\nUm and it listed who is that the party and it didn't match up with um with Christine foreign ths account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeak\nUh who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christian ports are allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support this did find out actual real evidence to support it than I\nChange my mind but I don't think it's there\nWell do you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell I'm now she's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so\nThe Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect on her but she pointed out that he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details\nWho invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar\nIn as much as there is no cooperation their big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that that Bert Katz says her friends sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters dear so and so do you know anything please call us and you know those letters went out and\nI Know some core operation you know areas right here at times they said they call they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf people to look at it and on on the Rachel Mitchell thing you know she was a lot of criticism her and um I think that the way she approached it was not a really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they all share the rocket every five minutes but she did\nA lot of information I was working day at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapist notes and the way we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty\nWhat about this because remember Ford says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist\nAbout that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name that is the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned this to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have the Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it sounds like\nYou're on the tournaments that that's what they say\nWell no we have the Democratic ... Hawaii senator the one that said to men to just shut up and sit down now Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about is drinking he said he liked me or he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drink too much beer but they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event\nUm nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so does he look a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here's you know ... question ... go ahead we're told us that things have changed\nFrom an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth\nThink that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking ... mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking correctly or mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr as I got to let it go there thank you so much Byron York a widow sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean has a toll free telephone number as we continue from Washington DC we'll get the very latest from Senator Lindsey Graham who's been in the forefront of a literally pointing out the madness that this is now evolved into\nA listen we all have\nJust gotten through summer and a lot of you have you know little sun spots\nAnd skin irritation from the summer\nAll the good friends at ... and Jen you so well they now have a brand new product it's there's sunspot correct her and you can watch us sunspots age spots red inflamed patches vanish right before your eyes because it works like all ... and you sell products\nAnd you're going to get the Gen yourself sunspot correct or absolutely free when you bite Gen yourself to get rid of the bags and puffing on the rise\nNow watch all those stubborn sunspots vanish and before you get busy with the holidays you're going to look to your best bags and puffing is gone and it's all guaranteed they guarantee it's going to work to your satisfaction or you get your money back no questions asked to just go to Jen you sell dot com\nThey have a toll free number you can call right now it's eight hundred skin five zero nine and if you want to right now you'll get the ... micro dorm abrasion that's also free to rejuvenate none clog pours\nSo you have instantly radiant baby solves skin all the time and if you order now shipping is free just call eight hundred skin by zero nine go to the website genius L. dot com\nRight from the swamp and the sewer it's the Sean Hannity show we'll get to your calls we have Lindsey Graham and much more Hannity tonight nine eastern on the Fox news channel as we continue [noise]\nThank you for listening to highlights of the central highlands from the news fourteen Ninety and one of the three point five FM K why ca this is the news fourteen Ninety eight one oh three point five F.
