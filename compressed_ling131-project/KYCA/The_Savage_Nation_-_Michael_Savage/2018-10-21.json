crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatched to secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the second now the allegation has\nMike pumps failed to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here and it gets almost more bizarre by the second now the allegation has banned the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal could show he now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that show he was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi hitting team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been heroes some reports claiming that cause show these murder was recorded but today no audiotape know videotape not even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently building with Saudi Arabia over other issues\nSaying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because show he was killed by anyone that can't say it\nAlone the Saudis and others just began to break moments ago and a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show he this is the Washington Post columnist now there's a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analyst former U.S treasury attach to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nAh she along with ... former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\n... yeah yes and I lived there for ... that I hesitated something like this fracking and the reason I get it because when the president said this morning and he's sending secretary I'm here to Saudi Arabia that made the secretary of state when it did these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled their plans to find halfway around the world um I I Do is incredibly serious than ah we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if they are required to keep it believed and we're still going to have\nUm I I Do is incredibly serious done and that they said\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with or whatever it is so if there were reports of people believed and we're still going to have to because if if the records are out there is what what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim that senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it who ordered it would be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how is it is no until now because it shows how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat's a fantastic question and I think the big takeaway that I have from this report and we'll see what happens but secretary\nOn pay me to them and let the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this ends and satisfy President Trump the secretary palm pail you know they have an audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that there are also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president\nThere's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually been very locally um an supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship is is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin supposed to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nThey well they were threatening to take care yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any\nOf the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S dam bond you know I mean this is getting more bizarre buy them in and out of somebody in this particular case walk in Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely she'll never really to aggravating factor here one you already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that bridge every single protocol moral ethical rule imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well Anita aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think this has ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm suggesting that this makes this even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual our cars so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing that's highly on like\nSo he was a member of the media makes it even worse now how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing that\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians are their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing though shocked I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they weren't going to respond you know we were they had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah yeah and just to say that the thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president on this you know the president came out and said that king and ... among the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nUnless there's something that we do not know about it looks like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be down there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia on the\nAir and well okay you're going to happen I mean the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving instead or and and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up of you left\nIf you went out in public anywhere and what was life life

negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine addict greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store it's\nActually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country and it was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas empty and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care\nI'm I Am at my pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing in that I Would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean Everytime you talk about it at our phones phone started ringing and we've got regular patience to\nDo you have a lot of them to write\n[laughter] we we have a you know a A R own pan over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it [noise]\nWell I mean so and you have all these pays now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well\nWhich has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ... I mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as more of our friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah at ... explain how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style\nA Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork that headache the hassle the middleman so that now medicines are pity pill now you can call ... ... email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nMiddle man so that now medicines are pity pill now you can call text email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nSo now they implement how many places did you get this finally up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining it in detail on up here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office says it's free tele medicine so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pay for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies during ... ultrasounds heart monitors long monitors um and then also medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out there and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they supportive and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities heat is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone what I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between\nThe Affordable CARE Act I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA or going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nThe Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump anymore than Republicans walked or health care chosen by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians in the health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have you know a better way through a direct primary care relationship [noise]\nNot leaving this was the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America at the top three\nThe patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America at the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income\nOne percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent so\nWhat they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan and God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr remember\nThis is a one size fits all model it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand hardcore thighs I'd a blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars a highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nAll health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear is a calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now from ... from Washington it's not coming we need ...\nImportant thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear is a calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now from ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this move in the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know in the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr Lee is gross ... probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think

so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House some twenty twenty\nI'm male focused on Massachusetts whatsoever on this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about our ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nIssue I'm not really concerned about our ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean because you're a one percent or but she also herself deducted fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes That's Elizabeth Warren\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons\nDeducting their use the underwear as if that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear and they put a value to it you know I've always said the Jeff that\nBasically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent\nOf taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts to the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they wanna lemonade eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump but that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people now there's just right after a congressman ... had been shot\nBy that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even was critical\nOr she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I'd actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happened\nWas that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island\nAh in war and Rhode Island not far from ... in the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this was by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale I'm DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best\nA time in history with magic versus Larry Bird and and parish McHale DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams at one of the best rivalries ever in sports\n... annual hall been up I've been to Boston a lot so beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through those I don't know what to tell them\nWhat looks Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not enjoy my race to Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nWay rarely I'm ready you need to do indoors [laughter] and we need to get that had his locker Brady has the most hated man except for the New England he's the most hated\nMan in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like\nThe fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight [laughter] well look at you know ...\nA lot has changed since you've been here unemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty minutes as for the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected at one point two\nBillion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like\nA Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that\nAnd raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on ah MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty two point six trillion dollar\nPrice tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs once government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know Elizabeth Warren complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or but you know the fact is when government becomes a tire of the loans or whether it's a student defaults or not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive the cost of the year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it was competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nI Wish you the best in those races\nWhen government gets involved and takes the free market out of it the competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between will pay attention to you know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here\nFor her to become president you got to re elect their and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well in your race or\nSanction if people want to get involved it's not too late field for Senate dot com G.
