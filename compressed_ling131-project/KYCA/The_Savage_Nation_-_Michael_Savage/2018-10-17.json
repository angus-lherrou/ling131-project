cool\nReally do you think so\nFive five four hundred Savage you get you on board the program paid five five four hundred Savage and you're on board and have you been paying attention to the stuff with hurricanes okay I live in Florida so when I hear the stuff about the hurricanes and I'm being told that they are getting bigger more intense and there's more of them because of a global warming\nI said what and when I saw President Trump on Leslie stall on Sunday I said boy I Wish somebody and brief President Trump because the truth is there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is no trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet I don't care what the so called experts are telling you\nSays there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is no trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet I don't care what the so called experts are telling you and when he was he said what scientists are saying that's not true he should have said Roy Spencer\nPHD because Roy Spencer has been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville\nHe's written in visible inevitable disaster why hurricanes cannot be blamed on global warming and global warming skepticism for busy people and he does it with facts from our own government\nAnd he's a he's got this out inconvenient data no trend in Florida hurricane strikes\nAnd he's just updated apply to Florida major hurricane strikes that he's been doing and it and it follows hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and it includes hurricane Michael and here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of\nHurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does do choose me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is down word but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not up word so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nBoyd the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so Spencer points out well yeah but if you look at the history of July August September average the temperature\nYou'll see that since Eighteen sixty this summer\nIs only the ninth warmest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and out of the top ten warmest Gulf here since Nineteen sixty seven occurred both for Nineteen Seventy which is both for we experienced any significant warming\nWell but we're going to get more of these really\nMajor hurricanes are part of nature dispenser points out and he looked at lake bottom sediment in western like in the Florida Panhandle very close to where Michael made landfall and he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five\nLike in the Florida Panhandle very close to where Michael Bay landfall and he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five hurricanes but\nFrom one thousand to two thousand years ago there was a hyperactive period of intense land falls in the Florida Panhandle in other words there's been times in this planet history where there have been more hurricanes\nAnd more intense hurricanes in Florida than there are today or long before so called global warming\n\nBy the way the latest hurricane experts who claim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes they don't show any data for that\nAnd when Roy Spencer PHD put Michael in his count of all is all us landing major hurricanes it marked a downward trend since the thirties forties and fifties not an upper trend not an upward trend\nAnd yet they still keep trying to make you think that is Massachusetts Bay colony and sixteen thirty five had a cat three or four storm with up to twenty foot storm surge\nHappened again and sixteen Seventy five you don't see those any more\nUntil twenty Seventeen the United states went eleven years without a major hurricane strike according to a NASA scientist that was the one in one hundred and Seventy seven year event to not have a strike that for that long\nAnd yet we're being told that manmade global warming is increasing the number of storms and increasing the intensity and it's just not true based on the debt\nAnd yet Leslie stall made it seem like Trump didn't notice talking about she was the one the new he didn't know\nWhat do you think\nOne more one more victory for Trump is getting tired of winning\nHere's the headline from kitty tablets Trump was right city council offices headed by the San Juan mayor have been rated by the FBI remember when Trump came out and pointed out there was corruption and Puerto Rico and that there were local failures to respond to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria last year\nWell during the recovery process with the feds San Juan mayor Carmen ... Cruz regularly came out slamming Trump\nAnd she would have a custom Ice T shirt against him that she wore to get on TV Now or offices have been ready to buy the FBI\nWhat's the operation was related to suspected corruption in the purchasing department San Juan mayor comments\nOffices have been ready to buy the FBI what's\nThe operation was related to suspected corruption in the purchasing department San Juan mayor Carmen ... Cruz said on Twitter the instruction is always total total her instruction up for this total collaboration mhm right the administration and the mayor of San Juan\nIs being investigated by the FBI and corruption charges Trump is right again\nThere was a lawsuit FBI reportedly launched the investigation following the February lawsuit filed by the remote Lena\nThe former director of procurement and she claimed that she was retaliated against for reporting the alleged a regular axe to local controller I have friends in Puerto Rico and when I asked them about corruption they laugh\nBecause they said of course there's corruption there's there's there's so much corruption you you would be shocked at the amount of corruption Puerto Rico is a small island and it's all who you know and there is corruption like you would not believe I said he wanted the hurricane or is it especially with hurricane relief\n\nA five five foreigners Savage get you on the program a five five four hundred and

politician talking about whatever\nThe only punches the Republican in the face\nOh getting their faces oh a creative crowd you know follow them\nInto grocery stores gas stations department stores restaurants\nThey're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnthony Scaramucci is with us by the way next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy it's phenomenal and it's called the Trump the blue collar president\nUh I noticed that it's too early to talk about the book you tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and and his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading and how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing at all you remember about the president he may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hits second and he often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally come after anybody\nIt's only after the attack him\nThat he doubles down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring our and then bam Pocahontas\nOr a Republican candidate in the primary Jackie and then\nHe fires off the nickname was sort of the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him then once he starts shooting at him he's going to hit you with the full force there and just sort of as a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nWell let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and\nHe he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kid in the street and uh and I know both I mean\nHe yelled at me he yelled at me after the curse and you've got to remember like the big guy Ryan Lizz a total wire she basically faded me into the call but then he's asking me to do a profile with them and then that's when I responded with the expert but you know what it is what it is ...\nHe basically faded me into the call but then he is asking me to do a profile with them and then that's when I have responded with the exploit it but you know what it is what it is ... what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony and I need more Harvard Anthony but you know what\n... what makes you grade on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close is that we both found a little bit of that and I only when you were a bus\nIn ... when I was just washing dishes busting table I was a cook yeah that's right you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life and I don't know I mean I I I think a lot of us in that\nAre blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I'm just on and so it's not in me\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story a law where we were in these aspirational working class families in our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents into the American dream\nAnd so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way to see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated or currently ... similarly situated the way we were\nIn the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks of never broke my loyalty from the president because I really do believe this horse in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nWell I was I was in line the proof is in the ...\nI mean when when you go ... ears adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more in poverty\nYou can't get three the only president never to get three percent GDP Growth\nThe worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter you know that we have four million more Americans working eight million out of all for food stamps and out of poverty I'm thinking okay\nFinally the forgotten men and women the the young Scaramucci's on Hannity's now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he can\nScaramucci's in Hannity's now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's got to get better because he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back on shore of the United states I Know you
