misunderstood man in Washington DC but it would be imprudent politically for the president\nTo fire him he has no intention of doing so Rosenstein\nYou know must receive Mueller's report and I think the president wants to see how that will play out and I think it's beginning to wind down many of the people on Miller's staff of already left and returned\nTheir jobs at the department of justice so I I think that is reaching a conclusion I agree with John no collusion no structure and a and then let's launch a serious\nInvestigation with a grand jury and the people at the department of justice

page also stopped by the straight ahead [noise]\nDo investigate we would have to investigate\nAll right joining us now is the man himself he's got his brand new book out that I loved the title and I like the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my bring this book is a must read for everybody and how are you going to say I'm\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't drink or this title would be as appropriate as it is off below Seventy two hours but we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know your\n... as it is off to below Seventy two hours but man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that you are a patriot\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and when you got to have policies of appeasement again and that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarized patient\nAt the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that's over thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat even exists read his ... speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he said\nAt the un line yes absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here\nHe will exist not just outside of our borders ... they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means everything and then look everything's riding on this I\nDon't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the ... party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only probably picked up see three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack at NIH on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what would literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat Americans enemies and we'd better do without apologies tactic Gorka\nOff the page as I'm reading through your book that we better defeat Americans enemies and we better do without apologies the tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept but the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist strong on national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the will cost you a court has is we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool\nWell guess who used that philosophy in the past about philosophy drives to the labor camps that drives to the ... on a drive through death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that Sean\nWe have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and then again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about it we'll\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out yeah in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others come back without their arms and legs in their in their faces his figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we are willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start them involved in them\nSo some of my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on\nIt do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with the wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allow the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the the ... of the threats\nOr at home because we allowed the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is a very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's a Whittaker Chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would occur chambers is\nThis is a man who was cabin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was a man who would occur chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went on record saying\nHey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist fall in the government including al ... his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do he had the will to fight he stood out for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh will have the social and his his his his a scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it ... years ago\nThey have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the general ... you know they divided America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break will come back more with Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight as new book defeating America's
