someone even more reluctant than her she was a militant hawk in a terrible situation for America we didn't need a militant hawk and the un\nWe needed a skilled diplomat in the un she was not a skill

after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left does not just take President Trump they hate this nation it's nothing new but it's at its worst\nAnd then she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to prove it from Christopher Columbus to the Salem witch trials and then he or she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by centers to politicians without Syria motives\nSavage provides vital contacts for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria their causes

the effects of going to be seen for years and years to come but let's get back to the news of the day\nAnd my opinion on it and I don't know whether you agree or disagree with me I said that Haley resigned suddenly because she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed to get Trump to bomb Syria\nNow on what do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning\nShe was bombastic and

believe we've seen that before and perhaps we have with the red scare and in a few other times uh the war of the world's by Austin wells hysteria\nBut what we're seeing now where you have the pillow sees and the finds things using the propaganda tactics of Joseph ... to whip up the masses against that targeted demographic meaning the heterosexual Christian white male this is something new in

I Will react accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city in my own home and\nI Hope you feel the same way what began with a Trump witch hunt has now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there is no tied to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there is no hysteria in the air you store against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria there was no witch hunt against Kavanaugh he wasn't a pinata for all white\nMale heterosexual Christians why she of course he was well that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very hysterical times and very dangerously hysterical times\nAnd the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car and too many houses no what

there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchased to be on a new release table between the ninth of October would just today in the twenty second of October which is not today and I have gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on a new release table or buried underneath other books on a new release table so it's up to you to go there on demand is a book to

talking about my book stop mass hysteria what you found in the book stores or on a more intelligent level if you've gotten the book to Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the best things in it\nSo here we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the blacklisting of Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon for you and for me for that matter Governor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those people in uh the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed them and left them off they thought he'd be marginal\nBy those people in uh the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed them and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee\nAnd his show has one of the most loyal and phenomenally large audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News if not more so in its own time slot\nWherever it is seen now last year Governor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on his show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God faith and reason in the book took off like a rocket after that\nAnd I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited the governor onto the show to be with us today and I just got an email can't joined me because she's prepping U.S House for the hurricane he's in the panhandle of Florida\nBut he's going to join us tomorrow granted his phones are not out from the storm and try to reach us either on a landline or on a cell phone again we want to thank Governor Huckabee for standing with the American people in these dark times especially in these times of media blackout some remember he's been\nHe is himself has been a ... a blacklisted by many many in the media and written off\nAnd he rose from the ashes like a Phoenix as I Hope we will do as well on the Savage Nation\nThere is no hysteria out there and none whatsoever the Washington Post says it's not hysterical or Marlboro not at all judicious timing I Would say well I Would say so many of my loyal listeners understand uh the timing of mass hysteria is perfect right now and we're talking about that\nBut we're talking about the news or the day so Haley resigns and immediately later in the afternoon reading right now we hear the Trump is floating the idea of a Goldman Sachs banker named Dina Powell to be the new UN ambassador\nYou say well what's wrong with that\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to clean the swamp\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to not be a global list to not appoint global lists to high places I seem to recall that was his campaign slogan\nRight nationalism America First can you explain to me how Goldman Sachs and a woman who works for Goldman Sachs representing us in the UN is America First game looks plane that to me do you think that threatening war with Syria\nMe how Goldman Sachs and a woman who works for Goldman Sachs representing us in the UN is America First can I explain that to me do you think that threatening war with Syria or Russia\nPuts America First I don't think so and as I said to you and the reason in my opinion that Haley suddenly resigned as because she failed to ignite a war with Russia by bombing Syria about four or five weeks ago when she was reading the war drums I don't know if you remember her speeches one bellicose speech after another\nAnd threatening one day after the other\nSo here we are now they're saying oh well maybe we'll put Goldman Sachs is Dina Powell and they had to replace Haley to me it confirms everything I've been saying now she worked for this government she was working in the administration and she left\nAnd it says Dina has done a great job for the minister action has been a valued member of the Israeli Palestinian peace team well here's your problem\nHere is your problem\nAnd at the risk of igniting the write\nIn directions I Do not want to ignite the right I Will leave out my belief as to who is pulling the switches on this particular situation in the United nations you can't really blame them\nI mean if you were the tail and you continue to wag the dog for so many years and suddenly the dog said look enough is enough we don't want the tail wagging us you'd be an angry tail wouldn't you or am I speaking an allegory is that are too complex for the average Fox News view or\nWhat do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned because she failed to ignite war with Russia She was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military and\nTo attack Syria and Russia look it's a very complicated game the middle east\nAnd you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit there and salute and say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out as because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would have drag us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel Mike Campbell\nTo do and that will show that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that and not at all\nI mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America's second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist that happens is um twelve years old\nAnd a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east as time they use that instead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars not bring us into them\nBut I guess you all forgot that\nAnd on a personal note well you know the Trump is surrounded by several factions as are all presidents\nOne of the factions are global lists like Nikki Haley like moustache Leo\nAnd then there are other factions who are nationalist and they vie with each other for the president's attention and then he makes the decisions obviously that's why he's the chief executive well he didn't listen to the global is who wanted him to launch Tomahawk strike against Syria\nFour weeks ago Haley was literally drilling drilling she was on the verge of success our greatest success ever of igniting a war and it made no sense to me\nNone whatsoever\nISIS had been beaten back into one city ... whatever it is and Russia and thank God for Russia and Syria and our own warplanes ISIS was beaten back into this one city\nAnd in order to make sure that the Syrians and Russians didn't go in to clean out the remaining elements of ISIS in that city\nThere were talks that Saddam was going to unleash chemical weapons on his own people which made no sense whatsoever none\nI mean you're winning a war of the whole world is watching everyone as an iPhone you can unleash poison gas on your own women and children who would do that who would believe a story like that other than idiots who would buy a story like that and I kept saying this weeks and weeks ago don't do it don't do it don't do it\nI sent a message after a message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know they received them\nGo don't do it don't do it don't do it I sent a message after a message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know they received them\nAnd they know one thing about the Savage Nation so long as I'm Still here as long as I still have a loyal audience which I Do you are the base that elected Donald Trump not to Johnny come lately is none of them elected Donald Trump you did\nAnd now that I said that I'm going to say something else so it's not lost to history I Will rest knowing and my family knows and they're pretty bright people\nThat it was I who helped push Donald Trump into the public eye and pushed them over the finish line he even said the same thing to me put his arm around me and said without this man I wouldn't be president I Am proud to tell you that I have saved the western world\nFrom the total insanity that they wore and still are engaged in that is how I see it and then as how that is how my ... family sees it and I don't need the approval of anyone else in the media I Know what's right I Know what's

and then go out to sea and stay a male be there'll be a nor'easter from a DC to to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell south in ... south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia or to Greenville Spartanburg I think ah to Raleigh Durham\nTo the tide water Virginia you live south and east of that path and the further south east to go\nThe more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings\nBe put into effect in those areas and ah over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out of putting that out there if they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into friday\nYeah All right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast\nAnd as it moves north east is going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through I was going on\nA hundred mile a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty to a hundred in\nHave regulatory guts and then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the

east coast uh to the Carolinas I guess through the tip Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City two AM in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east of Norfolk in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glancing blow a\nA you know it'd be like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours or New Jersey on in the southeast New England out of this\nAnd this is the last this is the last one short so you don't have to\nWorry I didn't know was the last one that that fascinates me that you said it's the last one this isn't going to happen for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall pattern and I'll tell you what folks you ... and he says is two thousand and two all over again except slowly\nSlowly which was the big hurricane and the Gulf hit a little bit earlier in Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October this is pointing the way believe it or not this is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big one for much of the United states this year\nThere's certain types of patterns is set up so it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm\nThat will then establish it we may see something that try to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but impacts dorms on the United states\nThis is the last one in my opinion\nJob of starting you're hoping to save people's lives and uh you help every day you nailed this with the exact pinpoint perfection an accuracy which is so vital for the people the make proper decisions about whether to stay or go Oh thank you for being with us we really appreciate it will go back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing\nAlright eight hundred nine pool when Sean if you want to be a part of the program there was a really disturbing piece on the law and crime website ... sister website the media I ate\nAnd ate chronicled the FBI Director who's testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency\nNow you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not\nBut that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nAgency now you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not but that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nNow the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first an office that you were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible that the president's conversations with the international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise her response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to in this Saturday\nWell then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that most senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extend some oversight\nI don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations and then Rand Paul as director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up\nBy the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with say a terrorist naming them\nAnd re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes\nAnd as his time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the ... system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we ask you to get a warrant\nThe information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar\nAsked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought it was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and

apartment should not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that is not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember on this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on may night the president fires gym called me on may seventeenth Rod Rosenstein they lower the special counsel\nIs one of the majority of ... happen in between there\nRemember at least a page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion

know there's a whole lot that has gone into this\nYou know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of

and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they will read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here I'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single\nDo we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here I'm One of the big problems with all of this

literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of the course of ... deals\nYou know ... and as a result it

somehow they get put in a three oh two and they get used as debts a justification\nTo actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick thing it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow\nUnder oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of ... twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that\nSo now is the time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who is coming forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so

investigate these things from ties and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I I never said this but you really think about it all of that information was disseminated to the American people to lie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they'd vote a certain way but more importantly then after the election that they lost\nSpite of all of these efforts all of the lying that kind of always takes place when and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years in spite of all that then they use this phony information again and again and again have a media league strategy\nFeeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story of a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell to some and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russian collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends in the media that we're willing\nYou know accomplices and all of this and then they talk about undoing a presidential election surreptitiously going out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they get and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished\nI mean that's what happened here\nYou know certain all these things are again being being paid for by the taxpayer and we're basically taking it in the rear end every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately you know when I say this is the biggest abused the power scandal corruption in American history I Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right\nYou know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal\nCorruption in American

can understand that they don't like the president's style\nUm it may be that there is at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day\nAnd ah I Wish some of the other people that were in your camp would would be as intellectually honest\nOr as you are and I applaud you for
