I I don't think that's true but it's what the Democrats say you know when a when they go low uh then they then they go lower I think that's I think that's the Democrat Party saying is a\nMaryland Democrat and gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous accused governor Larry Hogan of bullying which is a term that I think should be reserved for grammar school I think it's a grammar school term\nBullying him with the release of a new campaign video that mocks him for several gaps they say gas they call them gas including one where he said he's running for governor of Virginia\nWhich in case you're a Democrat is a different state altogether that's another state altogether and so uh Ben Jealous or again he's a little brighter than ...

Europe [noise]\nIt just is out of control innocent people are going to end up getting hurt here All right so a twenty two days out of this election remember I said that one of the things that Democrats will never say Israel when we're now we're going to impeach forty five but just don't do any voters don't do any party\nMember and then Maxine Waters they keep telling me not to say it but I'm going to say it and Peter forty five and ... forty five\nShe's she's honest about it she's telling everybody here we're going to do it but they're telling me not to say because it's not going to help us in the election and twenty two days now we have a piece of Democrats are being advised not to speak about their unpopular open border policies that is very difficult to win on immigration\nIs there was a memo obtained by the New York times and left wing consultants for the center for American Progress that's put dusters group\nAnd a ... of the think tank third way and ... Democrats running for reelection spend as little time as possible talking about immigration and the immigration issue we're more than a one and a half million immigrants were admitted to the country every year\nAnd they reported sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum put together by the center for American Progress\nAnd uh you know shared about a dozen briefings with Democrats in ... so they can't talk about anything they want to do me interpret that for you let me lie any way we can never tell you what we plan on doing what we know what they plan on doing endless investigation\nImpeachment of Trump open borders which they won't talk about impeachment they won't talk about\nYou have shifty shifty announcing plans for nearly a dozen brand new anti Trump investigations in the house alone if they get control of the house it's why I'm telling you if every house race if you don't get out in twenty two days I don't care what Democrats name is on the ballot\nIf you vote for the Democrat you're voting for below sea you vote for a democratic Senator McCaskill Donnelly Heitkamp pastor Nelson a you know this woman out in Arizona whatever her name is that things Arizona's a crazy\nCinema I mean you're you're voting for Schumer it's it's\nUh you know this woman out in Arizona whatever her name is that things Arizona's a crazy cinema they mean you're you're voting for Schumer it's the same thing you don't vote it's a half a vote for the Democratic senators and house members\nAnyway Washington Examiner points out Trump is likely to face at least five new house investigations are caucus led by Nancy Pelosi will lead to ruthlessly prioritize the most important matters first he said\nAdam Schiff member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence listed five different investigations he says that the Democrats will start once they take over\nAnd one that will prove his charge that Russians are are laundering money for property is owned by the Trump family and the intelligence will assessed the work of Robert Mueller et cetera et cetera I mean it just is never going to end\nEver they don't care about the the country of the future of the country or the way Hillary says in an interview Bill Clinton didn't abuses power with a twenty two year old intern with the sex toy and the oval office\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill is to actual misconduct\nNine numeral now but I take responsibility for my life and my options\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with the White House intern some today have said he should have stepped down for a member of\nThat here you know she's defending him all she wants but that doesn't address Juanita Broderick Kathleen William Paula Jones and are saying the bill did not abused his power how can you say she's an intern is classic workplace sexual harassment because he's got all the power he's the president\nBut whatever I mean I don't know why Hillary so define on the issue but she is um so we got the ... let me tell you what's gonna happen no one twenty two days because I think this is important we have a CBS News battleground poll showing that the house races are in a statistical tie\nMy advice to you is to think three weeks from tomorrow you're going to turn on the TV and get bad news because maybe that will motivate you and the agenda simple impeach investigate open borders eliminate ice they want their crumbs back they want Obamacare what\nElse do you really need to know anyway they find that the battleground states the race for control of the house\nWant their crumbs back they want Obamacare what else do you really need to know\nAnyway they find that the battleground states the race for control of the house is now within the margin of error which means a statistical tie\nThe same CBS survey finds that for Democrats to when they have to rely on voters who say that they're going to vote this year but did not turn out in the twenty ten or twenty fourteen midterms\nIf the elections are held today Democrats would stand to win two hundred and twenty six seats they claim more than a two hundred and Eighteen needed for the majority Republicans winning the remaining two hundred nine but the margin of error and each of those\nIt's tight fly keep mentioning names on Hannity every night and on Hannity dot com\nMarsha Blackburn is pulled out of a bigger lead against Brett us in and I have to believe the tape that was put out by project very positive putting\nSome a highlight on that you know the new rock star of the Democratic party ... got something like sixty million dollars thrown at Ted Cruz but Ted Cruz is still up by eight I'm going to be in the Houston area on Saturday of this coming week I'm going to do a town hall\nWhich ought to be fun uh we have just a two point lead for Heller in an important race versus Rosen in Nevada I mean ... that's an important seat to hold\nAnd the case with Arizona ... finally taken a lead there I've got to believe that her leads gonna get bigger once it begins to resonate what a cinema has been saying about people in our own state whenever she travels abroad or if you look at some of these other districts it's very very tight\nI honestly can't tell you what's going to happen in twenty six states like a twenty to twenty two days I Can't tell you but I Will tell you you got to personalize this election\nI mean Nancy Pelosi look at her is that who you're voting for voting for a Democrat\nThat say if you vote for senator that's a Democrat you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nAnd there are radical left agenda\nYou know if you if you want to know what it's between lower taxes

[noise] yeah yes and I lived there for most it doesn't ten and eleven I anticipate it something like this breaking and the reason I did it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary ... to Saudi Arabia that means the secretary of state when it does these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world um I I Do is incredibly serious done and not to say\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with or whatever it is so if there were parts or keep it believed and we're still going to have to because if if the records are out there is what what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim that senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo learn how to know until now because of how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\n[laughter] that's a fantastic question and I think the big takeaway that I have from this report we'll see what happens but secretary\nAnd pay me to them and let the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this ends and satisfy President Trump the secretary palm pail you know they have an audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president\nThere's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nBeen very vocally I'm an supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship is is important but the Saudis\nActually the very locally um an supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into why I think the relationship is is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says we need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin says to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening to take care yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any\nOf the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S dam bond you know I mean this is getting more bizarre buy them in and out of somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely she'll never really to aggravating factor zero one you already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility ... that that I mean that breaks every single I'm a protocol moral ethical rule imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well Anita aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that there's this ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes this even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual our cars so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nHighly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing though show I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were they had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so\nThat was a bad move yeah that\nToo yeah that's the thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they live with the president on this you know the president came out and said that they came and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nUnless there's something that we don't know about it looks like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nHad called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we do know el about it looks like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nOn the air and well okay you're going to happen\nI mean the the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ...\nWomen voting and driving and set her and and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up of you left if you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under Sheree there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing him shine and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWasn't modernization and Saturday we saw women being able to drive we saw the what the route that the government that I had to where it's called the ... I thought you were at sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major yesterday and sent all the people who dress observant link but it's such a great clean found that people aren't talking about what you just said\nIs that it it has been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to ...\nFor many years and and this and this new\nRules or oppressive as it relates to Judaism and Christianity and\nLesbians or either slogged or killed is not true\nAbsolutely am and but that's for me what's so unfortunate about this incident and why I Hope it gets corrupted very quickly and so we will actually singing modernization Saturday the liver you know I'm a more liberal or a pitch to women's rights limits education when driving and that played the crown prince had built up such\nRest where everybody's home down here\nTo explain why not much money the financial where and why and what do you\nThink this is the news fourteen Ninety eight one oh three point five FM K why ca Prescott and K. to seven eight sand Prescott it's three o'clock\n[noise]\nSurveying the damage Jain Lisa ...

in the case or professor Ford or Mrs Ramirez or miss sweat they get that cetera I mean in every particular case and um I Would just lay out to your daughter and then go all over you\nKnow what the allegations were how they came out where does any corroboration and any of the cases I mean I thought the most outrageous one was the final one again by miss sweating egg you was claiming and her story shifted in change dramatically within the course of a week from my perspective\nAnd I think you know she was basically claiming almost on a weekend basis that these kids were drugging these young girls teenage girls and boys all lined up in the halls and they were waiting their turn to gang rape the girls\nNow ... hard pressed\nYou know again the day the media looked high or low why didn't far\nTo find any cooperation and they weren't able to in the case of miss forward the one I witnessed she placed in the room so that didn't happen\nOr even her best friend says she doesn't remember any party that she was with judge Kavanaugh so\nYou do need some type of ... and if you believe in due process and presumption\nOf innocence and I think we I think the Republicans handled it with the sensitivity deserves with the severity it deserves considering the severity of the allegation\nBut I'm not a person that Russia's to judgment on ... you have to I Believe that it served this country well to follow the rule of law\nAnd due process and a presumption of innocence and I think that happened in this case and I think the person that laid out the best case and that was what Susan

know but remember this will be their agenda\nIn twenty two days they will want endless investigations they will want impeachment they want to open borders they want to eliminate eyes they won Obamacare they want their crumbs back and this woman Nancy Pelosi would be your speaker so pretty much be both for a Democrat\nYou're voting for Nancy Pelosi and her views on her values which are

then they aren't kidding she refers to kind of position on his so pathetic clean\nOut looking at the end of the ... and they may never nothing in this day I think the issue of citizenship is not just about these young people which would be just the Haitian enough\nFor that other undocumented ... as a immigrants in our country who was under a comprehensive immigration reform should in my view the on the path of long term happen earn path\nOr a path to citizenship\nI'd ever have before but I was in my chair out here and then I realized that come along the terrorists name\nWith him be Elizabeth Cady than our sense terrier Christian line of all their hair\nMisrepresenting the Iraqi people the hot sun city settled a playground and now the current president but if\nThey're going to say this if you give them some stock and finish the slippery slope I certainly hope so\nIt said that you would like to Institute a single payer health care program and cancel raise taxes I think the main roll back the tax cuts that they pass the fear is that what do you think of that when that second part is accurate [laughter]\nSanctuary cities might help law enforcement and how how they [noise] their

it\nProvide more signing stand\nIn the country not to say that a person can shout walls and it's crowded theater\nThat was thinking more of a picture of it stops and night at these things that came out at night like a vampire I can still have to do ...\nSo that's what's at stake in twenty two days just like in the Senate if you're in Montana or North Dakota Indiana Missouri is here in Arizona and Nevada or Florida well you if you're both for the Democrat you're voting basically for Chuck Schumer because that's who they're going to vote with\nThat's that's who they will be that sold there'll be listening to that ... they will be aligning themselves with that so they will be voting for for their leader\nAnd we already we've had eight years of this and the fact that we're our memories or that short it's frightening at times to me All right back to our busy phones as we say Hi to skip is in Utah skip Hi how are you glad you called\nTexture thanks for taking my call I'm listening to question whether these street run on a single sheet of most of scares me the most is they seem to be running on a trip for America um you know I don't put up with everything that America is known for is just seems to be destroyed by these\nDon't want us to hold a broad brush it looks a little left the left hates America I think there is a a a significant even at times portion of the radical left in this country that literally they hate\nAmerican exceptionalism America's role in the world um they don't like our economic system they believe in they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't want freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged cause I think\nAnd they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't on freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged because I think they are now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump in all things Trump and you know it's just it's just pouring out of them\nYou know we've tried a lot of these policies we've tried apologizing we've tried bribing dictators under Obama we tried redistribution under Obama we've tried socialized medicine under Obama and he's the first president never reach three percent GDP Growth in the history of the country\nYou know we know the disaster of Obamacare ... millions lost their doctors their plans and they paid twice three times the amount they weren't paying in spite of promises a we know that ... at the end of his eight years we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty you\nKnow numbers mean something and frankly to go back to these failed policies now look Obama might even be considered moderate compared to where the Democratic party is in the house in the Senate today\nYou know you have one moderate that Joe Manchin that's it and the rest of them are all pretty radical left and they don't apologize for their quote socialist beliefs that is the emerging Democratic Party\nSo when I say that a vote for ... or vote for your local Democratic Congress man or woman is a vote for below sea or a vote for in a Senate race in your state is a vote for ... I'm not kidding\nThat's real I used to say that it'd be a stay at home in the election that's a half a vote for Hillary Clinton um same pretty much the same thing here\nAnd then there's a lot at stake listen I found the best coffee you've ever had in your life if you're tired of going to those big liberal", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Prescott", "day": "15"}
