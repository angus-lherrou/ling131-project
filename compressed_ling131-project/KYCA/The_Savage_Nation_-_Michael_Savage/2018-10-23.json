is with us\nThey don't need silver didn't have a very good year in twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast pollster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans picked up seats in the Senate I don't have a feel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee\nMissouri Nevada Arizona for sure North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they've got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements does it make it any easier\n... that's right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised that sober for the second cycle arose going ... um you know the most recent survey indicates that in fact\nYou have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are were within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts out we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not so much money and then we're not campaigning and I'm not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied up in the generic ballot\nIn and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter and shoot the two things happening you see this a little bit with Stacey Abrams uh in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um and\nWho explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat and in Arizona for US Senate\nWho refuses to apologize\nFor urging Americans to saying it's okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban um what's happened in Minnesota now where I think Keith Ellison may drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship\nA because we can cheat the ocean is just so totally left wing unacceptable and so I keep looking around at these patterns and uh I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where the ... billion for example when\nWe were talking about ten days ago you and I were but this was a race between jobs and march but if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and you watch the Democrats\nCould can you can you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out of there because it's the important wherever fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be boating and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets\nAnd you're either going to have great news all the way around maybe it's going to be split decision for you gotta have horrible news\nAnd you get to decide ultimately what that news is going to be this is where your vote actually matters this election counts and you can shock the world again and I'm confident that that can happen that can be the outcome by quick break more Newt Gingrich on the other side and later pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh much more\nYou know obviously this is the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one\nIssue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nYou know I look I I well\nOne issue or program they're offering that will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nYou know I look I I well they do run on a government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which when you examine it collapses\nBecause is totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing they've come to a big idea and it should really bad idea\nI agree totally All right um we'll be checking him regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burn the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think there's that doesn't change the ... the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registration for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get to our phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big

right ... ... ... okay and they ... a day but we'll give you thirty seconds final last word thoughts today what's gonna happen to fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stayed off the those so called blue blue way that we might even retain the house and\nWe're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close so we don't want to ask me to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said well there are so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expanded opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black and\nMany a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling ya liberals can't stand is a ... and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's I think we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two\nWeek how how would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country\nHas a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they can afford a vacations take their kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things but it's such a universal listen to humanity\nYes it is I really believe next fourteen days are going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this isn't a weapon formed against the self prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party a share\nOr I go to share both curry and we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us past are always good to see and when you're in New York and I appreciate you being here David as always congrats another New York times best seller Sean Hannity dot com Amazon dot com\nOr when we come back a tight race for congressman Ted Budd we'll check in with him than your calls eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number of an awesome Hannity tonight at nine hope you'll join us as we continue\nThat it said had shifted more towards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls closed what seven thirty but I remember correctly on election night\nOr they do and so we're going to fight all the way through the end ah look this is a district that goes from Greensboro down to solve very overcome mores of ill ah this is a this is a great a district but it is\nAh look this is a district that goes from Greensboro down to solve very over to ...\nAh this is a this is a great\nA district but it is one of the topics toughest districts and the state it is if you look at those numbers it's an are six or so it is a real fight we knew this\nA twenty two months ago when I was sworn in that this would be a a a fight for the foundation for who gets the speaker's gavel in twenty eight teen and voted it come true now it seems like people are waking up\nVoters are starting to turn out and we're thankful for every single one of these conservative voters that are going to the polls with a few days of early voting but again this is a con harassed race you know for low unemployment ah like we've got growing the economy would have done what I said I was going to do\nWell you also have the ninth district in a tight race\nAnd mark Harris is on on deck and Trump or the president is coming in and support me and mark Harris both uh this coming friday night and so looking forward to mark here as a winning me serving with him he's a great guy I've known him for over two decades or so look forward to him winning and serving right alongside of him\nWell this is an important race if you're in the thirteenth congressional district in you're in North Carolina including what much of high point or Greensboro all Davidson ... counties of parts of Rhone counties in and some others you know this is a big raises is going to be a bellwether race or election\nCounties well exactly thank you so much\nAll right thank you we wish you the best thing so much for being with US Congressman Ted Budd that's an important or race or let's get to our phones patios and but that is the Maryland Patty how are you\n[laughter] I'm doing great how are you Sean\nI'm good thank you glad you called\nYeah you know I'm I just wish I believe in ... I Believe and what he's saying I Believe and what you're saying you cannot let the migrants come in and now it's ridiculous it's out of control but\nIt's all about the whole coordinated effort and showing it so that the Democrats crack can't play their same game as\nYou know of course she ... you know with the way they're using all of their their word to feel sympathy and build nests trust against the Republicans and\nTrump is so good at this he's just got to make sure again there is a coordinated effort said that there is the and the people there and the military a show of force start sending bosses start sending plane all staged they're ready to say we mean that\nThis is his red in line and the fans just like Obama hat with Syria he didn't do that\nThis is this is ... and he's got to\nHe just said lean mean that this is mine and the fans just like Obama hat with Syria he didn't do that it's this is ... and he's got to share this and handling is right with a really great where it needed Africa\nI'm really not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know a Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela are bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't ... president telling the vice president that men Pence told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras financed by Venezuela look\nBottom line is they should be turned back now but if in fact we see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border\nWe're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interests of innocent people and all of this nobody's innocent if they're willing to just brush our border Russia across the border we don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed and ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis\nThey're going to be on the Mexican side of the border\nBecause America is not going to do anything to people that don't violate the law\nBut if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying\nWe should have food and water medicine supplies and transportation back to where they came from and I think you're going to do it\nAs as expeditious way possible with them as much care as possible um but I don't think any arrest\nEver looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border and border one of confrontation with American police and ice and our military\nUm our side is gonna win and you're right we should do it as compassion early as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt you know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero Toulouse here\nAnd that's a that's a tough position to be in and then you have agitator that or you know they're not telling them anything that's honest than truthful that they're telling them they're going to get in and so they're going to be disappointed feelings of anger anger is going to probably be on display\nSo we're just hoping to get a turnaround before this even happens but ... you know let's let's be clear here this is the United states of America where a constitutional republic we believe in the rule of law\nAnd the application of our laws that's it Democrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talk\nAnd the application of our laws that's it Democrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky as in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you called Becky\nHi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on and I\nWell I got a couple of things being from a border town that people don't understand about this this law that's kind of [noise]\nYes they come to our voter but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV and chicken pox in life and our border patrol agents and all are people that are working with them get exposed to this\nThey don't understand there's long term ramifications of them and I had a feeling of thought about why I'm Mexican Government it's not stopping some\nMob it's because when they come here and earn money they send millions and millions and millions of dollars back to their family members the wire transfer\nSo why should they stopped them because they're making money off of it so I think we should stop the wire transfer\nThere is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson the Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been ... by reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today by Ben horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters boats\nI'd been there I've seen I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it drug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand that people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying or laws\nThat we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America\nIs to respect the laws of this land and respect American sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that\nAnd do it the right way and they should have precedence over those that are lawless and don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple\nAnd you know I feel and listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars were spent over the years to help other people in other wins at some point we've got it\n... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars we've spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful\nAnd those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of\nNo Americans never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is it we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that anyway eight hundred million for one showing you want to be a part of the program Donna's in Iowa Don Hi how are you glad you called\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call I appreciate that I'm a marine veteran\nYes sir and I'm Glad you could go ahead you're called silver ... thank you sir I called actually to echo what you had earlier reported about this stuff\nAre being financed through Venezuela in it that kind of reminds me of who's very good friends with the Venezuelan this is a for rock Obama and this kind of have that feel that it came up through him I just I feel that this has got his his\nUh organizing skills written all over it\nWas an I don't ... you mean in terms of the caravan well there are a little of the\nThe vice president is saying today and and again I don't know who's organizing it who's funding it I Know that you know I get the distinct feeling that there are you know the less silence on this is very suspicious to me you know why don't they speak out about protecting our borders you know if we had the wall built do understand\nWe wouldn't have to worry if they ever got to the border that there would be some type of confrontation 'cause he couldn't couldn't happen it would be good for people on both sides\nIt'll encourage people to follow our laws and respect our country and our borders and our sovereignty and at that point people go through the process legally and I'm not saying that we don't let people in from other countries I don't really care where you come from you know you got to show you were able to take care of yourself", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Prescott", "day": "23"}
