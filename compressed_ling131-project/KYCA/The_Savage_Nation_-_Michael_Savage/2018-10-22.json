I just want to point out that the news media is saying that\nPresident Trump invented this this tone to those mockery of a of a Senator Warren with her phony Indian thing and that's not true this has been going on for a long time this mockery of of her\nOf her a ridiculous claim\nCenter at one released her and says the report then it said that the great majority of Warren's identifiable ancestry as European\nHowever the report adds the analysis also identified five genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence and this is what Elizabeth Warren put out now this is a a joke of course\nHowever yesterday afternoon Cherokee Nation released a statement saying\nIn part that DNA tests are useless in determining tribal citizenship and people using DNA to connect themselves to Cherokee Nation is inappropriate\nAnd that was a a a gentle right on what they said because they were a little more direct the statement itself says\nFrom the Cherokee Nation\nMay DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish\nListen to this whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and wild DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate to Enron I say\nYou know DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate to Enron right senator or you're going to be racist ... are you going to stop offending Native Americans now it makes a mockery out of DNA tests\nAnd it's a legitimate uses while also dishonor ring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who is heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage that is from the Cherokee Nation secretary of state\nWho is named Chuck ... junior Chuck ... junior who is the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation they're independent nations was also on the television last night on Fox News channel it was on CNN surprise surprise where he didn't help or Elizabeth Warren's cause either the problem\nWith a DNA test isn't it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation a member of an Indian nation DNA and best can give me some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived there in North and South America and maybe in a native\nPeoples of those comments [noise] I'm In the relevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country\nIt is irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American so this whole thing was just want want want it's ... it's never mind my DNA tests doesn't say anything in fact I've it indicates anything it indicates that I Am less Native American than the average Whitey\nOn the moon okay [laughter]\nI'm going to get to idea and the moon a little later on why is Whitey on the moon in the show today well you might be surprised but it's another reason I'll get to it in a little bit on the other reason they're crazy people now let's go to Elizabeth Warren she's out there saying that the president does or a million dollars that's got to number four\nBecause this is what President Trump actually said when he made this ah the news media and and at all is with Warren not smart people not the really you can't take them seriously\n... saying now President Trump or a million dollars because she fulfilled all of the requirements that President Trump laid out if she gets a DNA test\nPresident Trump or a million dollars because she fulfilled all of the requirements that President Trump laid out if she gets a DNA test and it proves that she is in fact\nPart Paul Paul then President Trump owes her a million dollars this is the phony arguing that they just lie about everything they live right by Brett Kavanaugh there a lot about Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton lies about everybody they lie about everything\nAnd a President Trump actually send these words in July about the DNA tests\nYou know those little kids they saw on television for two dollars\nFirst of all those little kids and and\nWhat she claims of Indian\nBecause her mother says she has hiking thoughts that are only a set her mother says yet I think about when it was\nSimply take that cat and we want to say\nIf you take the test that shows your hand you\nKnow [noise]\n[noise]\nNow the test does not show she's an Indian really a debate has not happened she is not the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United states has not given or the or the DNA tests on a stage during the presidential debates ah and ah and and I didn't\nHear him call her mother a liar which is another ... not what she said that she keeps calling my mother a liar President Trump keeps going my mother a liar that he didn't call a Elizabeth Warren's mother mall pall a liar didn't call anybody a liar\nBecome a liar\nHe didn't do that so she just lied there in calling a saying that President Trump was lying about her mother being a liar there's a lot of lying going on here it's a circle festive lies a tangled train wreck ... stupidity\nBut there it is um he didn't say that your mother's alarm or he did say that you have to become the nominee beyond a debate stage she gives you the DNA kid you don't get to pick your own DNA person who is a you know a corrupted Democrat fellow traveler from a college campus\nBut then when a CNN listen to that or watch that video this morning Allison ... who used to be a reporter listen to it and said huh maybe everything that I've been\nFor that or watch that video this morning Alison Schmidt Allison ... who used to be a reporter listen to it and said huh maybe everything that I've been saying all my wife has a giant lie and President Trump is in fact the most truthful president in modern history\nOkay he didn't mean it was during the ... on the other he said he just he just\nHe just won me over maybe it didn't really mean it was during the debate now he ... okay well I actually listen to what I said now and the one me over not winning you over

executed as you might expect some were allowed to commit suicide in certain cases\nBut they executed the number of the conspirators\nAnd Adolf Hitler couldn't be present for at least a couple of the executions so they filmed the executions for him so that he couldn't see them later at least a couple where they hang up by Hitler's enemies with piano wire\nAnd a Hitler wanted to watch the films of this so is print psalm on the the uh the culprit here behind the curtain\nQuite possibly and perhaps quite probably that said there's\nA lot of Palestine trigger round there these days you know he

his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in the book about how\nWell the mean horrible landlords actually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they

election day glad you are with us it's the Sean Hannity show [noise]\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the ... the flag draped casket would come through and\nHappened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives and as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the ... the flag draped casket would come through and there was ... it was a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nAnd Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for cares and said this is really personal for those of us who served and were shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans parish over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah that well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more uh both on the ground and the air and on the the I mean this is this is why we fight or to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties and it you know this is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and\nShe also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to a flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so\nThis isn't just a one off for her uh this is a pattern she advocated a shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like the you know a a deep dive dump has been made but I Would think that this was common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean\nI I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in the race to people\n... absolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer's top recruit for them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about it\nThe Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks you write some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another and social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not too many and unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up an ad to put some of these statements and like you just played it cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to mix Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to have to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf the Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only got to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think you'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but I'm ... more than one alone on real\nYou know I don't you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took on the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defence\nAh fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American\nSoldiers are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case\nAh I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you want us there and then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh luckily we were there it was with US military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make sure that our values\nAre that were set up for yeah\nWell I really wish I knew and here I'm a ... Martha making Dolly if\nYou're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema\nYeah well I really wish I knew and here I'm a ... Martin\nLuther King Dolly if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention of course in cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country uh she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nAs she was a line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol the torture yes it was a ... again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best put plans for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to\nSecure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels are taken advantage of it has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in and ... uh and that's a sector that is being overrun right now\nAll they do have been there many times they don't they released\nInto the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nAnd this is not church president John fall it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing our border and the president as frustrated as the eye and you need to use everything he's got enough to to get to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they usually more funding or and fully funding all yes and you have\n... thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell Sean I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because of being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMight wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nObamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen counties which has no choice\nAnd are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if they have no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now a tree that thing conditions who can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gets more choice people more flexibility at the state level um or free market get the federal government you know to not be doing it one size fits all top down penalty taxes the mandate\nFailed and so we you know I voted yes again I bet millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions are good intentions but their policy they're wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as the not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate that'll make votes for Supreme Court justice was a lot easier\nGoing up against a very radical leftist in the name of Chris and send them Oh thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the position you take and uh you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us more than ...\nThanks hon if he's signing a flashlight on that and an advocacy and if people want to how they can do to make Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations and we can win this thing thanks so much\nThank you rod as in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you rod\nCERN legislation on this show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the person that that actually a presented when he was on call is okay\nThe reason why my concern is is this because magic close is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done it can initially they want us out of transparency and so we've given transparency it's like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever President Trump actually nominates they've already got a team investigating that specific person to attack on a smear campaign\nThat's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that's one on one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine\nAttacked a smoky cafe well that's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one on one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine that\nThis is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and
