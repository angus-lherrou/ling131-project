forget what happened at Kent State university and the killings at Kent State changed the course of American politics you see the radicals were agitated\nIt's an intergenerational group of agitator incidentally the old hippies of that time are still alive and they've cultivated an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call them that\nAnd the old hippies and got the mobs in the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of a state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off

did the little form of mass hysteria by the way and the numbers students were shot dead on that campus\nOne of the results of it in addition to the tragedy of the students being shot\nWas that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt\nSuddenly they cut their hair and went home to mommy\nAnd took a job and McDonald's there were no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard\nAnd I'm afraid that this was going to happen if they keep taunting the police if they keep taunting senators if they keep harassing

stopped and the only way to stop them as my passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already we're not living in the in the early\nAnd the only way to stop them is by passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already we're not living in the in the early days of the founding here where we're now

me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that they didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck\nMe the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it [noise]\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force\nAlong the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves through but it's going to accelerate through there we're we're looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nAnd you folks over there you go and you got to remember the way the northeast or the fight a Florida shape\nEven though it to the east Appalachia cola or the wind won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge\nWay that northeast or the fight a Florida shape even though to the east Appalachia cola or the wind won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water that's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and do that by to Florida I think Tallahassee probably get wind gust eighty Ninety miles an hour and they're not the power out in Tallahassee do during hurricane Kate which went very close to Ninety percent\nOf the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or with this there I'm now I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least the gusts with this\nAnd we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon tomorrow night that possibility tornadoes are from Florida and then prove southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary All right so what do we get landfall and uh what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on the coast I've been down there a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and it's but there are a lot of homes right on the water so\nHow between three and nine PM tomorrow thinks one we're going to have landfall and I think things are really going to deteriorate\nVery very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday and afternoon and there you just got to get out I mean you know again what for its you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds there was a bad storm it was spread out\nThis is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where it's a it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and a lot of folks\nYou can see what's going on with this\nYou saw with Florence Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the clock photographed the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter\nAnd that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast is look\nThere's nothing magical about it and I we I wrote I wrote down this weekend and I I Know that sounds pompous but you got people saying we've never seen anything like this it's already starting with the climate ambulance chaser\nThis has been telegraph so far in advance and even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem coming up into the Gulf of Mexico and then there was going to be what we call rapid rapid development feedback we see that happen every now and then\nAnd we were fortunate with a board said it was you know it it was off its peak this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do when given the ideal situation and that's what this is so\nIt really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own\nWas off its peak this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do and given the ideal situation that's what this is so\nIt really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own but your website actually so you have it hitting land it's really going to start getting up about noon tomorrow we'll a little before\nRight and that and then the the landfall I think at some time between three and nine PM Panama City will get that down in ... I Believe that may be on with the on TV Tonight we will be honing in on this we get a lot of people in that area of course you know\nAs you've been Harper and about what twenty eight days away and we'll we'll watch it you know people that listen\nI I appreciate let me be beyond hair want to take care of your down there but we want you to listen and get the heck out of there if you order it out of there because it's a bad storm\nAlright Joe ... started the official weathermen of the Sean Hannity show please you know whatever your local officials tell you I'm what I'm hearing from Joe is if you're a coastal person you're going to want to move inland probably a little bit more\nUh westward rather than eastward because it was going to make a right turn it's got it looks like it's headed right through the Atlanta area\nRight into the coastal areas of the Carolinas and uh and then straight out to see maybe getting is upward as northern as a Virginia but look at whatever your local officials tell you if they tell you got to evacuate don't be pride full just suck it up take the day or to\nMake sure you're safe and secure put put that as a top priority\nUh All right thanks so much for being with us job of story whether bell dot com thank you uh eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program president now even he's saying what I'm suggesting is that is that the U.S would end up ah like Venezuela if if the Democrats win the midterms\nThere's some truth to that there's a little bit of payback I see for Senator Lisa Murkowski the geo pale Alaska\nApparently is going to either reprimand or totally disarmed now Lisa Murkowski I Would assume a primary tell you the one person I'd love in Alaska to run against or would be Sarah Palin maybe Governor Palin could make a a political comeback I think the people there would like like that a lot\nOut this was a fascinating race cars you wouldn't think anything in California would be in play although there are very important especially in Southern California there are very important congressional seats in play and that would be from say just south of Los Angeles Orange County down and through San Diego\nIn Southern California there are very important congressional seats in play and that would be from say just south of Los Angeles Orange County down and through San Diego and I know they've had massive\nPopulation shifts down there but you wouldn't think state wide that you'd have a gubernatorial race that is now is closed as it is\nIt's a five point race between Gavin Newsom and the Republican businessman a guy by the name of John Cox\nWe've got to get John Cox on the program and I'm going to tell you why it's happening\nBecause the people in California are fundamentally understanding what Gavin Newsom is proposing is an economic disaster for that state went oh free health care for everybody\nIt doesn't matter if you're in California legally or not and also the cost of it being not only a sanctuary city like San Francisco but the sanctuary state\nWell that means that that includes health care that's the criminal justice system that the educational system\nAnd if people are not paying taxes are in the state illegally and maybe some illegal immigrants do but they're certainly available to use services under what Gavin Newsom is proposing for everybody\nIt's basically putting a sign out that would say hey free health care in California just make it here and we'll take care of you\nAnd you know people are going to do they're going to make it there and use the California health system now remember California already has a state income tax uh Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you could no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you could no longer\nCaught or deduct rather your state income taxes on your tax return I mean is that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes so the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am in his right behind them\nJust ridiculous the amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection it's going to be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that raised a little more closely and see what happens by the way we do have\nAn attempt by the ...

Jared and John Solomon into the next one other thing that we've got to get to an all of this we have now are the revelations that have come out with everything that's been going on with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat the FBI made it more clear now than ever before that Hillary Clinton really through what is just she's up tour eyeballs and everything being the sole instigator of the entire Russia gate scandal that only paying for the dot CA\nAnd there was a great piece by John Solomon last week and investors business daily also laying out all the evidence\nA chilling indictment of how this political criminal\nNot only managed to escape indictment but was somehow able to weaponize the FBI and the D. O. J. all to destroy your duly elected president President Trump and last week the ... of course we have the FBI general counsel Baker reporting\nDirectly to former FBI Director called me telling congressional investigators that an attorney from ... law firm gave him materials remember that's the law firm that she funnel money to\nAbout Russian election interference during the twenty six team presidential campaign just stunning revelation since that directly contradicts the Justice Department and the FBI officials sworn testimony I Will take a break we'll come back more Greg Jarrett John Solomon\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele to compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the DEA OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing it along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition\nTo the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use

Rosenstein\nIs Mueller's boss if Mueller is going to be investigating Rosenstein for illegal illicit activity he can't how we must still the boss in this case\nAnd the timing of this tells us everything John his was revenge for the firing James Comey this is part of the listed scheme to frame Donald Trump good title for a book I guess that's why it's number one that\nJohn Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure I missed some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the blast or the ... and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misuse for a political opposition research project to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nThey sustain investigation that was designed to hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part that Baker divulge as in the middle of my story about him fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well sky a\nFake or gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after ... when the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the dossier ... copy that's different from the one the FBI has sort of steel and gives it to Baker and then Baker turns it on to the uh counterintelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job of a reporter to be getting evidence the FBI we're we're supposed to report facts not become snitches\nBut more importantly the timing of it is so important the FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking um ah the existence of the investigation and all that dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them\nSo for steel for leaking um ah the existence of the investigation and all that dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them and hear it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele\nThis is not how the price of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think they ... give us several key revelations\nOr one of the challenges the credibility of roses theme one that shows the media um ah being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three that's a direct involvement of the Democratic national convention he's a lawyer and turning on evidence pressuring the yeah I think of what happened in that time from\nChristopher Steele July fifth twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and Europe he gets turned out they don't act on them right away they if they're not excited about it a few days later he goes to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department\nBruce who are put pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the the ... lawyer coming into the FBI again putting pressure on to the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI to find something on ... before\nDay and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed take Donald Trump out of this\nCandidate any American who have been treated this way it really raises civil liberty concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns and we should all be concerned by body of evidence that Malow firms would rub Jared has written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the piece that seemed to be but it literally at the end but those the puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start feeling in the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is that we had a group of people\nThat literally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her\nThe very people that literally signed off on Warren that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer cords and the very same people that after they lost had an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary\nWe're going to get Donald Trump in the way we've got to do it is a we're going to eat secretly record them\nAnd we're going to surreptitiously\nThat's the salary we're going to get Donald Trump in the way we're going to do it is a we're going to eat secretly record them and we're going to surreptitiously get him to say something that we think we could use against them on top of a phony investigation that they've\nThey initiated through a media release strategy again of the ...\nYou
