team that has like a a\nWe could ask some teams from the grand\nCanyon region they could get into the playoffs\nYeah all the parents if there's any team that has like\nA seven three six and for what record but down south but uh uh where they go ahead and win the region because we all know the stuff you were in the region are you qualify for the state tournament regardless of what you're a record
