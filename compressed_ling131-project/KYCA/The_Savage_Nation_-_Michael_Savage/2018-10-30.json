now\nThat he's innocent lamb when he's been funding these radical leftist groups who in fact are terrifying disease nationalists by the way out of getting their backs up so you want me to make the connections between the bogeyman of America today the one that you're allowed to voice contempt for the white nationalist\nI Will do so I'll be glad to do it for you\nBecause there have always been white nationalist in this country many of them died in World War two\nOh yes I mean a lot of white nationalist in America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries Oh yes they've been a lot of white nationalist intimate in America\nLook at all of the um military cemeteries around America you'll see an awful lot of white nationalist who went to die ... fight and die for their country but all

all of a sudden the word and why the national ... been linked together by the radical left into one phrase that signifies something other than being Caucasian hula ... a Caucasian loves his nation suddenly it means something akin to not see them\nAnd this is a trick of the radical left in America they've tripped many people don't even know what they're talking about the things that if you are of a Caucasian background and you were a nationalist you're a Nazi\nAnd ain't necessarily so [noise] so therefore we have to look into the mind of the white nationalist especially the one who did this

numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be blocked\nJust now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress and the Senate as we move forward and there are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of a new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants to universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states what smart governors\nWell it can be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd that would be your only count you manage every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money\nBut when you get older if you really get sick that money that account is built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic care fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what your deductible is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack cancer\nOr have a bad accident but anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years and he joined us atlas MD Wichita, Kansas he joined us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us\nA doctor I'm just to remind people I Lived in Wichita I could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month\nI get unlimited care twenty four seven I get a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get unlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nFor every American could have ... level direct care just like you know how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting there is ... and we don't want those people mending our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the direct care model cars\nMeant for opinion pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no co pays free procedures we can fix is we can work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease saving their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in our fair\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back towards a an Affordable Care act dial a Medicare for all\nIt would decrease our ability to really you know innovate in a way that is meaningful for pace\nUh and Affordable Care act dial a Medicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know innovate\nIn a way that is meaningful for patient and more importantly shot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled socialized medicine or you're going to inserts a government between patients and their doctors\nOr do you think of the capital here you know that's how the ... at the same government that's going to control your health care or you have a another position that his health care freedom and these are the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nA war that your decisions are not being made by ... by the government and so in a while direct primary care is is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been impressed by most Republicans running including\nA famous who's running for governor in the state of Florida he's embrace this Newt Gingrich has put this in his you know to correct primary care and his platform or so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the visual for him\nI mean that it's almost mind numbing to me and you you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be honest but I couldn't pay them I mean I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care\nAnd get a doctor's recommendation and didn't and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the stock in the box places and I'm not now playing them like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou and everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom and we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market to do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and meds are ten dollars a pill we we we want freedom in health care we want choice do direct care model\nAllows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nThe direct care model allows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way I'm Sean ... in the bars you know it shouldn't be a part\nOf it you know in our practice we have not raised our prices and eight years we've tried to sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services\nAre X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so if preexisting no pre existing condition that question is can you actually afford to get the care unique by the doctor you need when you need a and these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship\nCan actually do that so you need to embrace of the people that are running for office that support the freedom and health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with the Republicans because they had promised repeal replace and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit he got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have\nWe're going to have better health care options for the American people but in many cases the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare when you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country doctor remember\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get launched but there is over a thousand in growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty practices started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nOr the ... and then you have any direct access to every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all and these practices exactly maybe you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care\nThere is no insurance except he probably would have won a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive the gardeners\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know a point that goes unmentioned is the fact that the insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent every year when Dr Lynn I never raised our prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nMoney trying to be noisy but you're making money at fifty bucks a patient I'm a I'm a make a monthly you making any money\nWhere do you want me to have an acquired yeah yeah this has not been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices of float or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospital\nTo keep the practices afloat for able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's\nWorth the same poor people in America people we defined as poor\nLower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they needed a Z pack they're going to walk out what is the pack and pay above the Z pack\nWherever they yeah they should be able to get that think about it the poor and ... you are the more you need a model Lexis MIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system in only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient\nOnly believed to have a functioning cars and car insurance gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call him you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients who have a we have about six or seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so what what kind of way and I was just like those practices and probably most of your patients like me I really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know saying let's go fishing together hum\nBecause most people will drive but there's probably ... at least ten patients them every practice where they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our ... and our lives last year we had her high you know we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stop you know we factored that in um on the\nProgram we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land do this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after that so now with or a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model\nOr we're looking to increase that just by thirty percent with one conference alone or the interest is massive and keeps on growing and as long as we could policies will place at the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to\nTo grow and blah so you'll see this movement leaving all across the country are getting better access better care for the cost\nA sudden I got to tell you any Democrat that is telling you anything about health care that's out now is they're talking point we're offering health care a ... and Republicans will take you take care of preexisting conditions they're lying\n... bowl little lie as keep your doctor keep your plan and save money and why would you trust the people that burns you the first time so that they're talking point in the final week of the election and these alternatives uh assuming Republican to get the Senate\nI Am and save money and why would you trust the people that burns you the first time so that they're talking point in the final week of the election and these alternatives ah assuming Republican to get the Senate and hopefully the house\nWhich is a lot tighter um it would be an opportunity for them to adopt this model and every American could I've concierge care at lower rates and we'd all be better off", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Prescott", "day": "30"}
