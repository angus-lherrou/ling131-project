comes down and there's no police report and I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover\nTo use on the Supreme Court and the Senate hasn't been best\nInvestigate we would have to investigate\nAll right joining us now is the man himself he's got his brand new book out say I love the title and I liked the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my friend this book is a must read for everybody and uh how are you going to say I'm\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is often low Seventy two hours but man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that you are a patriot\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad that need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and when you gotta have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what did we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarized patient\nAt the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it from second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that's oh well thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat even exist read his ... speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he\nSaid at the un he's absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here\nEven exists not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means everything and then look everything's riding on this I\nDon't know if you want\nCool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means everything and couldn't smoke everything's riding on this\nDon't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the ... party wins the White House usually\nEnds up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only only picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack and die on November eleventh September eleventh um but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies and we better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWhere we have to take very seriously this concept but the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist strong on national security it wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the big Ocasio Cortez is we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool\nWell guess who used out philosophy in the past about philosophy drives to the labor camps that drives to the ... on dry food death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and then again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized us\nAnd we pulled out you know in Iraq and Afghanistan we pull out we even give dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces his figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war then we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you\nTo win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war then we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start them directly involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important is is the one who hitting on\nIt do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with the wooden sticks and rusty rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual will to win in addition to the the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's a Whittaker Chambers\nMost kids have no idea who ... to ... this\nThis is a man who was cabin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was a man cool would it could chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went on record saying\nHey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist fall in the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do\nHe had the will to fight he stood out for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh ... dead so showing his his his people out here is a scary thing the Democrats have done this before don't be surprised that they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the Gen rye are they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break we'll come back more with Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight his new book defeating America's

reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit cause now how the woman goes into a clinic\nComes down and there's no police report and I helped expose the crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not to the gods now movies amazing Cormac God's smell is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history bring\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWhy they are saying is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he is the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today\nUh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he is the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you are not and bring him in and put them on ...\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenas McKay memos and the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who said Rod Rosenstein was talking about recording the president United States so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he\nTook that as seriously when he was told about that meeting that Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that McCain memos and we've asked Mr ... assigned\nTo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr rather than it did lead and that you played shots he he talked about trained he he talked about facts and and the hearing to this power are a rule of law and justice system works well\nOne of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us those memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you the committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nOr Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agreed that we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that uh it's it's more ... on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and ... literally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a planned now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now to James Baker\nSaying that he talked about taping the president of the United states in the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no\nTalked about taping the president of the United states in the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it was set at sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running dusted department\nShould not be joking with support in about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities and an uproar because on may ninth accredited fires give them call me on may seventeenth Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nIs one of the huge already happened in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks\nStrategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was a page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWhere you're writing I think not only are they leaking aired of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually\nA memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media\nCould not be substantiated I I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein read the five application many side you know when you start to look in here some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well didn't\nThey will read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed out the Nunes memo pointed it out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified\nThe bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants that that they were literally committing fraud on the size of course they never substantiated they'd never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of the course of ... deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result it was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a three oh two and they get used as a justification\nTo actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sickening it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of ... twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do the indicated that he would do that\nSo now with your time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there\nTo answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McKay became right from that meeting so look we've got a subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions
