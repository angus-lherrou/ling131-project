political turmoil does it sound familiar\nWell it'll be familiar to you after you investigate this a little a little bit more [noise] so what was what were the Salem witch trials what happened\nWell the minister of Salem Village was a strict pious forever and Samuel Paris and he had a son Thomas and two daughters ages eleven and nine in January of sixteen Ninety to the girls began having tantrums or fits as they were called at the time\nOr the girls through objects scream made strange noises and twisted themselves into bizarre positions\nAs with John good witness children in Connecticut\nA doctor was cold and once again unable to cure the girls the physician pronounce the element to be demonic in nature well then another local girl eleven year old and putting them began having in a similar fashion a pair of magistrates are demanded that the young lady's name the source of their body which meant\nOn February twenty ninth under pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty Sarah Good a pregnant beg a woman and the parents just Caribbean slave to the tuba\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did not want in their town\nGood and ... professor innocence to no avail and so did too but at first\nThose slaves were rare in the region she had been with Reverend Paris for fourteen years and she loved the Paris children for whom she was largely responsible\nBut Paris whipped er into confessing promising to secure her released if she did show the poor woman admitted to the magistrates that quote the devil came to me and been me serve him an added that she was not the only local which wanting to harm the Puritans she also inform them that she had in fact bake they which cake\nFrom Ryan urine with which she gave the family dog just in case the pet was a familiar or help or of a local which what happened next [noise]\nThe three women wore in prison the next day\nDespite his promise Paris vow to political expediency and allow the slave to remain behind bars we late spring before the governor finally convened the special court order and permanent as soon as the women were in prison the Salem authorities other took a program we know all too well the auto distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants than farmers\nIn prison the Salem authorities other took a program we know all too well the art of distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants and farmers if there were challenges to the local theocracy then leaders must create a diversion Diane an event that would dominate what passed for a new cycle of sixteen Ninety two and that was which is right in their midst to to have said there were others the word spread that they had to be found\nUsing the tactics of Dianne Feinstein and the committee\nTactics or mass hysteria and paranoia Europe had purged itself of tens of thousands of undesirable that way Salem and it's on ... had to do the same\nAs with so many things one can hold the media partly responsible for this hysteria and I give you some examples of how the media was used in that time through books and publications\nAnd so the hysteria gathered force throughout the early spring and the numbers of those accused continue to grow by the end of may more than sixty people were jailed awaiting trial for witchcraft\nThat was when the governor was finally forced to establish a special court of all your and Terminator and what happened then on June tenth that institution Dianne Feinstein hang in the first victim Bridget Bishop\nA brash see what it was late husband had run and then she was apparently accused him no crime in particular other than that she was a soft target\nThe woman who was known for playing shuffle board and wearing red clothing which was considered to signify sexual yearning prowess well it went on and on and on\nAnd what happened well cotton mayor put his agenda ahead of justice he crafted the equivalent of fake news and contributed his own call to arms at the court riding the following\nWe cannot but humbling recommend onto the government the speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as we have rented themselves obnoxious according to the direction given in laws have gone and the wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of which crafts\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing or immune from accusation and they went on and they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so that we speak forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years to come stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria\nArea I Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern\nIf for example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts is that would not have been a stereo and twenty eight teams to something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is all you get from the media today you would learn that the following that for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia\nThe mainstream media would have you believe it is fact it is history and urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I gave you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria in our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nNot in the media will reference nine eleven it's proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at war because they have been at war with the

research on who Senator Flake is\nAnd you'll be shocked to find out that Senator Flake well appearing to be somewhat middle of the road is anything but I think that flight will vote against him no matter what the FBI says now remember this before we go on\nKavanaugh had at least three FBI investigations along the way to becoming a federal judge Iraq Obama hadn't done in fact I set it when Obama

the time I had to hold my nose to vote for you\nAnd it's up to you to hold your nose to vote for you know what I was ... whatever's going on at the time and now I'm saying the same thing that Jeff Flake I did help him get elected and I would wish he would just hold his nose and support the president he doesn't have to like\nWhat do you know the president which we all know he doesn't but he should at least support the people that elected him and they're not well\nI don't really know what he said it remember what he said his sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well what he was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters they all got absolutely not which means I'm only doing this because I don't have to face the\nVoters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nYeah but when he was even in back then when when he was you know this has been out of every one for a couple of years he he missed major votes that we needed them on one was when he was home with his daughter at some dance recital and another one he went through his son's wedding\nAnd he said that you
