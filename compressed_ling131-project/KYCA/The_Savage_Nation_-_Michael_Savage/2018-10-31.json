people from Africa and the middle east as he could get into this country\nIt's a sad fact of reality but if you look at it from the point of view [noise] uh I'm rather how liberals are looking at

about and they get in a challenge to the fourteenth amendment which is a good story to talk about and it's a very real story we know what the scholars are saying\nWhich is that um it will go to the to the courts and we know that the left wing courts will say no he's wrong and then it'll go to the Supreme and they will probably side with Trump even at this court even this court right now would

tell us what it's doing to the illiteracy rate in this country look let's be clear I'm a former teacher\nI'm the son of an immigrant very important point street remember the fact of the matter is the literacy rate of America has plummeted since Obama opened up the floodgates to a third world those who are illiterate in their own language\nThis is something I cannot emphasize enough we're not even bringing in people who are literate in their own language their illiterate in their home country they cannot read or write most of them cannot read or write in their own language do you know that are you aware\nWhich they're illiterate in their home country they cannot read or write most of them cannot read or write in their own language do you know that are you aware that we are calling from the bottom of all societies on earth\nWe're not thinking even moderately educated people from these countries to come here with some literacy we are getting people in who have no literacy now how does that benefit this nation you know I don't care if you're a progressive woman who runs runs a corporation\nOr a or whatever you may be I'm trying to imagine a very wide net of listeners and it's not that narrow it's not as narrow as you may think\nIs that benefit a nation where is your argument on that\nKnow give me your tired your poor your hungry and those yearning to be free cell repeated again that noble phrase written by Emma Goldman I Believe and on the stature Emma Lazarus always confused as to why ... was Goldman because Goldman was thrown out of the country Goldman was deported for being a real no good and that\nThat's what people could still be deported Emma Goldman was thrown out of America for opposing the world war I think World War one\nThis was Emma Lazarus Lazarus okay Lazarus Lazarus ... ... give us your tired your poor your hungry those yearning to be free now let's pause there for a moment before you all get so agitated that we lose our lunch [noise]\nAgain I got to tell you this is so important to know\nBack three four years ago I was on a yacht more in the west side of New York on the Hudson River in the ... district\nAnd I gave a little party for people from my radio business and people from my publishing world about a hundred people came aboard for cocktail party and I gave a little speech which I played on the show twice over the years 'cause I'm so proud of it and I think it's called an immigrant son\nArrived in New York against something like that and I stood on that yet and I look\nAt the statue of liberty right down the Hudson River ... years later would save those people on a plane you know the Hudson River named for all the Henry Hudson that evil white male who they named the river for maybe they can rename the Hudson River\nMaybe seal river or something like that because it may offend people down the Hudson River the as the statue of liberty and I pointed to it and I gave some remarks to the audience I Hope that they understand what I was saying that\nOffend people down the Hudson River the as the statue of liberty and I pointed to it and I gave some remarks to the audience I Hope that they understand what I was saying that only in America could this son of an immigrant meaning me\nBe clear on this boat one of my grandfather came here on the urge\nSteer edge she urged third class fourth class they came in no better than most animals and they were sick for most of the voyage and they got off the boat with very little in their pockets but\nThey had a scale or a trade that people to take care of them will usually taking care of by relatives who are waiting for them in the city of their arrival there was no welfare waiting for them or they wouldn't have gotten in the country if they had no means of support you didn't get in here\nSo the rest of the story open a little tailor shop you probably work for someone for a while and then he was so good in some skilled at what he was doing as I was told years later I never met him he died at thirty nine or forty I don't know how old he died young you know\nKilling himself here in this country very set I Wish I'd known him but he's the astronauts to the family Sam I call them the astronaut or the family and one of my books\nSo this guy\nOpens a tailor shop and to become so not well known in New York\nMainly amongst the wise guys I heard I don't know I heard the story they all had their suits made by um you know how they always like nice suits down there on the east side in those days the gangsters anyway he makes suits for them I even give them away charged him and he made the suits and then he died of a heart attack God Bless them\nSo what I'm saying to you is I have sympathy for those wanting to come here and make a better life for themselves I Know what it's like to want something and worked for it\nBut I also know what it's like to want something worked for it and then be destroyed in this country by social engineers remember that phrase was popular about five years ago remember the social engineering that we used to talk about five years ago on the radio while we have the social engineer still at work\nAnd if you ever

believe than those Jews these left wing fanatics of this uh bend the the arc group\nFunded by Alexander ... speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's sickening because it only stirs up anti Semitism because when you start to make believe that your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be defined you anti Americans on the left\nYou make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't there are many many conservative Jewish people were never heard from by the government in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people when you don't make you believe you do is you stir up anti Semitism\nAnd yet they want you to believe that all of Pittsburgh is Jewish community doesn't want Trump to the exact opposite is true\nAnd he's on the way there and I pray to God these left wing fanatics funded by Alexander Soros\nJust cooler today and don't make a mockery of yourselves and pretend that you speak for the Jews in Pittsburgh when you get there saying are not welcome I pray to God that you just for a few minutes have respect for the dead and don't use their dead bodies\nAs fuel for your horrendous agenda against the president and against most Americans by the way\nJust given a break for a day can you do that survivors huddle huddled in closet during synagogue attack terrible story I guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense self defense Chris\nI guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense self defense\nChristians Jews must learn how to use weapons they must learn to defend themselves I Know it's a shocking thing to say in a liberal democracy like our solar were not Conan or shouldn't while you would like not to be that kind of the nation but we are\nYou need to learn to defend yourself the Israelis learned to the can't just be done with love\nThey learn to have a tower in one hand and it was in the other that's why they develop the ... machine gun\nThey learn they needed a gun in one hand the show and the chief rabbi by the way of Israel was a paratrooper at the time remember that store he would parachute out of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in a in the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant\nAnd so when we're going to learn I don't know when the average liberal in America comes to understand that someone else is not going to defend you you have to defend yourself\nMaybe they wouldn't have to huddle in a closet maybe they could learn that they have to defend themselves as terrible as that may sound and if they don't want to do it and they have to hire armed guards I've been trying on people about this since Nineteen eighty to eighty one\nIt's only a matter of time I said you're just throwing the dice sitting there like just waiting for a maniac to come in\nAnd it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and started them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but because it was in India you know it came in when this one hit home because there was a white man who did it a crazed Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda they've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews that didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean is there is the uh the the the slaughter and the gay nightclub they didn't focus on it\nThe other slaughters they just always look the other way because it doesn't fit the bill left wing agenda I mean it's not clear if you're looking at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open eyes open heart with all these news stories and you take it and you do it for a living it's very difficult I had a tough time over the weekend after this happened that hit me very close and very hard\nAnd I brought everything that I could to the table yesterday but today we're talking about something that's entirely different which is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the in the in the women and children and nobody caravan of which we know there are several everyone knows that\nDifferent which is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the in the in the women and children and nobody caravan of\nWhich we know there are several everyone knows that I mean if you were a if you're a gangster how would you come into the country you don't hide what would you walk in and say I'm a gangster and I want to deal drugs in America\nYou get in line with the thousands of them with the women and children you have to push the carriages in front of you and you get the sympathy and the American people is all they're all just wanting to come in there all poor that's how you would do it\nSo it's slowing down on its own momentum is slowing down the momentum and that's because the president is speaking for most American people you may not notice\nForget the liars in the media who do this to incite hatred\nEvery poll one after the other no matter what the state shows that the largest majority of Americans even liberals do not want open borders they do not\nThis is a a a small percentage of radical fanatics funded largely by the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not allowed to mention his name anymore suddenly the victim of a sudden after victimizing America for all these years with all of his money suddenly he's the victim\nHe funds let's see on the FAA these funded black lives matter he's fun to occupy groups to me that's not American by the way that's quite something else\nAnd he was thrown out of Hungary he's not welcome in many European countries all George Soros because they try to destroy their sovereignty as well they can all be Nazis what every Hungarian our loves their own country as a Nazi according to George Soros they throw them out of out of Hungary so what do you try to do to that country\nThat closes universities in some countries because of the Haiti was preaching against nationalities against the nation and nationalism\nAnd then there's another thing I said yesterday that should not be lost in the ether over the airwaves it's about so called white nationalist is that the new bogeyman white nationalist just say why didn't nationalist together and immediately you have a boogie man you can hate right\nIf you live in a liberal community has since I was white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist togethers feels good when you say it doesn't it what is it white nationalist\nIt's not too broad a statement of white nationalist so if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty while you're a Nazi now so look at every cross in every war memorial cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white national\nWhy didn't you believe in America and America's sovereignty\nWhat you are not see now so look at every crossed in every war memorial cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war she a lot of them were white most of them were white and the cemeteries as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just population was and is\nAnd the military was comprised largely of white people and were let's go back to World War two just for a minute\nSo most of the man who wore enlisted to fight many of them are fighting this he loved America not all but many war and so they fought why well they will nationalist they loved America and they didn't want to speak German\nSimple so what they're white nationalist to show you know to find your terms a little clearer\nWhat I mean white nationalist what is it actually mean not every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet to the left wing in America they've conflated the terms into having you so you can believe that anyone who is proud of the flag\nProud of the nation's history proud of the culture proud of the language is

which is called Philly street talk you know with it added flavor of duty you are kill outcome um I support the president in a hundred percent oh that desperation\nThat's really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what are what you might say tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happened to both the wrong way every single time but the last two years\nA we have some new polls out of Florida finding the Senate and governor's races they are statistically tied a Florida is the one state I'm worried about in terms of both the Senate and\nI don't understand this obsession with Gillum by the way he stuck taxpayers apparently with travel cause this is a fundraising although he was getting a lot of money from but we all that's right we have breaking news on Gillum than I Do we owe undercover tape\nAnd then lying about their and they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we have those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care if they don't\nHave a lot of ... listen lying is is the part of it the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse\nAnd I look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and what does the media but now they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his\nStrong support for Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem were blown up\nWell it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm biased\nFor Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem were blown up well it's interesting I'm so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one for my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast\nA message over money and results right results look we have done with this economy\nOn the national international stages well with the president and when it comes of sitting down with North Korea\nHeading for nuclear as Asian or we would help\nOr making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from Tel Aviv Israel promises kept and being a shining light on the hill or were there was a lot of doctors for a long time still is but at least shining brighter we lead in the world others will follow a more prosperity and peace [laughter] um\nYou want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nThey got a lot of things to get our vote him look I take a vote for any Democrat in any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs his vote for below sea because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi boat with her\nI'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for ... um to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the cabinet hearings\nA look at the the agenda Democrats is is it it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of\nClass Americans they want it back they want to limit their eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just dash city considering they litter how many there are counties I read in Iowa that I'm seeing two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors in plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that\nSaid yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high\nThey can even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we have three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue\nRisk unknown and go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they can be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp\nFor hopefully not a Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care and of course what they've tried to keep on the wrong shot and you know this and are blisters now this impeachment\n... know that and then let us investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file a Justice Department and intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now and\nOne week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a ball the best to you and six days a it's tough out there nobody can predict what certain said but I Will tell you they don't I I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never\nYou never really have a feel for how the house is going to go up twenty men might be an exception\nWhere I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans had been out of power for forty years Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nYou know Sylvia look at history and this is what Republicans are up against that forty five retirement and a headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first midterm rather than like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving\nOf Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich force Clinton into what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington and I think the same thing\nKnow if you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty\nTo what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington and I think the same thing you know if you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty to an app specially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats are that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to me there's a brass means to poll out today I had to go back in double check it showing that African American support for the president is now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement if you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey Trump's approval rating stays at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range\nI think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not\nBefore and and all the media likes to go after asked me to say I don't know why he's a great guy in a smart poster but you know they say oh these are right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats mused on was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact\nOn the midterm elections but again it's all up to now the interesting developments as relates to the issue of the caravan [noise]\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico and are\nNow you have and I look there's always the most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey hope an opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to hero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that caravan want a better life and that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen\nThe president's been very clear um the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants and from Central America and elsewhere are\nYour um the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants and from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday\nThe Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they make lip point two percent\nOr you know less source our quarter reporting that she identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos\nThat would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U.

politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happened\n[noise] yeah it's it's just ridiculous that's what\nIs essentially what she's running on and uh and so we're we've been doing everything from going door to door I think over eight thousand houses personally I'm a second pair of shoes or we need people to come to make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know do you know we're off the dot com come help\nYeah what uh what do you think do you get a day by day return in terms of Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there\nWe don't register my party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and are in our people are voting but so are there's clearly asking a master and so we really got to get people to mail and about anybody listening to us right now if you haven't senator but I'll do it now I get your family to do it all your friends get it in because\nThe sooner comes in the same work take off your list a heartless do when you get to the heart cases who may or may not vote must we talk to him\nWell she's just writing running basically on Haiti as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess he wants to impeach the president he wants open borders she wants to crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running\nWell that is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the ad obviously we we we don't have a state income tax in our state she favorites that that's been turned down nine times by the public here but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nOr you know and she thanked me all the time for a\nFor not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in I lost my health care myself my wife and my\nMy four children and I ended up with a lousy plan that cost two and a half times as much as they can cover things I Want covered covered things I didn't want covered twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business we can possibly get\nSo you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician deciding for you it's called freedom\nYou know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies Tracy people around the country or are we get so you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician disparity for you it was called freedom well\nListen we wish you the best they don't see a that is the difference in the butt to aim Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi\nI keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because they'll electric speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for sure so I Hope the people in Washington state's eighth district get out there for Dino Rossi oh I Know you have

lifetime just thinking about Maxine Waters is the head of financial committee to think about that for one second just a brief diversion so\nI was thinking it might be nice if on election night you hosted your own show and I think we should take a poll and see if America would like to see host your own channel\nOkay well we'll see what you're saying is which is a benefactor all my twenty three years at Fox is I don't work on election night this is true and it's all Fox News division that takes over\nAnd I went one year I went in and uh you know I was on for five minutes and I'm like I I Want to be home alone and I want to have my three TV sets off for depending if I can set up another one in the meantime\nAnd my six computers and I want to do what I always do I want to be looking at percentages and finding out beforehand whether we're winning or losing\nNow the former president of Fox News bill shine can attest to the fact that has emails to the fact\nThat I have called it right before anybody else every single election year because\nYou know I'm sitting there looking at let's see uh\nUh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida and I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important races Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi means to heart\nRacist Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand\nWhat a Speaker Pelosi means to heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you want running your country then by all means staying home listening at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is\nWe are going to rage their ... well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad Republicans that they don't go out and vote well\nI have very very sad to say she's already picked out on the show has got to think however\nI'm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is with the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely\nThere is an unknown Trump factor all bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been on calls me I never get called for a poll and polls you know I look at them\nI Know a conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats to take the house\nUh but I also know that they got it wrong and two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't pay the spirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind\nAnd go out there on the field that's why we play the game and you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight yeah because you can't\nDraw you cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote oh I Can't complain because I'm basically I'm not talking about you everybody knows you vote\nHas nothing to do with the voting I hear your oil we can do is informed people it has everything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with every but my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part\nWe know we're in a blue state so we do the best we can still voting or whatever your feet to the are civic duty\nAnd but I Am saying look look at where it's important to look at what states presidents do whatever the he's not doing eight states Lebanon rally blitz California Florida Iowa Ohio we all need you go go when you know at the end for example we sucked up Obama\nEight states that uh Lebanon rally blitz\nCalifornia Florida Iowa Ohio we all need you go\nGo when you know at the end for example we sucked up Obama for eight years it wasn't good for the country we will we would suck up a Nancy Pelosi as speaker one more time but I'd rather not I'd rather keep the progress that we've made the last two years going keep the momentum going", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage",
