Scott Perry\nKnown it because they can't when they can't they can't win on the electoral basis we saw that with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton that was the last straw\nFor the George Soros is in the far left the media matters all of these people once they went down in the presidential election that all of them thought they were going to win because they have the media in their pocket and still do\nThen they said you know why we got what band and um the free market place we are now going assassinate people and this is very similar to what happened in Germany and bringing them back to the\nLast thing that you you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that\nAnd this is very similar what happened in Germany and bringing them back to the\nLetter saying that you you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that people today are like not the killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying ... propaganda miss I'm certainly when demonization very different from saying that they're a death camps\nIs look that can't happen in America and thank God because our structure is still in place to prevent anything like that happening\nBut I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros behind the scenes with tens of millions of dollars alright funneling into agencies that are bent on destroying human beings and we talked about this last time I was on a program what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery American should pay attention to that because of that guy can go down on uncorroborated are uncorroborated than anybody in this country can\nAnd as you rightly pointed out to try to with Trump on the Russian collusion that's collapsing all over the place the fusion GPS guy put out a dot CA taking the Fifth Amendment now won't testify what does that tell you okay so you know we're living in a dangerous time let's\nLet me turn it into this you're I'm agreeing with you that that what really got exposed to me that scares me a lot then there's two things one is we ever do justice system we don't have equal justice\nOr equal application of our laws ... look at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever but the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon\nAll principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served us so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republicans for the first time in their life did something right they handled it with the seriousness the topic deserves\nThey were thorough they did it right and at the end of the day there was no corroboration to the allegations being made and now we see people like what Eric Holder kick them we can't be civil Hillary Clinton\nGetting their face Cory Booker or Maxine Waters used the these cabinet people you get a crowd\nAnd you follow them into the grocery stores department stores gas stations in you\nPoker or Maxine Waters used the these cabinet people you get a crowd and you follow them into the grocery stores department stores gas stations and you tell them we don't want to know where any more that's what she said no we're going to use\nIts amusing that you ran down the list and we are we could at ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke about the Republican candidate for Senate they're um slam dunk ... a reporter [laughter] you know\nAnd it was obviously said ingest and no press goes lie all crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over look\nNot overlooked it they they do not Harris\nYeah yeah well because now they're in concert there the the American media is in concert with the Democratic party\nAnd that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic where the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting a political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know a dozen no I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty sixteen I said it's absolutely possible that Donald Trump is going to win then they ... than the five\nDays a on a factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and near there even gonna stay home or vote against her and not to exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say it on your TV and radio show but what you're\nGoing to say it then they're going to attribute it to me and then I got an ally and had a lot so wryly say the stuff he won't do you have\nNo idea what I'm going to talk about it because nobody ever does and nobody tells\nMe I don't even think can you or me be either know what we're going to say but court before comes flying out of our mouths now\nBut what would you do every day I mean you're you're putting in four hours a day doing commentary and then you have to go home but\nYou have to have unbelievable security surrounding you that should never happen in a free society\nNever been in this film you're not the only one to talk about it yeah right you know I mean it\nWas something else have you on the comedy is going on right\nOn and the conservative commentators are all in danger and and this is you know to me\nHow many lives on right on and the conservative commentators are all\nIn danger and and this is you know to me I mean I'm saying to myself I just got to be exposed number one and it's got to stop number two and you can't have people telling a emotionally disturbed individuals hey surround them when they were in a restaurant\nI mean that should be marching orders should be investigated by the ethics committee or the house just for saying that\nBill we're seeing now and two major cities many riots break out\nWe
