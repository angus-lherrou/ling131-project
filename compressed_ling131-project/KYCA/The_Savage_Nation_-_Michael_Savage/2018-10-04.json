from well Dr ... Diane fraud stains false accusations fell apart on them\nSenator frauds things accusations blew up in their face or they they demand an FBI investigation and the Republicans call their bluff and said okay we'll give you one\nNow that the investigations are about to be hidden and they won't even released that one that's a big one wire all the senators saying don't release the investigation what ally they're putting out McConnell now are saying no don't release the FBI investigation of cabinet\nWe agree with Dr for US Senate approached him why one of his Republicans doing are they catering now in other words the FBI investigation probably exonerated cabin or from these charges of rape and such\nSo why are they not releasing it so what have they done they now come up with a new tack to attack him he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court and I want to ask everyone listening\nLet's say you were just excoriated in public ripped apart lied about destroyed and you get up now and you meet some of those accusing you\nWhat would you say to them thank you oh you'd be angry that they're saying is angry media showing his mailman is showing his humanity in essence is a

and that you are the camel Harris they said was going to run for the presidency I can guarantee you America sees that she's an empty skirt\nShe seemed to be what she is a vacuous individual nothing there there's nothing there\nShe was a small town prosecutor who was picked hand picked by the Democrat machine and they ran are up the flagpole she's gone I can guarantee you she'll go nowhere she's too vacuous another one who who flamed out is Cory Booker called themself Spartacus you gotta Spartacus moment\nBut he went further he's shown himself to be an uh actually idiotic\nI Want you to listen to Cory Booker listen to this carefully he says that Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence doesn't matter you shouldn't be forced out right now irrespective of whether he's guilty or innocent now this means Cory Booker believe was\nNot in the rule of law but the ... in the rule of the lawless and then the rule of the market in Marlboro how can anyone vote for this man so I think both of them have now disqualified themselves of four\nOr any serious consideration beyond what they already are doing here is Cory Booker saying that Mr cabinet or his guilt or innocence doesn't matter listen to him and all three astonishing\nWhen it's temperament had been revealed in an ... where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of [noise] and not only\nNot whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial to fall asleep in how the question the rain that we should not move on to another candidate for this is\nBeyond comprehension so they've been found out to be liars and attempting to pin the tail on him saying he was a rapist than it is to know that that didn't fly so now they're saying because he reacted to being smeared he's not qualified to be in the spring court ladies and gentlemen the Savage jury let me ask you something if you had been\nPublicly excoriated humiliated lied about and you had a chance to answer some of these questions what would you have done sat there

doesn't scream and yell at people you think that which is not used to temper tantrums for the day they forces that are on the American public are you joking\nClosed doors thinks she doesn't scream and

process started what's now called\nThe Tom sure cancellation industry\nTom shares the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end what are you my timeshare you gave them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual maintenance and assessment\nFace sound crazy the crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your family is now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity\nOf the media you mistaken every poll I don't care which side of the aisle is conducted by shows the same thing\nThe respect or the ... the the I don't even know where right where the respect as the wrong word their opinion of Congress is at an all time low the average person's opinion of the media is lower than that of Iraq dropping in the New York sewer\nPeople hate the media and last night we hit a new low a new low in America below that it actually is worse than anything I've ever seen about why my republic which was so generous that the average German who was not an extremist by the way you have to understand something about the rise of Hitler the average German hated Hitler\nIt was only a small fringe that put Hitler forward\nGerman who was not an extremist by the way you have to understand something about the rise of Hitler the average German hated Hitler he was only a small fringe that put forward the middle class German was repulsed by Hitler\nBut the the generosity of the ... hour period in Germany reach such a fever pitch that even middle of the road Germans said enough is enough and they started to rethink their moderate positions they couldn't take it anymore\nSo we have no longer any gate keepers in the media except to block conservatives like me for oil outlets in the media is still America while I'm On the radio you got to understand something\nThat I'm Still standing here up to twenty five years of being as graphically honest as any person in the history this media as open as I Am is almost a miracle it actually is a miracle\nIt is a God pocket God part of the red states from Michael me in Nineteen Ninety four and here I Am in January is going to be the same it will not be the same my show is changing dramatically one hour of radio one hour of a podcast but many stations\nThat have been desperate to drop me will be dropping the show some new ones will come along I'll be very clear with you it's all political make no mistake about it\nAnd the radio media landscape and move in the same direction as Fox News center left instead of center right that's what's gonna happen across the media landscape center left instead of center disastrous era\nOn many many levels [noise] so now we see what happens when you stand up to the establishment Andrew becomes degenerate and sick\nAnd you say nothing about it you are allowed to function in this society but if you speak out against that you yourself become the victim the truth dies and along with it the truth teller\n\nLast night Trump gave a speech in front of a crowd\nAnd while he is right about what he said about Dr fraud the optics are awful he went off the rails now mind you I'll repeat what I said he's a hundred percent right in what he said about Dr fraud he does everything right from the heart\nAnd since this whole for Kavanaugh thing began he's been very measured in his comments he really didn't take sides always the front of the cabinet and always giving credence to Dr fraud and heat we asked to Democrats in waiting another week so the FBI could investigate these claims again\nI Want to repeat Trump is right about what he just\nAnd heat we asked to Democrats and waiting and other weeks or the FBI could investigate these claims\nI Want to repeat Trump is right about what he just said last night but the optics are awfully went off the rails you see in front of an adoring crowd in Mississippi he mocked Dr frauds testimony\nTo the tremendous applause we heard what happened every news Cast Lead with us all of the ... media outlets all twisted sister's in the news business\nWe're having panel discussions on Trump's horrible treatment of sexual abuse survivor he gave them the father they were looking for\nNow this doesn't affect solely the media or the Democrats but demon cat voters who are already looking to take out Republicans and the demon cat fringe activists\nWho are loudly confront the Republicans everywhere they can run into them\nAh it also feed his reasons for guys like Jeff Flake stir\nAnd Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to not support cabin or in a vote on the floor I think it was a terrible miscalculation on the president's part and I have to ask why does he do this\nWhy is it that when President Trump is in the White House setting he controls himself but when he gets in front of a crowd\nHe makes you believe you on a telephone to a television personality your calls him all the time and I think that's the problem\nI think what happens he goes off the phone from his TV personality goes on a stage after getting pumped up I Am I think she's on television when he's not he has to think about the consequences of what you're saying\nAnd so as I say to you this is a very difficult time to be in the media especially when I'm Michael Savage and the Switzerland of talk radio right that one down I declare myself the the Switzerland of talk radio\nWhy do I say I'm the Switzerland of talk radio well for one I'm not a registered Republican I never have been\nIn fact uh I don't go to Republican events I generally don't like Republicans\nHowever in the times that we are in and there's no clear a choice than ever as to the safer party for most Americans and that is certainly not the lying filthy degenerate Democrats the ... the it's a terrible time to be the Switzerland of talk radio I'll tell you that right now\nAnd the phone number here is uh what's the difference with my phone number is what's the difference

that Lackland Murdoch took it over you're gonna see heads rolling out of that studio he's a super liberal from London\nHe does not want some of the people who are on Fox News to remain and they've known the actual is gonna fall one day wait until you see what happens in the next few months\nI don't know what they're going to do once they get off phoned news I don't know where they're going to

to be a recommendation or a conclusion made by the FBI we learn that from Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety One\nBut that wasn't the purpose of any of this their hope their dream their prayer was that the

war against free market economics air war against the individual liberty in other words there are at war with everything that judge Kavanaugh stands for and both like for on the Supreme Court\nTherefore not only that he'd be blocked you must be destroyed because if he's allowed to access to the highest court well that means that the left is no longer going to be up to us the highest court in on my end to slam through their agenda because lord knows they can't necessarily get it to the ballot box\nTo for decades they've been lying on the judiciary in order to affect their left

Clinton\nMe to go to a broader actually allegations were ... they get it by ... by the\nNews may not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them\nWell that need to go to a broad range of allegations were already and they get hit by this hour on by the\nTime he was made not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them if this is the new standard Jonathan\nNo because that's not our authority that those are local crimes that happened now in the case of winning Roderick though however um he would that would have been a state matter because that the time a Bill Clinton was the attorney general\nYou know and so but here's the thing is that you keep saying and and Daniel okay but here's what you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this if you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate but if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative sex there are none\nAnd there is not going to be any because it doesn't matter\nWho you question the very people that uh the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so as you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or heard here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence\nThat case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally ... the the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the that's the thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do\nLook look I agree I think that one thing that's important to cut back to this was a standard here this is not\nA criminal investigation uh they say is an investigation than to conduct that may or may not had bearing on way to get a lifetime appointment [laughter] um and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extremely political an extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\n... is an important question do you have any corroborating witness for any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat isn't on the question that as an\nSeem really by an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... well I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is is on shit I'm at question I'll tell you why didn't you know because people are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case\nI think what it is is I Want you to make question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there's no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passion about something if somebody says what other information do you have that courage intimate question because\nThere is not and the FBI who is to create it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have ... ... it would be them\nRight and our inside there is no corroborating evidence as to where the judge was on any given guy with the he was there and I think I think people are emotional for for ...\nAnybody actually has a copy of is\nSummer calendar that year but we don't have an exact day anyway so right right and you know what you're saying is you know he has to prove his innocence or\nIs he innocent before proven to be ... they haven't been proven guilty what what do you believe it is and will proven guilty again so

different there are countries where you are guilty until proven innocent um I things have gotten so overwhelmingly over the top so extreme in each case where where judge Kavanaugh has been accused and\nThe accusers mention names of people and whatever evidence that they would have to corroborate their story it has fallen apart each and every time\nWe watch this man go through the agony of crying repeatedly on national TV Now we hear some senators saying well he may not have the temperament look at how angry he was when he was defending himself\nWell I I don't know what they sing the appropriate response is if you're accused of drugging young teenage girls and systematically raping them on an almost weekly basis I don't know what the appropriate response is but I think if I was innocent and somebody said about me I'd be pretty pissed off\nAnd I want people to know I Want people to see the righteous indignation in in me that I did not do this\nAnd the passion that that that is behind that those words that I Am speaking that's not me that's not who I've ever been that's not who I Would ever be I'm not that person I never did that\nHow do you say that in a way I mean it's supposed to say it like ... minutes of these charges\nNobody's going to believe that most human beings as I felt the judge Kavanaugh as the ... role I bet you he's never been that angry and emotional and his wife\nBut the circumstances warranted it based on the seriousness of the allegations against him I don't know any other way that a human being would otherwise react\nAbsolutely I call back right since ... exactly believe that I Believe that the man has spent his entire life whining can be a guy and he did everything\nI call that righteous indignation they are quite believe that for\nI Believe that the man has spent his entire life wanting to be a judge and get everything that he needed to do to get to that position and he is also like you said on multiple occasions the justice system they flock to itself it\nIs intended to protect the innocent and instead what we're seeing if he is absolutely being attacked by them very laws that she has spent his life upholding which is you the\nThan defendants does not have to prove their innocence is on the prosecution to prove someone's guilt and they're completely flipping that the tide and we cannot\nSue for a second Michelle that he gets on the Supreme Court\nAfter going through this experience and he's a judge and\nNow he more than anybody I think it's going to have a heightened sensitivity to the idea of the presumption of innocence right I Wonder in many in a weird way God works in mysterious ways\nThat he may not come one of our best justices ever based on this process and based on what has happened to him and his own life experience with this\nAbsolutely I completely agree I mean especially once you bend the truth is that many you can understand how it feels to be treated and when you're innocent um you know end up against it and I mean he is the highest level in the land that somebody that they get\nPulled over on the side of a road you know he's being treated by police officers somebody who has spent
