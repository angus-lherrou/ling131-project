that get government out of the way and let people do it they were born to do\nAnd I I look around me and I'm I'm listening every two and four years and then judge Kavanaugh on Robert Bork and and I'm

tinder and social media what kids are doing on\nOur website it's all very overwhelming and your\nKids have to remember that relationships are requiring that's been an all the\nValues that we value so

try to get some calls and listen to this\nYou know people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats I have a uh I I have conversations that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it it is a limit to amount of jobs are so that the fathers will lose their jobs and they say\nWe'll give you more money for having more kids in your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner re\nJust shot a now you ...\nWhere people called ... which is actually

middle America strong\nI mean this this thing made me a billionaire and I could have lost two hundred million dollars walking away from that deal but even with that I knew it was more important to me that takes a chance to walk away from that deal than I have no fathers in Chicago with no home and when we do have written a reformation\nFor no cause it's a it's a ...\nRehabilitation 'cause they didn't have the ability and the first place we never had anyone that taught us we didn't teach us that we had no in the town that's\nRight so I'm a it's more important than any specific deal any anything that we bring jobs into America\nOne of the one was that I Love that liberal tried to do [noise] bloodline or try to control a black person to the concept of racism because they know that
