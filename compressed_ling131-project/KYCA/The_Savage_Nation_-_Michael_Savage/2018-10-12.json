you saying that a person can defend themselves\nIf they're self they either you have to be calm when you do what you have to be professional you can't be acting at your own anger you know that's it's it's it's got to be in the realm of what any normal person would do which you know but what\nIf the guy as I say is over six the and the mob is people in their twenties and thirties ... there's no equal forced to that\nNo I think that people whose cars were seriously ... particularly the scene where the cars being pushed the guy is leaning against the trying to stop it and they're swarming the car on that one and the one where the guy got out of the car in both those instances I think deadly force um was on the table\nBut we're not recommending deadly force on this radio show and I will I Will cautioned everyone listening to the following I'm a very smart woman said to me once you want to know that person for the rest of your life you know there are do you want to be righted you want

streets masked mimicking terror groups or just the past what what's going to happen at some point people have to stand up\nAnd that's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nThey'll keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics has you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw police officers sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing ... why do you think that was\nA I think he to me he looked angry I bet his superiors instructed him to stand down unless something actually erupted and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks\nBecause the problem with that approach is that the attackers these rioters cut it anytime lose it and attack somebody for somebody getting out of their car or in the car can lose their temper or be scared and then the violence has already happened and then the officers respond it's too late\nPreemption is the key to preventing violence we know that\n... all

mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some whiter she's just doing it and they just friends to come and harassed us they come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I think have a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening [noise] I Would pick up a knife and disguise it in my hand and up because I'm not going to get hit sitting down\nAnd I would politely ask for him to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the

right to bring the level of that office down to the guts are\nIn my humble opinion now of course you'll disagree with me just to disagree with me but this is part of the cultural degradation that I

the way they should not have been and shouldn't have happened\nNumber one [laughter] but I Would wish that there was a secret service agent or would have prevented the rapper from grabbing the precedent for this I look at the president's face in the picture he is extremely shocked he's horrified by the way that the guy got so close to um do you understand how dangerous this is where the per say oh I'm wrong look at the picture\nI grab the screens shut up and I'm having to put a areas rapper violate Secret Service protocols it's on Michael Savage dot com and if you think I'm wrong look at the president's face he shocked\nHe shot the demand got him in a hug where he's got his left arm over the president's a left shoulder he's got his right arm holding the president's right hand the

show again because then the movie is coming up\nI'd be very curious where they think about this because this goes way beyond the optics of the picture this\nGoes to a breakdown in our society it almost every level nobody seems to have any value is left no one seems to know what's right or wrong no one seems north knows the difference between north and south no one has any dignity wherever you're turning everything's breaking down from the top to the bottom that's that's that's my opinion\nThat's my opinion Rosie Rosie on line three you disagree with all had please you're on the

got it all wrong and I don't think the president's going to gain any votes from it I think he's gonna he's not going to lose any votes but he's going to have a lot of people walk away feeling sick\nBecause if we're defending him and defending American values aboard his language and culture what you could argue that rap music as part of American culture you we'll be right in saying that but I Would say it's in the wrong direction it's taking America in the wrong direction of culture\nAh and I don't care about race at all you want to make it racial go ahead and make it whatever you want because that's all it's on your mind I Would say this if it was a a a person of any any any race and if he wanted to have some one of the arts in there with a large following there are other choices besides a rapper whose lyrics are disgusting\nDisgusting do you think that I'm Alone in my opinion maybe on the first thing the only want to say it today but I can guarantee you won't be the last look at the lyrics of this rapper I Can't even read them on the air I Need you I Want you come to me ecstasy\nEcstasy ecstasy ... or ... ... ecstasy ecstasy she\nPushes drugs he pushes group sex he pushes ah everything you can imagine that we don't stand for that's the message you think belongs in the oval office I can read more lyrics if you want but I'm not going to do it on the air they're all

confirmed that and again it's not just one or two or three and half a dozen of these people\nAre inside the campaign office they have confirmed that the people are real\nAnd and then of course you have the bonus material with his brothers and staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe says quote we don't say this out of these walls\nHe says will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that he's going to vote with the Schumer wing of the party one she gets elected kind of see they don't want them even the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer Democrats so all this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know you you think back in and you'd think Peter Struck and he talked about smelly Walmart Trump voters and you think abiding just what like last month saying that the Trump voters were the ranks of society by\nLosing in court and in a court of public opinion these forces of intolerance remained determined to undermine on rolling back the progress you all may\nThis time they're not you have an ally in the White House this time they\nAre small percentage of the American people virulent people [noise] some of them the drugs in society\nDrags innocence either so then you've got smelly Walmart people ... society era deem Abul deplorable that we now learn

with you know we've got Eric Holder saying a kick them\nA Obama once famously saying that you know these are bitter angry people cling to their God guns bibles in religion I mean there's such hatred in contempt for voters there's another tape we showed last night James I don't know if you saw the show we did run your tape and thank you for sharing it with us\nBut an Arizona democratic senator a Senate candidate name's Kristen cinema\nLiterally caught on tape and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona crazy and it's even worse than that\nBecause we found out Fox News dot com reported

represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the nineties for plotting to blow up the UN and FBI building and more\nWe're going to invite that person to\nYou know I mean it's unbelievable to me what they're doing is they're just outright lying to people\nBut they have to show on that that's the the whole purpose behind our organization Vera ... exposed the real nature thing the reality\nAnd the motivations behind these people and and they have to lie and the red states it's not that the Democratic red state Democrats have to lie in order to get elected and when they get into the parents\nDon't want a way they don't have a yes or no\nBut they have to mislead and misinform the voters and and again it's so if people think that it requires all this espionage it does and you walk into the offices and just ask the question the staff first of all tell you the same thing with\nThe last April we don't actually believe this and if there's one thing voters won't tolerate Sean if there's one thing\nLeft left or right thing because it's just so self evident you can't lie to people you can't lie about what your intentions are you have to be honest and they cannot get elected they said we're not\nIf they are still no you're right if they if they said what they really believe they'll never get elected so whatever you do it's like uh they just it's an

your earlier marks about a Florida and everything and uh you said help is on the way that's actually our message to the people in California that\nAvenue some political class has resulted in the highest housing prices the highest gas prices water is\nBeing rationed in California you're right he's proposing new of\nRationing the water because of the delta smelled so I went out there and Devin Nunes has districts is a great guy and if you're in the in the San Joaquin Valley I was out and I did a show from there a couple of years ago when then farmers to couldn't form because they were saving water for those little itsy bitsy fish called the delta smelt\nWell that's part of it Shawn but they haven't built a reservoir out here in Thirty years imagined California if it hadn't built a road in the last Thirty years can you imagine what the congestion would be like it's it's all horrible anyway and but they haven't built a reservoir and we built one desalination plant that\nTook Twenty years because a lawsuit and regulations and you know we've got to do more just sell nation we got to do more recycling we got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all there is to it and what the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to save a little tiny fish which is wonderful but we got to live\nWith farmers got a farm and it has such a big part of the California condor may mean you're growing oranges and avocados and and all sorts of other you know strawberries and\nAnd fruits and vegetables you may not know this about me but I Lived in Santa Barbara five years of my life when I was broken and have you know I was a porous guy in Santa Barbara at the time but\nUh I Love the weather out there and when I had my first orange picked up a tree which I stole a it was like uh not bad I think I've ever had in my life um let me ask you this so you have a Thirteen and a half percent state income tax rate out there you are a sanctuary state not a city hall stayed\nAnd now they're avenues to ... free health care for everybody's busy putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here will take care of you know\nI saw that the Newt has said that all the other governors around the country are probably\nHealth care for everybody is is he putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here will take care of you and\nI saw that the Newt has said that all the other governors around the country are probably for for a new so so they can send anybody who is ill to California\nAnd our tax payers pay a their health care you know that's ridiculous shot I mean even for months that they didn't want a single payer health care but you know new is basically just offer anything free to anybody and in the process what he's doing is he's going to make California even more on affordable than it already is a\nI think the people know that this guy mismanaged San Francisco you didn't fix the homeless problem there he's personally compromised he's a\nPretty much an empty suit was put in business by a billionaire Getty family and I think people want somebody like myself I I struggled I built a small business I've got results in the private sector or and I think that's what people are looking for\nHow come the people of California then maybe I should ask the same question to myself because we're not far behind you in New York state with nine point nine percent by the highest income tax rate why did the people of California takeoff Thirteen and a half percent income\nState income tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know California has had an exodus of people\nTo ask ... only ... in Illinois what everybody's saying in Texas and Florida and then the Carolinas you can come but if you're going to bring your dopey dumb liberal policies with you know stay home\n[laughter] I don't blame them I talk to Greg Abbott about that he said there but they're they're\nThey're ruining the politics of that state although I think they'll still survive lets it we've got to make sure that California is affordable that it's open for business Sean our education system is now buying with Mississippi for one of the worst educational results in the\n... best if you'd be the best you know\nLook I don't know what the I don't know what your odds are I Will say this I I really hope that the people of California pay attention because you know putting a businessman in their California is one of the most beautiful states in the union and its spin literally being destroyed from within by politicians\nAnd I hope the people of California rise up and realize that this was happening to them and the idea is Gavin Newsom of putting out there are so dumb and so if the cost prohibitive that it's going to end up being a disaster for everybody\nIs that this was happening to them and the ideas Gavin Newsom of putting out there are so dumb and so it cost prohibitive that it's going to end up being a disaster for everybody and there'll be just the further mass exodus of tax dollars nobody's gonna want to be there so I we live on
