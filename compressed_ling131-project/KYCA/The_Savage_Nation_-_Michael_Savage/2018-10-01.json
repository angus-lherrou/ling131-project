at the thin why wasn't anybody in Washington and I don't really mean to politicians because they're not an economist for the most part but I guess really why wasn't anybody at the fed able to see this coming\n[noise] well yeah it's I think what the fed didn't see coming\nIs not that lean and brothers and other a broker dealers were in bad shape they saw that coming very much I think what they didn't realize was how big an thick this Web of derivatives that I just was speaking about and you mentioned\nUh laws and other um entanglement so first of all Bear Stearns where I think they did realize it but then on a limb and brothers at a later I don't think they realize how many strings would get pulled if Lehman Brothers plunged to the bottom of the sea which it did\nThey knew what was going to be bad I don't think they realize it was going to be as bad as it turned out to be [noise]\nJust speaking for myself I think that the fed chair Ben Bernanke he did a really good job the overall good grade in uh the worst imaginable time to be fed chair I Can't imagine a worse time\nAlthough the Nineteen thirties uh to beef and they didn't do very good either back then [noise] All right well that by but I Can't imagine the worst time in the modern era to be fed chair that went Ben Bernanke he was fed chair I think he did a pretty good\nIt's a beef and they didn't do very good either back then or well that by it but I Can't imagine a worse time in the modern era to be fed chair that went Ben Bernanke he was fed chair I think he did a pretty good job of the most people would agree with that and yet after a relatively short tenure he decided you know what I'll do something else\nDo you have any insight and insight into why that decision was made\nWell I think first of all it was you know you I'm sure it didn't seem like a short time for bed and knowing that they're trying to mine it was eight years\nOkay now that have been fed chair that have served more than eight years prominently Alan Greenspan he called her mind more than ... Eighteen years but yeah a lot of the Greenspan period was\nClass that I think the biggest reason is that um he was flat out tired or I don't want to say beaten down by the crisis coasts as you just said his performance after Lehman Brothers catastrophe if you start dating time from that forward was tactically good\nUh but he was he was he was tired of it was very\nUnderstandable understandable for sure moving to the president I Want to make a comment and get your response to it either impressed in watching Jay Powell\nAnd his media conferences are talking about monetary policy trying to communicate to the financial community and the country at large or he has a\nI mean I didn't know him well I Know you know him but I didn't know him at all and I think that he has been a really pleasant surprise in his communication skills are at those media conferences ah what's your take\nI think that's exactly right you know you never know because he was there on the board of governors for I guess six years before he became chairman but if you're a member of the board you're not meeting the press the way the chairman of the board\nDoes that now by the way as you know he's going to start doing it in the next year every single that may be out of it in every second so I think\n... if you knew him your best guess was that he would handle this well but you never know until you see it and as you say Bob I think he's handled it spectacularly well it it really he gets up there and he looks like he's been doing this for years uh\nYour point of view Dr Blinder this change in a thank you for bringing it up this change that Jay Powell announced recently that he's going to go to a media conferences every\nChange in and thank you for bringing it up this change that Jay Powell announced recently that he's going to go to a media conferences every meeting and\nI have to tell you a really good at it and I think it's a great idea what meaning does it have in terms of a monetary policy in terms of transparency from your point of view\nYeah well what it meant first of all is more transparency because there's more information coming out that sort of definition but the main thing I think\nIs that the markets can come to believe and by the way the fed did nothing to dispel well they said it verbally but their actions never dispel the belief that the only so to speak live meetings where the interest rate would be changed with the ones that at a press conference scheduled after them\nWhich was every second meeting now's not the worst thing in the world but having a press conference now after every meeting or make every single meeting live and thereby give the fed more flexibility\nAnd I recently now ... and by the way we are speaking with a doctor Alan Blinder a Princeton University author of one of the finest books out there about the two thousand eight or nine disaster\nAfter the music stopped that book is on the recommended reading list in the book section a bummer that comes available and Amazon dot com [noise]\nUm when we take a look at monetary policy we're hearing now more than ... we're hearing comments about well you know what we have to do is get the three percent that's a neutral mate or how much we do put on that\nI bought a fair amount of weight on it but the key thing there Bob is that\nYou don't want to read that as a target so I think that's a reasonable consensus maybe more than there shouldn't be you could argue but a reasonable consensus on the federal open market committee that a number around three percent represents neutral bought and this is what's really going to be much more important\nI don't think there's a consensus that just stop it neutral I think once we get a bit closer to three percent um and maybe we'll be close enough already a two and a half or will almost certainly be in December\nWhat but once you get close to three percent I think there's going to be a rip roaring debate inside the committee about whether the fed needs to go\nConsiderably above three percent or not and that's that's the much more important issue for them\nWhether the fed needs to go\nConsiderably above three percent or not and that's that's the much more important issue for monetary policy\nSo this is really going to become way more of an issue when we if we if and when we get to three percent and a growing economy\nYeah absolutely I think there'll be there'll be essentially no disagreement on the F O M C about getting less just say that they're going up and twenty five bases point increments at some point they got the two point seven five\nThen there's gonna be a real I don't know whether there'll be a knock down drag out but a real serious debate about going higher than that with some people thinking you know that's enough and some people thinking no that's not close to enough we need to go substantially higher and the biggest\nDeterminants of what they do when we get to that time is what inflation looks like\nAnd right now inflation is behaving itself that the peace III Corps number hanging in a two point oh it was looking pretty good\nIt's amazing it's exactly to the death toll place where the fed wants to be so they're happy as clams there\nIt's a little scary though it starts to make it look like they actually know what they're doing Alan\n[laughter] it wouldn't be a bad thing 'cause there was a time where people didn't think they knew what they originally [laughter]\nYeah maybe maybe what goes around comes around and maybe their turn our guest is Dr Alan Blinder Princeton University

report twenty to Twenty one across the country let's get Andrea on the line he's in Berkeley, California Andre you're on TALK around them blind or go ahead\nHello gentlemen thanks for taking my call question kind of the elephant in the room that nobody likes the guy is are are dead issue in the United states sovereign debt issue twenty three trillion and growing it's big all over the world\nTo me it's more than a wildcard um what is it Dr think about that as far as growth going forward I mean I mean just service thing that that I I Believe I read somewhere that if interest rates go to six percent the government could not\nMaintain its interest payments on the debt and you can't go bankrupt you can't write the debt off I I think it's something I I I just like to hear his perspective on things in regards to that issue\nGo ahead I'm sure a couple of things that you raise a whole host of complicated questions but let me try not to take too long and pick up a few of them\nFirst of all when you look at the size of the debt you want to take out from that it's not quite as big as twenty three trillion you want to take out from that the portion of the debt which is around thirty five percent of that one piece of the government owes to another piece\nOf the government you want to look at the death held\nThat held by the public is the way it's often called them the data but what that means is that you actually have to be able to sell into the marketplace and find an investor willing to buy it so it is a big number but it's not that big\nSecond point you raised about that surface as interest rates rise and they are rising and we think they will rise further than they are the debt service will become more burden some more of the budget will have to go\nThe debt service uh that I think is going my guess is this going to squeeze out some other kinds of spending because you must services that you must pay the interest on the debt\nFinally if worst comes to worse than I Hope we won't get there I don't think we'll get there but on bad scenarios we would get there\nRather than default on the debt or default on the interest payments did not meet the interest payments the United states is in the position that all the debt is denominated in you\nJust payments the United states is in the position that all the debt is denominated in US dollars and we can print them\nNow that's not a good outcome that's an inflationary outcome but in the ... if you want to think about what's the worst case scenario because of the huge national debt it's much more likely to be inflation than the fault\nOr get stuck around on blind or a Princeton University let's get down to a ... a chemical ... Iran with Alan go ahead\n[noise] yes thank you for taking my call\nA there's been a lot to talk in the financial media about the anniversary of the meltdown and my wife and I took the opportunity to look to the movies last night so the big shots and the other was the inside job\nThough it prompted a question are there any of those unregulated instrument still out there like credit default swaps thing and ... mortgage backed securities that we shouldn't be aware of\nBut yes there have been the kind of volume that was true back in the bad old days are but there certainly are a credit default swaps again importantly not nearly with the volume that we had then which was outrageous and there are plenty of mortgage backed\nSecurities but uh what an important point on that\nIs that just like corporate bonds there are good mortgage backed securities and then there's junkie mortgage backed securities and what I mean by that basically is the quality of the credit and the collateral stand behind them so I'm a solidly collateralized\nMortgage backed securities portfolio a portfolio of a subtly collateralized mortgage is lying underlies a mortgage backed security is not necessarily a dangerous instrument when they got dangerous was just where Bob started this\nConversation and a half an hour ago his packaging really junkie bound to the fault mortgages and then writing these securities on them I don't as far as we know there aren't a lot of those today\nAlan Blinder Allen I've never known and economist or not to worry so I'm going to assume that you are a an economist in that sense you traditional in that\nI've never known and economist or not to worry so I'm going to assume that you are a an economist in that sense you traditional in that you find something to worry about I'm Talking about financially of course not and I'm\nIn that context what worries you\nWell a few things worry me or I Would start\nWith the trade war which is not a financial event about what ... but it's but it's an economic event and\nUm it can hurt us and I worry that the markets are entirely to cope pathetic about it there was a time when you you'll remember that's not so very long ago where they seem to dance up and down on the trade news when it sounded more\nUh like warfare the market went down with the sounded more like peace the market went up\nThat doesn't seem to be happening so much any more\nTo me as I look at it the trade pictures looks more dangerous now than two months ago but the stock market is higher than it was two months ago so I worry about a rude or\nA day of reckoning coming there um I worry also less\nAbout a financial oversight or sorry an inflationary over shoot I mean do you were just pointing out that we've been growing faster than potential GDP for a long time what you didn't mention but it was implicit and you're asking the question is we're already at four percent unemployment how low can that go\nWithout causing inflation or we don't really know the answer to that but it's worrisome\nAnd if the fed is I'm\nA behind the curve as the idiom goes it will try to ... and inflation starts going up a lot it will try to catch up the federal not just watch inflation go up and up and up and up and that's been the cause of many recessions in the past\nAlan ... ten minutes here why was that the treasury did not issue forty or fifty year debt when interest rates were down at ridiculous lows was there a reason behind that you know\nI don't know I mean I Would if I if I were in the world I Would have issued longer that at that point now is this going to offend the treasury the Obama treasury and then the Trump treasury um\nI I guess the defense would be\nAt that point now if I could offend the treasury the Obama treasury and then the Trump treasury um\nI I guess the defense would be doing that is trying to out if the market out a curve\nBecause markets interest rates were so low because they were shorter rates are expected to stay low and to try to you're basically trying to beat the market when you do that right\nOr guest Alan Blinder a former fed chair\nProfessor of economics Princeton University and a research associate at

of the house Newt Gingrich is with us up he'll join us on the Hannity tonight will be broadcasting from the nation's capital again as this will turn out to be a historic week one way or the other um Mr Speaker thirty six days is\nElection day and I will tell you there's something I never ever in a lotta years now witness the anger and the level of anger that they exist on behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these\nTactics against Brett Kavanaugh um is that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises\nAnd the base over all these tactics against Brett Kavanaugh um is that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people that are wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there there are sprinkler steps here one is to communicate as you just did that this is about America\nThis is the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in whether we keep going forward or we return to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance\nAnd whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that work to move and the right direction or go back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama\nAnd then third I think the Republicans should have an eye open next week we'll have a sort of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected hero the next steps are going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and I think that there are enough things working\nBetween the administration and the house and Senate Republicans that we can put together a very good positive campaign soldiers are three part campaign which America do you want results versus resistance and a commitment to an even better next two years\nOr I miss this bigger things for being with us we appreciate your time as always eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program\nA when we come back my colleague my friend from the Fox news channel Tucker Carlson we'll check in with us we'll get his take on the news of the day a much more straight ahead as we continue from the swamp the sewer D.C straight ahead [noise]\nDebate the details of this or that tastes when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon Sanchez and Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be racist watch this has to be they're going to paint him as well within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron descent as as a racist you mean it was going to happen because it had to happen\nLot where there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad and Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know be like Republicans\nThe San Francisco racist you knew that was going to happen because it had to happen\nA lot of there there are a Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party subs a you know be like Republicans black cross a cost is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr by ... well the James Byrd add I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ... girls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them\nThat this was happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to where I went to school in one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive public gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the tenth one was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address the tend to\nWhat you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time it's football and you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh I really need to get to sit here and really\nIf there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in the space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him the codes to the nuclear arsenal\nHe was fat vetted and yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all\nMemory attacking Christine for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happened she named for people she says repressive off or say it didn't happen\nWhich is to actually shut all men are tacking Christian for it I'm just making the obvious point she\nThat this happens from him for people she says repressive off or say it didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions in the book it's a joke at is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know what's\nThat job well this is the way I either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor border saying but I don't have any recollection\nBut also a professor Ford identified one person and that was mark judge mark judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true\nNow they made statements under penalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about Mr Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed than they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect input filling\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGot to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake in where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but where the rats were the other night and Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but for common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and they they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much\nThe president Lana undercutting the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why is that for art and what are you afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at them as NBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and as Paul conspiracy all hate Trump\nUh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and as Paul conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and\nFox obviously I was a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions or their interviews where people give opinion [noise]\nUm we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to find new things to flush them out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life\nTo all my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts\nProviding every night and I see are dropped more than any other kind of explain what this means it's a really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get him elected curl up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never sent sorry and they never learn anything and so voters got mad at punish them and good for them but why would\nSo that's I that's what I think my job is is to explain what this means and I think maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think in the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I totally like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there are days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that like all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed to silence\nNot you know what I mean there are less\nThen we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be\nCrushed her silence why don't you know they're you know what I mean there are less than nine
