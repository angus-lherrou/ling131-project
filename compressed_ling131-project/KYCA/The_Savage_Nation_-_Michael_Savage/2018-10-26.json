logic\nLet's assume there's alone not out there who did it and we don't know what side of the aisle Iran\nWould they be likely a Republican we don't know a Trump supporter you would logically say no because it only make Trump look bad if he's caught why would a Trump supporter do this get caught and then make Trump look bad and it doesn't make sense to me\nSo it wouldn't seem to be left as doing

sang\nEvery one of them is giving a race to their employees or opponents or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we roll back on necessary regulations\nOr we could really open up the ... the southern chaired a responsible gas drilling a Governor Cuomo votes will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly Felch against it and this is how scary my opponent is again debate last night he ever voted four times\nFor government takeover of our health care which is single payer which could cost the taxpayers of New York this was bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's just sponsored the bill would only cost the taxpayers of New York\nNinety two billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt wouldn't call them [laughter] that's it and I do believe what Ninety two billion when we're already take half your money anyway a credible and many at all\nCertain it's just a solution that\nVoted for times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate you this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is a support the president he's not going to support the president he's going to support Nancy pillows either going to support the impeachment cock his he's going to China right now with all these Democrats you never shown that in fact on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was handpicked by Sheldon Silver for the job to get in the assembly now he's hand picked by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny none of them have come to the district to help him get elected but you know who came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had to go in there and his daughter a bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why a mom having you on this isn't the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in\nNorthern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican and you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district\nSo you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out there because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible and\nYou're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money up and talking to my colleagues power across the country the amount of money they're jumping introduced racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous to me and my opponent is outspending me\nI've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York uh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even an upstate New York where we haven't really tough economy I mean we are actually helping our small business community\nAre small business humidity is about Ninety eight percent of my life to visit says in my region and they create most of the jobs that just being held its ally by Nancy Pelosi\nThat somehow the wealthiest started the only ones benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts is because here's wealthy donors wanna leave New York because they're not getting a lifeline that they used to get\nThere actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight that says this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have the money to deceive voters and fool them into thinking that this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get the vote out its most important as we can beat the money but we need our Republican voters to understand that a ticket out oh it's really really important\nOr write or call the attorney or running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main\nYou know ground zero seeds that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things would have been with us and hopefully we'll send them back to Congress and eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves it we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nUm by the way just going back to direct or re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today a little more about that as the day unfolds here let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nThat as the day unfolds here or let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been in clinical sense whatsoever but the summit terms are on me and\nTo get out and about [noise] uh the end he hit on it every day I listen to it and not watch it or not but I\nLooked and I hope everyone feels the same way you do this for a hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home that's a half a vote for below sea in the Senate if you stay home a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve\nI've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world in the media\nYou know I see three scenarios that could unfold if I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win\nIf people identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then\nThat means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career I wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won by especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen\nAnd you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country\nAnd we're not going to go away and we're not going to cry we're not going to be the cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want to enlist investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's going on\nTo tell the American people the truth and then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote\nThis election season so don't wait I'm telling you what's gonna happen we know they only want Obamacare we know they won't open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states we know they want their crumbs back\nKnow they want higher taxes\nKnow they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things

you see this all the time with a lot of these illegal immigrants they played it down or they use their DACA status or you know if their children may use their children I mean I've got anchor babies I don't have anybody to take care of him you know they use this all the time and\nWe really want to talk about child separation edits and its finality um and the president was the one that fixed it even
