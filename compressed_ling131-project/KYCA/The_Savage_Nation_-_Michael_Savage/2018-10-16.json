member but it has everything you need everything I Need to look feel smell my best your best and when I Love even more is the fact\nYou know what I I I hate going to stores I really do especially you try and buy a razor and it's like a\nYou know an an act of Fort Knox for crying out loud to find somebody with the right key to open up the shaver box that they have half the time dollar shave club will deliver everything you knew your door\nThe executive blade as far superior to any blade you will ever buy in any store amber and it's about a third of the price delivered to your house they've got everything you need doesn't matter what you're getting ready for your hair they cover your head to toe your skin your face you name it they have a doctor Carver shave butter\nBut it shows up right at your front door you only pay for what you order they even now have toothpaste and toothbrushes and then\nYou order what you want and you don't pay less and it's a better product and you have the convenience of never going to store again and you can try one of those starter kits no obligation like their oral care kid or it can restock whenever you want a or you can start with ... and that gives you the executive blading Dr Carver shame butter\nAnd what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child they negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine at a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nIt's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas MD and Dr Lee as grows president of doctors were patient care\nI'm I Am at my pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones phone started ringing and we've got regular patients to\nYou'll have a lot of them to write\n[noise] we we have a you know a A R own panel there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it\nWell I mean so and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well all which has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ...\nI mean I pay them and they take my insurance is but they do it as more of our friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah at ... explain how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley stout\nA Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I have done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork that headache the hassle of the middle man so that now medicines are pity pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cellphone\nRight so this is now they implement how many places that you get this finally\nUp and running around the country I don't think you're explaining it in detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and it's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits free tele medicine's\nA flat membership freight based on age if insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits free tele medicine's so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasound heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesome medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they supported and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities eat is working Dr gross that's the point\nYeah it's working everyone but I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe former correct I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans Wachter healthcare chosen diagnostic Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have\nA better way through a direct primary care relationship\nNot as we leave this was the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America at the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income\nOne percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent\nWhat they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying from one check up year right out of their own pocket and also getting a catastrophic\nAnd then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying from one check up a year right out of their own pocket and also getting a catastrophic plan and God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr ...\nYep this is a one size fits all model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring medicines that costs a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower their price just like Fifteen minutes we'll save you Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd we're you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this up front pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know\nFor example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear is a calorie is not coming from Washington to save us\nNow from ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this move in the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nKnow well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know in the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great the great solution the health care after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me\nBroken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great the great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr Leah grows the probably one of the defining issues that caused
