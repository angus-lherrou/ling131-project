Republicans always support Ruth Bader Ginsburg gun and Justice Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nThen Republican nominee to get just get bull legit ... does it matter if there's any corroborating evidence\nYou know one thing is I'm watching Susan Collins a speech was so well thought\nOut based on facts\nAnd the standards that she uses to evaluate important issues maybe that's why she kept to herself pretty much the whole time nobody knew what she was going to do\nThat was just not a a non\nPartisan speech it was a speech in a row of\nMind or of the dignity that we can have them in spite of big disagreements\nAnd talked about the law the constitution the role of the Senate advice and consent\nAnd a little bit of class\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and you'd you basically described what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years from\nTomorrow I start my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\n[laughter] well ah you know I'm I'm In uh\nThirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox news channel\n[noise] well uh you know I'm I'm In a\nPolitical system this deteriorating\nI think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe say that\nThe biggest winner of this speech has the judiciary because her as a wholesale attack on the independence of the judiciary one at all costs what you saw that day was a person embracing the rule of law not the rule of the mob what you saw today was a woman not being intimidated\nWhat you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being said a strong woman which you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward\nBut this is as close to McCarthyism as I Hope for witness in my life\nAnd if anybody turned it around it was senator Collins\nOh you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came when they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh I don't think any of us will forget anytime soon the\nThings that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that\nRemember the accusation by Julie sweat and that was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug being girls lining up in halls gang raping numb and it happened frequently\nAnd I I Know that some people brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night how was one supposed to act if you're innocent to the\nCharge of drugging teenage girls and participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but I Would think if you're innocent it is one of the anger\nAnd and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody thought any of those will judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well yeah I think I think the most Americans saw a man who was\nFighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this went through a logical explanation based on a calendar that very few people in the world Cape except him and his dad and just a warning to everybody to know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life I'm not evil\nCalendar that are very few people in the world Cape except him and his dad and just a warning to everybody know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life\nI'm not evil and I think he reacted consistently be an innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out it was breaking news allegation number three at a very new and\nEvil level right so I saw it and I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party\nOr where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less than that made no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah Susan is going to be this way for a while to come\nRead it here's my take on it and being in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth\nShe said you know that makes sense ... to keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends not tell anybody and you've got to remember is ... and she worked through the process you took teach allegation on its own\nShe went to all the major decisions so judge Kavanaugh and spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a big say every I think they should be in every civics class in the country\nEvery high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins explanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days\nTo me senator a look at\nYour when Senator ... and I know how close you were to Senator McCain right now who recently passed away and I always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for president in oh wait over ...\nIt was the right decision then and nice name by the day I had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated\nThen I remember he said that how these people on radio and TV\nAnd you know I understood Senator McCain that you know he kind of had that side of them and I knew it really well\nUm but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last the teen days political is down to the ballot box\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this\nBallot box I mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this in the future is deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power too bad if what it says and say\nListen I went to the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape is serial sexual predator he is a very ... and logical judge I looked at everything they said about him I compared it to the facts and I'm voting yes here's what on what the voters to do\nOn the voters to remember what the Democratic Party will do to get power\nAnd that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America do you really want these people in charge of your government [noise]\n[noise] well I think that's a great question you know there's something you mentioned earlier I saw I I'd never known Susan Collins that well I Know that look look the Republican\nParty is not a model out for dinner if you want to and I'd love to I actually I I Am now is embodied today that\nI had no idea that the federal one is under which she makes her decisions and I are all that time I respect I ... I really have a deep per se but I Want everybody to have their own mind I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I hold passionate dear\nBut you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside in the halls and the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting\nAnd Maine is not exactly an a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and\nInfluence or and groups are pledging now to the vote her out of office and destroying her and I'm like that anybody listen to what\nSenator call just said that anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most thorough\nCase for for how\nAny senator or congressman should make a decision\nAgain a good example for a civics class to look at in terms of wait a senator should act but let's talk about the politics for a moment [noise] okay I talk a lot about sort of mind Kagan only because had tried to save the system\nTo be on those votes but I mean I Know but but you know you more than made up for it well\n[noise] okay I talk a lot about ... only because I've tried to save the system\nYou know you always have ... votes but I Know but but you know you more than made up for it\n...
