on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine where kill that's I'm afraid of and who are they going to blame it on than most say well we don't know who did it\nWe don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare monger and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it isn't me\nAll right but I remember that the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare mongering and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it doesn't me\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately I have been trying to tell America for a long time now that there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics\nAnd I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace they only know hatred and war\nBut I saw pictures of the illegals coming over with a new group from Mexico joining them and they're all strapping young men of military age and and clean the clothing that is what my headline was give us your tired your poor your gangbangers\nThat so what do you want me to say what could I as a citizen with a radio show say give me your tired your poor your gang bangers so what can they do so we have an a gigantic problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump\nAnd so far with thanking God that it was Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is surging toward the border\nThis is his Alamo and if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you left referred to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was\nAnd as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon\nIn order for Trump to stop this massive army of invaders and to make sure this is not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were finagle into signing the NAFTA deal with them because they're that horses out of the bond as they say in American parlance show how we got to stop these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you when you do you want a little tiny string about when Rome was broken into by the vandals and as a God's when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and a half would you like to be a little little history\nNow do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men barbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob of Fifteen to twenty\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers know rapists no killers\nAnd know gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical\nSo let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand\nA small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races\nSo why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly controllable I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you were in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have to arrange walking the streets but I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a pod cast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell this I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know where I go to the whole story now you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr or something that's a little you know small soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire entering into east and west ... as I describe in stock mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening very important for you to hear the ...\nThe empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't Jim doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome and it was already decaying socially and disintegrating merrily and then they face the barbarians on the borders\nAnd again it's just what happened next well all on the imperial frontier which ran roughly along the Ryan and then you enemies without pressing against the Roman borders\nNext well all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Ryan and then you enemies without pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes had come up to the right\nIn North Hungary where the vandals and what was once that Syria and is now Romania\nLive is a God so west Scott's behind those in South Russia where the east guts or asked her guts and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands and then there with the Mongolian people's for cigna way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nLet's go to graduate school together in thought for a minute\nWho do you blame out both parties you want to talk about both parties or cashing in on them on the illegal aliens for the last twenty five to Thirty years you'll have to spell it out for you why do you think that the Congress is doing nothing\nWhy do you think Trump won the election because we want something done and he said he would do it that's far he hasn't\nSo you can blame anybody you want\nTo me it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami of the early eighties and we're asking that Honduras Guatemala El Salvador empty the prisons and then not houses because if you look at the pictures that are so plain and the picture is worth ten thousand words\nAnd they're young strapping young men by and large with a few you know in the front women with carriages thrown in for a fact so that Jake Tapper can a Yankee or guilt chain\nAnd Wolf Blitzer can chime in and say hey that's racist but\nWe all know what this is it's an invasion\nSo what's an existential problem what are we going to do about it I'm not just saying it because of the current or it I mean I read existential isn't my ...\nAnd as a a girlfriend so I Know would existential ism is as if it's a wonderful phrase it's an existential threat was originally use the here in politics by Netanyahu with regard to Israel\nA number of years ago and he said it's an existential threat to the survival of Israel and then everyone picked up on it but this was a true a truly an existential

around they say the same they've they blame us to mediate ... because they want to put politics Trump's all in their world\nYou know political disagreements et cetera you know they shouldn't be marching orders to follow politicians and cabinet members and create crowds and confront them and tell them they're not wanted any more in a anywhere anymore\nYou know but if you'd call out the deep

but I find it really suspicious that you've at eight or nine of these things so far and usually the triggering mechanism for these devices is the actual opening of the package well there's been several open and none of them have detonated which tells me\nThere is some sort of problem so I'm hoping they're not real um and I opened up the authorities find them sooner than later I think\nWay I got searched go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that it look none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming\nThey have so much

able to capture because these things to knock that day and I think we'll see something so All right\nDr Gorka will you be it'll last word today\nBut bottom line is we run these people to ground we release ... how do we throw the book of them but it doesn't matter what side you're on\nThe the responsibility for the normalization of violence\nAnd started on the left when you have a former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they're down you kick them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil often we win the election nobody on the rise says that it's the left responsible if you put them normalize their stuff is\nI Want to thank you both doctors Sebastian Gorka congrats by the way our new new bestseller why don't you try to Feeding America is

nine four one Sean is our number if there's any chance of a great night on election night twelve days from now it has\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with him when it count so you know I don't like the counts\nAnd point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with him when it count so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote to\n... I don't know what let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat health care being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state\nSean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and matching said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving up big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters mansion says no one even on ...\nWhere people say oh well he ended up voting for cap and all the reality is he waited he actually left the Senate of voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast their vote and then and only then to Joe mansion step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically dead\nHis toe so I you know I kind of you know a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point he didn't vote for the tax cuts and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and it was important issues like tax cuts\nRegulation energy those are three main fundamental issues\nThat that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with the oil opioid issues and we'd have it with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joanne since first vote will be for Chuck Schumer and Chuck Schumer has made no bones about the fact that she's going to head out the obstruction\nResistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're empowering these liberals the folks that really created all the rockets during the Kavanaugh hearings\nPart of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're empowering these liberals the folks that really created all the rock is during the Kavanaugh hearings then you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on Joe mansion first vote because the you know he's not going to be with West Virginia\nAnd he's going to be part of a team that's tearing down the president West Virginians don't want that and that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia sick to try and keep in other words how much you're Schumer and company and below seeing company or are they investing in the negative ads about you\n[laughter] well they put a fortune and I think by a well by all accounts they're going to probably be up over\nTwenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final counts\nAnd that's what happened John you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again and we start to come back twelve to ten eight six to for that to you know to even\nAnd that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWindows Arlene voting but getting away or junior started yeah\nEarly yeah early voting started yesterday\nAnd so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans had a lot of energy and people know that the future of the Senate could really be at stake what this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it or not hockey\nBut we're going to work Joe mansion and people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest Washington did a liberal and he's never there when you need them\nAll right we're watching those race now put this in the top ... column a where we once thought it was a leading Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda versus Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and raised at this point and uh with early voting there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help\nA future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish you all the best Patrick Morrisey\nHey Shaun thanks so much than anyone interested in learning about or you know where Patrick Morsi dot com or take\nWas in the U.S Senate and we wish all the

of instability of the left things you might have forgotten the list gets longer and longer\nSanity tonight nine eastern on Fox quick break right back we'll continue twelve days till election day and we continue with the best election coverage available on your radio dial\nAnd we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour on this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left that the media routinely ignored\nAnd the hatred all new to the minute by minute second by second hour after hour a day\nMany of those on the left that the media routinely ignored and the hatred all ... to the\nMinute by minute second by second hour after hour a day after day Trump hatred twenty four seven\nWhich is now that it's a it's it's a psychotic pathology on the part of those in the news media they didn't care about that either\nI'm very clear you know I don't think the cabin on standard should be applied in in the case I Believe and due process still for even Allison even for Spartacus work insisted on this program\nThis Russia collusion Hillary Clinton paying for Russian lies we need to know about it\nAnd in this case people making threats of violence against the president or against any Democrat oh I'm the one that said ah investigated when bill when Brock Obama was president and I'm the one that electorate how we need to keep our presidents safe and secure\nWhen Steve ... shot on that ball fields and we found out it was a Bernie Sanders supporter I said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for what one of his supporters does that's not Bernie Sanders fault\nAnd you don't see the same recognition by anybody on the left they just wanna hyper politicize anything they can any minute of any data to bludgeon Donald Trump politically\nAnyway Danielle McLaughlin is with us as well as\nJonathan Gillum welcome both of you to the program and uh how many more weeks we're going to have another little baby Danielle McLaughlin\nGuys you know about two weeks out from it in our parents cannot allow thinking\nThere any truth to the room where you're going to NATO to name your baby ah Gillum Hannity\n[laughter] was it on a show and I get one had any\nLimits on Hannity at my work too well revelations [laughter]\nLooked at it\nThe real Haiti has been coming from the left it's been ignored by most of the media has been very little coverage I forgot to mention the severed head of a president they didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's just selective moral outrage being about Russia or being about sexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric for action so I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroy the president bomb the White House\nAnd I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nAnd you know I think this is happening on both sides and\nIt an destroying the president bomb the White House and I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nHaitian you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think that's no excuse for it you know I listened to cut the plate and people are hard at work and doing the same thing that we have to be like she ... about the extent to which the president has also made threats and it talked about violence\nAnd out of the last few months and then ... and what you do is you give me the the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very very specifically\nAbout all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say and\nEvery one of those you know as a matter of news CNN wouldn't let their anchors use the word mob well because that central planning for that none of Tony pointed to reality you don't win you know you don't mobs going after those people I Do I'm not going to defend it I don't think it's right ended a mile to be able to eight inside looks like a month to me\nI looked at I think the president should be telling police officers in Long Island to rough up space when I get in the back at a paddy wagon [laughter] you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most pot and journalists from across the political state I just people trying to you know\nWe don't respect but I don't see that I see a media that has been corrupted and complicit in\nAdvancing conspiracy theories lies and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you see John of them\nWill tell you one thing uh I I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs and that's a big difference in a mob\nMob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do with sort of thing but in this case these people have organization they don't just show up somewhere a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um\n[noise] uh it is to the the way that conversation isn't going over the past couple of days though I I Want to Sean I think everybody needs to look at one thing uh all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target\nAnd when I look at it at the response which you had and which are seen from other people\nAre when bronco bomber was in office um in in the case of the shooter that shot\nWhen I look at the at the response which you had and which I've seen from other people are when bronco bomber was an office um in in the case of the shooter that shot to\nUm the mystery squeeze 'em what you saw people not blaming Bernie Sanders but what you see here and I find that is so hard\nIs that uh these devices have been\nOut there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to ah to carry out a plan covert lead to put these things in place all at once\nAnd none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there but the organization of the rhetoric is so disgusting Louis the low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and asked um was this rhetoric\nPrepared it's a it's a very alarming thing was that I got Daniel\n[noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the printed and today I think that there is blamed the light across the entire political state try and and what I think regular people like me see if\nI go out and the world I deal with people who don't necessarily agree with\nI Can't my job's done I said I I work hard and somehow I managed to get around the world get around this country to get around my city without inflaming tensions are the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with the politicians that they cannot get their job is done without that kind of planetary rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it and this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says\nThe fake news a lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton Bruins through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit and it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels and you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host\nAnd he hasn't changed one bit and it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels and you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host\nPart of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we met at Obama when no one else would we ... the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving an opinion as part of what we do well like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when when something like this happens\nAnd all these Democrats are having these devices deliver to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the the ah down or where they have the headline a bullet with a reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump proposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this other automatically\nPutting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen I mean it it is it's it's it's such political\nUm this tasteful rhetoric\nThat when you couple that with the things like Madonna said with the things that are these politicians are are instigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never never said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words or so or inflamed it's not because of him it's because of CNN and MSNBC and these leftist politician that go out and\nPump it up to something that he never meant it to be we're\nGonna have to leave it there are Jonathan Gillum author of sheep no more thank you
