I'm watching I mean I don't even leave the house that's why I'm starting to look like Charles Manson my hair is growing there's nowhere to go\nI finish radio show in there and watch TV and because there are no ads I prefer a Netflix that's sort of ads and ruin it\nI don't even watch cable anymore I see are killing them I used to watch a movie on HBO no more\nAll I got his that sad you know government media complex adjuster I don't watch them the Showtime nothing is never good movie on All right so I watch Netflix so want it and I liked the foreign dramas\nAnd last night I I that was the end of it I I couldn't take it anymore I ... I was so desperate I was watching a thing called ...\nWhere one of the actors from the Sopranos did it a number of years ago someone mentioned that I didn't want to watch them I never liked the guy he plays guitar for Bruce springs for Springsteen Bruce Springfield whatever the guy's name as the anti Trump or as I Know they're left wing liars they'll like Robert De Niro rat pack you know what I'm saying that kind\nHow could these guys to be so stupid as the hate Donald Trump so much so this guy to guy looked like\nAyers they'll like Robert Deniro rat pack you know what I'm saying that kind\nHow could these guys to be so stupid as they have Donald Trump so much so this guy to guy looked like with the hair those the guitarists I never book does act there are characters Sopranos I liked\nHim was not one of them I never was convinced that he was convincing All right so it turns out that he conned someone and to making a series years ago ... about a mob guy was on the lam and he chooses to go to Norway or Finland I don't know no way no it\nIt's kind of funny in in concept and it's hit and miss it's not that good but just stick with it because some of it is good and I like the the snow and the trains and the scenery and I just want to see some difference I'm watching what finally last that I had enough\nI said this is garbage this is such trash or to even make it so I got man and went back to regular television and I watched um\n[noise] what was I saying before before the eggs are going to my head now I watch the um below decks which is about life on the table and seeing it on bravo right\nClinton you ever watched that below decks once in awhile no well you heard about it's about the crew you know and the captain and you're supposed to have a vicarious thrill like you're on a yacht\nHaving been on yachts I can tell you that it's hogwash it's all acted the whole thing is scripted\nBut you get a peek at some of the most beautiful boats on earth and that's nice\nAnd at the end of the day and you realize what a boring life it is so last night's episode was some guy from Silicon Valley with is ugly girlfriend and a group of people and they rent a boat about two hundred and fifty thousand bucks a week\nThat's what they cost would you leave it to fifty three hundred thousand plus costs plus a tip no less on the kind of money All right so they come on board\nAnd the next thing you know every second the guy as a a camera in his face they're all taking pictures of themselves they're obsessed with social media they're sitting in a chair the cameras rolling they're having a drink the cameras rolling there in the hot tub with a camera\nHow do people live like this and why would anyone care to watch that I asked myself but anyway\nI watched it for about Fifteen minutes with with interest because I'm an employer I Need a vacation between writing the book\nStop mass hysteria between nervously awaiting for it to come out amongst too late if that book it come out or because they would have been a number one bestseller on the New York times list everyone knows that\nA mass hysteria between nervously awaiting for it to come out amongst too late\nIf that book it come out or because that would have been a number one bestseller on the New York times most everyone knows that but unfortunately that's how it came out\nIt came out with the happiest competition that any publisher has ever seen I have three different publisher said to me the day that stop mass hysteria came out it was heading into the heaviest wins they've ever seen in the history of publishing that it made it to number Lebanon list as a miracle unto itself in the loyalty the audiences are overwhelming but nevertheless\nAh after the book and the book launching the promotion\nAnd now the election I haven't had a minute's rest I haven't had a vacation and ... and white I'm starting a new career in January would you leave that\nI'm always starting something new I never asked I'm like the tree Rolling Stone\nI really I don't get her any more so I'll tell you that so I Am starting a brand new career at this point in my life which is amazing most people would have retired and so you don't want to hell with it I don't want to know more than enough already\nThey don't want me on this station they want me on that station or start something new what do I needed for but I'm going to give the pod casting a shot because that's absolutely the future of broadcasting everybody knows that podcasting is going to be to the spoken word\nWhat cable became chewed the visual image remember there was first broadcast television and every two minutes there was an ad\nAnd then people came up with cable and then you'll start watching cable because there were no ads in the beginning remember that well part casting is sort of like that with the ads are interspersed in much fewer\nAnd much freer form\nAnd there's going to be a hybrid because I don't want to leave broadcast radio I Love broadcast radio like you're listening to me now on almost three hundred stations across America most of them\nHave programs are actors who are smart enough to carry the show in the one or two hour form it's not true everywhere some of them have such a political hatred for me that you will not be able to hear me in their market I Know I'm not supposed to say it but there I just did it's all politics make no mistake about it but hey in the market that we're in today\nThe show can be hurt anyway so it will be heard as a podcast and broadcast you'll be able to get it so I got to train you how to get it as a podcast it's simple\nLet's say come January and you don't hear me anymore and your station you just go to Michael Savage dot com as a box you click on it and it'll take you to one of eight or nine different pod casting the platforms or if you're listening to someone in broadcasting you go to them when you look for the Michael Savage broadcast it's that simple you can listen to it in a car\nCasting the platforms or if you're listening to someone and podcasting you go to them when you look for the Michael Savage broadcast is that simple you can listen to it in a car on vacation below deck above ...\nAnd that's it so that's a part casting is sort of like the cable television when it first came out and it's definitely the growth industry or the spoken word and truthfully I don't want to spend the rest of my life just looking for entertainment\nOr or am I going to do with my rest of my life not work I Love radio to me being on radio is like being on a
