and like I said that during the first half broadcast games like this where you have two teams that are used to score and a lot of points I mean Comey not coming into this game ah the least amount of

game of the year against answered in Seventeen points I mean usually these teams are scorned up around thirty points again and I just kinda figured that uh mainly the\nDefenses would win out uh the the theory here that night [noise] uh and that's exactly what's happening and of course we showed at the at the outset that this would be a really close to him and that really come down to the ticking game at the in\nFact I was just going to delay because [noise] [noise] did you got to wonder if you look at one point game begins next\nThing we can still don't loom\nIt could mean that could bloom big obviously you would think in the game like this are you from the ... were able to touch down in the second half would they immediately tried to go to uh go to [noise] so uh I mean if I was damn I certainly would\nBecause you know this was not going to be a high scoring game a ... and you know both teams are in the mid twenties I Would be very surprised\nTo find here when it comes to press

on in Flagstaff denied the eagles are at Coconino\nAnd in Coconino a wins that ball game that they have a shot at getting into the play offs to a there is a possibility that the Grand Canyon reaching for the first time could have poor teams in the in the playoffs I'm not sure that will happen but there's an outside chance it could\n[noise] and I went to\nWith coach Supreme such as this model serious match it's called the power point system works out I think comedy called for those of you or hurt our morning here on\nBasically [noise] he feels [noise]\nTournament which is always the team's coach firmly believe was one of these teams here in this field in the\nPlayoffs you say well\nThat that means Coconino wouldn't make it either been a shift if that was the case in case the bad news last night [noise] they'd have to drop four or five blocks from the PowerPoint rankings to not make it and then a million would have to drop three or four spots in the power point and [noise]\nAnd so uh it's gonna be interesting I was in and of course we need to let our a radio audience to know that the the Bradshaw mountain bears or show at number eight\nUh they're pretty much for sure of getting in next week\nEven though they're not playing tonight for the Grand Canyon region title\nFind we got the regular season me personally I don't know about doing it because I think I Would like to play on the regular season it\n\nUp getting a little ranking into power point's getting spot in the postseason than if you're having a little more control over [noise]\nYeah um [noise] you know and and

[noise] those injuries are they happen too often\nThe run up to forty three years\nIt was kind of a short can't it's almost like a similar honors are afraid of all the [noise] but it sure is the

it you would have been set forth in Thirteen yeah I mean it's a it's funny\nYou know Seventy six [noise]\nShame shame to again to them and it\nWas forty two yard line it looked like so challenging field and again you were mentioning earlier the cook county on the way I feel that they shouldn't sightseeing tonight coming down to the kicking getting\nAbout well let's say in in in that [noise] that was a combination of position in the kitchen in there that's how big a lemon yard or when you're on the forty two yard line we're not saying the badger if they were saying the maintenance forty two yard line the bathrooms are going to start this drive and maintenance territory [noise]\nThe way to explain things for you to hear from a soccer semi finals one Seventeen minute more Blue Ridge mistakes semi finals [noise]\nCourt from the time\nMore Blue Ridge mistakes semi finals [noise]\nFrom time to ponder\n\nThat rollout plan is to ... to do the right and they take they take the running back and have him go out down the left side on the line and then cut across the middle can they hit him and that was for about twelve yard gain the ball sitting at the the main guess twenty seven yard line first than than\nGoing to run around in\nThink you'll find don't seem to get past the twenty yard line and I didn't get to the ground\nIt looks like it's number twenty show Machado\nDoing if he's really into the ground of been through the the uh\nYou know in that play like that it doesn't seem like side was just being in that many yards cars right now the bats are often the blind is winning the line of scrimmage that play with her for a A R just check it down and ... just stay inside the broader twenty five\nFor the receiver got to\nBe\nSome kind of\nAgain picked up another three or four

[noise]\nFor the first and then we're\nHolding call against the bad you're [noise] gonna bring this back it would've been of hers down this path to play a mind the badgers a thing would have had a first than than the ah their own forty five\nPercent are standing there at the Cannes all\nLooking at three and I don't think really happy with that [noise]\nWhere's the replay on\nThat John\nDoe morally joined 'cause it's a it's a New York penalty from the bottom what's on the ball was all the way back to the badger uh Thirteen yard line then they have to get a first than we're out how to do their own forty three [noise]\nReceiver deployed now for the job\n[noise] I'm not wearing green\nGreen pretty good handle\nAnd going to go back to sports to learn\nThat penalty is really going to cost the reactors field position [noise] uh [noise] the monitors are going to have probably their best starting field has been on a on a gesture and yet in this game and uh [noise]\nThey're going to start is probably a bad your territory\nThere is a pipeline clique [noise] one\nForty five yard line [noise]\nJust throwing in frustration on some of the earth and I used to play\nIt will be starting [noise] badger territory let's go up to forty five\nAnd a half yard line\nIn European Blair owner that was blind brothers controversy [noise]\nFor them to read you love to go into a corner [noise] their parents to know a couple of those kids up to the former yard line [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah just a real ...\nThey know a couple of tackle gets up to the point yard line [noise] [noise]\nYeah just through a flare pass out into the flat right in front of the maintenance man [noise] and now we're actually going to call it a six yards gained the ball sitting at the bat you're thirty nine yard line pretty critical juncture in the game for the badger deep and set up behind him [noise]\nHe was deployed to the modern [noise]\nField [noise]\nDropping\n\n\nYou look forward to even go to a lot of weight and complete\nThe makers quarterback a quarterback so Bola [noise] had to throw on the run or going in the opposite direction of where he wanted to throw the ball and that's why the ball was slightly thrown under\nFour now one of them are thirty nine [noise]\n[noise] where\nThey're going to want\nTo bring up a fourth and five situation will ... pawn always difficult to know John whether they're more writers or partying or not because you're a quarterback punch the ball\nAnd uh he all you know it looks like when he's thinking about plenty and he's about to step or two behind where normally sets up in the sharp yeah\nAnd they aren't going to find it\nOne is going to balance\nYard line backers got around their own yard line\nSo I think it's closer than that I think the ball ball sitting at the two is not the one that was great fun [noise]\nBy the ball [noise]\nBadgers forced to start from deep in their territory with two minutes exactly remaining in the third quarter an actor is down\nWell than\nThe regular season\nBeen touring with two minutes exactly remaining in the third quarter and the badgers down\nWell than\nThe regular season finale Spanish

cheaper and just can't get the push from the wine while we get off that comes\nAnd struck in a few others\nThey smell [noise] what a critical handled that going to be a team yard penalty definitely

[noise]\nFrom the gun is going to give it to a speech right up the meddling in waiting rooms you may\nYeah there's really no pain there may be getting to have a yard [noise] if that were in the college second nine and a half [noise]\nThe the uh tonight ten carries for sixty yard touchdown [noise]\nThe God [noise]\nThere's a number to shake up and down\nAnd he just went down the field about

made a top not showing up in in in in in in North Carolina\nOh my God is is that an arrow wait till you see what they do it don't make hay out of that tonight\nBut here's the problem with that too is I agree with that and if I were if I were Trump for flight is saying with this alleged really really quietly and I would also prior you don't hurt and say look we're going to offer more protection for all of these political you know a democratic files and things like that\nBecause I think about it is is that if he keeps on the tweeting\nAnd the longer that this play on the alleged of what we're trying to discover here about the alleged bomber\nWe keep the media doesn't get light their coverage on the discovery of this farmer\nCould actually end up helping Trump's as long as he keeps his nose clean because of my concern is this caravan we're going to have a crescendo right now and it's kind of climax just hours before\nThe election and there are there going to show all of the national
