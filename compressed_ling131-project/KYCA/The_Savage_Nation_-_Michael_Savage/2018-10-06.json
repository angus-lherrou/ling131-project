cash\nPenalty against Bradshaw for rough in the past or there'll be a fifty yard penalty tacked onto this play I Believe [noise]\nAnd I think even if there wasn't a penalty I think I Would have still been a first down for Prescott [noise]\n\n\nWe'll see how they market than all the off\nYear a slight went out to the thirty yard line and that's what I thought the penalty is packed onto the game you know the play and show the badgers starting at their own twenty now all of a sudden one flight later have at first that stand up their own sauce [noise]\nPlay and so the badgers starting at their own twenty now all of a sudden one play later have at first in their own forty five [noise]\nThe first of all have receivers to start offering Clark into gone to thirty one remaining in the first quarter rolled up seven seven o'clock going to take off on its own not the matter of fact the court\nTaken down the\nLine and that would be just still not poor badger first tell even with the tough talk

good run on his part it was about a ... yard run the badgers habits first than seeing it on eBay or forty one [noise]\nPartners to that's around here and the guy who's going to get at the\nGas standard standing bender thing gets up and they're almost as soon as he puts his hand on out there about two or three bears I just came right through the metal to stop him\nAgain good penetration by the Bradshaw a deep anti trust a vaccine that said\nThat plane went for a one yard lost it looks like to be [noise]\nLooks like it's got back to the line of scrimmage or their marketing the ball right now\nSo it's ... it's going to be struck it down a chance for the bears forty one the fish absurd discussions something here a John and I don't know what it is\nHow long are waiting for then good

could be the proverbial fly on the walls yeah [noise] and they don't want to be official news coming over and talking to badger head coach Cody correct about whatever the situation they hear there was\nNot a penalty I rode on the previous play so I don't know what the discussion\nAbout\nIt looks like whenever I was looking for that\n\nAnd there's about [noise]\nWhat looks like wherever it was like\n\nWell it's a forty one yard line in their territory [noise] do you ever see the other side for the Dodgers log in the God it's like it's even ... next to him well take from the south\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nSo what do you think you're saying if you bought a couple of metal and also alert to make up almost thirty three\nNumber sixty five or ... sports for the bad you're really through a good walk or he's the center for the bad actors its first go badgers a at the bears fans yard line [noise]\nClark when the gallon received either side he's going to give it to look at like quarter I Can't stand Jordan joined it gets better than I Am finally brought down\nAnd a good tackle man I Want to say that was number one in Coney taco for Roger now things are good\nFor students as the badgers tried her body player and I'm not that good pursued by the bears game second down at both from the Tim [noise]\n\nBring back behind him [noise]\nMark rolling out to the right\nThing to throw the cats play they\nTo stop on the line [noise]\nNumber eighty three for the ... a bathroom break ... not just went down and out on the right hand side of the badger line are awesome car kidding uh for about a U.S seven yards gained it looks like the navy yard at my shirt [noise]\nRight it looks like the bathrooms had the ball at the mayor three\nI Believe the I Believe you are right Kelly birding goal from the three years' time wind down here in the first quarter just five seconds must be hard to understand their core jobs that they\nDo you think it's fair to do all these years [noise] and the badgers [noise] what is that [noise]\nOh you don't think it's fair to the um [noise] and the badgers what that\nSold on the right side with three receivers and that's why a Aaron green foot wide open for the touchdown putting the badger set Thirteen just set it and the play was going the clock to zero to end the first quarter [noise]\nHere's why screeners was appointed after a time [noise]\nAnd it gives\nHim I don't like what was that one flew\nMeyer who may walk on the extra point however the touchdown throw the Aaron grain what's the badgers back on TALK at the end up at first it's Thirteen Bradshaw bouncing back after this [noise]\nThis is Steve ... with Olson's for healthy animals someone asked me how people would know from our name that we sell a huge variety of food for pension bar near the animals\nI talked for a little bit and said the food we sell is just part of what we do in although we have an incredible amount of high quality food to feed from our New York the animals in the wild birds the resulting your animals is our main reason for being our mission\nAnd that's why we call ourselves the oceans for healthy animals when you walk into oceans you should know that you're not just going to get food but also the confidence that you purchase will be healthy for your pet poor born your buddy\nIt the number of Seventy eight Sebastian Martinez one of the line I Do I\nThink you're right it does it is to have a yard loss as the badger were really putting a lot of heat on quarterbacks Josh Grant and he got rid of the ball and it was flooded by one of the badger defenders first second and a woman at the bears a thirty six\nGrand kids that were the lord and find a way to find the quite the opposite end of Dodger shut the door on it in a hurry Dylan boy with the tackle Logan brand and just this feeling picking up a good heavy themes\nOr just a just an off tackle play kind of a counter player I play it looked like it was actually going to the left hand\nOnly picking up steam\nOr just a just an off tackle play kind of a counter player I play it looked like it was initially going to the left and then ended up going to the right pick up about four it's going to bring up third down to six the ball setting\nUp their forty yard [noise]\nA screen again from the garden receivers sad [noise] and he began to go to Anthony bought out apply them to play the badgers gang capital Josh green and\nIt's going to be a safe fast penalty against the bathroom [noise]\nI'll grant went up to the right side if you want to get used to be not enough [noise]\nWell like you said Kelly it looks like this one is going to go in favor of the bears here [noise]\nOne of the uh [noise] one of the bathrooms are reaching out to grab unarm ended up accidentally grab the face masks and that's exactly what it is it's the fifteenth yard penalty against the badgers [noise]\nHuge brand here for Bradshaw now than they won't have the ball now in your territory forty seven yard line and we'll see if I can make some hay out of bed [noise]\nRain for him to go to the right side don't make the cut up the dead man by the couple of them get talked about forty yard line before he's finally stopped by the press with the snake only got one of the guys on the Capitol\nCould walk by the right side of the Bradshaw bounced off the answers why really created a whole are going to bring up a second down and we're going to say a three yards to go up the badger thirty dollars [noise]\nGrant picks up again why not get up and they don't mean that is growing up in the ground by stand Jordan that's going to be good enough for up there still not a good first speed put on there why Josh grand grand find a way that been carrying tonight\nFor about thirty nine yards [noise]\nThis is by far the so far the best right by the bears are in the first half was got at first we had a at the badger at thirty six\nThis running game for Bradshaw now starting to get going here\nJust great again from the guy on the receivers out the last one to the right moment that behind him down the ticket the Anthony ... [noise]\nNow you're starting to get going here [noise]\nJust great again from the guy the receivers out the last one to the right moment back behind him down to think of the Anthony Weiner [noise]\n\nReally [noise] with a throw down to Florida I think actually they tend to agree scandal which I think might have been a Ruben Gonzalez end up with that on the ball\nMight have been deflected badger set a pretty good pass rush on that point you have a policy the plate or they were trying to run in a slant pattern from the right side of the ah [noise]\nThe airline and sort of bring up the second down to an STD or bats are thirty six [noise]\nSeven eleven remaining in the second quarter Prescott up twenty seven [noise] brain takes up a bit taken down someone behind by dealing Danny there\nI mean granted cable to pick it up about three or four yard top of that run\nYou know the bears run the Oxford at times and the the uh the type of ... the last three or four years have given the badger state since the option in a press with a sophomore Josh Grant the quarterback for the bears and his running ability\nYeah this is the guy who just took over after starting quarterback position about three weeks ago the stock market has been very impressed with the job for a quarter of not just grant has been doing for Bradshaw we're going to get a handle the\nAll star game than Jordan is we're well arrangements him wanting to last me down he\nSort of fell down on that one way up in the air tried to rebalance himself\nObviously Josh Grant was changing the Cape wind scrimmage and the costs are\nA number twenty three but the bans are sent George to try to ... I'll say over anticipated the ah [laughter] when the ball is going to get out and it's going to bring up a third down one at the badger twenty six [noise]\n\nGrant went to bat die that's their hand [noise]\nThat's got to the end zone going\nOn [noise] and bad and I like to thank you\n[noise]\nAnd that is I like to thank the cat to the end zone out twenty six yard TD\nJosh queens to our senior\nUh steer just went down the sideline on the far side and that just beat to number twenty five for the badgers robots and uh [noise]\nI think the badgers we're expecting a running played on thirty one and I think the bears I got the badgers by surprise when it's on the ball and at the end zone for six points\nI wasn't expected to throw it to the end zone on third in really hurting into what I think Bradshaw Mountains stoned every one that got ten points on the board [noise]\nAs it looks like Bradshaw going to go for it to hear\nNow hold the boat here and it's\nGoing to get a timeout called by press get\nBugs tonight's game is brought you in part by all since we're healthy animals were good enough just isn't so Bradshaw melting calling their way back into this game\nAnd that's\nWhy the sticks yard touchdown throw for Josh Grant Alex fear has made this and what is Thirteen game pending the extra point attempt\nBy the way folks up get your updated on some other uh football actually known around the tri city area tonight in the second quarter\nChino valley it's they're all coming tonight and they are absolutely have been right now the score they're thirty three to nothing\nMeanwhile on the opposite end of the spectrum things are not going very well for uh the mayor of football team just down the highway sixty either as a ... on his beating then thirty six but nothing [noise]\n\nSo again Bradshaw going forty two point conversion\nGrants from the garden Anthony modern that then\nThere's the thrill by grant and I think that might have been hit by press get my parents are not there are a fly on the plane [noise]\nThis is probably going to be a\nA deep sense of holding call or defensive pass interference call against somebody in the badgers a secondary\nOr try to see what the ah\nAll or defensive past interference call against somebody in the badgers a secondary\nTry to ah see what the\nOfficials signal is\nYeah it is against press get past it or fear of St Paul against the batters and it'll be half the distance to the call or two the goal so on the point after a try here it's the ball being placed at the three ... line it's being placed in the yard and the one yard and a half wine\nAnd Dell Bradshaw melt in calls on now and\nI don't think I've ever been to a game or it's taken this long to either get an extra point or a or a to point conversion\nWell this happens in rivalry games and uh it it made me that Brad charge going for two because with the patches missing the extra point on their second touchdown a of the half\nA you know right now is pointing to Thirteen\nOr if you kick the extra point it's only a six point getting so uh you know I I'm just a little bit befuddled on why the bears especially with the uh [noise] when the ball was place at the three I can understand teams or to the balls place to the garden path\nOne and that's where it is right now so this is not surprise for the uh the bears go on for two or with the ball so close to the Golan [noise]\nRolling make up the meddling going [noise]\nThat are going to fall by Josh Grant southern southern remaining and then the second quarter and the band is close the gap on press get badgers now with just they want to fit the lead over the ban will be back right after this\nHi I'm Missy towns in high school athletic director for the Unified

your place in one of the Nineteen different programs at Prescott high school we want to see\nJail and that's all there to stop the guy ailing queen but a huge scam picked up by price you know\nAgain the badgers a wedding in the left side of the bears defense or secondary the bears rented so deep that they're flooding the homeless receivers in one area\nAre able to find Aaron green and the ball is all the way down to the fair [noise] thirty three yard line where it's first in the bathroom for three minutes left are going to have [noise]\nAgain Twenty one twenty Bradshaw on top of Prescott look into regained don't leave here [noise]\n\nHey we got one boy what comes flying in [noise]\n\n\nAnd it looks like it's going to the all star game press get to know that will get them back five dollars to the thirty eight yard line [noise]\nFirst team now for the badgers far with the wind up in court to see the court finally taken down by Bradshaw out around the thirty three yard line [noise]\nDon't you don't need a thirty one yard line where he finally got taken down a way out six or seven there on the play for all its been cleric [noise]\nSecond and nine ball at the thirty two yard wider Bradshaw territory to Fifteen to\nGo on the run of themselves and at this time [noise] just massive humanity right up the meddling Clark was able to get through me [noise]\n\nSo it looked like barking just able to get back to the original line of scrimmage ended obese [noise] actually looks like he might have picked up a yard there and so we'll call it through to me [noise]\nOriginal line of scrimmage and it'll be actually looks like he might have picked up a yard there so we're going through to in any [noise]\nOr [noise]\nYour the emotion court dropping back costs plus a messed up through\nThe\nSenate only one don't think they're going to pass [noise] and ...\nAre not happy about that [noise]\n\nI don't watch Aaron green made the cats right around the yard line but now the official state incomplete\nPass [noise] and badger named sharing is not happy with that at\nAll as the badgers will call a timeout with on thirty five months ago and then the second quarter it's Twenty one twenty Bradshaw mountain so we over press [noise]\nWe brought you to stick around for our halftime show my partner Kelly Ward is actually he's down on the field right now and they'll probably get his usual interview with that because for a month to breed\nRight down the stats for you and uh just ramble on about all sorts of interesting stuff here [noise]\nAnd that you're sending back out onto the field down and we're just about ready to get going here again with a beginning again in a minute thirty five months ago here in the\nSecond quarter and it looks like a claim gross is going to come in\nAnd going for the extra point\nAll spotted happy thirty nine yard line [noise]\nHere's this now the chicken and the kid is going to\nBe no good [noise] I don't like it grows kind of a shame that one too though right\n[noise]\nWell actually Correctional Center to go well [noise]\nIt's kind of shape that one too though right\n[noise] are actually correction you know shake it took a while to [noise]\nSo the field goal and no good by clay grows and the score remains Twenty one twenty fever Bradshaw mail to\nFolks just storing update here for you in the first game of the American league divisional series the red Sox going into the top of the night with a five to three lead over the Yankees go stocks [noise]\nMeanwhile in a game to the national league divisional series the Dodgers what they do nothing lead over Atlanta Houston earlier today defeated Cleveland's dove into four in the American league divisional series [noise]\nI mean if I may [noise]\nGoalball spin don't belong there spoken like a shoot pessimistic Red Sox fan [noise]\nBradshaw male consultants back out on the field\nAnd they're off by one\nWe're just a minute thirty five to go into the second quarter [noise] and then there are still in the heart or [noise]\n\nAs you get a bit of rain here in the game now finally the backup and one of the scrimmage trip to the red sorry [noise] Josh grants from the gun [noise]\nRan with a loan that that's their hands [noise]\nGrant that's now let's new show now don't bird brain power and they're going to catch up on each side yard line [noise]\n\nAnd the rush right up to the line of scrimmage person can from the pie as we get what's going to play [noise]\n\nAnd actually it looks like a\nJosh Grant spike the ball there to stop the clock [noise]\nTotally second intent rats\nYeah it actually looks like a\nJosh grants like the ball there to stop the clock\nSo it'll be second intent rach off from the movie for yard line with a minute twenty love to go in and the second quarter and the Bradshaw mounted will try to extend its lead going into the locker room pairs of Twenty one twenty\nJosh Grant so far the night with a touchdown throw any cuts down the road trip out to the left side or the bad news [noise]\n\nOn top of Josh jumped\nInto the ground pulling back second sat\nBy press get paid I mean that slowly [noise]\nGrant and Bradshaw back [noise] that looks like to be [noise]\n\nFor like thirty six yard line so that'll be thrown in each team down for Bradshaw now if they got it after the badger forty six yard line for food stamps [noise]\nThere's a lot of credit card company how it's going to tackle\nForget the first shot like sitting ducks let's get the second one by one day [noise]\nBeing of about three on the play by brand and [noise] and it's going to bring up or down in Fifteen for spotted at the fair thirty nine yard line there's talking over they going to go forward here and\nWe're coming down to ... seconds left to go in the corner [noise]\nAnd it looks like the ... are just going to end it right here squat\nHero and that'll do it for the first batch shed [noise] and they were not to have that kind of game you want to start in your male bonding we have\nTime with the score\nBradshaw American Twenty one press get twenty and we'll be back right after this [noise]\nIs the ... for healthy animals someone asked me how people would know from our name\n... with Olson's for healthy animals someone asked me how people would know from our name that we sell a huge variety of food for pets and bar near the animals\nI thought for a little bit and said the food we do is just part of what we do and although we have an incredible amount of high quality better feed from our New York the animals in the wild birds the resulting health of your animals is our main reason for being our mission\nThat's why we call ourselves the oceans for healthy animals when you walk into oceans you should know that you're not just going to get food but also the confidence that you purchase will be healthy for your pet poor born yard buddy\nWe've been doing this for thirty eight years in North central Arizona with our stores in Chino ... and ... also take your purchase out you go and we will go special orders were wholesome for healthy animals the health of your animals is our mission go to ... his family dot com for the location of the also stored nearest you [noise]\nAnd I and I don't have a coral with that a bit I think there is a better way to determine who those best sixteen teams are are you\nIn college football in college basketball they kind of go on to power point system but they have a committee that could over rule about some of those things and uh [noise]\nI I really think over the last five six years you know the managers really of missed out on the play offs but just one game and I really think\nThe factors that we're going to the top six feet teams at least three out of the last four years but they didn't get in a simply because uh I'm kind of made me a week or pre conference schedule in this year are you know\nThe badgers right now according to back perhaps have lost two games to two of the teams that are in the tops it according to their prep course we're speaking about yesterday in in that canyon bill are [noise]\nSo uh it's just not surprise me that the badgers or in the game [noise]\nTo what the CIA power right to say the number two ranked team in the state uh and so uh this is going to I I really feel this is going to come down to uh\nUh to the end of the of the game is going to be a real donnybrook of the game that's assuming John one thing\nFeel this is going to come down to uh\nUh to the end of the of the game is going to be a real donnybrook of a game that's assuming John one thing and that is if the badgers couldn't limit\nIf the badgers couldn't really limit the ah the running game and the auction off and she's always given the badgers trouble and I don't know why more coaches don't run the opposite anymore because it it's very hard for people to prepare for because you don't see very much\nAnd um you know I hear on the college sports station that serious actually maybe for all the time\nYou know Oklahoma had trouble with army two weeks ago and the reason is gets army runs the auction\nIn Oklahoma and just you know teams just don't see that anymore and so I I Am concerned about how the badgers are going to contain a Anthony motto that running back for the Bradshaw a mountain bears and the quarterback Josh ... we do\nA good play maker he not only is a good play Baker he can run with the ball and so it'll be interesting to see how the rafters make adjustments against that running game and the second hand\nI'll tell you what the other thing Kelly as we are not really seen one of the main weapons Bradshaw mental than a whole lot Logan branding on this guy who has really done an excellent job for a\nMore of a rational marathon this whole year coming into tonight's game four hundred Seventeen Russian yard fix fix touchdowns or even have to pick someone said\nWhy don't we carry the ball so far three times tonight for just for ... yards so you talked about model we've talked about grand into the stall works here on the chopping so far [noise]\nBut you gotta wonder maybe Logan Brandon is waiting and waiting and just ready to pounce on practice and show that while he's gotten\nA second hand well bought it does almost twice as many yards on the season is a brand that does so it's not surprising that modest get the

[noise]\nSo second in nine foreign threats to the ball the eleven yard line or\nDo I think that you know what part do faster they were telling\nThat it it looked like a ball hit the ground before the badger receiver I Believe that was a number to Jacob ... ways to make the cats\nIn the past was originally intended for number for air and green and he couldn't get their hands on it and the Jacob

get a first down without story\nYou ever seen as either side in Puerto standing next to often Clark Clark jobs back to the young man in town that receiver bowl or [noise]\nOr this will definitely be a

Bradshaw had it but I'm I'm not sure that to trade cater didn't wrestle the ball from him before they both went to the ground so let's see [noise]\nThey're going to rule it they're going to ruin the catcher in the paper [noise] jolt support was was chips fly Chandler's went into the Bradshaw players' hands and then before they hit ground Craig Taylor ripped from the Brad shop or a\nSecondary
