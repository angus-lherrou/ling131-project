by just being all they're interested in others viewpoints they respond well to feed back\nThere they don't try to hide their own mistakes and\nThey set an example of behaviors that their team members tend to follow which fosters a real collegial cooperative attitude which can lead to smooth they're functioning teams it's subtle but it can be very powerful ah in getting teams moving in the right direction\nTo what a person is aware of his or her own weakness in the past that was seen as a weakness noses changed\nI think we're on the top down command and control\nI'm invincible leader did more relatively well in the you know the sort of vertical companies of the past where it was a chain of command that went up and down I think now we're having much more collaboration among teens\nAcross different departments um innovation is coming from\nAll levels at all times and it's really hard for a command and control leader to keep a finger and every pie humble leaders are better able to kind of move among all the teams and inspire really open and honest conversation and interaction so that the team's work better together\nUm it's more than a change even in just quit companies want it's a change in the structure of how we're getting work done\nSo what's wrong with the leader who in the past was charming and charismatic\nAbsolutely nothing and in fact some of those people can also be humble it isn't that if you're a humble year like this and be the person who sits in a corner I'm humbled people can also be ambitious for their team's\nNot necessarily for themselves and they can be

don't think there are a lot of differences and expectations of male and female bosses in some places in others it's still true that\nA woman boss wouldn't be suspect if she came across as mold and charismatic and authoritarian [laughter] um I think it just varies it it's true generally that women have tended to be more humble in the past because of their upbringing and their experience in the workplace they face obstacles that men don't\nAnd again that do humbled boxers work across all industries\nGood question um increasingly they do is more industries become infused by technology and uh it's just in time management rapid change it's becoming more valuable in all industries\nYou don't often find the words business and friendly and the same sentence let alone the same state unless of

financial hardship market watches ... here with information on some on demand payment companies that let you decide when you're paid Maria how does this work\nKind of a common problem you know we don't really get to suicide typically how often we paid our company decides that\nBut the issue is with so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck\nUm you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something else come up before your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so\nNow we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this [laughter] um or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check 'em but not as alone more it's just you know they might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\nWhat kinds of fees are we talking about\nSo one of the company is um it's called even their only client right now is Wal Mart but they say they're going to be expanding they charge just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interest that you can pay on a on a payday loan is it's relatively small\nUm I talked to another company called daily pay and they said their fees are more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know is an inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than some of those interest rates end up being\nMurray as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\nThe thing is that it's actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reason for that I think going into this story I thought you know there must be some tax reason or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that's\nUm their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged\nAnother company and sometimes that's [laughter] um their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there is no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know over and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they vote added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they've worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of ... workers are used to doing not that it's kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payments cycles um\nYou know everyday workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me so without conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would\nUnfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of the national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that as a benefit for their workers some of these companies\nAre actually you know that that allow you to outsource this are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often so we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nA really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts you use for day [noise] and\nCare has
