during the spotted owl earth first uh\nI had read it and the Heritage Foundation are actual report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station controversy that was all part of a global warming craze in the early nineties\nAnd I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees\nIn American then in Nineteen Ninety ... act our founding\nThe left we're fatty they said I was insane it that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chop down trees and we haven't replace them being made things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I\nPointed out you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is\nThe wood industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree it's cut down for a new ones are planted it's part of the policy a warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two then there was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever and and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want to cut down the redwoods will never come back you know I'm of the same token\nI remember saying well it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees forested\nAcres in America today than there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out\nThat are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green is going to raise sea level rise and it's like ice

chunks\nFalling off a glacier are in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about they thought you know what your throat where you're not a scientist you can't say that\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing and if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland

illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit started rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff\nBut this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now after the after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nSmoking I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nOh my God what but but what I'm not asking you know identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't\nKnow identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you didn't know\n[noise] [noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys know was um I I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over [noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but let's say this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics but even more than that\nWas was that the why why what was the barbarian eight of what happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no in God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened was\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born Danny would kill\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by snooping there spinal cords scissors now I didn't save is on friday I didn't say this on friday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frighten people away it's not\nYou I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director lets the story tell itself there aren't any\nExaggerating computer generated graphics there there's not a lot of\nA special effect\nA real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers\nOf children born alive killed by this man is stunning shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered\nOf children born alive killed by this man is stunning shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less what he had done they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie main precisely because of what it revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made and the actors in this movie were risking their future career as by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is a ... and across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or [noise]\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling it and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one they wouldn't allow any\nWith Facebook would not allow any kind of a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all it's\nActually kind of a unless they amazing or miraculous buddy if it was it was a lot of hard work at a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for and maybe how how difficult is it\nTo focus on the fact that this abortion is did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of ah of abortions in the world but the numbers of born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just stunning everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion\nAnd it's called an abortion if you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is but in Illinois and so forth when when a procedure came up a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was but rock Obama who refused to support it\nThe left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called\nAn abortion and\nThe the the ... that's the thing the leftist tried to do in countering this movie is to say well well if you want more God's nails then you go and overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say\nLeftist tried to do in countering this movie as to say well well\nIf you want more God's nails then you go and overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say guys now was doing what he was doing the causes women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to get\nThat's a flat out why by the way guys know clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilized people that were getting sick and infected with it just it was a pig style was in Philadelphia but\nI didn't focus on that on purpose because I didn't want to see that because\nYou don't see it that's my point they don't graphically\nTry to make their point they focus on a murder trial button good going out there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating and nervous out there what does Russia want to hear what one of them but he got it's not that I wanted to hear anything but that is what I think most people will learn that they didn't know if they go\nTo influence the
