politics\nNumbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way out I'm much less than\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's\nBut he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics and you know the constitution was written for moments like this and assume that we're sinful and driven by ambition an appetite and greed is why they made it so hard for us to get anything done\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we're proven them correct uh with with astonishing regularity\nReaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump God to violate the constitution says like Trump is supporting the constitution that's the liberals who are or who were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and how old are the only because of all this other stuff that happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embraced simple because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the ah the blue wave is going to turn out to be a a leaky faucet\nBut\nI I just there's nothing I sense out there

it can't be it can't be organic something like this has to be planned\nAnd so I'm asking myself who's behind the planning not asked that question\nWell they have to eat well\nThey have to use the bathroom\nWell there's some kids there without their parents what parents would allow for this and we've already have the answer that question a bunch of them would opt who's paying for the fuel league gasoline or whatever it's um I don't think there's any electric cars being used to bring these people north\nSo I'm asking myself who's behind this because you can go either way\nYou can say we talked about the front of you for the Democrats are behind it rich democratic\nDonors okay for what reason well\nIt could be they want to embarrass the Trump stir it could be that they want to demonstrate that cold hearted and this and that means spiritedness\nOf Donald Trump by having him do what he said he wouldn't do not let them in basically shut down the border if the Democrats are thinking that\nMan oh man do they not get it if the Democrats are thinking this caravan just by itself helps them in the mid term then there's something\nBesides this caravan that has to happen for this to help them\nSuch as unfortunate events\nThat might inflict harm on members of the caravan half to happen to the drive by and Democrats could the blame on Trump\nBecause otherwise this seemingly is a microcosm of what Donald Trump what Donald Trump elected\nKnow the way to look at this Caribbean if you really want to know for the way to look at this is as a microcosm for what's been happening every day for who knows how many years it just so happened is that we now have pictures\nAnd if you really want to know all the way to look at this is as a microcosm for what's been happening every

is an invasion and just like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades I mean it's it's an invasion\nThat has so far lead to a minimum twelve million

actually ... from the Democrats and Democrat name one door Wilson not one of my favorite presidents ten Nineteen sixteen ... gangs came across\nThe border in New Mexico and go with a bunch of people and not only ... Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's aren't going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to\nAnd Louis continued to close the more you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only allowed at our embassy\nA close the more you got to stop this asylum claims and\nBasically have those claims for asylum only allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from and also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not in may and if we're not the first country to come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talked to ... he'll talk about Jeff he's talking to Jeff and I don't even know who is who you're talking about Jeff Sessions suggested big money is that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points\nThey already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nPromoting it defies common sense to support this\nFrankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking them for dinner recalls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people will realize they're most\nDecember when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to assert gene point advantage that the American people will realize their mistake electing trumpeter Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousand six Senate germs the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen\nAnd we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September\nOf this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look\nFor me it won't be as big a blue wave and Republicans\nLook like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's on poll it forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I eat election day\nPeople have to start reeling in these mad and kept for ... projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can\nFor the sake of their business if they're in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who hired him\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house stepping in ways that Republicans who hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house\nWell a month ago there was no way but Republicans are going to hold out now all of a sudden we're starting to see\nIt as a blue wave may not I don't think they ever did I don't think you'd ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you'll get the poll result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\nThere is no way there is simply no way that a political party\nYou take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample there is no way there is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this\nInvasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and all that everybody who wants to in in the American people are not there the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing to do your own Paul wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody who wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there Thursday hungry we we we have so much they have so little [laughter] we mark what the that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump ... never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people in this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump want to never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want in let them yet and we shouldn't feeding them we shouldn't house then they have nothing there poured are coming from ... countries what the that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe media is going to try to make people think that way I look like they're mean spirited and cold hard in heartless and all this but it's not the case\n\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\n\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever\nIt's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in\nTrouble because he wants to build a wall that he is in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy here\nAnd that's just not where the American people are one other thing about this [noise]\nNow don't get to the final looming over my dad's a second look at is this is the NBC story\nFrom just this morning the
