and it really is one of the finest guys anybody could ever made [noise] uh\nI look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but\nI Am a fairly experienced here at analyzing predicting understanding the left and I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is but it's there's that that they are entitled to it\nAnd whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happen which are the voters\nSo today's American Left is angry as it can be that people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred and when those people will not a man to them and the left is making every every effort it can\nTo distance Trump voters from Trump\nThey've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office than force cabin all out of the nomination and to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling is something you and I cannot relate to\nWeaken try\nBut the degree of frustration they're feeling and having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory\nAnd subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to

it and if not take them out damage them tremendously but they haven't been able to even score on Trump\nSalt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they and they created a whole cloth something it did not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and began reporting the news that way\nEverybody hates Trump but now that they've seen combination I hate him to despise it they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only common sense to be able to have now that now that people have seen trumpet action I've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left taste not everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody have a trumpet everybody hated themselves are voting for him\n[noise] well it isn't coming to pass the\nWay they said the existed maybe never has\nThe blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much

doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months drive buys a showing everybody every day Democrats are going to cry\nAnd that's been the game the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls couldn't be missing a GOP syringe elite syringe and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change this story written before the moms could it happen again it\nProbably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's but it did inclined to go in either direction Democrats just don't win big or they could lose may get going ... what what is all those indecision all\nOf a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nPolls couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying that media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a tweet here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats to allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose\nThere is a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump's just to opposed Trump so here's a caravan\nIn addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump's just to oppose Trump's\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nA lot of people on our side I'm jumped St George Soros there may be\nBut if in Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying it's Venezuela if it's Venezuela that's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only commonsense nickel thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us a modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever not to say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickled kind of basis and the American people are opposed to what\nMy\nPoint is [laughter] [noise] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave I look\nMisunderstand I don't know what's going I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but I I don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it\nBecause I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groups think narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there is nothing happening in America right now that argues electing Democrats not in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nIn America right now that argues electing Democrats not in mass\nMaybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass there is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's a bore he tweets sees a bad guy here's whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying cabin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege every day are decent society\nStandard and good old normalcy is under assault every day led by pop culture leftists in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media where under assault every day but they have not overturned that yeah they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal\nThere's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republican\nUh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts you're not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats\nDon't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican to come up with it works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and they're going to be discovered\nDoesn't make
