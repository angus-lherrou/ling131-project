listen\nIf the if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk\nI Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate and I'd say no we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this right here we don't need him but they're still in opposite there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think\nAbility for this climate and I'd say no we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this right here we don't need him but they're still in opposite there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think they're an opportunity for him to speak out a and to and to take accountability system\nYou know the crystal is that these ... these people and there are ... are just desperate\nOr to justify their position says Trump has done everything that conservatives have wanted them to what it actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done\nSo the only thing they can do is uh assassinate his character which is what they\nCall it simply do this is ridiculous the you know ... one one comment\nA and I I've I forget it was in response to a question which elicited this where one could be done he said it would have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue\nSecurity guards and lots of synagogue\nPerfectly wise recommendation got attacked by the Democratic mayor of\nPittsburgh forward magazine which is an extreme left wing Jewish magazine blame him I said that Trump blamed the synagogue he doesn't blame the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point\nA they're a nut case is out there a will kill a and it's a synagogue and other other Senate schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats than the left or so people ranged over gun control issues that it practical steps like this or are hard to take\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue a live tree of life synagogue was also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset\nThat the media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view\nTo this evil anti he was an anti Trump a fanatic they're the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify the airwaves but these airwaves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former\n... the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify the airwaves but the ... but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me on the synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen\nTo welcome the president to Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's a purveyor of hate speech\nHow hypocritical um words that come from ... I'm not saying\nWe have a we have very very strong leadership and their city believing values not just curious how you leaving values and I was there not the value of his friends and that's and I do not welcome to Pittsburgh\nThe current ramp to forgive me for saying this but I say there's a June the Jews are out to lunch or this these issues\nThat first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\nDonald Trump ... uh you know is a counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turned on MSNBC the other day a on it in the Cold War our set a panel\nEvery single day there were four people on the panel that was the Trump and said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked to adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist dictator well actually no ah Joseph Smith see any\nOf it was it Nineteen century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who coined nationalism is a Democrat they just won't find any pretext\nTo link Trump to Hitler a lawn so down on CNBC you said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that translates into Hitler that have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny and as a tax I'm a ... a light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing\nA put these people they have done themselves into a whole here\nThey they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time since Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party and\nThey continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time since Abraham Lincoln and that the Democratic party or any major party has gone to war against the legitimate elected president this and this\nIs what Schumer and Pelosi call their campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party ... we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election and that translates normally into a honeymoon the Gallup\nEstimate is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds that we're boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi who insist\nOn demonizing the president of the United states which is something hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush too they called Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd a ... you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are silver sober Democrats but there and intimidated by the party left now um but they won't come out of the closet\nJeffrey I have one and Alan Dershowitz exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Maier says the current rabbi or who of\nCourse is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people he's worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responding like this\nRabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome\nSome citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome\nThat's a good answer Neal you know every time I go I go to a synagogue by looking around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause I got to universities are teaching Jewish hatred they they ... and our university the curriculum and the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole all land out\nAnd our university the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole all land the Arab land which isn't to genocide ally\nThe land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the

stuff going\nThis is this just literally insane I I I have no words send us\nNo exactly this is the best president or from the point of view of a Jewish survival uh we've ever had\nA Trump you know that Komen and I sound like his kids are Orthodox Jews for crying out two years I mean it's just in Saturday and are these so called liberal Jews\nUm are contributing\nA problem I have for the Jews by that well I mean they're always attacking me I don't know I've done a lot of demonstrations on college campuses against students for justice in Palestine and I'm anathema to the Jewish left\nFor that reason and it's the same thing I mean\nYou know the history here you have to do something but just having a security guard\nCap for us would be paid for by the government to do that or not authorized

who have kids your age and younger\nWho are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case for my whole life I have heard people say throughout my life but they don't want to have kids who wouldn't dare wanna bring kids into this world that some I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really really knew\nThat I Am sensing today when people say

that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting even citizens going around trying to do that stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to last for\nA country where veterans are put behind illegals I mean I just\nI that's the one that makes me so angry as they\nDo you think that is happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish on of the people you referred to as illegals coming here who are not citizens but yet being uh granted access to so many things given so much why do you think it's happening\nA will there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made it all just come our way and you know um but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's going to stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop them this\nTylenol I understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wandering them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting him why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal flow aspect of this\nI don't know a lot of the people who are voting they don't know anything about why\nI don't know where to stop why would they ah\nI don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them if I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken well you know America has to help their people to they can't just give away money to these illegals coming in\nAnd they're like well that they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in ... ... ...\nCut and they're like well they may bring jobs here how are they in bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're getting a working actor cut agriculture something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals outlet in California and there's a lot around the way I laugh but\nI don't know the answer is but they worked cheap number one for the people don't want them in for cheap labor cheap labor is the answer the other side of it um you you talk about\nThe people that don't want to give them the money the people who are behind these policies are damn wells making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving layers\nBut the answer the answer to the question is because the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in\nTheir human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed and they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registering to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters it's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life\nIt's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating\nLet me put it this way rarely\nThe Democratic party and do not doubt me on this and you and you do do research or journalism career you will find that this is the case the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic self reliance because they can't speak the language because they don't have any education those\nAre prime democratic voters\nAre the exact kinds of people the Democrats want to build a majority around because they won't be for ever grateful I e dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's that's\nThe reason behind that nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it but what they are really is just on a document\nDon't know what else happens that's\nThe reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on a documented Democrats it's not that they're undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now\nAnd the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them give them health care may vary track here make their trip here worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for now some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and I got to run and rings around people suddenly in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite competent\n\nThose are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I get really hideous I get that gets it gets really hideous thinking Democrats what people\nNeed people who are incapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate\nDemocrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much hey don't have much to them any way but they are great voters great dependent voters and thereby\nEyes so that's what this is about look I'm Glad you called rail your exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is working and you're I I Hope that you are the hope you do get into journalism is journalism needs people that that are interested in the truth\nI also want to thank you for the book the route on Iran and I've
