fair and do you want to clarify what nationalism it means to me\nI don't have to clarify ms I Love the country and means I'm fighting for the country I look at ... national is um somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know there's better than anybody our leaders of the more worried about the world and I have about the United states and they leave us at a mess\nWhen the president showed is that what national I think any thought about it very hot and it is wrapped up in these connotations the nest aggressiveness dominance of one race on one country over another\nIs that another way you view the word nationalist when you hear Trump talking nationalism\nDo you think Trump is as the BBC's Katty Kay saying they're on MSNBC Trump is using the quote dog whistle\nOkay oh you racist out their vote for me is that what he's\nA terrific book written um and it was just it just came out recently by your um has an aid called the virtue of nationalism\nAnd his point is that he's a\nConservative Israeli writer and a political therapy Faris\nAnd his point is that nationalism is properly understood this the post World War two or twenty first century nationalism is merely stating that\nCountry's deserve to have their focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact\nSo Japan is Japan nationalist do all the gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe in the Japanese culture that there's something unique and beautiful about it\nAnd they're not constantly passing judgment on others but for Japan they want to preserve their history their culture their language all those things that they think make Japan special\nNot others but for Japan they want to preserve their history their culture their language all those things that they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and the supplies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nAnd includes getting a free speech freedom to worship a right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the last has to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the laugh they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second migrant migrant caravan has entered Mexico according to Fox that's just broke paleo so Trump can't talk about that either can't talk about the assaults on Mexican police I guess either okay ah let's go to James in Florida on line three James welcome\n... hey Laura let me tell you that was the best interview I've ever seen the president and get on my job last night you hit all the points it must have been very exciting for you to be in front of a bank us\nToday [laughter] but I I have to tell you that this is a show this is another thing from the left they knew this was coming these people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it and the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it and I wish she'd signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the leftist completely botched and some Republicans have totally botched is well we've been talking about this issue for almost Twenty years\nAh All right where we need to all your calls a congressman Dave Brat is also going to join us he's in the fight of his political life remember brat\nOnto the scene when he unseated Eric Cantor now this was back in a twenty fourteen and now he's up against the far left a woman who uh think she's going to be able to take that seat because of the redistricting that's happened but we're going to do\nTwenty fourteen and now he's up against the far left a woman who I think she's going to be able to take that seat because of the redistricting that's happened but we are going to we're going to fight to the finish on this one as well congressman

seven five one\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law is outdated\nOr we're just going to make it up as we go and that that is a very dangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so what we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist healthcare paste ending Medicare is you know it\nDouble tax rates personal and corporate\nThat puts you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction it it it's just like you said it forward commercials backward\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and I would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you\nThat young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and forced then here for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the left so once\nThey want they want is kind of take those issues away and neutralized tromp on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] yeah and that won't work immigration you know Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told\nNot to mention it right by all the\n... or ... an article in the hill yesterday the Democrats are just sarcastically\nCaving in on the issues and just saying you know well we don't have it we don't have a party platform to run on why start now there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district\nSo yeah you're right that the kids were loading up what Twenty one trillion in debt\nThan and catch and release you know these are all children have gone to cross the border right likely chat which are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill rights and you run those basic issues by that by the taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation\nOr the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you don't do grow the economy I taught college for Twenty years last the Obama period a high end college graduates couldn't go out by the decent job\nThat and now it it's just day and night they'd be time it's just boom and the kids are getting multiple job offers one statistic what's really interesting it's just the job mobility people are leaving their jobs because they are that confident and go get a better job it's been a long time since that's happened and so\nThe kids are moving up the the wage chain you know\n... ... it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody\nIt's been a long time since that's happened and so the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know ... and ... it's just great news that's how we ... we got to share that with everybody thought but there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offering result\nThey want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted best vacations they want to page the president impeach cabin all my opponent won't come down on any of\nThat of course not so what is she in fact I mean you know the question out asking his final final days why why she hide and why why is that why is your challenger\nMitt spanberger hiding on these key issues in the the voters in Virginia and deserve to know the truth about what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state\nThe the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers of Virginia but she's answering in these glib cliches\nIn Broome eyes to make us every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions and why she hiding I Would keep saying that whereas she why she hiding\nRight right one of the things she tired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press the lead her hide but she worked at a a Saudi\nA school where she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is a U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel because of the anti Semitic anti American anti woman\nThere was a bar right ... hobby fundamentalists Saudi training school that produced terrorists\nAnd after the fact she says she still proud that you work there but like you said if you're proud of the fact that you work at the school that is they have school then why didn't you put that on your resume she'd hide everything she tidy or policy platform she's hiding her position on\nHealthcare immigration taxes she won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the seventh district in Virginia\nI Want to play a ... I Want to play a sound bite pretty this is from Joe Lockhart Clinton's old press secretary again words in subjects that they want to take off the table before this midterm vote let's listen\nHe's still talking about global is um which is a dog was over a parade they sound like they still going after George Soros another dog was over anti Semite\nDonald Trump doesn't change um he might have moments where he read the paper in front of him but he will change I mean they have the largest slaughter of American Jews in American history\nHe reads the paper in front of him but he will change I mean if the largest slaughter of American Jews in American history won't change his attitude is rhetoric nothing will\nWell I got it yeah it it it sounds different from Joe locker but it's someone who was on CNN with Allison ... uh but I don't think that was ... I mean that's the sense that you can't say the word global list ... why not I mean\nThey're the lessons use the word global is plenty of times but again they are the ... story is one day and they want to take the college speech code mentality and soy set upon society at large in that way they fix all the debate\nYeah the the left is very good and this goes back decades right they are creating graduates they try to take your strength away from you and\nTake away your strongest point to write my strongest point is Iran as an outsider\nI voted that way right my small business score is a hundred percent\nAnd uh I have the support of all the the small business folks across my district et cetera I did around all the counties\nAnd so they're taught to talking point for me is I don't get around it I'm being paid off by big pharma et cetera but because of an Obamacare vote and so\nYou're you're right that talking point is right they're very smart on how to shift the language they do not want to have a policy debate if your policy debate we'd win at Ninety ten they have to ship that off to the politics of personal destruction they have a hard time with me 'cause I went to seminary that no I Love everybody\nSo they have a hard time shifting around that way on me and so now they're just running crazy false commercials you know the biggest thing I Can't believe with the national media it it it's it's just provable the house voted for pre existing conditions right to help people with preexisting conditions it passed the house\nAnd that's the number one issue the leftist running on saying we're against it after that was the biggest bill of the year last year but\nYou got to know not dream fake news\nUnreal now well Dave Brat a is a classic independent thinking Virginian\nAnd the type of person who the voters of the seventh district badly need representing them in Washington someone who will not be cowed by the threats from the left and who knows how how injurious it is\nTo the American people to have outside influences try to shut down free speech and threaten people and intimidate people away from speaking their mind a day\nPeople to have outside influences try to shut down free speech and threaten people in intimidate people away from speaking their mind a day brat a I Know you're going to win this David seven congressional district everybody get out there and vote and Virginia a and a congressman\nDave Brat has been fighting for the American worker and fighting for ah the people in this incredible commonwealth of Virginia now for years and we just wish you the best of luck Dave if we don't talk to you before Tuesday next Tuesday ah we'll talk to you at your a victory party [noise]\nHey God bless you for all you do Lauren if people want to go check it out it's day brat dot com bust red button that can get a few bucks to get me over the finish\nOur eye day brat dot com everybody go their help 'em out if it's five dollars twenty five dollars or more we want your help by you're listening to the lower anger show stay there the Laura Ingraham show\n\nOut today on DVD and Blu ray from number one New York times best selling author domestic issues that come to his latest film death of a nation\nWith one week before the midterm elections this is the most important film you'll see before you cast your vote\nDidn't actually back in better than ever with his explosive examination of America today and what could happen if the Democrats take back Congress this film as a wake up call for every American death of a nation on DVD and Blu ray today get your copy now at ... dot com that death of a nation movie dot com\nOr your word your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio a boy I Do care making every American save her from the effect of R D served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and we're just a buck up your computer often\nBut if you have questions about identity theft and even if you're struggling with fraud today my I Do care can help\nGet Fifteen Percent off my id care dot coms less Laura my id care dot com slash Laura\nDot org ... in a cage to serve an agency and ... it's ten o'clock\n\nStirs more debates on immigration somebody ...

might not I've not been going to too many events but I went to an event last night I Can't tell you the number of people I ran into these are donors I went to a donor a bunch of people\nI think there is going to be a red wave like you can't believe I Try to test on them\nI rather than joined them in their enthusiasm I tried to talk them down a little bit I just wanted to test whether they were being emotional or whether they actually fought it out\nSo Iran or you do it's got to be a red wave and it's gonna be big it's going to shock everybody people are going to be starting just like they weren't two years ago I said okay well I\nHope you're right but let me let me give you some facts on the ground forty well yeah we're going to get through the birthright citizenship is it just a second here but I Want to set it up with this\n'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for all this is exactly why Trump was elected as my good friend McCarthy and the recording said you got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is beside itself the day the NBC is headlined Crump\nTrump's attack on birthright citizenship is just the latest attempt to rile up the GOP based everybody's saying he can't do that that's the fourteenth amendment he can't universally with an executive order reversed the fourteenth the men do we\nTo discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activist judges that'll that'll turn him down here but the point is that you need somebody like Donald Trump typical the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended to grant citizenship\nTo slaves and their descendants\nNow how old are you how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment which was used to grant citizenship to this slams and their descendants now being used a grant citizenship to anybody that gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here\nBeen shipped to this slams and their descendants and now being used a grant citizenship to anybody who gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here\n\nAnd so this is something it's long been thought to be untouchable Trump is saying I look I think I can fix this one of the executive order\nAnd the reason he thinks so it was because the constitution is the final word folks the constitution will actually Trump acts of Congress statutory legislative acts of Congress that they pass something unconstitutionally constitutional survives if it can be if the case can be made and\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\nBut the conclusion is it there has been no blue way and there's not even been a blue ripple back you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blow bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support long time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities so this guy is openly [noise]\nFirm belief that a conservative red wave or Republican red wave is coming and is on the way [noise] [noise] many other people are either it's I've I've heard some people who were rushed to look at it got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirement stats\nThat such a\nToss up I don't know how to factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than wherever used to having to factor in\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats has been or has been lost I think by the way the\nPolitical professionals are going to be\nHyping the fact that as things stand I this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places things stand now looks like the Democrats might when my house by\nMaybe for the and that's going to be designed to get you to not get lazy and overconfident\nBut to maybe for the and that's going to be designed to get you to not get lazy and overconfident but don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nEvidence of panic\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by media because their efforts to derail Trump have failed\nEvery one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly colluded with Russia is Robert Mueller was supposed to have delivered to go with\nThe special counsel buying now all was supposed to have core Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way out by now do not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope\nFor the special counsel investigation\nBarring an actual report they had been hoping and praying for a week\n[noise]\nThat would be in the beginning that the report does say that Mahler found hard evidence that Trump important cheated and stole the election from the court shows up the hill derby but there aren't even any such leaks\nThat's the big one that has blown up do not doubt me on this by now Mahler was supposed to have delivered the guards than drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks\nSo now it's off the plan B and plans see and so forth and that's why I say that kind of it's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they feel confident\nIn a in a blue wave let's take a brief time out will come back we'll delve into will get started delving into the Trump claimed that he can defy the constitution and and birthright citizenship whether the

presidency this is what pushing back looks like it was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore\nAnd you know what that means you go into this country together all these years is the\nHonoring about actual results you have a heated campaign you're may have political parties and elements that really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance

in recent months let's get to the phones I'm Sorry folk site a diarrhea of the mouse today because there's so much to discuss we'll start with Dave in Pittsburgh it's great that you waited CERN hello\nHi rush [noise] hey I'm In Pittsburgh and something that really bothered me upset about the local news here are local leaders were blaming off the people of Pittsburgh for the shooting that happened to turn to God\nThey were on the locker leaders are saying that we must come together and stop the hey we must stop the violence we stopped and\nThen after this was a great observation you are making this is classic you have one guy who's responsible for this he's mentally not write clearly off balance he does what he does\nAnd now all of you in Pittsburgh everybody we must come together we as no everybody living their lives cause this guy to lose it and go do what he did\nThe rabbi about synagogue is saying some of the most intelligent stuff anybody a particularly in the heated passionate moment but yeah that you're you're exactly right here local media during the same\nLocal media is doing the same some of the national about local leaders are doing and why should anybody the guy who was shot and they're not say anything about that guy Twain we need to change [noise] I'm like theme for what\nDo you think you need to do a day in ... in order to prevent this from happening again what what do you Dave in Pittsburgh need to do to make sure there's some other lunatic doesn't act like this\nThat and it'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation in the Senate um\nLook we're way way far away from this\nWe're just getting the conversation\n... is going to offer legislation in the Senate um look we're way way far away from this we're just getting on the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration\nAnd so Trump and his ... the roots of an executive order is good but there's the you know there's going to be a judge\nThat's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved you know if that's going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does\nRight legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more than just the statutory act\nAnd the left\nAnd they've got plenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn one of them to try to shut down every effort here\nLet's see this is how folks this is how we ended up having a chance to win by shining the light it's on the left in who they are and what they do by forcing them out of the shadows and making them do it\n\nSanctuary cities isn't good educational tool people can find exactly what these people on the left of the people responsible for this the people that are believing in the sanctuary cities for someone out make 'em defend it\nMake 'em run for office extorting virtuoso sanctuary some make the left speak make them behave make them stand up and support what it is they believed him\nAnd so this conversation starter on the fourteenth amendment ... ending birthright sit and make them stand up and make polo sea and Schumer and whoever else saw them make the case that in a body born in the United states should be able to make them make the case\nThat's how we're going to defeat him folks and it's going to be a long process\nAnd don't get the left has gotten away for years by being able to lie and camouflage themselves and make themselves look like people they aren't and make themselves look like they support things they don't\nOh a lie and camouflage themselves and make themselves look like people they aren't and make themselves look like they support things they don't\nThey hadn't been anybody like Trump and elected in Republican politics forcing the left out this way and as it happens\nIn the media goes more and more bonkers because they know what's going on\n\nAnd it's it's forcing everybody to see that the media is in the media the media is the Democratic party\nAnd all of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there's not going to be a blue wave thinking they think more and more Americans because of Trump are finally the liberalism and action as opposed to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are\nThere now see I can get and once that happens it's it's harder for the left to win\nI mean if they could win by being honest if they can win by being who they are they would they would have been doing that\nFor a long long time
