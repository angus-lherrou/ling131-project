didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nHillary every one of the cats\nDecision making and I says he can get to see my dad all the time like the guy\nWas it was a strong enough to put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made a Superman that was the favorite superhero and you made a Superman said for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who\nThe odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is\nIs referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get transpire Jeb Bush they said that\nAh they're Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think as a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role model\nAnd every day well all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time and it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow\nAnd I'm someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that comedy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West's let's listen to\nThe needs of each other and have someone to help him if a guy them I mean he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nGo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative and who want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be on and on human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people have devoted their lives for this oil I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised a question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room Katy\nRunning around college campuses it's trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy if it bit him in the back side will take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls\nStudents okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy if it bit him in the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty ... we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans flip the script this is a unconventional moves and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go wash\nDishes Michael Mad Men here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of\nMany Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right health markets offers free service with access to thousands on Medicare plans plans that can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and even plant that pay you back\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a planet may cost less and cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to the the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nTestify to this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn\nThis administration is the more Congress unites with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United it's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there\nUnited it's like it's driving the last ... into aid uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing and they are they are more and more angry\n[laughter] well there's you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now Puerto two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point in the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is driving them I think to a\nA two to this uh unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenger the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh when you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have Winnie the Supreme Court justice\nWho believes in voting rights a justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed\nIf she were importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that\nBait do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with a with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion was he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd senator what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard buck are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n[noise] well I think Ted's in that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout we know the left as angry that people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen than that\nHim nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry that people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see it down there in a turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said while he would have voted for a Kavanaugh but I'm the truth is\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term than we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and I just don't think ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking and just going to count on our issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to discussing what next ... when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pack the incentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report\nOr or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions town there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then a leaked that sent it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff for the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or I'm most cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly did the ... Dr Ford's interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this a cup they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is ...\nYeah we're going to we're going to get to the bottom of this a cup they'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because it's just simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this was a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that\nNames when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there is nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone is lying someone dying here\n[laughter] well I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I I hadn't really thought much about it but perhaps ... and that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator or for the next uh you know three and a half weeks of this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seemed like all hands are on back people are working together they're not back biting each other as much in Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win reelection you haven't heard Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time for the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a a has United\nDemocratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\n... that it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right I'm to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or\nA cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the\nBallot ask Jill McCaskill exactly on Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the\nOval Office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time\nBut there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and uh I just thought it was I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was at that reading poetry so no one ever think that we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump as it is that near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty ... pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not\nI I think so well it's just drive he makes their heads explode and they act in all sorts of ... Russian irrational\nWays and and uh we've seen that and looked in the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on on TV and uh I think this we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including the adding more federal judges to the bench\nOh my gosh that is ... the judicial branch coal equal branch of our government article three judges and we need more on Trump nominees on the bench and when you declare those are cleared those through Senator Cornyn again thanks so much for all you did a

... ... when I say hypocrisy is ineffective I'm Talking about only in terms of persuasion and if it ever does work\nTo persuade we probably will never know what one thing I've found throughout my life is when you're when you're targeting people to persuade them egos are such that they never want to admit\nThat anybody change their mind they want to say they came to these conclusions themselves\nAnd

office falling apart because of Trump it's just not really happening sometimes it gets mentioned in passing but but um it's not really\nIt's just not really happening sometimes it gets mentioned in passing but but um it's not really happening and when people mention anything that triggers a stress response\nIt really isn't the the stress or that's the problem it's helping people to manage their own ability to deal with stress because they could they could have problems and any issue money or relationships or something else it's really helping people to get stronger to be\nA to build some palaces and to not take some so Chris soon to be a little more open minded\nUm said I'm not seen with with some of those people are saying\nWell now wait a minute now are you suggesting that the story is in the political that's the equivalent\nOf something as big and watch the Washington Post suggesting that the story is exaggerated and not that many people are suffering from this a prompt arrangement syndrome or whatever\nI can tell you that I have an extremely busy practice and it's not happening because Trump get mentioned in passing yes so didn't George Bush so they go rock Obama but usually they were not there they're member\nYeah but what if your office was on the Upper West side or what if your office was in Georgetown or you know in Hollywood I Walsh or boulevard what its

these people are going to see are suffering from the same things I don't really shrinks know how to help them I think the drinks are probably encouraging them that they're justified in feeling this way that Trump is enough of a rubber ... to make anybody feel this way and that's normal\nI can tell you one thing that I'm I'm right of center and I'm In the minority in psychological and psychiatric field\nOh yeah Oh absolutely\nThat does that bias does bring in someone who is very much a progressive or liberal\nA logical and psychiatric the whole oh yeah Oh absolutely\nSo that does that biased

zero percent that's interest yeah\nThey're not coming in with for that is that they have other things to do they're worried about you know their families are they're going through a divorce or they have anxiety or depression about other things or they were traumatized [noise] um\nLet's see two liberals all of that is Trump spoiled [laughter] 'cause he got elected and he's president it's all his
