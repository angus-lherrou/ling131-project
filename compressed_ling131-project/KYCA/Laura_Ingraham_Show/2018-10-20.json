healthiest food on the planet the treating so there can't be a correlation there [laughter] [noise]\nSo [noise] so at the class we talked about you know like ear infections right okay you get gear up parents gear up your kids are going to get an ear infection and an ... you know from one week to two months they're going to get a near interaction\n\nSo five medical doctors in a PHD looked at\nThe associated food allergies and in Seventy eight to ... percent of the kids with ear infections had a food allergy they got rid of the food eighty six percent got better they reintroduced attitude Ninety four percent got worse\nOh so does this I looked at when your kid has an ear infection to relocate sugar to relocate soda pop do we look at milk allergies that your kids to Russian and Tylenol on an antibiotic don't question me\n[noise]\nIt's really I'm quite crazy see Ninety eight percent of kids after having tubes put in her ears because here's a progression parents raise your hand if you've gone through this [noise] your kid gets an ear infection by them you need an antibiotic and you need Tylenol and you need to yesterday\nTo your kids born with a certain number of antibiotics and Tylenol and their system and then when they when they reach seven years\nAntibiotic and you need Tylenol and you need to yesterday\nTo your kids born with a certain number of antibiotics and Tylenol in their system [noise] and then when they when they reach seven years old or it's gone so that's why they got an ear infection as their antibiotics wore out and ran out in the Tylenol was in their bodies was diminished and depleted so then they got the ear infection\nSee that's the medical model your kids to fishing and antibiotics and tunnel\nSo they do the antibiotic number one and the kids are OK\nAnd Adam ... medical research says it that weakens the immune system sixty to eighty percent of immune systems in the gut raise your hand if you as a parent or grandparent headed kid put on an antibiotic all sudden they got diaper rational upside one down ... down the\nAnd the kids got diarrhea and that will lead to the rash and you know as part of their immune system gets smoked\nSo then you get a stronger immune enhance or in their world called stronger antibiotic because the kid had another infection\nAnd then you get a stronger antibiotic and then they finally shut down in all seriousness I say well you know you don't want your kid have hearing loss here so we got to put tubes and the kids there's no Ninety eight percent ... percent of kids in one study had a rare occurrence of the flu would build up two months\nAfter having the tubes in here the tube is is it too is supposed to drain the flu it ought to the ears right hoops Ninety eight percent had fluid

right I Do get should that's a good distorted guitar part and you gotta have some drums bonnet Carre GM you've been very patient go ahead sure your arm year\n\nMy apologies Okay Jim you are still on the Gulf War\nI mean we know or what have you heard about remembering Kelly by themselves\nOh jeeze Okay Jim you are still on the air go for it\nOr what have you heard about remembering fairly by fell\nFor\nLaser surgery\nFile lasers can take down a missile fire I'm sure they can cut through fat and there are some times when I think that that's probably an acceptable route to take\nThe its kind in that category it made me one time would do it I I'm never had a fire don't need it if I'm not familiar with it from a personal standpoint\nBut from what we ultimately in the natural health care field and certainly in my clinic we like to look at okay why is there a belly fat is because of the percentage of body fat being increased in that person is there for is that because they're not eating right so it's like we use the analogy GM of putting\nFaring a tire every day off a little bit lower we got to put some yellow home compressor pop up the tire next day pump up the tire and eventually you're going to want to say hey why don't we just six to leak\nSo if there was a belly fat issues that can be handled one time by the laser and you want to do some homework and research on the\nSafety in the advocacy meaning the effectiveness of it\nBut if it's safe and effective and it's a one time thing and you get rid of some some people will lose a lot of weight and they'll have a kind of some flabby skin hanging around him flopping around in this and that and so they get a cut off or they do whatever they do with that\nAnd and then there are good because they don't intend to gain weight again because they've changed your lifestyle but that's kind of a key thing is to change your lifestyle all\nYeah it'll come in come out of their ear\nDepending on the person some people's physiology they just lay down fat quicker\nAnd it's one of those things that it can it can be helpful because one pound of fat I've read anywhere from Eighteen to seven hundred miles some blood vessels are required to from the heart to supply that one pound of fat\nSo anybody that has\nAny fat anywhere you know it just puts a strain on the cardiovascular system so to get it cut off like that would be maybe really saw a real important thing and logical thing to do but again do your homework do some research talk to the people that have had it done to talk to the people that in fact are doing it\nPorn thing and logical thing to do but again do your homework do some research talk to the people that have had ... talk to the people that in fact\nAre doing it and see their reviews and you'll get online and Google the heck out of that thing before you haven't done it in the meantime you know start eating well exercising well if you're able to and that is the suggestion let me read this my engineer just him some research\nAnd it's not the only place in ... on a battle oh [noise]\nYeah so anyway it's to do some homework on that than you are you are you asking for yourself there Jim yeah see I Would do some smart guy called before\nAnd what kind of weight loss and climate there\nWell my wife takes care of that and she has an excellent excellent track record men is not if the lifestyle is not a crazy die you don't count calories that's tedious in dire comes from a ... diet too which means way of life\nAnd what we typically have she has what's called a fat flush system\nIs very effective and it's safe and we've known for years and we encourage the Mediterranean diet because it's the one that's best\nFor preventing osteoporosis and the best for preventing dementia and it's been around forever the paleo diet is going to come and go to South Beach diet can it can come and go and I didn't even know if we're still around Mediterranean diet as men holding the line\nSo I Would suggest you know you can call the clinic and you can schedule with my wife she will do a percentage of body fat test on you\nAnd there may be a waiting list because she has a lot of people that want that and if you Google lip of youth laser liberal was what you want to Google and that will give you the information on that and then you can always call the Clinton for other questions and you know check out the weight loss program that we do and [noise]\nAnd\nYeah it does have a lot a lot of things to think about their gym but I sure appreciate your calls or oh\nGosh say one more thing absolutely I heard on the last year the drain out their first shot was ineffective and wars ... or ... hours history\nYeah it's it's just it's such a pause\nAnd we'll tourist flu season one of the worst in history\nYeah it's it's just it's such a puzzle they say okay this shot has mercury get it we don't know if it's effective get it\nAnd we think that maybe they didn't thirty three consecutive years because they initially claimed that the flu shot would be great for preventing flu deaths and the elderly zero thirty ... consecutive years I looked at that\nAnd then ... then they expanded their market they said well six month old should get our flu shot we don't know what the strain is we don't know the effectiveness he has it has mercury\nGet our shots and don't have a question now is because we are the medical profession the the alphabet people far frustrating to me the M.

singer and he has more to last year and he is running everything including my life\nThank God for mark Israeli my daily expectation believe me I just I I so happy and lucky\nReally are and if you want a ... yes say you know I'm a stay a\nIf you want to read how much I Love mark you'll have to pre order my new book the dumb things smart people do with their money because I think I made his fiance cry a little bit like a little teary uh in the acknowledgement\nThat that's told the truth so I'd like to say publicly he hates it ah okay let's go to a caller eight is Ralph who woke up nice in the early for us in the bay area hello route how can I help you out today\nAnd thanks for taking my call of course what's up\nA lot to ask you about qualified longevity annuity contracts\nThe famous cue lack\nYes ma'am\nWhat's going on in your life that you're considering it\nWell I'm a single man without children about to turn a sixty five retire or for teaching oh congratulations Oh thank you can\nBuy a ... a little bit of Social Security\nSaved about a hundred hundred and fifty\nWell thank you can buy a although receiving a small pension now a little bit of Social Security of saved about a hundred eight hundred and fifty thousand for all through the uh some of the traditional Ira\nAnd a little bit on a raw hey I don't have any debt\nAnd I was thinking says I'm probably not going to have the errors of my good idea for me to pluck out about a ... a and place it in a Q lack that supposed to begin whatever\nAround eight years of age ... understanding of the queue or is it pays about two thousand a month depending upon which I'm sure a scarier you your shoes\nRight and uh for the rest of my life and one of the concerns I have about being a single man without family is that you know\nI may make bad decisions as I got older I may need long term care ... uh I may become senile I'm frightened of market volatility ... and uh having a ... my view sort of a good offer uh for me um\nSo do I get older suggest so I understand that you're using the you would be using the most people look at the cue lack as a way\nTo kind of push off year requiring minimum distribution till later in your eighties\n... or you know should to mostly it's used as a theoretical way to kind of delay receiving required minimum distributions is that what you are using it for or would you be using it to create income\nOh okay which would you say is more important at this point\nI Would say probably I'm I'm\nProbably the how the added income towards the end of my life okay private insurance\nI mean I might okay so I went to one of the smartest people I Know because I'm not a cue lack expert\nBut on a ... it's a guy named Michael ... says he he writes a cool\nUm he runs a website called nerds I view and it's mostly for nerdy people like him which would include me he's a financial adviser and he wrote very eloquently about the ... so I went to him and kind of want to see what was going on and she saying\nAdvisor and he wrote very eloquently about the ... so I went to him and kind of wanted to see what was going on\nAnd he thinks that um unfortunately that although it sounds good it turns out I'm going to quote him here\nIt turns out the unique nature of the longevity annuities payment structure is not very hospitable as an R and D ... strategy it can take until the retirees late eighties just to break even\nAnd recover principle which means they're retiring risk significant foregone growth by trying to merely to for our MDs through the use of a ... so here's what I Would have to say to you about that\nI think the problem is that if you want income than it is reasonable for you to say hey I think that I Would like to add some income to my pension and my Social Security I have this traditional i._r._a. how much is in the traditional i._r._a.\nI'm a ... and ...\nAnd ... and there's eight fifty in the four three B and even right now the traditional i._r._a. how was it invested generally\n[noise] about ah six three for ... for for so long\nAnd you like doing this yourself are you doing this in a no load mutual fund environment okay I mean if you really are concerned about income than what I might look at is um to actually look in at a low cost annuity\nThat it's just that not necessarily a cue lack and doesn't have to be you know could or could not be but I think that low cost annuities are hard to find okay they really are\nOn and so what I think you might want to do is to say All right where can I find a low cost annuity a or a low load 'em and I might start with vanguard\nI'm just to uh where are you holding holding your accounts right now your eye or a cat right now\n\nI've heard of them [laughter]\nThink he should since you're doing this I Do think that I'm a low load 'em annuity might be something that you should explore I all I Know one that is at that they have through vanguard I don't know if ... offers a load but if you're seeking to create a stream of income that is going to be\nI Know one that is at that they have through vanguard I don't know ... offers a load but if you're seeking to create a stream of income that is going to be uninterrupted and then maybe perhaps you look at an annuity on the other hand\nIf you're really worried about sort of like what happens if I lose my mind I'm Wondering have you done your state plant was a really realistic I like have you done estate planning it\nNo I don't know so I mean look I think there there is another issue here which is a ...\nIf you have nobody in your family do you have a friend who would trust a younger friend who you trust or should you just hire someone to act as a trustee on your behalf an institution that could help oversee\nAny issues that arise if you take a turn for the worst\nAnd so what I'm going to tell you is actually first and foremost before you starting to look at an annuity\nAnd doing this I think you should start looking at your own estate planning and even though you may not have any air is maybe you want to leave money to charity maybe you want to have someone to have some flexibility and and you know some ... maybe make a a charity the\nThe beneficiary of your traditional i._r._a. and then if something happened to you then it goes there or maybe you want to pay an organization\nTo act as a trustee if something bad were to happen for you I think this is a story that begins with estate planning it then incorporate what your law white what you're thinking and then you may find that if you had that person that was in your life\nFor you know again you you find a good qualify to state attorney and then you don't need an annuity that and you just have somebody who's going to help administer assets this could be a really important step for you and not get involved with any insurance product at all so I think that's where I Would start\nAnd you think that makes sense\nWhich are All right good then go off and make some money keep teaching what what do you teach by the way\nTo a government histories\nYou got a lot on your plate right now Mr sure there's a lot of our government and there's history being made everyday thank you so much for calling let me know how it goes okay thanks so much bigger good luck\nOn sometimes you see it's funny there we are we get to the nut question but only by doing a little digging\nIt's fascinating to me it always has and\nThere we are we get to the nut question\nBut only by doing a little digging it's fascinating to me it always is and uh hey estate planning week bark you missed it coming to the end of it right now but\nIt is so important it is important to distill what is the issue that has really underlying\nThe question that's what I that's what I think is

guest chip Conley is about to explain how you can really reframe what you do in your workplace\nNow ship was the owner of a boutique hotel ... scene is can talk he's just written a new book called wisdom at at symbol work\nAnd we're having him on because he is speaking to this idea that now that he's at air being be he's refrained his great experience\nAnd you can to here's the first part of our interview with chip Conley let's talk a little bit about the air being be your heart of this and then we'll get into your book so I have a separate book here I lovely okay lovely also friend of the pod friend of the show\nIn her air BNB story here she describes you are so Brian chess game read your book peak great companies get their mo Jo from mass low and the book's author I'm reading now quoting from Lee Gallagher's book the air being B story and and listeners you remember we had Lee on the show a few different times\nThe book's author was chip calmly the founder of ... a boutique hotel chain which he started in San Francisco in Nineteen eighty seven overtime\nConley himself had become something of a ... a lot of that in the case because I'm bald Scott now okay you know in that book you basically applied\nThe teachings of psychologist Abraham ... hierarchy of needs the pyramid of physical and psychological needs humans must have met\nIn order to achieve their full potential with food and water at the bottom and self ... at the top to corporate an individual transformation now self actual ... at the top sounds a tiny bit ... San Francisco bay area and and me can you explain it Abraham ... was a good uh\nNow self actual nation at the top sounds a tiny bit ... San Francisco bay area and asked me can you explain it Abraham\n... was a good a good Jewish boy who spent some time in New York uh teaching um created this in the mid ... century\nAnd the premise was being all you can be you know that that was a U.S army line in an ad campaign that they got from Oslo ... since ... basically being all you can be and so um yeah it does sound a little bit um you know new age but the bottom line is\nAnybody in their work and in their life would like to be all they can be you know if assuming that there are engaged with life and so the premise of that book peak was really to help people to understand how to create an organization that can have a collection of individuals being all that can be\nDo you think that in corporate America that we ... it seems to me at least I you know I interviewed tons of these CEOs and the sweet people in on the record author record it seemed to be kind of gotten away from that I mean they say bill you can be but they really mean bill you can be so we can maximize profits\nThat's an issue with my phone provider do you mark no it can't be\nI think this is a hardware problem anyway you're listening to Jill on money and this is the program that takes the mystery out of your financial life I'm Jill slashed singer\nAnd you know we try to bring you fun and entertaining interviews and the second hour and a I just adore this guy I I wasn't expecting to like him as much as I did however as Marco always likes to remind me\nEvery time I think and it's not going to be great interview I meet the person and and pleasantly surprised mostly because I Am of all year and I love just talking to people but this guy chip Conley is a\nI think a a special case and no one really significant issue that impacted chips life is that he had terrible scare health scare\nIn his late forties and um I only bring that up because we just finished we're just finishing estate planning weak and just a gentle reminder gang get your estate planning stuff just get\nWe just finished we're just finishing estate planning weak and just a gentle reminder gang get your estate planning stuff just get it done talked to any state attorney\nQualify to state attorney not the person who did your real estate closing not the woman who negotiated you divorce and state planning attorney would that expertise please please do that\nAnd you know we're talking about what is midlife yes we're all going to live longer chances are and one of the cool things is that because of that because we're all likely to live longer chick Conley says we need to redefine what need life really means\nFirst of all ... for those of us who are in midlife and and and let's start by saying mid life I think has actually changed it used to be forty to sixty five today I think it's thirty five Seventy five because people feel irrelevant earlier because there are more people in this mid life marathon and feeling a little confused by it\nI think the key is to start start saying which habitats are going to be open to your wisdom and ah so\nOne of the things that I had lucky going for that was fortunate for me was I was in an industry hospitality and these the founders of there'll be MB it started in that field but had nobody in the company would hospitality background\nSo start by asking is there a field or an industry you may be in health care\nAnd you have some people want to disrupt health care and then got some great technology but they really don't understand how the industry works or they don't have the contacts they don't have a rolodex that know how and I know who the combination of those two together is something you have going for you especially if it's an industry where people are learning the industry along the way\nSo I think that was helpful I think also it was helpful as it was clear that Bryan and his co founders really wanted to learn from me why because they asked me a lot of questions rather than sort of having to you in the room and then on occasion just saying okay let's try ship out\nAnd talked about hospitality they started looking at me three weeks into friends and you're in her in charge of strategy now so it's just we just enjoy the hospitality and three weeks into it and now in charge of strategy for the company which was not something I asked for but he clearly saw that I had a strategic mind so that was great\nSo but I but let me just say I had a you know the book was didn't work the making of a modern older is full of used apples a hundred and fifty examples beyond me I Am an unusual case in the sense that the founders of this company asked me to join them that doesn't happen a lot for people in their fifties\nI think there's something interesting you point out many people face their modern\nThe founders of this company asked me to join them that doesn't happen a lot for people in their fifties\nI think that there's something interesting you point out many people face their modern elder years with a sense of anxiety I hear that anxiety when people call the show up and they're in their fifties and I have friends obviously you I'm sure you have the same thing you have a group of friends you grew up with them or you went to college with them and\nThey're in this place where they just don't know how to channel themselves into a next chapter and there is anxiety financial anxiety obviously when you probably didn't have as much better\nI think that sometimes people stay stuck in a place where they feel like they're becoming obsolete in kind of like running out the clock and don't know how to make a move and and I find that to be it that's pretty consistent\nAnd really consistent we have um we started something called the modern older academy which is a social enterprise so so it you know we have half the people coming on scholarship where people come to a campus in in on a on a beach front in ... which is in Mexico and yes and they come and they learn about how to evolve into a modern elder\nWhat the four steps that are outlined in the book so you don't have to go to Mexico necessarily to do this\nOr number one you have to evolve and this is the hardest up because many of us\nI I Would have been very hard for me if I think back on it to be fifty two years old I've run my own company for you know with for twenty four years and now I'm actually reporting to someone who is Twenty one years younger than me ouch forty percent of us in the workplace\nHave a boss younger than us and that's actually only growing as a phenomena so if I didn't evolve and say okay I'm no longer the sage on the stage if the leader of the company but I'm the guy on the side and the person who's helping this guy Brian be successful and I\nHad I had the right size my ego so that was one form of evolving I needed to do\nAnd that idea of evolving is not just in your identity but it's in what you know and that gets you to the second lesson which has to learn so the first lessons are evolving learn which are two things that frankly people in midlife often feel like they don't want to do because it takes work\nRight and it's uncomfortable the idea of uncertainty is something that grits us often as we get older and certainly can come from feeling ages him in the workplace treasury feel like oh my God I couldn't be you know one\nOne round of layoffs right away from being at the what are some things we can develop while we're still working to try to help us get to the next stage\nOne round of layoffs right away from being at the what are some things we can develop while we're still working to try to help us get to the next stage before that happened\nSo uncertainty as painful but irrelevant seems worse and so that's a good I I just not in the book I can hear your new job where we're going down the road um\nSo the bottom line is I think that if you do the math let me just start by saying this I'm fifty seven years old I hung out with my dad you know in a scuba diving with him in rural Indonesia in may my dad's eighty one this month\nUm and my dad and I took one of his online tests where it says how ... how long have you lived to be both for both of us is that we're ... we're Ninety eight\nTo five fifty seven now and I'm a little Ninety eight you can do the math I Am thirty nine years into my adulthood and I have forty one years of adulthood ahead of me I Am a less than half way through my adult part of my life when you think that way you realize oh my gosh I have a lot of time ahead of me which\nMeans that you may be more willing to have a beginners mind and be a little bit curious about things that you might say yeah let me try that out I'm going to be a beginner and the idea of being in mid life you know let's look back in childhood we had to learn how to walk which means we had to fall down a few times\nAnd we've had to do things in our life where we've had to get be not very good at it learning a language at fifty seven among Spanish and money surfing last year when the surf this is not the thing that people in their fifties do but\nThe process is great it creates curiosity ... curiosity is an old licks her\nFor having a life affirming kind of experience so long story short is once you realize that it's not over at age fifty you're open to maybe trying some things and looking awkward along the way but having fun and that being able to laugh at yourself\nCan you explain this rule that you have at ... and you know as a modern elder you say that you have to be an editor yeah explain what you mean by that\nThere's a great book the Johnson Rausch brought out recently called the happiness curve and uh it it goes into great detail about the fact that frankly people get happier starting around fifty or forty your forties are your worst decade the reason for that is because we tend to accumulate\nUp until about right at age fifty what does that mean well you ... friends you accumulate relationships or you know you you might you accumulate children and and having kids you accumulate roles and respond\nWhat does that mean or you accumulate friends you accumulate relationships or you know you you might you accumulate children and and having kids you accumulate roles and responsibilities and things you do for nonprofits and\nBy the time you get your forties it's a mishmash of so many things that you really don't feel like you know you have much control or freedom in your life and so you accumulate in the first half your life you edit and the second half your life and we see this a lot with people in their homes\nThey have a you know have a big home then they become an empty nester and then they downsize that's an example of editing\nThe process of editing your life down to what's important to you including who you want to spend time with and what you want to do is a really valuable exercise because it means you start focusing on what makes you happy [noise]\nOkay

among the aging aspirational again [laughter]\nUm the idea that we could actually see that frankly some of the best part of our life doesn't an amazing benefits that come the second half of midlife a and\nHelping people to see that and then I see that companies could use that and then create a new kind of generational compact the idea that the movement would be around how do we see aging as a part of society that isn't something that we just sort of shut shut it off to retirement homes\nBut instead it's actually there's something to be learned from the younger generation and it goes in both

email\nMike says in past years we will we were able to write off twenty six thousand dollars in itemize deductions and also sixteen thousand dollars for personal exemptions for our family of four that told forty two thousand dollars now with the new tax brackets it looks like we will only be able to write\nOff twenty four thousand is that true well so two things\nFirst you've got to determine are you going to claim the standard deduction or are you going to itemize there's a few things about itemized deductions that you should know first of all on you are limited in your uh itemize deductions for state and local taxes to ten thousand dollars overall\nYou also um if your charitable contribution limit for a year cash donations is limited to sixty percent of your adjusted gross income I think for most people that's not going to matter medical expenses deductible in excess of seven and a half percent of your adjusted gross income so Utah Boulder itemized deductions\nThere are just a gross income I think for most people that's not going to matter medical expenses deductible in excess of seven and a half percent of your adjusted gross income the tone up all their itemized deductions and you say to yourself is that more\nThan what I Would claim for the standard deduction\nSo if you had twenty six thousand dollars in itemized deductions in the past presuming that some of that state and local taxes we don't know 'cause I don't know where you're from\nBut if that reduces if your state and local tax part of it let's just let's pretend that you had Fifteen grand in state and local taxes we kept at just ten\nSo then you have to add up all your other itemize deductions to see that makes sense and if he adds up to more than twenty four thousand dollars and then you then you would have\nTo itemize but if it's less than twenty four thousand then you would just basically claim the standard deduction which is twenty four thousand so you lose a personal exemptions that just went away the real question is\nOnce you've made that decision all is not lost maybe your tax bracket went down maybe all of a sudden your tax bracket which was you know twenty eight ... goes down to twenty two\nSo you didn't mention how much um what your income was but you may find that your total tax picture improved I don't know 'cause I don't know what last year was but that's the big decision around standard versus itemize saying\nYour standard deduction it's twenty four thousand for married filing jointly you've got to tally up all the itemized deductions including the new limitations and see if it's more and then we'll figure it out but no you don't get those unfortunately those a\nA personal exemptions anymore okay ah Rob wants to know a strategy for creating income during his retirement he's fifty four he says he's a computer programmer and he would love the option of renting or cutting back at sixty\nI feel most comfortable knowing that I could have a hundred thousand

his four oh one K. with a company match his retirement savings he's got about a one point one million dollars in regular investments of nine hundred so he's got to a million bucks\nHis four oh one K.
