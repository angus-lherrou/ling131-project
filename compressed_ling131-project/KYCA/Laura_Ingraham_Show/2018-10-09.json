called racist or afraid of all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually shut the distance or\nAnd I think it was a seminal moment inflection point in the

really show real leadership and did not cut and run a judge Kavanaugh if they'd cut and run judge kept the fight for judge Kavanaugh for his confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency\nAnd I think it it it it the booze everybody to really understand that the Republican establishment and the populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts and all the you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want\nAnd that's what it's going to take this November and quite frankly don't take that going forward so hopefully law this is the beginning of people saying you know we've got to work together this is what happened in six ten you know when I step into the campaign in August\nWe were quite fractured everything pulled together and wasn't me it was it runs Priebus it was many many people that came together to bought the grass roots together people like you with your show that brought the grassroots effort together with the establishment and we won in ... that's the lesson one word United\nPut our differences off to the side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the thing with the stakes are so high look at what happened at and look what happened at the vote of judge Kavanaugh on the floor of the United States Senate\nLook how many people have had given their lives to this country than with the rule of law at the center we have that that behavior of those protesters were just unacceptable and what happened afterwards which is really kind of model that's coming so if you want to make sure that the\nLike the senators were harassed or an attack in the Senate and it's like Ted Cruz and his wife were basically a costume or by people at a restaurant and the chase down an alley if that's what you want the future will be built up\nBut it's about what you may have to vote for somewhere and it was in your district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now

ballot has shrunk somewhat\nIt's all about President Trump and going forward and that's what we've got to pull together\nWell we're talking to Steve Bannon here on the ... show the ah the generic

races has been a four point lead\nAnd what um the\nThe post Washington Post and uh the shower school\nAnd they pulled a\nAnd this was districts as of August twenty four and a lot has changed since then but apparently it's about a four point advantage Democrats hold I think that's actually good news and it's only four points\nI think it's great news is really down from ... one polar audience just keep in mind when power and decided not to run the we're talking about sixty votes than it was fifty I went on Sean Hannity on the hundred day to go ... I was saying it's thirty five forty or now within\nThe kill zone this is very winnable as all of that she was an agency even the post story today's a little dated because it doesn't really talk about what happened after capital I think what we're going to see is remember President Trump won a white female voters fifty two forty eight which done Hillary Clinton\nWon a high school educated white voters female voters sixty nine\nThirty one some of the ... President Trump does resonate with women who who understand national security and women who are concerned that Law Order a woman who are concerned about the economy or jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out I I Would love to look at the trend is in our favor it's trending\nTrending to to uh stopping this blue wave\nAnd people have to understand if we stop the blue way\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other in a vicious way between the Clinton Wall Street hunter and these kind of social justice a basic cultural marks on the left tear each other apart and I think leaders to a massive victory of two thousand twenty that's where it such urgency\nFor people really the focus on his house districts in the in the coming in the coming three or four weeks that we really this is all about\nYou know one of the great things I Love about being a conservative Republican at all or is that people understand it's about self reliance inspect getting up and doing something this is a hundred percent\nIn our our zone right now to to turn this around I think you can look at every number the trend is that our favor\n... uh I certainly hope so see before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe I Know you have the movement that's called a\nThe trend is that our favor\nYou know I certainly hope so Steve before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe\nI Know you have the movement it's called uh in Europe or maybe you've done some more can Italy we see so many there are and other leaders guy saw Le Pen was meeting with so many yesterday the day before\nA into trying to again ... recapture the European a cultural understanding or bad it's been so threatened by poor leadership\nMass migration et cetera and where do things stand in in Europe I Know it's every country is different but where things stand now\nBut you know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a ... year ahead or around the United states that's what grades did kind of came up before a brings it\nAnd the two thousand sixteenth victory Donald Trump are inextricably linked you're seeing the same thing and\nIn Europe right now ... basically what it is it's the same kind of Tea Party grassroots ...\nYou know ... ... evangelical Christian revolted just soon over in Europe what you're saying is people that want their sovereignty back of their countries are tired of the ... he was really a global organization has tried to take their their national sovereignty and take the value of their citizenship away from that whether it's on migration economics a whole host\nOf issues are seeing leaders like Le Pen in France or the alternative ...

well\nIt's it's basically saying you know it's so embarrassing for us in the world stage with Trump\nThey would rather have our country not do as well economically if it means they're not embarrassed among their liberal elite friends in Europe\nThe general Powell who are a lot of respect for it's just very disappointed he also doesn't really understand it's just the mist appointed that day to it a lot of things but President Trump has tried to Israel and they were driven a alliances throughout the world with a ... at first but he's also putting them he's inextricably linked\nA amid the

hey they're part of a package and there's people like General Powell I mean I honestly the general ... day was kind of embarrassing because he's so detached from really understanding the details are particularly say this on a NATO\nOr the president has done more to try to rejuvenate the NATO allies by having the NATO countries start to step up and pay more for their own defense for President Trump says that we're looking for allies we're not we're not we're not an imperial power or not trying to be we're not looking for ...\nAnd what happened to the NATO in Europe is basically a protector of the United states it's unfair because when the overall economy in Europe\nIs about the same size the United states and so people just got to step up and start being good allies in see people like

good\nUm Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kavanaugh's replacing and here is the president of the United states just started hearing audio soundbites ... he is apologizing Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to bread and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward just serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in you follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over\nEverybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that it's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin all their openly promising that continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are

win the house of representatives to nullify the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this isn't anywhere over\nAnd so in Trump is calling them out and I'm telling you folks this is crucial we don't I I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it's just as important as the Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained\nTo the American people what the American media had not told him\nWhen he resigned the essence of her testimony\nThat when the drive by said that he was mocking Dr malls before he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where the house was\nShe didn't know how she got home and she didn't know who took her and she didn't know what she said after the event that the only thing she remembered is that she had one beer\nThat the four people she sent word of there in the house all the night at the press hadn't told nobody that\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable staying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf\nIt takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThat and that's what we'll do\nIt has

deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing in immaturity is the result of the liberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nThat video and video of these kids\nOn Saturday afternoon to literally calling at the door is that the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try and stop the real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this wasn't just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all event promoted\nDenounced all of it promoted and encouraged by the powers that be in the media and the Democrat Party and the ...\nOf the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to this decent people are we're we're not going to become them\n\nThey may have as an objective with a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but\nWe're not going to become who they are we don't have it again is to become who they are so given that how are they stopped\nIt's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder\nTo stop things they don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to you beat that back\nYou're doing with these ... to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm Sorry I'm going to cut it sorry never Trump has bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia trick [laughter]\n[noise] sorry never Trump ... bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia ... the church is rock solid the churches where enduring about [noise] uh not anymore\nThe churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money\nChurches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is here but take a look at your papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our\nWay of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest levels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean their bodies accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up participating\nIn the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but its highest levels of governance never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were\nProven innocent thank you [laughter]\n[noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man\nThank you [laughter]\n[noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump per se but that's just pure class\nTo take the time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young\nDaughters of breath and Ashley Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear about every father loves\nHaving his children told that he was a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night\nThen proclaiming camping knows innocence I mean that is akin to taking all of poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it cabin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media tried to ruin the Kavanaugh\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\n\nHe can't do that that wasn't a corner or he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to die on science I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or is she was also a storage\nBut somebody suggested she writes that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the U.S the Y. United States attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nDon't think they ever expected it to get as far as it then they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination on Kavanaugh would pull out\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it then they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination on Kavanaugh would pull out and they would never get as far as ... as it got clear it was\nClearly\nIllustrator jihad no evidence no collaboration no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought I Would go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull a nomination presidents don't want the grief starts to reflect poorly on\nThem they go to the nomination look [noise] it won't work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees inside damn it's my one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee\nPresident get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah nominee pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused to pull out withdraw ghetto capital that's where they gum up the works\nAnyway I got to take on another brief time out and just getting warmed up here\nOn one level the mall five Rush Limbaugh\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one random safe you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America would amaze you it takes skills sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creation as that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network online at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is\nIt going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that the president is teaching Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody's pick it up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was\nWhat do you think would happen\nIt because I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats and the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red wave I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like everybody is preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expanded their whole there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in numbers we haven't seen and who knows like since Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd I'm Wondering what if what if all of that\nCrafts are going to retake the house in numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right rash of my son was one about away Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by ... trust shows them jobs even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here to Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor California is is closer than is running its gamble new some than anybody would ever have believed possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think Washington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the melt down that is going to happen among many\nElected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this they've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this country\nWhere it ought not be there people ought to be more
