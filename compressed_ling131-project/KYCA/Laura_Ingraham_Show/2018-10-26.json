help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about uh somebody might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact\nThey don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that the you know so so that's that's but as we're talking about this someone said to me\nYou know and what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort an FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert he was actually a tax possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti pollutant stances heat\nHeat specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't it interesting\nI have it be that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operations to designed to do what's happening now more of this you know anything and so in some ways we shouldn't allow south I mean it's I mean ... strange moments and and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about what we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign context was everything what that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and again not conspiracy theorize and again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post marked on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise]\nThem how do you discovered that they came out of Florida that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announced is\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I. N. F. treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan\nAnd negotiations are pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty bladder mayor prudent turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we notice\nSo ... it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing earth sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five forty war that is a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew longer I Am sitting in for ...

all over the u._k. yeah field several\nPeople or one person then so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders for you know the vice president's et cetera uh the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nThis point in time let me ask you this because getting getting back to this I enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can lose it us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I can talk so what is it what does that mean\nHe's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I get so what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how and there was what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is he going to do except threatening you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan when the first thing too is against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinate Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting a\nTimeout pulls that carry this\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting light like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before then this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia\nCan keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThey tried to drum up support there to force us to not what you often the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot or he is a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race wasn't Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the ... show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\n[laughter] yeah well I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I you know learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the air force I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so I had built a team\nAnd I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so I had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nOn the important point in and you and I ought to know how to talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for and we'll talk to the show dog how to show\nUp my but my my question unlawfully people what they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nThree establishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire\nAnd and all you're exactly right and things like me what the bank you Buddy Guy thank you can see them all share\nA little bit explain explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nBut I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roof you can go to in San Francisco yeah exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said do you really have to world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them that destroyed them\nEconomically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet um you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this is changing stance visa view Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion them in the Bahamas or their their entire administration on down with the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways uh you you look at you\nIf you want to collusion I mean the bombers or their their entire administration on down with the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at the uranium so you know those sailed you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there were intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate then and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work they're doing and I listen I get in touch with you want

be all in on um a bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make a whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down\nNow in the midst of this there continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported the discussion about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers and ban\nUh down in in in plantation Florida and one of the\nThings that I had intended to share with you today as a Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we have an audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\n\nChuck Todd said that he fears the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party as well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and [noise]\nThere's a lot of CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now\nAnd that is so all of this confusion Chuck\nTodd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility that Russians are behind this and the male bottom scary is dividing the\nCountry and that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press daily now the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is\nNot worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press\nHave Chuck Todd\nWho's still believes despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence\nChuck Todd still operating under the belief that Russians stole the two thousand sixteen election somebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen and and and in fact\nThe exact opposite is what happened is we all know Hillary and her team were doing the clothing with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is I mean Democrats in the deep state lose or that they can say election in Balad too much was going on we can't we can't our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think could be\nThe deep staying here sent this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts hearing aids the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent they'd been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I would've said I'm Crazy I mean I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\n[noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being on a lot of trouble\nOf course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't [noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being out a lot of trouble\nTheoretically he'll eventually the gears up for justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans around the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again\nIn order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan I says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\n\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once was elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him they if they really\nJust a moment we'll let's discuss it you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot\nIn in this election there's no wrong answer her don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you'd you'd think that Trump is essentially on the ballot that this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in Toto are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this is going to be their big moment when they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this was the beginning of the ...\nWhen I when I was something that I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blonde harassment keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read this stuff and\nIt's all written by among young millennial journalists and they have ever since election day two thousand sixteen they haven't been in various stages of\nPanic and I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll\nShowing that reading way or the bloom wave was not going to happen and it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about\nWriting about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty in was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off results\nKnow what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty and was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off result that it's not really representative of America Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says but if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and then we are not running the show in truth\nAnd it was it was a it was ... I wouldn't say there was panic in it I'm reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some of the last two years they have lived with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand six team was unusual irregular a a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of band candidate with\nHillary Clinton and so forth an overconfidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day but he's two years to fix is mistaken the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correctness missing now they're starting to begin to\nQuite may be this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority and it kind of dumb tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example that a\nTrump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum devote because of his mom's now\nHow can I share something with\nYou here I went yeah Trump rally I went out a Trump\nRally two weeks ago it was an it was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats for this event it was sitting like twelve thousand\nI'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line there were more women than there were men are going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters and my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters when I got down there\nLike me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that and it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and phone how how could you vote against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got their momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing it on their sleeves like these crazy radical leftists are all doing\nWhen they're and they're going to vote that they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there where it on their sleeves like these crazy radical\nLeftist are all doing well it is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that uh this week of bomb scare stories can dampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people let's continue you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a\nUsual lessening of enthusiasm or gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it that was it's as important now is it wasn't a thousand sixteen\nAnd in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been in that then the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I think the ... the rally in Houston\nHe was talking about how he he pronounced he's got he's got a track record now he said\nTwo years ago on the campaign and I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again and we're going to stop this we're going to make a trade deals matter but back\nThen it was just words he said was just words but now two years later I produced meaning is not just words it's real now and I think Trump soda supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um the attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to his spirit them a or to somehow weaken their enthusiasm so we'll see uh that won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called sanctioning extended time we'll be back after\nThis doesn't olfactory news you need to know Russia
