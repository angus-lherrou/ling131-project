be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated that circa ... cases will be denied those folks can be returned to the United states\nThey could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states that and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum Guatemala they should be applying for asylum Mexico but they're not in addition to the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where a company daily in a miners have to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they have like but again\nThey're

people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nPaying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it cost to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for a very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor at this is another incentive again you went back to ... the people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory either verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to cure these cases as quickly as possible so those are the good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum\nFrom Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is not the case is that is that a
