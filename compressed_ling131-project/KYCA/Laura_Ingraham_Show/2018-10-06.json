the equity lines are on two pieces a rental property\nThat I get a first mortgage on one\nSo okay interesting question on\nThe the tax rules have changed right we knew that as a the first of the year\nAnd I want to be clear because mortgage debt is a bit misunderstood right now in terms of what it I'm ... how how it actually is it has changed so big picture\nIt used to be that you could deduct interest on mortgages up to a million dollars the new law allows you to to deduct interest on up to it says generally allows you to so let me just say generally\nOn mortgages up to a million dollars the new law allows you to to deduct interest on up to it says generally allows you to so let me just say generally because you should always check with your tax preparer or make sure that your situation falls into this but generally the new tax law allows you to deduct interest on up to\nSeven hundred fifty thousand dollars of mortgage debt\nTo buy or improve a first or second residents\nBut it eliminates the provision that allowed interest deductions on up to one hundred thousand dollars of home equity debt\nAnd also decide bar or if you're in a high tax states don't forget there's that ten thousand dollar limitation on property tax deductions\nOkay so that's the rule\nThe question of whether you should um now refinance your home I don't know\nI mean mortgage rates have just gone to a seven and a half year highs I you know probably closer to eight soon on as the general long term interest rates are ... eat intermediate term interest rates that ten year treasury has gone up thirty year fixed rate mortgages are about foreign three quarters that's up about a\nFull percentage point from a year ago\nAnd so is it really worth the cost of a re fi just to claim the interest probably not I'm guessing no so what other ways that you might find some relief\nI think that the maybe the most direct way is you might find that your tax situation has improved simply because\nYour tax actual tax rate has gone down\nSo before you start freaking out about the worries about losing a deduction here and there maybe your rates lower maybe you're now in the what I called the wall upping tax bracket uh twenty four percent that's if you're married filing jointly one sixty five to three Fifteen\nIf you're single it's eighty two five to one fifty seven but that's a very big tax bracket that if you fall into that\nOn and rates have generally gone down also maybe you are I I mean again I don't know in terms of\nYou should really check for rental property um but I and maybe there's something you can do with your rental property that would help your tax situation maybe you're going to claim the standard deduction\nBut I I and maybe there's something you can do with your rental property that would help your tax situation maybe you're going to claim the standard deduction now and you wouldn't have been able to itemize anyway I ended up some of that stuff I don't know but there's a lot of\nPieces to this many people have been lamenting the things they've lost in the tax bill but maybe there is something that you gained\nAnyway on and I just\nI'm again there's so many pieces to it a tax question that I I Can't possibly um really comment on you know your specific case but I Would talk to your tax planner there's another tax question [noise] um my husband and I are\nBoth working in every year we basically oh three to seven thousand dollars in taxes\nWe make two hundred and fifty grand a year to reduce our tax burden someone suggested to uh make a\nA before tax four one K. contribution rather than our Ross four one K. contribution what are your thoughts okay so the again we're talking about tax brackets here so here are people who are in the twenty four percent tax bracket\nOne sixty five to three Fifteen so if you think about it that's a pretty low tax highest marginal tax bracket for someone who makes two hundred and fifty grand [noise] so I Would keep doing the Roth\nI think the Roth is better just one more to pay the tax am I missing\nSomething everyone complains about taxes I mean these are what essentially could be who was that guy who interviewed and he said these are the lowest tax rates that you're probably going to pay for the next hundred years like fifty years ago and fifty years ahead like for its is truly amazing\nHere's a question from Kevin\nAbout reach real estate investment trust what a ten percent investment and reach be a fair amount of exposure for portfolio of a million\nDollars and ten percent okay richer okay they're fine I mean\nI'd be careful there um it's not a perfect heads a lot of people use that as an inflation hedge not perfect I don't know if it's an equity read or an income rate so send me a follow up on what kind of re you're considering\nJim and his wife are both fifty nine they've got five hundred thirty grand save for retirement he's got a hundred Seventy thousand dollars in his four oh one K. the rest in IRAs including two hundred and Ninety thousand\nThey've got five hundred thirty grand save for retirement he's got a hundred Seventy thousand dollars in his four oh one K. the rest in IRAs including two hundred and Ninety thousand dollars in a variable annuity which they've been in for over nine years she says it's done OK\nI funded it with a hundred and fifty six thousand dollars so it's almost doubled and nine years\nAs I get closer to retirement I'm looking for a better annuity product I'm sure annuity products have improved since I bought my river source annuity a financial advisors recommending a fixed in the index annuity with lower fees and the current one uh\nIn addition the unity as a death benefit which is attractive to both me and my wife would you recommend to fix the newly product that plan to keep working to sixty seven and then living my four one K.\nOn okay you're ready for this breaking news you don't need another annuity\nYou said that you've got this money is coming from an IRA account why are you going to buy another annuity when the surrender period is up\nBut you can do is just let the money flow back into the annuity into the IRA don't buy another annuity you want to really save yourself some money here's an idea by an excellent I bet you're a mirror prize broker is not going to tell you to do that but I Am\nSo that is I think the best way to really save money and for a lot of people they don't realize it but\nThe money that you're that that ... ... the source of the annuity funds is really important\nIn a way to ... as you determine what to do next so if the source of the fund is a retirement account\nThat's great news because it means all you have to do is you say okay well my fees are up I'm done with this you simply let the annuity company no the insurance company no okay I'm not going to renew it I'm not doing anything all the money will slow directly into the IRA account and from that point\nYou can do anything you want and hopefully what you do is you just buy some index funds\nAnd if your broker suggests that you buy another annuity I Would say go find somebody who is a fiduciary go find somebody who is a she only planner go find somebody who's going to put your best interests first I don't see why you need an annuity\nSo do Sherry go find somebody who is a the only planner go find somebody who's going to put your best interests first I don't see why you need an annuity I think you're going to be far better off just basically letting the money go back into that account\nSo funny when people say like the money ... I promise you want they had the money been an index funds during the exact same time horizon you would have done better simply because of the ...\nOkay you are listening to chill out money live from

plan to retire at age sixty five I Am a member of a union a big one and together we're building a pension for me I Love that that is true\n[noise] anyway upon leaving my current employer I planned to roll my pension into my existing roll over IRA\nA friend of mine encouraged me to investigate the tax implications specifically my employer will be contributing a substantial portion to the patch and\nWhat made more money by leaving the money in the pension or by rolling over into the IRA when I take a distribution I must pay regular income tax would my distribution from the pension be taxed at a lower rate what about the growth I might or in in the stock market would that grows out pace the tax liability\nI listen to your show and don't use the c._e._o. radio and Minneapolis and I think you're wonderful\nAnd I tell you something I Love WC CEO\nTo great station and um love the people there and thanks\nRadio and Minneapolis and I think you're wonderful and I tell you something I Love WC see a great station and um love the people there and thank you so much for writing so Steven let's think about a couple of things first of all if you're a member of a big union\nMy inclination to you is is to uh for you I should say not to you my inclination for you is to keep that pension where it is because a pension isn't guaranteed to promise now it is true that there had been times where pensions\nBreak their promises but it's quite rare and if you're with a large employer may be a state employer or maybe a big company um it tends to be that that pension guarantee is a better deal than managing your own money in the roll over and the reason is this\nYou are managing your money yourself in that role over the pension is professionally manage and generally speaking it will give you a target returned that they're on the hook for\nSo I like a guarantee I think it guarantees a darn good thing\nIf you were to roll over the money into your IRA then what would happen as you would do a direct role over so they would take the cash balance of the tension and would roll into your IRA there's no tax of it and then the money just comes out\nAnd as the money comes out of this tax at your current tax rate at that time same for your pension if you left it there as the money comes out\nThere is that that money is taxed because the money that you put into a pension and the money that your employer put into the pension has not yet been tax so I don't think there's a tax issue I think it's a risk issue and I would much rather that the company be on the hook for the risk then you beyond hook for the risk\nOkay so that is my advice for you Steve and good luck\nAnd uh oh I Do notice by the way as I talk to you it was just recently the Minnesota state fair\nAnd I know that because uh John Heinz was anchoring there and told me that he eats a uh he did eat a foot long hotdog every single day during the state fair\nDuring the state fair have got to go there I Want to go to

you the big thumbs down on that\n[noise] ah okay\nEvery so often I Love reading these weirdo books uh where you have an author who is pretty much like a hard charging financial dude or do debt\nAnd they\nTake a step off of that corporate treadmill\nThis guy his name is Ben fatter our guest he\nIs a business executive he's an investor and he um now is back at work he's a senior executive at ten said that's the Chinese global conglomerate it owns we chat and\nJust it's a huge company he was also the c._e._o. of cake to interactive that's the publisher of grand theft auto the thing is he's doing this whole investment gigs that take two things are going well\nAnd then all of a sudden\nHe has like a moment and it's not a moment we're like oh I had a heart attack and I hadn't awakening but he did have a bit of an awakening in terms of what he really thought\nHe wanted to do at this point in his life and he and his wife made pretty wild decision of course most of us don't have the opportunity to make these kinds of decisions right we can't just be like you know what I don't know just bail on my life and\nUh I'm gonna go to Bali and I'm going to figure out what I Need to do to make my life a little bit more serene it'd be a little more centered with myself and be a better person\nThat said the stories kind of cool so I present to you a pretty cool and interesting story one that probably most of us will be able to do ourselves but maybe take some little pieces of it for yourself\nHere is our interview with Ben fatter author of take off your shoes one man's journey from the board room to Bali and back tell us a little bit about where you found yourself and you thought this was going to be sort of a short term I'm going to fix this thing and get out to talk about that a little bit\nUm so we found a company in ... when I saw the company that was a really troubled she investigation of your list additions been for him to be thrown off of ... you know any number of things that are going wrong with the company with ... children reading where we were pushed\nOld SEC investigation FTC investigations being threatened to being thrown off of NASDAQ and you know any number of things that have gone wrong with the company\nWe found ourselves on this um shareholder meeting where we replaced the board replaced the management and I went in essentially it's kind of an interim CEO for six months into these things go you know some six months of war came to me and said I said you do a great job want you to stay until six months turned into but for years\nI Love the job very exciting the people there a terrifically talented um uh the products they produce are incredible including grand theft auto and a Red Dead redemption but at the end of ... you know I I was circling the globe you know multiple times a year\nAnd I realized one day I walked in to my apartment and my oldest son who was in eighth grade at the time\nWas barricaded inside his room I'm doing his homework and he was a very serious students and it's just like sequestered they're on his own and I just crack the door open I said hey Sam and he just wanted something at me and not dinner he kind of you know granted some more [laughter]\nIf you got a financial question we love to hear from you ask Jill Jill and money dot com and right now we're going back to our interview with Ben fatter who um figured out a lot about himself when he took his family\nTo Bali for an extended period of time to kind of figure out what it is that he wanted to find in himself and for his family the important stuff\nSo I'm In this segment we find out what it was like to land in ballet for Ben fatter and his family so what was it like when you first got there what did you find in chanting about ballet\nYou know one of the for much little transformations was ever a gym or spiritual over there and somebody said to me something I didn't quite believe what I'm beginning to believe that there are certain places on earth that are just virtual mhm\nI'm ... one of them ... or over the last intact remaining indigenous cultures that are really polluted by a western culture it's a little small island in Indonesia individual the world's largest Muslim country puzzles whole island is an island of ... and it's it's a little brothers indoors\nA really polluted by a western culture it's a little small island in ... in Indonesia and in each of the world's largest Muslim country puzzles hall island is an island of ... and it's it's a little brand of and that was on and it's very kind of\nSpray prime or it's very old I'm an ancient and um and yet they're inviting westerners to participate so I found truly fascinating and spiritual and did you grow up with religion in your life I did I grew up as an Orthodox Jew wow so where are you the kind of or is it out if you just become a Jew but welcoming Buddhist\nAgainst getting kind of a Jewish guy that's like yeah I get this child actually in a different flavor of that is so you you know it's more it's more a state of mind than anything else right\nWhen you go there how do you how do you tap into that spirituality like what happened I Know you talked about yoga which you basically can described as like a girl a thing [noise] well [laughter] I leads\nTo lift weights I used to you know as cardio is kind of like I was doing what any hard charging that can you imagine what do you write look when I went there I tend to set my wife's like what am I going to do over there I'm so used to all the stimulation coming at me from all directions\nAnd I had no idea what was going to her and she goes you know you'll be bored it'll be okay you'll just be bored\nI wasn't born at all I was curious about meditation I'd read a book about meditation I thought that was fascinating I read another book about brain plasticity and how we can change who we are by changing our thoughts I started getting into meditation into yoga and into sorts of things that are just really about\nBeing centered and grounded and um you know spirit spirituality is kind of a big word and I don't think it has nothing to do with religion honestly in moral down I just think spirituality as love love for yourself for others love for compassion for um\nPeople animals or whatever but I'm not at all interested in what are called like the ... the the church or Buddhism I'm interested in the philosophy of ...\nHow did your on kids adapt I mean because you and it was a finite period of time so you went in and said this is going to be a six month thing we're going to have our kids in school it sounds like you found it very cool school that was really interesting so you had this eighth grade grunting boy what was his reaction upon learning about this game plan\n[laughter] so we we don't like is one of the time and we took a Sam out to lunch at a local diner and uh you know kind of dropped them slowly but eventually kind of like you know he was listening and then he's like what what what did you say\nAnd what kind of repeated it and then just sort of fell silent and he didn't speak again for two days on my God I just sort of I Need to leave and just walked out and he just kind of he didn't speak\nAnd then just sort of fell silent and he didn't speak again for two days now my God and just sort of I Need to leave and just walked out and he just kind of he didn't speak and then eventually victorious at them like I spoke to a guidance counselor\nThis is not going to hurt your chances at all for getting into college I 'cause that's the only thing he thinking about all you can about I think he bit mentally came to realize like way there's no downside to this and I get away and I get a little vacation and I know at my college essays
