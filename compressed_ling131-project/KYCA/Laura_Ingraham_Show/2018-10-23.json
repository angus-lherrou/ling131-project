resonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters so we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think what's been hugely resident and you know the people to pay to\nTo have a politician and especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up on their

know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's a ... staff was caught thing over

and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but it is it's covered a lot in certainly certainly and socks and other networks is that on people's minds of president says mom's not jobs ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down in government to work for them\nYou know I think that ... you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offer gets chaos\nAt home and we must abroad and this this mall behavior it it is chaos than it is ...\nYeah you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offer gets chaos\nAt home and weakness abroad and this this

shouting obscenities I mean this is not the United states of America and this is not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech and her last intimidate and even use violence against people I mean I have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it and Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going to ride along with it I mean she is happy to see the mob tactics employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm concerned I think a lot of I'm a conservative religious voters\nHave is the social\nTransformation of the country and the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and ah that you know that we should really celebrate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious right to many saying that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\n[laughter] you know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first

minded people\nA day or you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the important value of safe and we believe in the importance of value family and community and those things built around faith in churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think to have the again the left wing agenda\nWhich has become so hostile\nTo people of faith so hostile to religious liberties just like a hostile through our Second Amendment rights just like it's become hospital the free speech I mean think about it what what the the left wing agenda really offers to uh you know you agree with us or you shut up\nAre stuck in a minute right just like to come off all the free speech I mean think about it what what the the left wing within that really ... versus\nYou know you agree with us or you shut up and that is just not what the people by state law but the people in this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you I've met many reasons obviously substantive reasons menu of the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous\nArticles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts in in a and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut it's this is the best they can do with you that well we had a lot of us just

Web beside already aggregators like Yahoo News or anywhere else in the theme of the day Trump spreads\nIs that early voting\nAlmost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is there for Democrats are growing up in the early Italy and\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bat on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they get Mrs NBC News\nSo the question here and it and the hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to conventional wisdom conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts\nThat the Democrats have been so

Washington what do you ever think what happened these people come up with their story they stick with it if it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads that everybody hates Trump\nAnd that hatred for Trump has brought in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energize and they get that in their hands and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens and they don't know what to do about it and they get non plus and a little concerned about which is where\nThey are now and I've shared with you yesterday there's a there's a a a lot of stories [noise]\nUh about the blue wave not happening that it simply doesn't look like it is materialize here in the Washington Post battleground house district remained close in a new poll\nOver here we got the cook report eight more seats flip Democrats how many seats left to flip that we're going to listen to cook report every state's gone Democrat by now\nAnd if you listen to the native silver eighty five eighty six percent chance the Republicans lose the house eighty six percent chance and Democrats wonder how does all this fit together\nWell it doesn't obviously\nYou have Republican early voting is out distancing Democrat early voting and Democrats have always owned that\n\nMust mean that something is drastically wrong here something is terribly wrong in the formula for this\nKind of Republican enthusiasm in an off year mid term election where so many people quote unquote hate Trump\nThis doesn't compute there ought not be there\nTerm election where so many people quote unquote hate Trump\nThis doesn't compute\nThere ought not be this much Republican
