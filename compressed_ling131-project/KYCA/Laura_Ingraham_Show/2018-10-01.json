{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KYCA", "content": "In the case of Canada the prime minister\nAre satisfied with the deal\nIt's good for Canada good from extra it's good for all three\nThis deal I'm not doubt it this is good for all three that's good and just that fact makes it good for us but this is good for all three but this is a much different deal the NAFTA and this is much more of a reciprocal deal for the United states which is really good yeah go ahead Peter [noise]\nKnow a lot of why don't you just I Will do the capital questions I mean\nYou talk about being treated\nHarshly will do that in a couple of let's finish up try 'cause you have a lot of people that want to run over to the wall Street Journal and start writing\nGo ahead please\nI'm Mexican journalist go ahead I'm sure it's so you're going to keep the ... steel another medium to Mexico and Canada until\nSuch time as we can do something that would be a different quotas perhaps so that our industry is protected we are not going to allow our steel industry to disappear it was almost gone I'll tell you what\nIf our country kept going the way it was going within two years you wouldn't have had a steel industry we have to have a steel industry we have to have it aluminum you know there are certain industries important so\nWe are working on that now that wasn't part of this but we will do something and in fact Bob if you want you may want to say a couple of words about that because we're literally talking about that one hour ago\nAs great thank you Mr President I guess I Would say first of all they're two separate things as far as we're concerned we know that there are great interest in both countries we are engaged in talks now an effort to try to preserve the the effect of our program and she'll take care of their needs and and the hopefully we'll be able to work that out but we are in communication with the ... and\nReally take care of the needs of our steel companies\nDon't want to plant closing\nTheir hiring thousands of workers all over the country I'm not giving that up\nBut to get as soon as as a president elect look ... ... we\nHave a we have a very good understanding of really good\nI Am Mr President just hoping you can just reiterate on the terrorists what specifically would it take for Canada or Mexico to be exempt from these tariffs and secondly did you consider\nDairy the deal breaker came to the area was a deal breaker and now for farmers it's as you know some states\nFrom these terrorists and secondly did you consider\nDairy the deal breaker yeah she came to the area was a deal breaker and now for farmers it's as you know substantially opened up much more\nI Know they can't open it completely that farmers also you know they can't be overrun and I fully on and I tell them that I say look I understand you have limits but they could do much better and we've opened it up to our farmers so the\nFolks up in Wisconsin I I'll tell you what I went to Wisconsin and I went to Iowa Joni knows better than anybody right and Scott Walker who I think is a fantastic governor talks about it all the time\nOur farmers were not treated properly by Canada and now they're going to be treated with respect\nThat they're going to be treated fairly\nPoor as I say in that reciprocal way can very important yes there go ahead [noise]\nLike since president\nIt seems there was some give and take on both sides for this deal I Wonder what's in your view would be your biggest concession to Canada and why you decided to make that concession number two if you could die in a bit more to the\nTo your thoughts on Justin Trudeau you're talking about tensions I Wonder what\nYou throughout this process what you've\nLearned about him and what the state of the relationship is with him today and going forward [noise]\nWell I think my biggest concession would be making the deal\nAre the one that people come and want to take from [noise] am talking about\nThat gives us a tremendous advantage in negotiating that we never used before with past administrations but we never use it\nEvery day and we have is a loser\nEvery day you could look at almost every country in the world almost every country we have trade deficits we lose with everybody\nSo I think my biggest concession was making the deal\nBecause we could have done it a different way but it would have been nasty I wouldn't have been nice and I don't want to have that we have a great relationship with Canada I think now it will be better than ever a call the only problem with Justin is he loves his people and he's you know fighting hard for his people\nYou know we've always had actually a very good relationship to get a little got a little bit testy and the last couple of months\nBut that was over this agreement and I understand that but no I think I think are just in a good person who's doing a good job he he felt very committed to his people and that's what he did\nAnd I understand that but no I think I think adjusted it's a good person who's doing a good job he he felt very committed to his people and that's what he did\nAnd again this is a this is good for everybody to go to Canada good from Mexico also\nYes yes please\nThank you Mr President as you mentioned you're going to be signing this agreement and your counterparts going to be signing a cigarette right from the next to sixty days\nThen it's up to Congress right you're very confident I get that you're putting out at all confident [laughter] I'm not well I don't know why you think that you tell me if you guys get a shot at tell me I think I think they are says controlled by Democrats could happen couldn't go out and do they want to throw out specs yeah they might\nBe willing to throw out of the great deals for people\nAnd the workers they may be willing to do that for a political present for you know people are political purposes because frankly uh you know they'll have twenty twenty in mind so far I Dream about twenty twenty when I look at what's going on they have twenty twenty in mind they want to\nThey want to do as well as they can and so trying to reject even great deals like this is a great deal for our country great for other countries\nBut it's a great deal for our country and great for a worker I can tell you whether or not they will obstruct\nWhether or not they will resist I mean the whole campaign is resist I see the signs all resist they didn't even know what they're resisting if you ask them what are you resist that well let me think about that they can ask they had somebody on this weekend they should what are you resisting\nAnd they were unable to answer the question\nSo you know I I Can't tell you about\nDelay obstruct resist because you know right after this election and I think we're going to do well although history is not on our side I guess in history a generally whoever has the White House doesn't do well in midterms but one difference as we have the greatest economy in the history of our country I think that's a big difference [noise]\nAnd that's one of our problems too because people that went out and voted for me and they wouldn't be voting for me if I was on the ticket but I'm not on the ticket but Congress has on the ticket and I try and tell my people\nThat's the same thing as me\nIn a sense that's the same thing I think of it is the same thing as me\nI think we're going to do ah\nI actually think I mean we have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago when I started looking at it closely I won't mention names but there were senators that we're not imply that we're not even and you know exactly what I'm Talking about numerous of them they were not in play\nI won't mention names but there were senators that we're not in play they were not even in you know exactly what I'm Talking about numerous of them they were not in play\nIn other words let's not go here let's not go to this day four or five states\nNow it's still there like even races in one case they're up\nTwo points now who knows what that and you know as you know there are a lot of ... repression poles or polls there aren't very accurate because I see polls that I Know are false having to do with certain of the races\nWe had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise]\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states at the end up winning and the grand I'd like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why\nFake news okay\n... yeah that's right behind you believe that the trade agreement will be a major issue in the mid term elections\nAnd they look it's a good agreement these people you know when I first did it they said oh why don't you just extend after they have no idea about business just extend NAFTA [noise] that would have been a disaster we're losing\nA hundred billion dollars\nIn deficits at least at least to Mexico under NAFTA but just look at the results and and a substantial amount accounted although a lot of people try and say it's pretty much even it's not even we lose a substantial amount [noise] so you know I think it's a very hard thing to defend but that's all right look I understand the world the politics I think as well as anybody\nI haven't been doing it that long\nBut I actually have been ... I've been doing it on the other side [noise] and I do understand and\nYou know they can take the greatest thing ever done\nAnd try and make it sound as bad as possible but this one stuff this one people are coming out for this one and saying\nSets incredible what we've been able to do yes behind you please\nMr President now that you've answered several questions on trade I'd like to tell you don't do do you have new she gives me do have a question of trade well you know one or two more questions when several questions I don't know that that's not identify somebody just\nBefore you excuse me don't do that do have a question on trade\nEntered several quite you have a question on trade my question is on jacket she has you know the FBI should interview whoever they believe is appropriate does that include Julie threatening the third accuser and can you promised to release the full\nQuestion is on jacket and she has an FBI should interview whoever they believe is appropriate does that include Julie threatening the third accuser and can you promised to release the full of your question I asked her they finished their appointments or president gave me a question plus [noise]\nThank you very much with border security are funding wild this costs during the negotiation and who will pay for the all the while\nLook people thought ten years ago that Brett Kavanaugh was going to be a Supreme Court justice because of his intellect\nBecause of his career because of the fact that there are no games you know now they talk about alcohol they talk about all of the things that you hear and frankly\nYou take a look at that they're bringing up subject we wouldn't know about this over the last Twenty years Thirty years of his career you know what happened to go back to high school\nAnd they're saying she drank a lot on the evening and high school\nWe you know I tell you what I happen to know some United States senators\nOne who is on the other side\nWho's pretty aggressive\nI've seen that person in very bad situation\nI've seen that person in very very bad\nSituation somewhat compromising and you know uh\nI think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however\nWhatever the senators want is okay with me they're going to be making a decision what ever they want is okay with me go ahead\nTo ... to do was\nSaying that the wrath of dealing with what I\nI I think depresses treated me unbelievably unfairly\nIn fact when I Won I spent a good thing is now the press finally get sit\nNow they'll finally treat me fairly\nThey got worse and worse now than ever\nTheir logo but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\nTheir logo but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico [noise] no no please shut down\nThinking though had that for going back to ... I got to be next year and I didn't know I thought you're going to go ahead\nI have two questions about judge Kavanaugh first there are now concerned that he may have lighter myth characterized his drinking while testifying if they find that he did do you think that bars him from being here Supreme Court nominee\nWhile I watch I watched him I was surprised at how\nA vocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nA little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this is not a man that said that alcohol was absolute that he was perfect with respect to alcohol do I thought he was actually\nGoing back so many years I thought he was a excellent the interesting thing is though nobody asked them about what's happened in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career\nBecause I there were no bad reports I mean there are bad reports\nOn everybody in here\nMost of the people sitting down there\nBut except for my parents were either [laughter]\nWe find one on him that um I think that's going to be that'll be the greatest shock of also\nThere are bad report showing everybody I'm looking at people I'm sort of\nLook at some of these people asking the questions fucking [noise] look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no for Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang province we call them\n... Richard downing that's just stick them done that he never went to Vietnam\nAnd he's up this er and we need honesty and we need integrity this guy lied when he was the attorney general's Connecticut He lied I don't mean a little bit and then when he got out he actually dropped out of the race or do you want anyway because Democrats are always win in Connecticut [noise]\nThe one very close probably the closest ever [noise] but he is a guy lied and now he's up there talking like he's holier than thou you know what to take a look at his record and want to get out and we apologize she was crying tears were all over the place and now we acts like how do you\nThe judge who has led an exemplary life\nI mean you go back to high school because he had beer I\nThe judge who has led an exemplary life\nI mean you're going back to high school because he had beer I think the judge has been a\nPretty amazing about describing his situation with alcohol and with me or\nTake a look at Cory Booker\nHe ran Newark New Jersey into the ground\nHe was a horrible in there and he made statements that when he was in high school or college one he was doing he actually made the statement and now he's talking about\nJudge Kavanaugh and I could go through a whole list of a gay looking Dianne Feinstein you're telling me about time\nDianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier\nIf she wanted a a really thorough investigation where all the time in the world she didn't have to wait until after the hearing was closed essentially\nShe should have said listen\nThis report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings we had two months\nNo she didn't do that she waited until we were closed\nAnd then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say but you probably leaked it based on a very bad body language you know the day but more importantly under sense for her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats\nAnd I guess I'm including you do the media right I consider you what part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be\nTalking about we want more time for the FBI if he wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up now you know is that you showed this the other Democrat she's not the only one she showed this other Democrats there were more than just her that knew about this\nBig confidential things confidential until the hearing was over after the hearing was over\nThey went public why didn't they do it during the hearing and we could have had all the time in the world you know why because they're dishonest people okay uh yeah\n... yeah my question Mr President says he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull him\nAnd I look here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker\nI can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't trust [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something good as I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't trust [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason [noise] can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be there would be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing\nAnd I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man who is drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him in many many years they go back to high school\nYou know I graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and then go crazy and you know there were in high school there was sixteen Seventeen years old and I saw a lot of it [noise]\nThey can't do something that they want to do with their life so [noise] it's a very tough thing I I really believe that he was very strong and the fact that he\nDrank a lot and so I don't know where there'd be big discrepancy okay yes go ahead please can you probably you know what you really ... and ... you've had enough go ahead please\nThank president I'm just not that he was being targeted by Democrats happy made the process overly political\nHow can you show the American people that she'll be able to deliver impartial decision\nYou'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly\nHe's a man with a family I think he's been treated horribly\nLindsey Graham was I thought to respect the other day and he brought up one point that\nIs now being discussed by a lot of people\nAnd that's who is going to want to run for office being office take an appointment or not just Supreme Court [noise]\nBut you know many many positions I have right now three hundred and sixty people\nThat aren't being approved they're very qualified nobody says they're not qualified but Senator Schumer is not approving them because of resist and obstruct\nIt's much longer than ever in the history of our country like I think Doug all the time almost\nIt's far more people that anybody in the history of our country most of those people are routine approvals these are people that gave up jobs they gave up their life to come and serve our country and Schumer and his group won't approve them\nThis slow walking down\nEverything is going to thirty hours meaning they take 'em out thirty hours person that's going to be approved it's a disgrace [laughter] so\nThis slow walking down\nEverything is going to thirty hours meaning they take 'em out thirty hours person that's going to be approved it's a disgrace so when the judge brings up\nWhether it's politics or not I don't know you'd have to ask him but I can say this he's been treated really really horribly but or you can go ahead and cleaner\nI'm not concerned you know you know you know what I'm concerned that we get great great people on the U.S Supreme Court that's what I'm concerned that I Want to have great people and I don't want to have to call people\nFor any court and have them say sure it's such a great honor but\nNo thank you I just can't do\nI just can't do it said to be a sad day for our country and we're gonna come close to that\nBecause I Know people now that say I don't know how he does it I don't know why he would have taken a nobody knew a thing like this could have happened [noise] but when when\nJustice now justice Gorsuch got approved it was rough but it was nothing like that what they're doing to this man and what they're coming up with and in many cases fabricating because as you know many stores were pulled back in certain stories ripple back that were horrible\nI'm fine thanks how are you I'm very well um so your your take on\nThis reopening of the FBI investigation background check into Kavanaugh there are some Republicans who say well this is a good thing because it\nAh gives cover to people like flake can Collins or to actually vote for cabin on in the end\nYou know this has been about I'm delighted from the get go and um\nI think what's most eloquent here is the treatment that this got from from ... said well this person asked for confidentiality [noise] um [laughter] this could have been investigated by the FBI authoring all requests for confidentiality from the outset of\nShe said well this person asked for confidentiality um this could have been investigated by the FBI honoring all requests for confidentiality from the outset if that's what they wanted and um I think everything has to be judged in light of that\nWanted it to me it seemed very obvious from the very\nBeginning when they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and studying the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the air and screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the left believes the Supreme Court just another\nSuper legislature and it's not really a court it's more of a social policy making body to the left in for them it's all abortion and and various social issues and cabinet even though he's a Bush guy or doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\nWell um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who gets appointed came to be so important that it was one judge just started I'm putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement to the constitution that happened a long time ago when when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's\nFrom put numbers surrounding the other amendments I'm quite clear that some people on the court foot that were that they could make it up if they want a long and so then I guess it very much batters who whose head is popping out from beneath the black crepe\nWill judge there was a a woman or I'd never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who identifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but\nThen so be it neither now so she she\nShe know express something\nThat I began ... you're you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race\nOf Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nIs a white male privilege ravens here which is I'm entitled to this I Do the hard\nWork and school and college and I deserve this I Want to hear that is not the case no one is entitled to go on the Supreme Court and no one who is behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and\nYeah that is not the case no one is entitled to go on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college at his alleged to do and no one who performed at the way who did it on Thursday deserves to be given an judge\nYour reaction to that judge um\nIt's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race I'm like I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one\nAppears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservatives supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYear high school\nI don't know why why high school and I go back to sixth grade wise just high school the limit here but it it ate all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know useful\nIndiscretions pass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive in responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't have the temperament\nBut that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know if he loses either way\nWell how do you\nThen he doesn't have the temperament of he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know if he loses either way\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right or the president said the FBI can has free rein that's a phrase he gave free rein a\nWell a free rein to do presumably what the Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check\nAnd background checks are are not about you know are not about ... I'm not criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence with their background investigations and they interview witnesses lay out what they say and present it to the Senate which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president [noise]\nYou know the um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on all\nOf this so that you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation as\nWell again if if high school and college drinking is now\nIs now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now\nYeah what we're going to be judged on I I don't know who want want these you know these nominations I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly he didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just to\nHave it for fan right yeah no nothing nothing stupid things\nBut it all your your your um UK is what the rest of us did no\nUm [noise] if there's anybody who would be willing to have every day of of his youth um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weigh in on this um the American bar association a supposedly it was it was of course it was improperly reported early\nOn uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that\nIs it was improperly reported early on uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you\nKnow highly qualified to be on the court and turns out it was it\nThe president of the of the APA picked up a pen and his letterhead a and wrote something he wasn't authorized to write um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years [noise]\nYeah and he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton\nUh and so you know the again initial reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline writers and written reporters don't do their work oh this is ... that's really bad\nAnd now of course we find out that that's all all not true a judge thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate your insights and and we'll check back with you soon you're listening to the lord and grim show eight five five forty Laura Jeff Flake a lot of you from Arizona calling in China being in a ear reaction to what he did on friday and his appearance at\nThe global citizen festival with a with his friends senator Coons\nAnd also on on his appearance on sixty minutes on Sunday he's enjoying his little waning power so that when someone has power over you they think they have power over you they enjoy that\nThat there are certain people that like exercising power over others and they take advantage of it I think this is his last gassed and he's enjoying every minute don't go\nTo the chances that we are going to be exactly the same place a week from now\nThat was a child and we knew that and some of our colleagues said that to where we back here one week from now it'll be worse\n...

Republican um\nAnd Andrew anger about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half of all confirmed to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArgument like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenience on whether or not having to get through I think the whole situation that's really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again and somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi TV was on the BBC it was on Russian television I think even a North Korea does\nThe little pot belly dictator mentioned it in his Saturday Night and message to the people it was everywhere what a Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are gonna take it into shorts everybody in the media covers it\n[noise] and I again I made that production at a at a time where it looked like they were getting ready to bail on the entire\n\nNomination and when that didn't happen when the Democrats won a couple of steps too far and caused the Republicans do engage in this than I revise their production so I'm gonna take a brief time out here uh [noise] I've gotten to Trump's\nNot too far and caused the Republicans do engage them in this than I revise their production\nSo I'm gonna take a brief time out here um [noise] I've got the Trump soundbites from the press conference in the rose garden following is announcing the NAFTA deal when the drive by started aquarium him about capital you've got to hear a baby so we'll do that in the right after that we'll get back\nTo the parents were Rush Limbaugh dot com out for your iPhone\nYour eye pad or your Android device just makes accessing this program and fall of bits contempt as easy as it's ever been to get all this and more with the Russia bad rash twenty four seven syllable up your apple store Google plays for Rush Limbaugh dot com you are listening to be more\nWhat is it costing you in vet bills for that convenience of just pulling open a bag of\nFormulated extra rooted trash a serial fish that cost a\nTon of money anyway how do you feed your dog to derive not only energy but a good coach bright\nEyes and great addicts you come to nine of pro\nGay I N o v I ...

dollars worth of repairs my vehicle was still overheating a friend told me to take it to autumn max within three minutes Dan had it fixed\nThe radiator cap wasn't holding the pressure I told him he was a miracle worker he said no I'm just honest I'll never go anywhere else ever I Am sold on auto\nMax take it to the max I don't act to Twenty one west we'll asked\nThem to grow it would be the\nRodeo stores to go before a judge to move to a national model started just too much by what good would offer ... ... bottles or do we proceed to get to the events of the box office rebuttal to get more depressed you\nThe best of course plant is on Saturday nights at ten pm you're on the news if I'm One of three point five and fourteen Ninety am\nWelcome back my friends are Rush Limbaugh and\nThe execution of a sign of a Sunni flawlessly with zero mistakes\nAnd I'm going to make him executive programming format change rather than get to the Trump somebody's not 'cause I Can't squeeze 'em all in here we're going to get back to the phones now people have been waiting patiently for a long time anyway so we'll go back to Washington DC we'll glad you called sort of what's happening\nI grew up here\nUm I work at your thoughts on on the ethical issues of the Gulf ought to be paid if you recall during the uh doctor court testimony the prosecutor asked her how to pay for her legal fees in her security on as you mentioned her ... and those ... million dollars\nAnd perhaps from kind of ethical issue what you can just accuse somebody regarding to cooperate evidence and then go public with that and raise you know that that amount of money as it is very\nFor some kind of ethical issue if you could just accuse somebody without any kind of corporate evidence and then go public with that and phrase you know that that amount of money as it is a very very troubling thought if there's a lot of weird and fences there for people to make off accusations if they could raise\nA lot of money or your your crowd crowdsourcing\nAnd look this is a toughie um in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are a range of lunatics who want her to be right\nTo hope she's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell his true they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw cabin on they're happy to pay for it this is how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than happy to pay it doesn't matter to them as she can afford her lawyers herself\nIt doesn't matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case\nSo she's identified a market there are people that want to support her win money so she starts in the Gulf on me page I actually think\nSomebody sent me a note today that uh go fund me they'll find me is not new money laundering is essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were a because there's a lot of this money going to go\nA lot of this money is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to be where they're already involved and Democrat Party politics so it's just it's it's a new form of fund raising this not call fundraising miss is made to look like people supporting\nHave been drag older and falsely accused a stressful\nReally in bad shape woman who can\nBarely barely get through the hearing have terrified they're happy to help and\nI you know this or that she's not the only one using it for ... there's a lot of Republicans Oregon that a lot of people who are using go fund me pages to raise money for their legal bills\nAnd other expenses and if you can convince the American people to support you well I mean there's there's a I\nDon't think there's anything and mediate that can be done to stop it and I don't think that you can draw any conclusions\nAbout her from it um in terms of whether\nThink immediate that could be done to stop it and I don't think that you can join the conclusions\nAbout her from it um\nIn terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw a conclusion that the goal fund me pages I'm\nI'm a way to get Democrats soccer's I eat voters to pay for this other doesn't cost people already have a lot of money anything then you could try to make that point\nThat the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you jumping Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left as always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work there's no reason to stop and say no fully as ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that maybe it maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them maybe let's say for a year\nThat's become them let's let's show them that anything\nDestructive they can do to other human beings it cannot\nWait a minute you know one thing I reject this whole are but I don't disagree with you I reject this argument we don't want to become the ... we have to become a Hitler to be Hitler\nDid we have to become the emperor to beat the gym now we can be used in the can be these people it's adjusted decent people are not conditioned and primed for it every day\nFollowed by agreement with Jeff flakes\nDemand that the FBI be allowed to do one way to get their fight and all of fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're gonna\nSenator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it in multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated it and we've shared it with your way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the way did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said\nNone of them got mad at it not a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care of the only thing got a rise out of them was when Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys and we know they said they didn't Lincoln Mr journal we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they didn't oh what\nAbout an investigation huh well Tom Cotton and says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be follow through but I'm from one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired of it because all they are for birds away\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible enters denial\nHow why is that so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility an attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nThey don't vote out capital that committee and he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not gonna\nIf the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out capital of that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held a pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again\nThen the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom and the schemes up Republican voters are going to get some kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and I hate seeing what's happening in the capital and they don't want to imagine that happening there on can they are going to show up and groves or I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\nHere from Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting\nIf Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day\nWhere Kavanaugh he has not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens take that moment right cabinet is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed it in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin all wearing the majority that we couldn't get confirmed but you need to come out in my ... how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen\nKavanaugh was not sworn in everybody thinks that what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks and Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there were guaranteed to get their votes weren't gonna there's gonna be a Republican away because of what happened to Canada and then a Republican start campaigning\nAnd they start\nWe're guaranteed to get their votes you're going to there's going to be a Republican away of cars or whatever to Canada and then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe majority\nWe know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here to stay in the midst of all of us Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some kicked off and his soul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump Trump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to\nTurn a cabin on defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do it\nVote for us Kavanaugh was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout when you have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call in here and sort of rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see how skunks they really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with capital so Kammen on doesn't make it this is going to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me you don't want to be the other way around\n\nThis is another trick I think that gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up you have a cap on hockey doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nRush voters are going to be\nYeah is is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it well rush voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what\nThe guy got railroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and when we're supposed to say well okay\nMan we're really loaded now that's going to cause that turn up\nTo ... I'm Sorry folks that I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's going to happen is\nThat voters are going to be out there saying even when we voted Republican Democrat still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected re it's got to be the other way you got\nTo win this we have got to be the Democrats not look to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analysts and they all well not all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get to the base all fired up we want to let them destroy\nA great life great patriot and great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win them in terms how does that work\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder\nWhereas it when they win that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team\n\nWhy do we have to keep losing to fire up our base you talk about a trap\nShe asked me in the media is behind that the Democrats a Washington establishment I got to take a break be back after\nThis is like please we need more than ever rush leaky I\nVeterans active duty military military spouses if you are in search of new home financing I Want to tell you about American finance sings\nV a home loan it offers you exclusive access to some of the industry's most competitive mortgage rates and there's no downpayment required no monthly mortgage insurance\nThe a home loan it offers you exclusive access to some of the industry's most competitive mortgage rates and there's no downpayment required no monthly mortgage insurance if you already are a homeowner whether it be a home loan and refinance", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott", "day": "01"}
