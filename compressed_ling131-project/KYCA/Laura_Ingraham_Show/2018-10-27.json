[laughter] I don't know if you look for this child\nI don't remember but I Do remember when she said it's just a little and she said you know I can tell she's ... [laughter]\nI don't know you look for this child not from my thing but I think one of those doctors let's try this medicine I'm not sure that medicine you know and it scares me I'd rather not be on anything but I Know it was just a little\nWell now you're probably a little high see if the cholesterol was\nThis year I live right\nOkay so now ... here between you and me and the fence posts and hopefully she's not listening and if she has them there you go but if if you're if you start to feel like a guinea pig if your cholesterol is your total cholesterol is a little high\nHalf of people that have a heart attack don't have high cholesterol those guard or is that it's going to be just kind of a a farce one oh one to even assume that cholesterol lowering medications\nAre doing anything to reduce heart attack risks\nBecause cholesterol elevation is because of stress toxicity inflammation oxidation and sugar consumption it's not because you're deficient in the lip of tour\nSo when you have a elevation of cholesterol it's the bodies attempt by shivering on a cold day to change what's going on it's a normal reaction cholesterol in\nEvery cell in the body except for the red blood cells\nSo if you're not looking at why your cholesterol is up\nThen you're just going to be taking the drugs forever and the same with the blood pressure getting Ninety five percent of hypertension\nIs Frank hypertension translation they don't have a clue see what we look at clinically is the person under stress are they reacting to foods are they reacting to something in the air they sensitive to juniper\nYou know we look at why the blood pressure is a boy your looks like it sounds like you're changing the oil in your car they got you got a lot of it now to my door\nOkay you got a lot of noise going on there but anyway the the way to think in terms of cholesterol is total cholesterol is the HDL the happy healthy good ones the LDL lousy ones\nAnd the Wii LDL the very lousy those are the bad boys but seems a bit more relevant saying is not total cholesterol it's the ratio of total to the HDL now you probably don't know that number because you didn't know\nBoys but seems a bit more relevant saying is not total cholesterol it's the ratio of tone will do the HDL now you probably don't know that number because you didn't know\nYour total cholesterol but if the ratio is like four or ... or it actually represents a you don't really have to worry a whole lot now there are multiple other things that should be looked at with cardiovascular risk in the bloodstream\nBut that's kind of the that's a rule of thumb is if you're a ratio let's say your cholesterol is two ten and your age deals or Seventy that's the three to one ratio\nSo to ten maybe is a little high in the eyes of a prescribing physician wants to write a script for Staten but not in my mind so if your cholesterol is up ... has been proven to reduce your cholesterol your blood pressure is up\nThere is a new trend called B F F blood vessel flexibility formula which stimulates nitric oxide production and the body\nAnd therefore expansion of the blood vessels therefore there's a possibility that you could reduce your blood pressure by taking a simple ... very tasty supplement\nThree times a day to in the morning and one in the early afternoon a lotta people react to stress your adrenal get wiped out their blood pressure goes up because they're stressed out so we put 'em on adrenal support to help with that\nSo the natural approach is totally different than putting a fifty year old on blood pressure medication and ... without looking at why both of those are an issue in guy I Need to run to a break I appreciate your call you can cut to chew on that information and you know and I look forward to hearing from you in the future\n[noise] so he qualified for one one zero one sex we will be right back\nYour health related questions [noise]\n\nWhen you smile do you like to weigh your teeth look\nThis was the news fourteen Ninety One oh three point five of them why ca Prescott on gay to serve and ... it's ten o'clock\nThis is a hot news ...

your four one K. fight\nAnd for being a coffee for certain for being with my employer does so for the money so I like the old them or or you know ... I Will be made for her to have what we make it the great\nThat's great does your does your wife put money away for her own retirement to through her yeah and what does she use an IRA or\nTissue individually four or five\nUnique four one K. good for you that's great okay so let's start with a house for a second because what you said was you had a house worth about five hundred grand on three hundred and twenty thousand dollars out standing on a mortgage which is a five year adjustable rate obviously interest rates are rising\nAnd so now you have to make a decision\nAnd that decision is when to actually locking down now you mentioned a Fifteen year mortgage was Fifteen and why aggressively pay it off not to say that you have to hold them\nTo actually lock it down now you mentioned a Fifteen year mortgage why sixteen and why aggressively pay it off not to say that you have to hold the mortgage forever but what's your reasoning you just don't like it\nShould or shouldn't be over before them anymore in for a long lead them reviewed because with the laws from Bert goof troop greeting order for these short or the older so I just wanted to finish\nBeing off the computer before retirement for when you're going to go to remember the last ...\nI think that the problem with that strategy is you've still got a lot of expenses ahead of you mean because you said you've got a middle school kid in high school kid so you've got college ahead of you on how much did you say you had in the five twenty nine plan\nYour ...\nAnd ... is it your intention that the kids are going to go to a public school like hopefully they get into somewhere in the University of Texas system\nProbably say that if we were ... working for\nHere's what I think I don't think you should get a Fifteen year I think as you get a thirty year and here's why don't worry about the interest rate so much right this second I'm Talking about your monthly payment I think a thirty year could give you a lot more flexibility meaning that isn't I mean just in case one of these kids\nGets into a school that's more expensive and you need some of your cash flow\nTo pay for school I think it will be very good idea to give yourself that question that doesn't mean that you have to carry the mortgage now you're forty seven years old you don't have to have it until you're Seventy seven you can aggressively pay it down in the future what it does I think it's a kind of let you off the hook\nIt let you off the hook for\nBasically giving yourself some room and you still can deduct that interest you know you really can so I Would first start with instead of a Fifteen year with an idea to aggressively pay it down I Would say no I think I Want a thirty year and I would take my time just to see what happens with the kids\nIn the meantime okay now we've got another question once we have that got to make sure your cash flow adjust right but the ideally the next big issue that I see on the horizon for you is that you just way aggressive\nYou're really aggressive and lost\nThe next big issue that I see on the horizon for you is that you just way aggressive\nYou're really aggressive and long term you're probably going to be fine however this is a bull market it's been going on for a while there's no reason why you need to take on that kind of risk\nAnd it doesn't hurt for you to be even you send your mostly a hundred percent you went you know wanting to count eighty twenty Seventy thirty would be fine you could take the most risk\nIn her off that's you know basically in general because I always say Ross asset\nAsset that you would actually access and they would take the next\nAmount of risk and a deferred retirement account four one K. or an IRA\nRight and in that account so if you are going to be eighty twenty and her off maybe it'd be Seventy thirty in a account where you basically are not going to hopefully need the money in touch the money until you're in your sixties in Seventy and a half definitely okay now\nYou're not qualified accounts those are the accounts where you should be taking a little bit less risk so if you're adding money to those accounts\nOne player instead of you know I don't know if you of gains are losses in those accounts and whether you're going to do some year in tax planning I wouldn't sell and pay a big tax on that but as you add money to those accounts I Would start to add some bonds\nAnd a funny thing happened while you were a super aggressive bond yields went up and bond prices went down\nAnd so I Would think that this is a fantastic time to think about doing this I loved that your ... your retirement account\nI loved that your wife is putting money in her own retirement account I think it's great that you're putting money away for education fantastic and I just think that the allocation part again which is not it's not the worst thing in the world it's been a great ten year that for you right\nBut it's time to adjust slightly just in case\nWe had a nasty downturn just in case that's all I Would think about and you're in with ... and you also by the way have it sounds like you've gotten very good providers you know basically vanguard in T Rowe price or lost some you've got low cost index\nIt sounds like you've gotten very good providers you know basically vanguard in T Rowe price are lost some you've got\nLow cost index funds available to you that's really the world you want to hang out and so I Would keep doing what you're doing I think it sounds great but just trim that risk could feel OK about doing that\nWill do the oval shaped your image your patients will this change social ...\nYes yes now new and you're going to kill me you are going to kill me when you'd make the adjustment and then the stock market keeps rising and you're going to call me back and say oh you you're killing me ... I I if I stayed and\nYou know like that but it is most prudent I mean I don't know what you do for a living but what I Want you to know is that\nIn many cases it's sort of like sometimes I feel like I'm a doctor I give you this prudent advice like this is what you should do I know you don't want to do it but what you should do and in and and in many cases\nYou just sign you'd be okay with having a very aggressive portfolio maybe it'll be just fine\nBut I don't see why you need to take on that risk you're doing what you should be doing right now you and your wife are really smart to be pushing that money into retirement and I wouldn't even over five five twenty nine I don't know how much is University of Texas for in state now\nI don't know it let's check that out there because like I wouldn't put that much money and five twenty nine Jeter and if you if you have\nIf you and your wife had decided look we want to put a ton of money away maybe it'll go to grad school you can do that that's fine but I mean it's not it's a it's a great way to save money for college and then great for the you know long term tax wise but you know if you want to build up your non retirement assets at the same\nAnd sort of say for every dollar that comes in I Would take some money and put into retirement some five twenty nine and some into my non qualified that's a good game plan for me and you're saying and that's what you should be doing so last but not least please do your estate planning I Hope you've got that done I'm sure you have\nAnd uh I Wish you the best of luck what a fun question for us to field because\nYou know markets easier when they're in good shape let's be honest and Ben and his wife they're in good shape you know it's not just that I Want to talk to\nYou know markets

thirty thousand dollars is a lump sum for forty two hundred dollars a month for life I Will be sixty four I'm In great health no children\nAnd then I said could you give me some more information he says I'm married my wife is working she's younger plant uncovering her with insurance for injured on me and he's got some other money in savings no other debt\nIf you look at the mass around this\nI think you're better off with forty two hundred dollars a month for life because I'm presuming well wait a minute maybe I shouldn't presume this is there a way here's my question to you you're saying you're going to have 'em there's life insurance on you is that to because your\nPension benefit is only on your life\nI Would be interested in seeing what the pension benefit would be if it were on your life and survivor benefit as well yes you might have life insurance on yourself I don't know how much you have 'em but it would be helpful for me to understand whether you've done something\nTo essentially put that insurance on yourself so that if you were to die than that forty two hundred dollars a month\nWhich would might go away if it's just on your life then that would replace would be sufficient to replace it I I Know there's so many variables and I keep asking you this so let me give you the big picture the big picture is I think\nThat the pension may be a good deal I'd be interested in finding out if there are other ways to receive that pension I Want to know how much insurance you have and I think that in this situation you may want to get some hours\nOut if there are other ways to receive that pension I Want to know how much insurance you have and I think that in this situation you may want to get some hourly advice from a financial planner because there appear to be a bunch of variables here\nAlso by the way for cars and a boat who needs for cars what on earth are you thinking\nYou know my uh my significant other was talking about a boat recently and I tried

I got my dream job\nAnd so that was with more villa that's where you are right previously okay so what happens when you become a prosecutor like you know ... you were in a litigation for right so you never know how a case works but what happens when you go and work as a federal prosecutor who trains you how do you know what to do\nWell one of the nice things about going to office like the southern district of New York the ... office is I'm the kind of recognize that when you first come in they're not giving you for example the investigation into Michael Cohen and and your ...\nPart of New York was Chinese office is um they kind of recognize that when you first come in they're not giving you for example the investigation into Michael Cohen and and you know those things so you start with smaller cases um that are less complex and it's very much on the job training but with a lot of training and so\nNow look these cases are incredibly important to the people who are involved uh obviously the defendant um it is a life thing as well as to to the victims but they're they're simpler easier cases the sort of get the the routine for it and\nYou know once you sort of get that confidence in that training then you move on to the more complex cases\nWhat was complicated but she started to work on that that got your brain really moving\nA lot of fun career I always thought of myself as a white collar guy I did a lot of work to sending white collar descendants when I was an associate it a law firm uh but I actually fell in love with doing international are kind of trafficking cases I'm the office had done was really a a a first mover in dealing with\nThan what actually happened so here with more on that is our guest Neal Brodsky he was the sitar the special inspector general overseeing talked the tarp as it was originally conceived we're going to buy a toxic\nAssets from these big banks going to take them off their balance sheets so they don't fail right yes okay what did it morph into\nI think they quickly realize that that wasn't\nPerhaps the most well thought out plan a nor would it be quick enough because the crisis was quick running a very very quickly in October and November\nAnd they realize that the real problem was that these banks were going to fail because they didn't have enough equity um they didn't have enough capital so in other words as the losses from the massive exposure they had two houses right near ... and then the bombs that were made up of these houses and then the derivatives which were\nOther words as the losses from the massive exposure they had two houses right new housing and then the bonds that are made up of these houses and then the derivatives which were bets on how these houses where were you know how these mortgages on these houses were performing\nUm that there's just these massive losses on his complete lack of confidence as to whether the banks had enough capital to avoid bankruptcy\nBecause you know of course economics one oh one if any company runs out of capital runs out of equity\nThan there are liabilities or more than they are um assets and they go bankrupt and that was the fear that was really gripping Washington and the world was that these banks simply were under capitalize they borrowed too much money they had taken to mention losses in these wild bats that they've made on mortgages and housing\nAnd they realize that the United states government needed to take ownership interest put their own money and sort of investing in in a certain type of stock was preferred shares of stock\nIn order to keep these these these financial institutions from failing and so it really turned a lot of it into just buying stock and these companies to keep them from family\nDo you think in retrospect that tarp part of that was that the smartest way to address the problems\nI think given you know it's sort of one of those those those things that's like when you get to the point where you were\nWhen they made that decision it was the best decision now obviously had they planned out better had they force all this when the first indications that the real problem there may have been better pass but I actually think right now you had an equity problem right you had companies where the market was fearing that there are going bankrupt in and look I mean a lot of it it was\nYou know how do these institutions get so ... so much leverage how do they end up borrowing so much money and having so little invest that mean you look at apple I mean how long would apple last if they had if they borrowed\nFifty dollars for every dollar in in in equity that they had and then they wouldn't last a week but one of the reasons why these institutions whereas there's this huge presumption that they would be bailed out eventually because\nThere are so large and so interconnected and also understood that the failure of anyone could trigger a cataclysm\nAnd so what happened I think when women was allowed to fail the decision was made by Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner um we just below and if they were like oh no we couldn't about and that but of course they could of course that could have bailed them out and it\nIt's a very careful language that they use but they were actively considering bailing them out and they decided not to bail them out to let them out to try to send a message to the market of course the message that the market received was oh my God this presumption that we've had that these events\nOut and they decided not to bail them out to let them out and try to send a message to the market of course the message that the market received was oh my God this presumption that we've had that these institutions will be bailed out is no longer valid and pure panic short panic that that there's this presumption that really\nWas the underpinning of of our financial system might not be true and so of course within you know within what twenty four hours\nThis was this was recognized they had she was bailed out\nUm which it had to be and then they had to get this this money into the into the system and so the reason why I think talk was so effective is two parts like first of all\nIt just put the money and right I mean and so\nYou know you don't go bankrupt if you have more capital but second it reaffirmed the message and the presumption the United states government is not going to let these financial institutions to fail we recognize that we maybe we screwed up\nA by letting leaving fail and we're not going to do it again and whatever it takes whether it's seven hundred billion dollars a tarp funds were trillions of dollars of guarantees a and loans and quoted he functions like we're the we're not going to let this happen and I think that was sort of beginning of of turning around now the way they did it\nI think was really really violated um what they were supposed to do and some of the goals that Congress had put forth for South\nLoan Congress pass this bill and you may recall um it didn't go the first time so they had to get it through Congress and so they made some deals and part of the deals as expressed in the bill itself of what its goals were going to be and so it really two primary goals that were went beyond just saving the banks for the sake of saving the banks one was to restore lending\nTo get the economy going again because you know one financial institutions all starting to collapse they're not lending and if you don't have any lending in an economy economy stops right we saw that in the great depression and that's what contributed to the great recession\nAnd so that was one big concern and the second big concern with housing\nAnd in order to get votes you know sort of a little bit of history lesson here but particularly the Congressional Black caucus right which was you know Democrats who ultimately are the reason why this bill passed\nYou know they weren't so concerned with saving Wall Street banks they were served with this foreclosure crisis that was just devastated communities and they said look will go along with this\nBut you gotta do something you got to fix housing you got to help people who are struggling in foreclosure and so the deal was once you buy all these mortgage backed securities and all these mortgages which is getting what they were originally going to do you got to fix them you've got to modify and so people can afford to stay in their homes before you sell them back out into the market and of course\nAnd all these mortgages which is of getting what they were originally going to do you got to fix them you've got to modify 'em ... people and afford to stay in their homes before you sell them back out into the market\nAnd of course judges said sure we'll do that\nBecause then they didn't buy any I'm Alone so they didn't actually have to do that but those are two the two promises that were made that it was not going to just help Wall Street but it's gonna help mainstream by restarting lending and helping people stay in their homes and so when they put this money into the banks\nTreasury Department had a tremendous amount of leverage they could have said okay we're going to give you this money but we're going to condition it on to increase lending or we're going to tie your dividend payment that you have to pay to us we're going to do that based on whether or not your baseline lending increases or decreases the amount you owe us will go up or down they could have had some requirements to deal with for closure\nBut they didn't they were just shoveling the money and to protect the banks that are at all costs and totally ignored what they were supposed to do and required to do by by law in\nYour mind was that a purposeful oversight or just the blanks hitting the fan and we as moving forward and worship you're scared and we're just going to push the money over there\nI think at first it was the latter right they were just scared\nAnd they didn't really care uh honestly about\nWhat promises were made to Congress and they certainly didn't care about struggling homeowners um you know part of it is again because of the panic at the time\nAnd part of it was just a mindset and and look this was consistent across both ... and the member this all started in the Bush administration but very very quickly you know by January we're dealing with the Obama administration and went from Hank Paulson to Tim Geithner is the secretary of treasury\nBut in many ways none of us really change and when it came to struggling homeowners but it was the prevailing view within the Treasury Department\nThat these were a bunch of dead beats a who took out money loans that were irresponsible that they should have taken out these mortgages and they really weren't deserving of a government bailout which was you know sort of shocking because here the hype\nThat first wave of foreclosures with two thousand seven that wasn't the second order effect of two thousand eight nine it's so upsetting to hear that that was the mindset\nMean I think ultimately it's almost the circles you run it and right I think the most of the people that we're dealing with that the Treasury Department just ranting circles where they didn't know who are foreclosed upon and sort of have this this view that they're just dead beats you know they took the money out because they want to have a pool and a second home and\nAnd yeah some of that happened to us but you know what a lot of people were victims of very predatory\nThat they're just ... you know they took the money out because they want to have a pool and a second home and\nAnd yes some of that happened to us but you know what a lot of people were victims of very predatory practices they took out loans that they didn't understand it they could never repay mhm um and they were ... they were defrauded and others just came on hard times\nAnd you know putting aside whether anyone quote unquote deserved it just the economic effect of helping these people with the amount of the the return that you would have gone by helping them versus not helping them and letting them fail but there's just no appetite for that within the Treasury Department\nAnd they really abandoned main street when it came to that that mandate to help push ups\nWill\nGet back to our interview with Neal Brodsky ingested minute during the break why don't you head over to Jill and money dot com bust Marquette baby book market [noise] rare while you're
