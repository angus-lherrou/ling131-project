registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nUh this is you know they're going to the the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh Trump aides you and you've got to throw the Republicans out and Georgia you see this\nTight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams Abrams who's lost weight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's a wake in the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race in Georgia has drawn thirty million dollars from um [noise] uh Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday it seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks uh the initial a defense to judge Kavanaugh I'm gave ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and\nThe interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... face of the ...\nHe did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in dignity and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process it gets more convenient for the Democrat I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again\nThese allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process it gets more convenient for the Democrat I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again calls him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just this the tip of the sphere of water are there ... there are more activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia is going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was this poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit\nAre likely voters hum and it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat to this governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia a and the growth economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that gross\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she wants to all these getaway programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nInto what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else has can do the issue Georgia right now is really the best state in the country and which to do business and she wants to tear that day out\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia maybe they've gotten a little a little bit of an awakened awakening during the entire cabinet deal I think ... should make this a huge issue down there and push and push this um this Stacey Stacey Abrams enough just come out on the cabinet thing\nBut I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it in the figurative way not literal way so don't start talking about you know you can't say anything anymore everyone's in every little word you say is like slice and dice buddies left wing groups again funded by George Soros
