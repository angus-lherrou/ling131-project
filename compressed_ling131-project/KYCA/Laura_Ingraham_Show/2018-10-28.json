I thought President Trump was pitch perfect and I think the caller from Schumer and Pelosi should've matched with the president did but unfortunately it did not\nKnow I I Want to hold up again this front page from yesterday or the Washington Post because I got to say I was really shocked by it I fully expected it to say suspect arrested and set up and said bombs us suspect outspoken supporter\nOf Trump that's the headline on the Washington Post and I went back and looked at the post\nFrom last year after Bernie Sanders supporter attacked a Republican baseball practice in severely wounded ...\nKnow headline there about outspoken supporter of the standards so I guess the question is is it fair to draw that kind of linkage front page such backed outspoken supporter of Donald\nThe I probably would have written a different headline if I worked at the Washington Post but having said that um look I Do not\nThe suspect outspoken supporter of Donald Trump\nThe I probably would have written a different headline if I worked at the Washington Post but having said that [noise] um I Do not think it is a stretch\nTo argue that ah\nPresident's comments\nAre helping\nTo stir the pot even further [noise] uh I I agree with the congressman the president's got too much credit and I agree that there are people who overstep the line I I was at outspoken when people are interrupted Sarah Sanders dinner or secretary Nielsen dinner I thought that was inappropriate [noise]\nBut when the part of the United states is actually questioning peoples' patriotism and calling them enemies of the people and you know his tank pitch perfect words\nIn the wake of a tragedy but then goes into a rally and continues to divide and and blame people I think\nThat is worth examination I think it is worth exploration I think we can all do a better job in our own lives are being more civil and and being vigorous dissenters and at an arguing with one another politically\nBut checking in how we knew it I Would hope that the president would would take some of this to hurt us well Jason\n... you know when when Congressman Chaffetz talks about the present was pitch perfect my initial reaction was which president because it didn't seem this week 'cause if there were two presidents first of all there was teleprompter Trump let's take a look\nAt me much never allow political violence to take root in America cannot let her out and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nBut then there was Twitter Trump here he is at three fourteen am friday morning funny how lowly right at CNN and others can criticize me at will\nEven blaming me for the current state of bombs yeah when I criticize them go wild and scream it's just not presidential do you think it's fair to say that there are two very different presidential towns here\nOh absolutely crystal after two years of a President Trump I think that's something people have come to expect um I Do want to say\nAh referring to the headline that newspaper you put it up if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and social media that is why\nReferring to the headline the newspaper you put it up if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter\nAnd social media that is why that headline is why\nHe does not trust the mainstream media to treat him\nFairly and he is going to continue to use social media so long as the mainstream media treats them in that fashion and his supporters are going to appreciate his use of social maybe I think that is exhibit a right there I think that we would like the country with like public officials\nTo exercise some restraint and not jump the gun when we see these tragedies happened they'd like Hillary Clinton to do it they'd like Eric Holder to do it and they like President Trump to do it in President Obama to do it\nAs well that would be nice if they did behave that way or the motives seemed very when these incidents happened you mentioned\nThe softball practiced shooter the guy who shot up the Annapolis newspaper editor for load of 'em they may very and they were I think we're we're trying to shoot born a political agenda and to these actions as as wrong what we should be doing is bringing these people to justice and hopefully deterring\nFuture acts by bringing them to address residents rhetoric is separate and apart\nFrom I'm not I'm In no way [laughter] I've gotten in a in some flights on those that work about this I'm now ... joined the president is responsible but do think it's possible that it's useful to say that these events happen in a particular climate\nNow I I don't think that's useful at all I mean I I don't any more than than than Bernie Sanders or fall for softball practiced shooter I I don't I don't think that's the that's the proper way to uh to look at the situation to these things happen because these people are deranged\nPerson who shot Gabby Giffords for instance either deranged people ... and that is what we need to look at it\nThe other thing is we're making sure that the American people know about the voting records about Republican colleagues when it comes to health care\nBoating to take away protection and some people with preexisting conditions and being an agenda forward that would have actually slapped in age tax on people between the ages of fifty and sixty four\nResulted in increasing health care premiums deductibles and out of pocket costs of the American people\nAnd being an agenda forward that would have actually slap and age tax on people between the ages of fifty and sixty four and resulted in increasing health care premiums deductibles and out of pocket costs for the American people that's what we're running on it again an agenda anchored around for the people around our candidates\nWe've been talking this hour about the tone the ugly tone our politics has taken and I want to play some ads that both of your campaign committee or the two chairs of the campaign committees have run against some of your opponents\nAccomplishments divers here's one that the un are so you say you ran against Democrat at least ... in Michigan here it is\nI just don't even know why not try things\nGoing on [noise] the rulers resistance to every minute mark militia son he's one of them\n[noise] congressman Slotkin served three terms working for the CIA in ah Iraq and Afghanistan in Iraq with the CIA and then worked in the administration as both presidents Obama and Bush is a constructive to call her of all people a liberal extremist\nWell you know I think uh I respect the misled can service to our country and the CIA and in the administrations but A People's views on the issues are legitimate and there are contrast that we need the wrong so people understand what folks believe in\nI think it's fair to say that she is not in the mainstream of a Michigan politics\nCongress Luanda here is that your group and you're sharing the dean triple C ran against Republican Congressman Mike Kelley in Pennsylvania\nTwo thousand ten car dealer might Kelly's elected to Congress in Wyoming hair and his net worth ... million this and so it's no surprise T help give special tax breaks to car dealers when like himself\nBut congressman the specific group you cite for making that report the center for Responsive Politics says in fact his net worth has dropped dramatically during the time it off as it hasn't risen\nLudicrous when we see our Republican colleagues voting for a tax package dubbed by the American people at a tax scam that was prioritizing corporations and the most wealthy in America over hardworking middle class families were going to call them out on the record\n... question but served that's his record I'm Talking about is not worth and that's a fact\nWell look to the point of your question I think that all committees and all of ... out there that are investigating campaign ads across the country that they need to be respectful of tone but I Would agree with Steve that when we're looking at boats\nOf your question I think that all committees and all of ... out there that are investigating\nCampaign across the country that they need to be respectful of tone but I Would agree with Steve that when we're looking at voting records that I think that that is fair game as well and we need to make sure that we're all looking to see and we can make sure that we're having a better conversation with the American people whether it's the last nine days of this cycle or going into next election as well\nAll right I've got a little bit over a minute left and I want you to share at a place they each get about thirty seconds you yes we've talked about the economy as we talked about healthcare immigration but to what degree is this election really about Donald Trump either pro\nPoor against a conference in law and you go first\nLook Chris I think all across the country are candidates are not really talking about this president much there is no one is going to talk more about Donald Trump Donald Trump\nWhich gives our democratic candidates the opportunity to connect\nWith their personal stories and talk about an agenda that is built around for the people and how we're going to be able to help lower prescription drug prices lower health care costs ... strong infrastructure package and clean up Washington DC with all the corruption candidates are doing well and it's because of our candidates the Democrats will win the majority in the U.S house of representatives\nA chairman Stivers you got thirty seconds\nWell I think this election is about results versus dysfunction\nAlready talked about our economic success we have more to do on infrastructure lowering healthcare costs\nBut uh the dysfunction the other side would bring their healthcare agenda would kick a hundred and Seventy nine million people off their insurance and bankrupt Medicare on day one it's they have an agenda that's

possible that some states will surpass their twenty fourteen total voting numbers just in early voting\nAnd according to some experts say that's a sign that that a lot of interest to the question is

Republican\nYeah I Would agree with that but I was in the house in two thousand ten when there was\nA red wave Democrats lost I think some sixty three seats and there's no evidence anything like that it's going to happen keeping the Senate maiming gaining in the Senate I think is what you're going to see in the house it's going to be ... going to be closed\nA lot of local issues like water in
