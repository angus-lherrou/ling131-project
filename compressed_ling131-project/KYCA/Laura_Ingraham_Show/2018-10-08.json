John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabinet shop a prior to his death that I think if he had not a guide Neal if he if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think he would have

and apparently he did that just out of spite uh because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over over his time in the Senate he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think the the the person with respect to his year theory might half the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham was always the junior maverick er he was always ah he was always John McCain's a wing man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nAnd then maybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian

it's gotten a lot of attention and it was a link to and real clear politics and a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about about that posted about some of the things that I that I said there\nAnd um and and and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and and I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post where did we go from here or by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander as the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right that's a pause there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted than lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that uh Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school students believable or the smears that they are the slander as the they directed against uh against judge Kavanaugh [noise]\nSo I continued uh but this land or the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact\nJudge Kavanaugh [noise] so I continued uh but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years to come\nAnd I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore about the capital nomination with John Malcolm\nTimeshare honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your

conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest adopted a ... that listed it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nI think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide turned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabin on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think\nAnd when when the cabinet on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculously accusations against him I think he needed to do that not to show people he was he was sincere and I and I pocket that that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now ask me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly as strongly as she did and said\nYou are now trying to destroy a a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people's service judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI I think that he he very much help his uh his cause and had he come out and being at a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation jak let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if their clubs\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the production or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this\nCrowd I settled on to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down\nThe integrity of the court by making Eighteen\nOr that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped\nFelt in that regard because that is involved itself in more and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that\nBut ... before the presidential election you had with Peter ...\nAre trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the presidential election you had to pay your dues Berg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she fought Donald\nTrump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving the administration and policies nobody was filing recusal motion to get her\nTo draw away and nobody express the kind of outrage courts her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing at the beach west courts Brett Kavanaugh\nOf all after all only challenge the tactics of the senators on the Democratic side of the judiciary\nCommittee you know the impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they both are in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives\nAfter he would be and teach then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody has actually grown out of all\nAnd there was no way that would ever happened to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do\nThis they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh will be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the the Democrats who showed up as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and ... and and all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so crane is I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do with roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there was with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being overturned\nGuard is one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there was a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they had been crazed uh ever since his election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nFor folks are on the left David predicting the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court ah starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to farm\nOr wrote the opinion that we affirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court\nAh would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited in overturned\nMy prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned than it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld how cases that tended to come to the court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you'd have states it would have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of it\nIs full frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the court I have no exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative sweat along with overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the program we're going to go to a break we'll come back with more on the cabinet nomination and your calls at eight five five forty Laura Laura

I've been reminded here one thing to\nKeep in mind folks when when you hear any leftist talking about whiteness\nAre white privilege what that translates to is power remember what the American Left is and it really serves to understand this\nThe American left today despises America as founded and this may be a bit of a simplification but I Do this in order to communicate and be understood\nAnd it's very essence the modern day American Left as taught and educated over the past two generations through middle school high school and college\nHas been taught to hate America because America is on just from our founding days because it was founded by white men and white\nMen found a place for themselves they exploded everybody else and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over two hundred plus years\nAnd only now\nIs the awareness insensitivity to this being realized only now are the victims of this white privilege of this white power only now are they standing up and demanding to be hurt only now are there and rising up in a righteous indignation and demanding fairness and redress\nAnd the only way that can happen is for the white power structure of white privilege\nTo be destroyed and replaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized\nSegregated punished\nMistreated abused what have you Byron them\nHave been victimized segregated punished\nMistreated abused what have you Byron them reclaiming or not reclaiming but claiming what isn't just lay there\nAnd that is America and its political systems and that's what young people have been taught and now as as evidenced by that column I wrote by are read by Alexis Grinnell or any other of these militant feminists militant leftist it is essentially\nThe product of the classroom\nAnd the campus which is now grown up and matured and become the quote unquote main stream of the Democratic\nParty this angry agitated\nBase of people that spans the sum total of every day in a permanent state of range and anger\nCan do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide\nIt has to be forced and of course for that to work for the use of force to work you have to cave to it\nYou have to camp to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened on every oddball leftist cultural demand out there they count on everybody caving they count on everybody suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nDonald Trump doesn't K B doesn't sue for peace and he doesn't power to them he calls them out\nIt makes perfect sense they would despise Donald Trump would make perfect sense if they feared Donald Trump it makes perfect sense that they have him\nHe refuses to play ball\n\nLook at what they've attempted to force but I'm I'm a country this whole Russian collusion thing\n\nLook at what they've attempted to force but I'm I'm a country this whole Russian collusion thing Trump Russia collusion that's a classic illustration of the left attempting to force\nWhat they want people to thing happen on the American people using everything

accustomed to there being no pushback they've gotten accustomed to Republicans being afraid of them end afraid of the media and it's this push back Trump having the audacity to run and the audacity to win and then the audacity to actually knew what he said he was going to do in order and defiance of all these people\nIt's rendering them on balanced and didn't say and by the way Paul ... who writes columns at the New York post and other places tweeted yesterday afternoon at two oh six PM Washington Post national security correspondent Greg Miller\nSpent the last two years writing a book on Trump

me any what their their points proves my point about humor in satire foreign to be true and funny it must have an element of truth in it\nAnd it does at the Democratic party is very much aware that they cannot and do not implement their beliefs via Congress here is David in Phoenix is we hit back to the phones appreciate your patience sir hello\nHi this is truly an honor to speak with you I Wish you could live forever and be on the airwaves forever\nI intend to ... thank you very much\nI'm just a quick question for you um\nYou know I think that the senators knew they weren't going to get the votes or the Democrat senators that is to oppose Kevin are and make ... make sure he's not on the bench and the Supreme Court so I was wondering [noise] um\nDo you think that the way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to find the entire Supreme Court when they don't get their way bingo\nThat's already been done the de legitimize position of the Supreme Court has already been gone why none other than the woman that hired and Kagan sorry that's her name the woman to hire and capital to teach at Harvard\nInflaming Kagan who was the dean at Harvard law and hire the guy was so good she's now Supreme Court justice thanks to Obama\nShe has said it would not be good for him to be on the court it would not be good too controversial the integrity of the court would come into question there's no question\nThis is what the left does they lose control over an institution the institution lots in their minds is corrupt unreliable and must be eliminated from the power structure\nCould have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because he has\nMale genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe\nE for the cameras could have done it well if you're old woman with the sun\nYou that's all this woman in this story requires to believe\nBoth the forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons\nAnd a husband that you love and sort of brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss what is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to what happened\nBecause that's what men do be cause man can\nAnd men can because they have the genitalia necessary to do it I don't know if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign onto that well you don't\nAnd so now these leftist women are enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade a bunch of average ordinary white women to join their cause anti Kavanaugh so now these women are sellouts and\nTheir ... says are sellouts and their rooms are sellouts and they're selling out to the patriarchy and as such they become\nWorthless and even a liability to the point now that here we have a soundbite with two women experts in gender studies saying\nDo we need white women get to the electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand eleven\nThe Obama presidential campaign this was written about by a Thomas and so all in the Washington Post\nMight have been to New York times\nNouns that they were for going the white working class as a voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of us sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base\nBecause white working class voters were becoming less and less dependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional democratic little guy voting bloc they\nExpress no interest there's just simply an evolution of that\nSo I'm a white working class was totally go pounds than by the Obama campaign two thousand\nI've only walk they express no interest this is simply an evolution of bad so I'm a white working class was totally go pounds than by the Obama campaign two thousand eleven now in two thousand Eighteen do we need white women it's an electoral questioned it every candidate needs to ask\n... folks don't as there is now under misunderstand what I'm doing here I'm not doing this simply doing expressed in the credibility of this\nDoing this under the auspices of how in the world can a majority or mainstream of Americans in any way support this party\n\nI realize I'm setting myself up here for what might be a major shocking disappointment the day after the election in November and I'm not making any predictions here I'm just\nI'm I'm I'm genuinely curious\n\nI just don't see how the actions the words the policy is the attempts to inspire and persuade I just I don't see how any decent normal people fall for this\n\nAnd I realize that Democrats are educated a lot of people in the last two generations I realize a lot of college educated people have come out of these institutions that may have been corrupted and polluted with this crap and since most people are not what they wish they were\nMost people are not as successful as they want to want to be most people do think about what they don't have rather than what they do\nAnd if that's who you are if that's if that's the personality type that it's not very big step to start blaming somebody else for what you don't have becomes very easy to blame some faceless patriarchy some faceless white privilege power structure some faceless Bon Jovi Mimi is\nDepriving you denying you discriminating against you\n\nSaw the left has to do is get hold of the people who have not amounted to what they want to amount to do they have what they had hoped to have it anyway materially professionally you name it the other words it's not hard to run onto unhappy people it's not challenging\nWhat they had hoped to have it anyway materially professionally you name it\nThe other words it's\nNot hard to run onto unhappy people it's not challenging to find a bunch of people that are\nBeating themselves up and all you have to do is ... is is convinced those people that\nSomebody else did it to the Republicans but white privilege power structure did it too and it was only one way to fix it and that's going to wipe 'em out I Know they get it a lot of people to believe this now\nAnyway back to the phones we go in a moment to solve the clock QuickTime out back with more\nAfter multiple millions of people who've been hearing a lot about
