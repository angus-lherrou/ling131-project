FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all\nRelated in any way ... inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wants some of

about\nTo characterize what's in these FBI find it so it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in this FBI report\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut

any more delays you do the best you can do\nAnd the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house from really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to to allegedly offer\n... and only to delay or looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college or law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate\nIt and the supplemental what would your response to that bear\nOut and they know that if they haven't read and how do they know what's in the supplemental they don't know what questions are asked was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the judge has some beers with\nOr who should yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just

here that Bill Bill or a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that the FBI ... testimony from former classmates of Kevin ... these are people that went to Yale with him and uh they ... the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the\nProblem is as you read and to the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened so would the FBI prove those people are are they just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and bottom line first of all it's coming from Ronan\nA secondly I'm a these if the if they're not ... witnesses to that and they're not permitted on the stand in a court of law never mind are doing this and you have to make that cut off some place and to what is you know comment what does make sense to do\nAnd none of these people make sense and if anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend a friend that doesn't carry any weight with anybody ...\nAgain people think that the FBI\nSort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't carry any weight with anybody ...\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some\nGlobal investigation into any allegation no matter how remote and interviewing people on a hearsay\nBasis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense for and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here the bureau is going to get sucked in the eye one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out and the the the the democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from ... from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know I was going to take a black guy from the other side of it I was\nI just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that\nUm was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and you you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting\nIn a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous\nWitnesses to expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nYou know broad ranging ... us this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what they're all the FBI us but you see the ignorance that it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better\nOr who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret it's outrageous this shouldn't be sacred this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you should or bottom line is the some of these people truly don't believe um does anything going on it's wrong here it's because they support they have to say well I Believe that uh\nDon't believe that there's anything going on it's wrong it's because they support they have to say well I Believe that the judge Kevin already guilty you can't look at the facts and

not part of the deal they testified under oath what more can the FBI or do you think the FBI really thinks that these people don't change their stories from what they testified under oath\nBesides that Dr forge testimony changed anyway and in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or Kevin always distinct talk that Kavanaugh for how many times over the years\nUm but they testified under oath and so the the thing is no reason to talk to them and go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying that I couldn't find anything\nSo I'm watching CNN did I've got CNN and Fox on it and here and it was probably ten minutes ago ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they've lost that gives a little CNN reporter only looks a little bit me he was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this was a very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today actually sounded like a Republican and that presents a problem\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today\nActually sounded like a Republican and that presents a problem\nDeflated sounding like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very thorough\nReporting and investigation\nSo it looks like flake and Collins or in line to vote has been called cloture vote was fired last night by by the turtle who was on fire again today just moments ago on the floor of the Senate ... out for him he was on fire\nRight now I'm so this this is happening and they only primary change your difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reaction to it I've even\nSeen stories today among never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will see about that but clearly there is a reaction is and and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people a day that they have no idea than Hillary Clinton ran the operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and he got boon because the millennials in the crowd had no idea\nBe\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park I mean he got boon because the millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token most people are not live to Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this is their first\nAnd that means is the worst smear campaign ever that they've seen could anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse cabin on has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence he'd been vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life well lived\nWhen you boil all this down I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican vote against the guy\nAnd in fact I don't know this but I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats Senate Democrats\nAre privately behind the scenes are urging recalcitrant Republicans that go ahead and vote for capital because of the way this was back firing on them\n\nDon't know that it's a wild guess and only time will tell

[noise]\nAnd NPR reporter uh just [noise] just tweeted that Senate Judiciary committee Democrats are filing outage Chuck Schumer his office stone faced\nThe meaning is they're coming out they made their depressed or there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy in a stone faced their shell shocked or something or other\nNow why would that be why well didn't the Democrats on that committee actually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying\nI don't know how anybody could\nHonestly folks that went out and I I'm not even being part is when I said as she can't remember where when and why the people she says\nHe could honestly Fox that went out and I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't remember where when and why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although we\nDid the Democrats in that too many really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days was going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nomination\n\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that this ... nothing other than the ... this is all this has managed to all they've got if they really thought that this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written\nQuestions having produced well that is shocking to honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but\nI fought this has been a scam from the get go and if they are all in on the scam and at the scammer was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter\nDetailing all of this so they work out a ... office and they're all stone faced\nMaybe they thought that they hand flake or maybe they felt they were going to get Collins Collins inflate of come out and what they have said so far remembered the votes not going to be the Saturday now so anything can change\nDo not think the Democrats have scrape the bottom of the barrel orbiting gutter and the efforts to forge this they've still got so Saturday\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you're listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senators and house\nYou and numerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing\nEarlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism against\nThat he is doing this it totally is he can't help it\nMr Sassaman gets the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump\nHas a behavioral patterns strategically happens it's called pacing and when they briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford why did he say compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's lie then his death needs to go on Trump's and all of this and everybody says oh wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on the record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establish that way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no it doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue of seemed to dubbed tail with what the swamp things\nBut then a few days or are we go by him and the president becomes really is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not marker\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff on Dr foreigners shaky uncorroborated among provable test them on the drive by it's we're never gonna\nI don't know if I'm Dr foreigners shaky uncorroborated provable test them on to the drive by it's we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the dry buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally but because he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said\nIn the process that Dr buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the neighbors gave me the vapors on my got Trump is on who's as horrible as businesses remained he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did re counting the dirty inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been playing now on all media when all day yesterday\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr forge testimony the drive by media did not report on on ... none of the corroborate shouldn't being possible they did not tell their audience is\nThat the four people foreign place them a room with her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks\nOther than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford and couldn't backup what she was saying that people watch the mainstream media had no idea that the foreign witnesses foreign claims where they're all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends\nThe drive by it's we're not reporting any of that the drive by it's worth reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned the woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets it on the record the drive by it's half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way think of all the millions of people who had never heard\nThe truth about\nDr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of ... million\nWell the millions of people who had never heard the truth\nAbout Dr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of ... million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterized it for everybody think of it this way I think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia and North Dakota Alaska who now you know the truth who never would've known the truth hadn't Trump not\n\nDetail that for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no corroboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does\nIf we had an honest median millions of people would already know that Dr foreign story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous\nThe people with these protests but I think she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democrats senators haven't told them only trumpeted is another reason why they hate it\nBut we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine balls the foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report\nSaying no corroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump has go literally insane but if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know what the Trump didn't say it millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democratic senators wrong Ben Sasse\nWe couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right drive by media wrong Democrat senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally\nNot like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump's strategy and it's all related to the pacing of how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more\nThan ... you know Russia [noise]\n[noise]\nI Know and this is the ... stock market report is evil wealth management and investment banking I'm not sure I can with senior strategist Jason or

at ten on the news every morning three point five and fourteen Ninety am [noise]\nThere's been a lot of talk and I would have been even for me one of the Republicans going to do if Kavanaugh's not get it from going to harm or going to be fired up what am I going to do that's not the\nQuestion the question is what are the Democrats are going to do if Kavanaugh is confirmed that's what I think maybe the bigger question and in the interest of discovering there's what's going to be audio soundbites\nWe have a group of protesters occupying senator Collins Susan Collins of Maine office and during the protests one of the protesting women made some remarks\nI ever\nHeard of mind man with I mean I can hear\nMore last night I got another train every morning at six am from I mean I I heard the hair Armani that story I don't know what I mean you don't mind I think you are listening to our story\nWe're not really didn't want to do that\nHere you know I mean\nHave the real perpetrator harm in court\nHearing me leave me seeing\nIt terrifies me that I and other survivors have to tear our bodies apart and share our stories like Planned Parenthood tears your body's apart\nThat she wants to be helpful while she's terrified I I I just I I I think in this climate it tell you the truth out there\nNow she wants to be held for a while she's terrified I I I just I I think in this climate they tell you the truth out their pet\nTo try to poke holes in her story and just six team the if the Republicans had succeeded in exposing her as a liar I think the Democrats for the last\n\nI yeah I think they would have gone batty asks the Republicans not at her I think they wouldn't have cues the Republicans brow beating\nHer and making her say different things because they're all on record as having said they believed her before they even met her before they even talk to her they said they believed her in fact I don't even know why the Democrats need to see the FBI report\nBecause they said they believe her from the get go\n\nThey're not even open to the possibility that she's telling a story that cannot be corroborate and haven't been\nThis is Lewis in Los Angeles is we uh stay with the phones Hi Louis great to have you here hello\nHey how're you doing Russ is my first tour list and then I started listening to you Sean Hannity everybody and\nI said thank you for for for basically\nYellen would I Want to go out so loud all the time you know you guys said\nAnd I'm thinking in and my first year\nOr I've never really been into politics I've never really cared a in a sense of you know just kind of like a they're going to vote whatever but this was really bad this was\nSomething that that changed because I have family that a lot of sun we got we got a big family and and it was like how can you just try and destroy someone\nWith no kind of cooperation no kind of\nProof no kind of and then Trump said yesterday and I'll say like this he he basically yelled out what I said it was like everything she was saying but I don't know well I don't know I don't know I don't know so it was like well what happened what went down what what's going on you're you're you're you're saying these allegations but you don't know\nCertain things that are very important like who took your home they should have been traumatized\nBefore you have something like that happen you would have been like hey mom picked me up and call somebody to get to ... or\nSomething so it just after that ... are they destroyed that man and tried to change me and basically it was just like I got to vote I got to vote for rights I got to vote for ... for for just God our our values in this country which are being\nReally this ... this has\nI got to vote for rights I got to vote for ... for for just God our our values in this country which are being\nReally this ... this has awakened view that much\nYes yes that that you know not that not that women can't be believed but both men and women can live to say that oh this certain nobody can can rely on women can't\nNo no you said earlier wait ... years you nailed what this was about earlier you correctly identified that the United States Senate was attempting to destroy this guy you didn't know who he was some pilot cold but you saw a guy\nTrying to be destroyed his wife his career his future destroyed and nobody had any corroborating evidence for all of this that was going to destroy him that's what got you in here\nAnd and I ... I feel like the gentleman before I went on it I don't think we're talking my wife we watched it was like wait a minute like you're not add up I'm Sorry when you flip through it for a new food like she'll look you know something else if it wasn't you know what I mean it just didn't add up\nAround here we have ... Lewis thank you thank for the call we've got other anecdotal story but it dovetails with what we're seeing in the polling data\nWe're seeing the generic ballot advantage of Democrats had now gone in the latest Maris to NPR poll and a twelve point advantages now two points which is statistically tied that's the margin of error um in in all these other generic ballot Paul's which I think er\n[noise] I don't think the Republicans it never landed in one of the news and the Republicans women Congress all the time so I was since Nineteen Ninety four anyway you people realize when the Republicans want a Ninety four was the first time in forty\nYears that they ran or control the house\nSince then they've lost control of the one control back but I ... I don't think there's ever been a generic ballot poll ever that shows the Republicans\nI had I could be wrong I doubt it I don't recall ever having seen one\nNow we're seeing voter enthusiasm shift\nTo the Republicans Democrats are are losing some and believe me if this all his real at this polling game as accurate as the same stuff that Democrats are saying it's affecting them then there's this from the Atlantic now the Atlantic is a left wing publication as is most us\nDemocrats are saying it's affecting them then there's this from the Atlantic now the Atlantic is a left wing publication as is most us medium they headline but this story conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh and they think other voters are to\n\nHere's a quote in the two weeks since ... claims against capital first emerged many feminist groups\nHave called on senators and the American public to believe women who come forward with allegations Kamala Harris the progressive Democrats entered from California captured this settlement\nWhen she questioned for during the hearing I Believe you and I believe many Americans across the country believe you\nBut the writer of this story whose name is am agreeing said the women I interviewed however raises them ten the notion that people's accusation news should be believed on the basis of their identity alone\nThis makes me furious because I think that's taking advantage for the worst purposes or something that's real in our culture a woman said women are not a monolithic blocked most of us are not going to take to the streets with pitchforks and torches\nThat said there's a large large percentage of us who feel very very strongly about the way this process has played out conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh they think other voters are two\nNew conservative women living suburbs [noise] the reason I ask that is because the Democrats claimed to have a hold on college educated suburban women\nWell they may be losing that hold too if some of this polling data is correct let me just say this\nIf everything were just and it isn't and I know it\nBut if everything were saying the Democrats would be destroying themselves right now as they did back in two thousand two when they did the Wellstone Mario the Democrat Party\nIs in a same world the Democrat Party is engaging in self immolation right now\nWith the treatment of Kavanaugh the backing of a woman\nWho's and got no evidence hasn't had a you have a corroborated and thanks to Donald Trump now more Americans than ever know the truth of ...\nThe backing of a woman who's and got no evidence hasn't had a you have a corroborated and thanks to Donald Trump now more Americans than ever know the truth of her story\nAnd the truth of her story is but it's full of holes\nIf Trump patent went on his rant going on his ran on Monday Night the dry buys would've never reported that because they had not reported it\n\nThe Democrats are not the majority they did not win the status that when the house the advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesn't that's for the winters\nBut the the behavior to Democrats have engaged in here the public political murder\nAbout highly achieved brilliant guy who never did anything to anybody anywhere near the way he is being described\n\nPeople bringing forth the ass allegations like this wouldn't be asked why isn't there no evidence to back it up\nIn a say in the world would be paying a price so ... so high they wouldn't even engage in this kind of behavior but the Democrats think they speak for a majority of Americans because they have the media on their side and they think\n\nThat they have succeeded in making the majority of Americans hate rate Kavanaugh and hates conservatives and Republicans\nAs a as well what we don't live in a saying world you know we don't live at the same country right now but uh it's still possible for the Democrats to pay a huge huge price for this and given the standard time tested American moral code\nAnd are sent and set of values the Democrats\nShould be halfway finished with their self destruction in the middle of this I take a break we'll be back in a minute don't go\nAnywhere [noise] simply really tell me he ought to be more\nHave you been dreaming of that new kitchen bathroom or home edition
