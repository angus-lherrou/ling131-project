I might have been too emotional at times I Know that my tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there was a son a husband and a dad\nI testified with five people for most in my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's going forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I've been to the entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judging person I've been to the entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed a terrific column by Kavanaugh I think it's ... it was both well timed and important to do this\nOr let's go to Steve\nIn North\nCarolina a wait and see if we go to Robin Massachusetts first online five Rob welcome\nHi Laura I'm first off can I say that at the end of my day\nWhen I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone on my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to speak to you right now so what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republicans how to fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think it's true or seeing the results of that all over the place right now\nThink Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham\nDuring the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kevin I was I think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWhen the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what's what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he he sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nHe's not going to dwell over mistakes we all need to do that any look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as a Republican and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming this\nNeed to do that you know look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Robin we have a great team on the anger mangled we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age sponsor can see a definite difference in her skin since using it watcher sunspots age spots and even read inflamed patches of vanish right before your eyes\nAnd just like Renee if you quicker call right now you get the ... correct or absolutely free for just trying Gen yourself or ... watch those stubborn sunspots fade away\nAnd do it before you get busy with the holidays my friends and those bags and puffing that you'll see them diminished as well for fast results suggest you sell immediate effects is also yours free go to Jim you sell dot com now recall eight hundred for a zero fifty two zero six order this week and received ... luxury micro drummer abrasion also free\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but\nUm if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's still be shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining so strive drumming them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names in their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's crazy\nYou know do you think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible I think you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught\nUp a really needed lost some much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight\nFor what you believe in a fight for a principal fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large shock me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he certainly things to the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's not\nWay how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper\nIt at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own the va to predict vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics and you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes\nVicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one's gender according to one's politics and you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the president selling judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred dishes judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitutional law\nThere's no such are no doubt on about ... they're talking about a\nPassage from your book you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it to talk about a passage in your book\nSo this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as illogical and beyond commonsense I respect them more if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional us than all this nonsense\nWe're gonna later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about\nWhat these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe then you're anti warmer or you're anti victim and justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop\nIdentifying ourselves as victims of this or victims of that because that's the that's not going to help you advance as a person as being able to overcome\nIt doesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the need to move in every man is a re this every man is a sexual harasser by virtue of their gender and then every woman is a victim\nOn even those who many who are of it had been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with it\nAnd their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about it you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to the world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and\nHis shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary of the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein yeah exactly one year ago today it was Harvey Weinstein major democratic donor you're not going to find him and a picture of Brett Kavanaugh you're going to find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lot of a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses and Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but\nLet's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't mean the women describe and kind of not sending thirty six years ... years ago and still on corroborated\nAll right this was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC or network that I literally don't even watch anymore because it's so pretty interesting so predictable\nBut this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to ah your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a ... a ...\nWhy can't you be the egg\nKelly in the fabric egg and tell your story because to say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth to say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding and compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice Rome shouldn't hold on I'm not I don't know your value okay you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president\nYour reaction to the\nWho I have to reaction to that much I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or the or harm or their recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me\nOr their harm or the recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there\nAre because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of blowback\nUm and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how ... how high the stakes are Laura [noise] ah to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed in as an associate justice United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied I won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be bullied um and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that I find it to be on basically are relevant and when I talked about the fabric drag which by the way is trending on social media I Love I Love and forming generation and said\nI'm a new term that may not know it uh but when I was talking about that I was talking about the process\nThey if you look at the entire cut that's me talking about how [noise]\nRight well I'm a

question and Christian Walker was shouting questions and I said she's been treated like average egg meaning the process she you you could do it privately in California it's her attorneys who didn't allow her that Curtis seeing the decency you can do it I'm not on camera you can do it\nOn and you might tell us and you have to explain you were there and you wonder about Iraq and by the way and I wasn't\nYesterday I wasn't yesterday but I'm not going to be bullied a particularly by particularly\nBy that person no but the funny thing is ... and I'm just I I was to this stuff up for people

[noise] can I just put at the bottom of the stack it's about somebody I very rarely comment on because they don't care as phony folk conservatives his name is Jennifer Rubin\nA ... Jennifer Rubin it's amazing transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger didn't win Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has a this building conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes to the deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative they're saying on MSNBC the email Democratic senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behave\nA conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving is if it's their time of the month does anybody think that\nWouldn't fly there is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say about about women senators are women and witnesses or any of us or admit here's Jennifer Ruben\nAnd by using this this this analogy these Republican senators behaving is if it's their time of the month is that not acknowledging that there is such a thing as their time of the month\n\nSo who is that here that's being cliched and discriminatory and furthermore pointing out one of the big differences between men and women because men except those who are trying\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known results something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is the\nKavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in them in terms of the words in her study of things\nJust continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the capitalist\nBecause of how Trump voters the purse and specifically the conservative populace coalition perceive the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\n\nPress and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they edit things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range hadn't somewhat diminished until cabin all came along and real wake in these people and fired them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell\nWhat happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from a cabin all by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy is high [noise] now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen thousand he's he admitted terms now where I Will she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people who voted for Trump are deeply involved in things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people who voted for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters didn't so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nHounded every day\nMultiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody what he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild a military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\n\nAs her insistent no that's kind of stuff it evaporates in ... you know people's lives do on the news changes but at this camp on a circus has re ignited the coalition that electing Trump\nIt's an ... you know people's lives go on the news changes but at this camp on a circus has re ignited the coalition that electing Trump\nAnd this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the
