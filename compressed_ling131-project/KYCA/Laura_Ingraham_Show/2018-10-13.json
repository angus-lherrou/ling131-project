were some really supposed to call in should I just answer the question as an email why not why don't we do that\nUh okay so and then send me some more emails all make will start to show off let's make this an email open it's like the cold open from SNL it's the cold open for Jill on money\nOkay Gerard writes ah my wife and I recently applied for long term care insurance [noise]\nWe would give them I don't I don't know if this was long term care insurance I'm going to tell you that right now because we would give them two hundred thousand dollars then no monthly premiums at our debts the remaining money would go to our trust or we could get the money back without charge whichever we would want um\nOkay so we found some of the medical tests are offering a program for three hundred thousand Andy\nWithout charge whichever we would want on okay so we found some of the medical tests are offering a program for three hundred thousand and a yearly premium of about let's see forty let's call it forty three forty four hundred dollars\nIt's just a been amazing and you guys are great so if you do have a question asked\nJill Jill and money dot com that is our email address so let's try to get through some of these um Denver writes that she's got to equity lines about twenty thousand dollars each\nMy understanding is that we can no longer claim interest paid on our tax return I only had that an expense is unreal tapes real estate property for tax write up any suggestions for how to replace that tax option was only about twelve hundred dollars the equity lines are on two pieces a rental property\nThat I get a first mortgage on one so okay interesting question on\nThe the tax rules have changed right we knew that as a the first of the year\nAnd I want to be clear because mortgage debt is a bit misunderstood right now in terms of what it I'm ... how how it actually is it has changed so big picture\nIt used to be that you could deduct interest on mortgages up to a million dollars\nNew law allows you to to deduct interest on up to it says generally allows you to so let me just say generally because you should always check with your tax preparer or make sure that your situation falls into this but generally the new tax law allows you to deduct interest on up to\nSeven hundred fifty thousand dollars of mortgage debt\nTo buy or improve a first or second residence\nBut it eliminates the provision that allowed\nTo buy or improve a first or second residents\nBut it eliminates the provision that allowed interest deductions on up to one hundred thousand dollars of home equity debt\nAnd also decide bar or if you're in a high tax states don't forget there's that ten thousand dollar limitation on property tax deductions\nOkay so that's the rule\nThe question of whether you should um now refinance your home I don't know\nI mean mortgage rates have just gone to a seven and a half year highs I you know probably closer to eight soon on as the general long term interest rates are nice intermediate term interest rates that ten year treasury has gone up thirty year fixed rate mortgages are about foreign three quarters that's up about a\nFull percentage point from a year ago\nAnd so is it really worth the cost of a re fi just to claim the interest probably not I'm guessing no so what other ways that you might find some relief\nI think that the maybe the most direct way is you might find that your tax situation has improved simply because\nYour tax actual tax rate has gone down\nSo before you start freaking out about the worries about losing adoption here and there maybe your rates lower maybe you're now in the what I called the wall upping tax bracket uh twenty four percent that's if you're married filing jointly one sixty five to three Fifteen\nIf you're single it's eighty two five to one fifty seven but that's a very big tax bracket that if you fall into that\nOn and rates have generally gone down also maybe you are I I mean again I don't know in terms of\nYou should really check for rental property um but I I and maybe there's something you can do with your rental property that would help your tax situation maybe you're going to claim the standard deduction now\nAnd you wouldn't have been able to itemize anyway and the duck some of that stuff I don't know but there's a lot of pieces to this many people have been lamenting the things they've lost in the tax bill but maybe there is something that you gained\nAnyway on and\nJust I'm again there's so many pieces to it\nBut maybe there's something that you gained anyway on and I just I'm again there's so many pieces to it a tax question that I Can't possibly\nUm really comment on you know your specific case but I Would talk to your tax planner\nThere's another tax question [noise]\nUm my husband and I are both working in every year we basically oh three to seven thousand dollars in taxes\nWe make two hundred and fifty grand a year to reduce our tax burden someone suggested to uh make a\nA before tax four one K. contribution rather than our Ross four one K. contribution what are your thoughts okay so that again we're talking about tax brackets here so here are people who are in the twenty four percent tax bracket\nOne sixty five to three Fifteen so if you think about it that's a pretty low tax highest marginal tax bracket for someone who makes two hundred fifty\nGrand [noise] so I Would keep doing the Roth I think the Roth is better just one more to pay the tax\nAm I missing something everyone complains about taxes I mean these are what essentially could be who was that guy who interviewed and he said these are the lowest tax rates that you're probably going to pay for the next hundred years like in fifty years ago and fifty years I had like for its is truly amazing\nHere's a question from Kevin\nReach real estate investment trust what a ten percent investment and reached to be a fair amount of exposure for portfolio of a million dollars and ten percent okay richer okay they're fine I mean\nI'd be careful there um it's not a perfect hedge a lot of people use that as an inflation hedge not perfect I don't know if it's an equity read or an income rate so send me a follow up I Want to know what kind of reader considering\nJim and his wife are both fifty nine they've got five hundred and thirty grand save for retirement he's got a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in his four oh one K. the rest in IRAs including two hundred and Ninety thousand dollars in a variable annuity which they've been in for over nine years she says it's done OK\nI funded it with a hundred and fifty six thousand dollars so it's almost doubled in nine years\nAs I get closer to retirement I'm looking for a better annuity product I'm sure annuity products have improved since I bought my river source annuity a financial advisors recommending a fixed in indexed annuity with lower\nFor a better annuity product I'm sure annuity products have improved since I bought my river source annuity financial advisors recommending a fixed in the index annuity with lower fees and the current one uh\nIn addition the annuity as a death benefit which is attractive to both me and my wife would you recommend to fix the newly product that plan to keep working to sixty seven and then living my four oh one K.\nOn okay you're ready for this breaking news you don't need another annuity\nYou said that you've got this money is coming from an IRA account why are you going to buy another annuity when the surrender period is up\nBut you can do is just let the money flow back into the annuity into the IRA don't buy another annuity you want to really save yourself some money here's an idea by an excellent I bet you're a mirror prize broker is not going to tell you to do that but I Am\nSo that is I think the best way to really save money and for a lot of people they don't realize it but\nThe money that you're that that harms the source of the annuity funds is really important\nIn a way to ... as you determine what to do next so if the source of the fund is a retirement account\nThat's great news because it means all you have to do is you say okay well my fees are up I'm done with this you simply let the annuity company no the insurance company no okay I'm not going to renew it I'm not doing anything all the money will slow directly into the IRA account and from that point\nYou can do anything you want and hopefully what you do\nIs you just buy some index thoughts\nAnd if your broker suggests that you buy another annuity I Would say go find somebody who is a fiduciary go find somebody who is a she only planner go find somebody who's going to put your best interests first I don't see why you need an annuity\nI think you're going to be far better off\n... just basically letting the money go back into that account\nSo funny when people say like the money doubles while I promise you one thing I had the money been an index funds during the exact same time horizon you would have done better simply because of the ... okay you are listening to Jill on money live from the capital one bank studios and if you've got a

I think it'll be great\nRight uh so Stephen writes that I Am fifty nine and a half I'm In good health I've got good job security I plan to retire at age sixty five I Am a member of a union a big one and together we're building a pension for me I Love that that is true\n[noise] anyway upon leaving my current employer I planned to roll my pension into my existing roll over IRA a friend of mine encouraged me to investigate the tax implications specifically my employer will be contributing a substantial portion to the patch and\nWhat made more money by leaving the money in the pension or by rolling over into the IRA when I take a distribution I must pay regular income tax would my distribution from the pension be taxed at a lower rate what about the growth I might or in in the stock market would that grows out pace the tax liability\nI listen to your show and don't use the c._e._o. radio and Minneapolis and I think you're wonderful\nAnd I tell you something I Love WC CEO\nTo great station and um love the people there and thank you so much for writing so Steven let's think about a couple of things first of all if you're a member of a big union\nMy inclination to you is is to ah for you I should say not to you my inclination for you is to keep that pension where it is because a pension isn't guaranteed to promise\nFor you I should say not to you my inclination for you is to keep that pension where it is because a pension isn't guaranteed to promise\nNow it is true that there had been times where pensions break their promises but it's quite rare\nAnd if you're with a large employer may be a state employer or maybe a big company um it tends to be that that pension guarantee is a better deal than managing your own money in the roll over and the reason is this\nYou are managing your money yourself in that role over the pension is professionally managed and generally speaking it will give you a target returned that they're on the hook for\nSo I like a guarantee I think it guarantees a darn good thing\nIf you were to roll over the money into your IRA then what would happen as you would do a direct role over so they would take the cash balance of the tension and would roll into your IRA there's no tax of it and then the money just comes out\nAnd as the money comes out of this tax at your current tax rate at that time same for your pension if you left it there as the money comes out\nThere is that that money is taxed because the money that you put into a pension and the money that your employer put into the pension has not yet been taxed so I don't think there's a tax issue I think it's a risk issue\nAnd I would much rather that the company be on the hook for the risk then you beyond hook for the risk okay so that is my advice for you Steve and good luck and\nUh oh I Do notice by the way as I talk to you it was just recently the Minnesota state fair\nAnd I know that because uh John Heinz was anchoring there and told me that he eats a uh he did
