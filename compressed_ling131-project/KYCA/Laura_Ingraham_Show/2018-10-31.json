depleted\nI've had a lot of people telling me the news today seems the same as it was yesterday the day before and that last month stories common story is go emotions get revved up and then they dialed back down and it's time to get ramped back up again\nAnd it's getting harder and harder and harder to get revved up it's almost like people are saying that they're being beaten down by all of

City I'm Nineteen Ninety five and a half year old he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of like a lead syndromes uh to go out and and stock with terrorists all around the country and tried to heal and it was a turning point\nAnd ... he doesn't go after the terrorists who doesn't hurt him beat the drums to go out and and stock with terrorists all around the country trying to heal and it was a turning point as president saying he was embattled when he went to Oklahoma City that turned his presence around with a very positive direction\nThis is how history ... works\nThere David around them are getting a stagnant Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after the terrorist\nHe didn't start America you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWell\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that by their very words the violence is acceptable\nYou oughta see I'm sure you are now seeing reports of some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless study\nRight now who couldn't even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five but there is no Fox News the block\nWith her and meet some of the airwaves uh this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nBut the White House felt some have had the issue of corrections say no we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's meant by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hike it around in the woods with some guns were in camera gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this\nAnd you get rid of it but there's Clinton's zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me\nBombed out so but you see Clinton you didn't do that no he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorists heated and sort of beat the drums in store for journalists all over the he tried to heal it was a turning this is\nAgain history revision as them extraordinary one more by this is worth blitzed\nAnd judge Jeffrey too but in the

show on CNN\nI with the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five or in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing our moon was president he went to Oklahoma City was he delivered a beautiful speech who was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on driver you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests see\nSo now that we're no protest for a bomb on there is no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nThat Trump's guilty that Trump's fault that the protesters are right why weren't they are any protests back in those days we'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\nPrecisely me cause no left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse\nFor it but it also was a different time we're talking about it over twenty five years ago twenty two twenty three years ago

that is the media as they are interpreting the reporting on I'm\nOn a what grass last words are\nBut if it give it to crash please save the geo ... that would that would indicate that grass lately I really don't want to go there I don't want to assume Grassley said until I have what he actually said I'm not going to even speculated or the way the media is reporting out of his save the GOP me there was over in\nIt was soon Grassley said until I have what he actually said I'm not going to even speculate\nNor the way the media is reporting out of his save the GOP means it was over who you were in we were I mean we were headed for the gigantic blow while you were going to lose everything and then like Kavanaugh thing happened in a caravan thing I didn't might save the GOP\nThere are other people saying well if it was going to save a GOP it didn't because all of that momentum was interrupted by a pipe bomber and the synagogue murders\nIn Pittsburgh and that would have just destroyed any momentum\nAnd you know I Love people in Washington and they're conventional wisdom okay so they are sitting there their businesses the News I'm gonna explain us three of their business is the news\nThey eat it they live they breathe it they ring courage it tainted lemonade at they absorb it hits the news\nThey think everybody does it to a certain extent\nAnd so they get all hot to trot about things and they see the caravan might be helping Trump\nAnd they like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they said that Kavanaugh's situation that Democrats blew that sky high and sort of home man this is really gonna help but then the pipe bomb and the sooner guy shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation or energy level\nFocus on those two things is interrupted by it and I think everybody else's has\nWell I don't know that it works like that with ... with with the people who are not in the news business\nBut I'm going to tell you it's been conventional wisdom and washing then let the pipe bombs and the Senate guy shooting destroyed what ever Republican momentum there was an for whatever reasons\nAnd I just I I'm Sorry I don't buy it I think people can feel that in Washington\n\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus we're about\nDemocrats or Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if Kavanaugh confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women\nInstead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story wouldn't we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul rape by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why isn't justice not being sought any longer\nAnd they answered the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it men destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess
