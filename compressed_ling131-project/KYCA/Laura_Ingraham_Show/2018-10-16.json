I mean it nobody else light the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by\nHolding steady in the spine on Capitol I'm telling you Trump is\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons\nNot waiting with bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the goon rule David analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he\nWent to five thirty eight and then he went to vox back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells them for example Nate Silver on election night two thousand sixteen five PM\nGave Hillary Clinton playing an eighty nine percent chance of being elected president so they were all thinking it was over in the same thing is happening now Democrats Seventy three percent chance of retaking the house of representatives\nDemocratic voters breathing a sigh of relief Nate Silver is continuing report that he was on um the FiveThirtyEight dot com politics podcast\nAnd the host was Jody ... Oregon who is a guy and the question has the gender gap increased since cabinet\nAnd the host was Jody\n... Oregon who is a guy and the question\nHas the gender gap increased since cabinet\nA lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in almost social\nNetworks right especially for Republicans way or the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit improved after the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats\nAnd all of these house races the Democrats are assuring their voters are locks they're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of 'em that are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them but they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blow away business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten for rock Obama being done in the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten in two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama won\nWell didn't even get way and he wasn't on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year\nWe're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over\nThe systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency and the Democrats have the least amount of electrical power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe it\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electoral power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties and from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... and the Democrats the comeback show up and re take everything\nThey lost all the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democratic party\nThat much worse bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the spending that\nEnergized but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS at all the other scandals that came along Benghazi there was nothing that Obama was doing the economy was a flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component to that I was twelve so now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand in the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd its hatred for who Trump is its hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaves it's hatred for his hair style it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us Oscars this massive Democrat blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave\nPlus Trump is you ... the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver bite here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I don't remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the like\nPod cast continued now listen we're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual we're all so I always says what are in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance that one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nAnd I like this for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitting he's never seen a split like this he's talking about\nDemocrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate\nHe is never seen anything like that he and I don't know how to do this and we consider it a toss up it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's telling because he hasn't got wind of what's going to happen this election and he was very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea\nWhat's going to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the talent and the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around\nAnd their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever had a split in the forecast like there's pretty unusual ... a\nOf things are on your shoulders time aren't they need to be unusual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it to predict is likelihood of a split as unusual we um you know I always say uh when we're in a beach one of his own\nAnd we're now in the eighties twenties on in both places that makes me nervous meaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous\nThat we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance that one of those two production is going to be wrong [laughter] well there is a pretty good indication of Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't\n[noise] well\nThere is a pretty good indication of Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't win a Senate or when the how he doesn't know he's nervous\nIs analysts are telling you it's

westernize their country as a millennial he's trying to reform it in certain ways letting women vote\nAnd letting women drive\nBut not much else he wants the world to think that there was massive

hundred years foreign or whatever it is we're going to run out of it unless we find a way to synthesize it which we will\nBut\nNevertheless he's the first of the ruling royal family ever talk this way to ever traveled the world and it set something up like this and this is anathema to the Muslim Brotherhood they can't stand this there's something else that the royal family is doing and I mentioned this\nWhen I was talking about who is to show me was uh Mohammed been sold on last week that as this\nUp to nine eleven and even many years after nine eleven the ruling religious\nDominance in Saudi

Saudi Government appointed newspaper editor has is\nTo ensure that nothing remotely resembling honest journalism makes it into the papers so when the Saudi ruling family hired him to run journalism it was to BP are it was to be propaganda\nTo show he did it\nHe took the money he put it in the bank and he did what the royal family wanted them to do he made a handsome living which according to Mr Bradlee here has always been his top priority\nTo\nHe had this undeserved status in the west that our caller is talking about because of the publicity surrounding his firing as editor of the Saudi daily all what town back in two thousand three\nHe was dismissed from the Saudi daily newspaper because he allowed a columnist\nTo criticize and Islamic ... thinker considered to be the founding
