five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us\nAnd when you're calling again there's Andrew but been skiing the Kim commando show man cave in oh Kim though there Andrew\nTo Scott in Charleston South Carolina called him and he said I just got back from months in Europe and Russia and we're worried about Internet Security and ice and Scott you just got back\nShouldn't have been all humane foreign your way just you know it's a little head Bob Scott [laughter] next time give us a call before you go [laughter] I mean he said yes I sure do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves to be secure\nOK so a friend of mine who lives in London maybe Gore and go okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel why fight [noise] okay and she said all of a sudden the the hard drive light like when okay\nAnd it stayed constantly illuminated for the next eight hours wonder why do you think\nThere were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese old they would not do that at all gosh God neither what the Russians what are you worried about\n[laughter] well I Would love to adopt she told you before we called but that was not an option in inside but I have a kind of a two part question number one\nWell I Would love to have the opportunity to talk to you before we called but that was not an option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one [noise] the the rumor has always been ours devices are less vulnerable and\nAndroid or PCs\nNow if you just for ... confirmed that then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] the reason why then people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple keeps to hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break an iPhone or if you want him to and basically take all the security ... and right away\nBut if you are trying to get a piece of now we're onto an Iowa device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] okay well what I did do sorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a cold do\nUs a dead set up a VPN but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the U.S should be doing in a situation like what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank can pay your credit cards and drink craze for in his and stuff like that\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I tried to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except ... obviously to pay two beers with things but um [noise] uh it was mainly just to check your email\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like that were were you a guy like well just can take the melon\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is there were several types it seemed like the VPN prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website it it's just like anything getting on the Internet period\nEnding try to do that depending upon what locked downs can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of VPN when if you look at their coverage maps and then you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to you know it's it's a it's a really\nAnd then you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course they didn't have the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic when you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is actually make a complete backup of everything\n[noise] uh so that this way if you need to restore it and then you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country or going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad uh three or six months you might be able to see it again but quite possibly a year Kaye and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to Eddie account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\nAbout the size of a sudden drop I don't know if you've ever seen the news and the some Dr has a rotating code on it even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a code on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank account so I Would try to\n... I Would encourage you to see if you can still some of that type of\nAh extra layers of protection as well and it takes time before you though because it's called we're here for you um but congratulations on a great trip but a safe return but again just spent some time and change all those passwords and listen I have to tell you haven't heard about the brand new commando ambassador ... super excited about that\nAt our commander dot com slash and Basset are you referring to your friends to the Kim commando show and they came commandos show newsletters and you can earn valuable prizes\nYou can win a dash cam a laptop\nOr a blue to speak or I mean really great prizes you do not have to be a ... member to participate we're talking about commando dot com slash and ...\nCam a laptop a Bluetooth speaker I mean really great prizes you do not have to be a ... member to bridges debate we're talking about commando dot com slash ambassador\nOr in your newsletter scroll down to the bottom you'll have a direct link to Europe particular page really excited about that the right where you are talking about the history of the cell phone now boring coming up here on the kids coming out of\nLittle America digital cameras on them\n\nHere's some exciting news as a company simply said is now valued at a billion dollars\nNot only that more than two million homes are not protected with an incredible simply say system simply say this comprehensive protection for your home with round the clock professional monitoring that would bring the police anytime there's even the slightest hint of a problem and simply say is built for the unexpected\nIt's loaded with safeguards they keep your system working even during the power and why fight outages even if a burglary matches your key bad the police will still be on their way\nAnd the system is so easy to use\nIt's incredibly intuitive it takes only minutes to set up in your home order your simply saying system now as a list or that came commando show you get free shipping and free returns\nDid not advance and we were still carrying around a lot I got to get my phone permanent could you live that far away like back in the killing me just hold it for just a fact okay so we we jump forward another decade K in the late eighties the GSM standard I remember that the mobile standards were establish world why\nWould you basically opened up the cell phone industry so it now it can begin to grow commercially so Nineteen Ninety two you know what happened in Nineteen Ninety two\nUh the first text message with and you just read that story [laughter] mom died in the first text message was sent and it was merry Christmas the one of the CEOs of Vodafone was at a Christmas Party they figure it out and they can text him and something\nThe first text messages sent and it was merry Christmas the one of the CEOs Vodafone was at a Christmas Party they figure it out and they can text him and somebody sent him the first ever text message which was merry Christmas\nAnd look wherever we heard today than videos or protect smashed season like you know ... on foreign talking ... yes our in Nineteen Ninety eight\nThe first ever piece of downloadable Khan was entering town it was a ring tone but it wasn't the best ring tone ever the best ring tone ever was a song called crazy frog\nCrazy frog how much money do you think crazy Prague made in revenue twenty million half a billion dollars you know half\nEarning millions you could you give me a phone I'll I'll tell you there's or Nineteen eighties break phone headed by that on ...

[laughter] yeah well it isn't that too yeah what it is it's a it's something good rather it seems like something revenue and so I just wanted to get the information out there that folks out because you know as you know hackers that are finding new ways to probe into your uh to access your um money\nAnd now just a few weeks ago we got a phone call from our local law I'm I'm a credit union and they know our habits anyway they they they got to I'm a I'm\nCheck that said a so called purchase that it was near Fifteen thousand dollars from the popular a sporting goods chain and um they produced we went to go see him that excellent they produce that similarly upstairs it's our check we don't use too many checks\nBut somebody was able to take our check and and there's er there's there's there's or address or routing number there's our account number the the the check never was a little bit different but there was it was like fourteen thousand dollar amounts from from this this place and I called back and say the name of the company\nYeah sure go ahead yeah it's a ... okay so I called them\nA lot that's a lot of fishing gear by the way [laughter] that was interesting and I know [laughter] All right but wait before you continue I Want to know too soon to check looked really good\nIt was it was a it was our check the only difference was that it had a different name on it [laughter] and uh\nHeck looks really good\nIt was it was a it was\nOur check the only difference was that it had a different name on it [laughter] and uh yeah so yeah we had that so when I I contacted a they they were most interested in and saying what was going on because I told her I said that if it's it's not just one [noise]\nBut I suspect that there may be some other things going on maybe it's just not only with our account but with other people's accounts as well sure and sure enough he out there it was and so they they put it all I'm a stop on it but the guy said that he had his own experience was that this was the second or third ah like\nI'm a I'm a ... a problem that he had seen and so I don't know if this was if he had any awareness starts there was something that you might be able to offer because the next day here where the credit union\nAnd and to do the fraudulent paperwork and ... kind of good stuff well the\nThe bank manager right then and there as she got some information and she says hey they just took nine hundred dollars from your checking cheese they were taste to\nIt so that the number one I'm impressed that your credit union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that a number two is that they were able to potentially pass this check through so I'm Wondering what the banks say that you could do as a precautionary means right now\n[laughter] well the only thing that we had to do is to actually shut down the the our account number and switch over to another one not the the routing number wasn't anything I'm certainly 'cause we want her to maintain um we've been there for years and they again they know our habits and that was at this kind of a defensive player\nI so I guess the big thing they can take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\n[laughter] well sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing that and I and to be honest this conference at the off guard a bit because we were right smack in the camp right smack in the middle of which is sort of house and the house we were we were right

Senate Democrats have been much less likely to cross the island vote for a Republican nominee than Republicans have been to vote for democratic nominee\nBut let me also point out that even though some of those ... sixty ... the filibuster was not used until Judge Gorsuch to change the number from sixty to fifty that put us in different quarters so the change that Senator McConnell made to rules when the Supreme Court\nReally cause us to be much more partisan in this\nInstance aren't as you guys did at first and twenty Thirteen not for the Supreme Court but for a lower court judges and we may not know hands out late I agree we go back and forth\nBe much more partisan in this so I just would have done that aren't as you guys did at first and twenty Thirteen not for the Supreme Court but for a lower court judges and we may not know hands up late I\nAgree we could go back and forth of course the Republicans blocked President Obama for putting anyone on the court of appeals to disturb us so we can go back and forth here my point is is we need to have a president who will consult with Congress the United States Senate\nBefore he makes those nominations have an open process we're considering nominees not restrict himself to the federal side I don't\nWatch it how big an issue do you think this will be in the midterms if Democrats have already been mobilized Republican sort of saying you gave him a political gift fire opposition and that this was going to energize Republican\nI think it's going to a boil down to our concerns about whether we are going to protect against we've made in health care or preexisting conditions where we're concerned about the more investigation being interfering with I think yes constitutional rights of women\nAre those issues are going to be on the ballot in mid term and judge Kavanaugh underscores those issues senator\nCardin thank you thanks for coming in always a pleasure to talk with you sir but up next Kavanaugh's confirmation as

to hear that that's has brought all of that to the forefront with the protests at the interruptions during the hearings and now with the smear campaign of judge Kavanaugh\nWell down on resistant obstruct the past two years but this has brought all of that to the forefront with the protests at the interruptions during the hearings and now\nWith the smear campaign of judge Kavanaugh holding these allegations back towards to the eleventh hour I think Republicans have woken up and said listen it's a very clear choice do we want ... resist obstruct delay\nA dysfunction in Washington and and they're also seeing the results three point seven percent unemployment for a million new jobs in this country so it's a pretty clear choice between which party is delivering and which party it's obstructed\nSome analysts say the this new energy of the wood shuttered McConnell called a political gift of the capital case will help you more in Senate races in state races statewide races\nBut it will in house races particularly in suburban districts let me put this on the screen in a recent Quinnipiac poll when voters were out the generic ballot question who do you walk in your house district\nForty nine percent said the Democratic candidate well forty two percent of the Republican so it's still plus for the Democrats is the capital a bump if there is any plane differently in house and Senate races\nIt's not it's helping across the board and house and Senate races were saying that you that generic ballot has narrowed it was double digits now it's at seven but I'm looking at every race across the country about thirty that are within the margin of various error certainly districts where Hillary Clinton won or we have Republican incumbents\nAre jobs to turn out our base first army base is completely energized right now and the Kavanaugh hearings had just highlighted how important this election is for them\nBut in the house races we also see a big gender gap and again let's go to the numbers men favor Republicans took control Congress by three points forty seven percent forty four women back the Democratic candidates to control Congress by twenty five points to be a person\nTo thirty three and won't the cabin off site where Republican sided with the male accused over the female accuser only add to the gender gap\nSided with the process and the rule of law and the presumption of innocence it had nothing to do with male versus female they said this is our standard for our country\nA doctor for did not produce any evidence that added to allegations nobody that she named at that party has backed up that story and Republicans have said we're not going to change the way we conduct the law in this country\nSuburban white women which I happened to be one of them educated women we look at that and said we agree with the process and I was at a beauty salon and right after the Kavanaugh hearings and suburban Detroit where I live in one of these battleground districts and everyone was talking about it and they agreed with it\nInstead we agree with due process and I was at a beauty salon or right after the Kavanaugh hearings in suburban Detroit where I live one of these battleground districts and everyone was talking about it and they agreed with the importance of the old\nShows that there is a gender gap\nThere and there was and twenty sixteen with women at especially college educated women I'm going to these Trump rallies I've noticed in the past three I get the demographics more women are showing up than men uh we have seen it insurgents have a new online donors it's coming from women and men I\nWe have to do I work with women but Democrats treat women a single issue voters we treat women as the whole voter they care about health care they care about the economy they recognize that for a million jobs have come back to this country they recognize\nYour twenty five years of drought twenty five point gap between how women view Democrats versus Republicans are well they're just being fooled by the Democrats and what it would all single or should be\nWell the single issue with the cabinet areas abortion rights I mean Democrats tried to mobilize women by saying\nA ... if Kavanaugh to the bench women are going to die I mean that's the type of hyperbole in rhetoric they're putting forward Susan Collins highlighted that and in their speech they want to make it about abortion rights were talking to women about the economy about health care about results that are happening that are making ...\nMaking people's lives better wages are up unemployment at a record low women our whole issue voters\nThen there is President Trump who this week went after ...\nWell you know it was one [noise] I'll do it\nDid you get home I don't remember I remember when it was all remember don't want to\n\nDo the ... Republican women\nYou know I was what the president that day it was more about the media the media was printing stories about Brett Kavanaugh and vibrant and then I was doing but he was the media was focusing on an ice fight with Brett Kavanaugh they were focusing on everything he had done it in the sixteen and Seventeen year old boy and they were not being fair\nAbout recognizing the inconsistencies in her testimony and to say yes she doesn't know where it was when it was who ... who drove for their who drove her home that is fair and why didn't the media give that the same attention that they gave to Brett Kavanaugh as they destroyed his character\nEven without the job or confirmation which is obviously a big victory for the president's ... one of the best weeks of the
