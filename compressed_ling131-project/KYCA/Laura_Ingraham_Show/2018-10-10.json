monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would\nWell my thoughts are this that public officials and and I I'm not a perfect public official but I think we all ought to set\nAn example of civility and so for a senator who say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say get in your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong a I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate but it ought to be peace hall and you shouldn't do anything\nA I Believe in freedom of association freedom of speech\nFreedom to demonstrate but it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't in Canada violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nFor surely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly\nUh I got to be a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to have respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nA and what does that mean let me see that this I'm lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes to take him out that she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and\nTelling people that are getting harassed in restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that but when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered in elevator but then you pour all Susan Collins yet people being ... screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in\nIn public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it in under what they think is the first Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection and we have but then you can't have police protection\nFor four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police\nOr you can't do that as well so our ah our I've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are\nA democracy will be a stronger\nUh are I've gone to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind you're already starting to you but are a democracy will be stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you go on called get in their face\nWell but what senator what responsibility does someone like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to uh to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things is is cornering women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers in Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome way I could do it all is gonna you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help us so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they gotta responsibilities already known so\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that undergrad there go ahead\nYou know wait a long time I think\nSenator Grassley ah the lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga of\nMany of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations\nAny thoughts to solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings pass the closer the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nFor all our bridger ... took me to\nTears called me for for not calling for a whole but but you can't you can't you know if I'd call the vote today you on that we went along we\nWe tend to tend to rely on and so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here and you know doing it and so we we waited until we had the votes\nNow now I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the ... because I set it on but I corrected myself when I hear you and you and McConnell\nBoth hindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult and I think I'm a I'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is uh\nCalled and I think ... I'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespect and I said\nOh my gosh Senator Grassley said what if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more solicited of Dr Ford I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nYeah well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because ah in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to Anita Hill and I never ask a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor [laughter]\n\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that\nI have to get you to react to this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat North Dakota undecided divide vote against Kavanaugh a lot of people have talked about whether the\nCourt remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camps and\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost junior Senate seat\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your future holds compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the U.S off whenever compromised um my true beliefs that um this person's um did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nThey're still repeating that the temperament issues Senator Grassley\n[noise] he lives and this gets back to what are already told you you got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important in\nA court in the land and he's been college or even people like Garland\nA said that he had that sort of a approach to judging and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is a temperate\nYou also leave your personal views out of out of a decision making you look at the law and look at the uh uh get facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by\nSo consequently uh ... what what she said\nThe uh uh get facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by so consequently a ... it was what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nAh the is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record\nOf comments on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech\nHigh tech lynching or something like ...\nYeah so so uh you know after twenty eight years of listening to the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great prestige and knowledge\nAnd academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest court\n... court and it's all positive\nNo it's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court a Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins situation and Main course all these leftist billionaires promising to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins I Know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that but ah conservatives even though a lot of times they disagree with Susan Collins they gotta look at her as a senator of great principal\nAnd we need to respect that\nAnd I said three million it's going to take a lot more than three million elector but they raised ... million against or so our goal is three million dollars right now and everybody that really ought to respect

now around sixty four sixty five miles an hour in the Panama City Panama City beach area these one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds are in the Iowa poll or not the entire storm\nA I I'm not trying

twenty miles depending on the size of the eye wall now from their it'll fall off nothing nothing uh [laughter] I mean a hundred and twenty five is no slouch\nIf you think that you've experienced

miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it\nThe further you get from me I Am depending on the structure the the more the wind speed decreases the
