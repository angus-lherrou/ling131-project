you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as a ... a Catholic migration refugees services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as he's contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers have emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way\nApart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that's their ticket in if you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're

I voted for Trump ... Trump voter and America First and most historic cents and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question your\n... how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty and the woman on a fair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudi side yeah the ... the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back\nOn harmed and we said screw you you know where your benefactor on spy on us and like I said yes we do and we're gonna continue to spy 'cause we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd a particular when Democrats or the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that he was either all Nineteen or white\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that either it was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F Buckley junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up\nAnd I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it ever doing anything I Want\nI don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia or you are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind live\nI said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi up the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's what I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was anti McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the line shake case\nAnd it was Andy who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out none of us is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right this\nIs exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he told me was so when you didn't realize that the Saudi royal family is\nIn charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites are in their mecca and Medina Monday and\nI found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nEssentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam while in Saudi Arabia\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam while in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islamic comes from ... for knows you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\nWhy hobby Islam is where and be really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into their into mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers\nTerrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi\nRoyal family stood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating it don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby isn't\nAnd that's what I mean went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve mind\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent\nOn the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out he wants other people investing other industries individuals' investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated to dollars or federal dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is me\nI don't know what word abandonment or and me are distancing from our habits of\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... if they all\n\nLeave branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family [noise]\nCannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still the branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show me again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca diner they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring and I don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith a deposition muggy\nThis has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wondered well who determines but these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different why they've got kids with every one of their wives saw Saudi king could have twenty sons\nHow does he determine which one's the crown prince how does he determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines\nThe when the into the crown prince the heirs and in what\nOrder\nThen saw him on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current\nKing Solomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it the widow if it's true or not the royal family is\nHaving a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as clown friends now many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his sons is going to be the next king but it's not the case\nSo all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cab you got all these plans for reform\nHaven't been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of ... Marcus show in Turkey which is also very unhappy with Saudi Arabia\nBecause the\nClimate roast turkey ... Recep Tayyip aired awhile he is not one of these guys that wants to western influence as we look I'm way long haired have to take a break but that's the answer\nPlace in so many ways Raasch\nNot one of these guys that wants western influence as I mean look I'm away long hair to have to take a break but that's the answer\nTo your waist in so many ways ... work", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott", "day": "19"}
