said if you think the X. box duct tape here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy [laughter] it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids came over for dinner throwing ... get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars sounds like that's a lot more than I was expecting right\nThey automatically added on twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery\nFee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you\n... yeah and you know ... isn't it tore us for that and also overeat because they'll say like\nPrice things search okay and so they add another\nFive dollars if you order or something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever maybe\nBut maybe it's like\nBeing a server at one point in my

was like a hundred and fifty\nDollars to go to things yeah I had the evidence broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it [laughter] and some to shake okay\nAnd the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars pay and so so ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave him an\nExtra four or five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this works [laughter] otherwise the opposite are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't included\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay it's good and they charged him square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that total thinking about this if they can get the total amount\nBy five dollars I Would think that ... dollar is no no no you pay the whole transaction\nThis if they can get the total amount up\nBy five dollars I Would think the ... billion dollar is no no no you pay the whole transaction that into what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then you have to pay a fee\nFor them collecting the money and doing things like that and he joined chambers I'm On I'm going to happen well I'll just hard it is hard and\nYou know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there was maybe about uh the I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin folding chairs ten percent I'm just a bit of having an African images use the cash that you're expecting me to enjoy my ... something like that\nAll right let me tell you something over the years epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical apps an ego tank forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner of loved his front as my partner choice\nOr for a couple of reasons well first of all it's cartridge free don't you hate buying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway gold but no it's colored IQ\nBut the ask an ego tank forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with up to two years of AIG riding the box up enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages that the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that's now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that she had to do the math that it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printers ain't tank and that can\nThey go take a Compaq space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot com slash eco tank can that each CEO G.

that number's one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four\nAnd before we get back to all of your phone calls they show the more interesting item that crossed my desk and screen that you just need to know about first of which\nIt's one of these ideas that popped up and I'm telling ya I should have thought of this is a product\nThat if I ever wanted to create a product it satisfy that need it's private it secure I think it's too pricey right now but let me tell you a little bit about it [noise] the idea of a whole personal email server it kinda got a bad rap with Hillary Clinton and her emails and that whole fiasco\nBut the whole idea is that your email is safe it's not handled in the cloud you actually have a physical drive now setting up an email to ... to me and calling and the nerds calling them again when you need to change up some settings and calling them again what had just died because it would happen\nBut there's a new product called helm\nAnd your emails no longer floating in the cloud somewhere and since actually physically in your home that survivor like I mentioned expense of five hundred bucks to buy the size of a book\nAnd has a hundred and twenty a gigs in storage or trade can go to five terabytes there is no fan passively clued cold rather um it has a security camera physical key because all the emails encrypted so it's not just five hundred bucks and there was a hundred dollar a year a subscription fee\nAnd if you think about it this way there's other downsides and one of them primarily is that you're not going to have all the latest features and Gmail and auto complete ten you know taboo auto it's going to fill out all the sensors for you but at the product that does have a niche uh does have a need\nAnd when the price come down and I think it's probably worth all taken a look at\nAnd other new products we're talking about smart home technology yes was swift difficulty\nAnd when the price come down and I think it's probably worth

nice place to live doesn't it doesn't really horrible play I live in spring grows right next to\nGarbage town Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas and she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless confuse immoral and she has it for ...\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to use the rise towers and she's like oh well they use all the same stuff was going to be all the same kind of action and then she went what if it is whatever the word\nI Wonder if it's worse I mean to call them and it's so frustrating\nThough isn't it I mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right\nNow is a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial here and I know I think I missed it by you know you're right on the U.S is that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't have say a fiber optic connection\nI mean that is now required by it's like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and a fiber connection so then this way you don't have to worry about what's going on so I don't care and you don't have all bars in all places so that's what I'm hearing\nThat is correct and there's no way that you want to move to the big city or no no we're going to stay right here okay it's all\nBut then when you complained of arise and what did they say\n[noise] um\nThey really can't get many answer I've been I've been within twenty twelve but the past month is just so slow here\nThat the Internet's almost have less on looking at switching to Comcast for my Internet and income can't say well we also have noble and so I thought well that might be a great stone service but\nI'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same price and towers and would switch between ... hours and Comcast hotspot [noise]\nNo I don't know how you I I don't I don't know if I'd Lincoln switching between the hot spots\nI think ours and Comcast hot [noise]\nNo I don't know I like I I don't I don't know if I'd Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise] you you know what you okay ... you know what you could possibly get and I don't know of arise and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you can get it for free\nIs that you may be able to get a little what's called a ... for your house\nAnd so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went and I don't know about the Comcast is that\nIf Comcast is using other than to sell to increase your reception and you're in bars I don't know if I like that either\nUm so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that will repeat the signal from the power that you have nearest may so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers that even though like for rising at AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often used different frequencies in technology so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay huh um and they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe uh the towers and they don't have to carry that debt and they can make more money so the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with a day you know\nWhich frequency is Comcast on a tower and how does that compare a variety so that there's nothing you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know the bad hits should be different enough that one service might be better\nAnd I and Comcast senses of cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon and the hope on the horizon is five gee and it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on poor gee you're talking about\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee and it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on poor gee you're talking about one gig in bed or per second speed versus\nOn five gee you're talking about multiple ... and so you know couple of solutions that she might want to try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have a real real close to ... from afraid of odd [laughter] I Know that we know but um [noise] that I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage may very right could be you know he cares where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain Comcast what the problem is have Comcast you turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works\nExplain to them I don't want to sign up for a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or she would I'm getting\nAnd you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now and they'll do anything to keep current customers to get a customer so that he might have to escalate it's a little bit up higher but it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation and Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on [noise]\nAre you doing I'm looking for an app that I can secure Lisa I'm among to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car

a busy exceptional pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirties and\nWell then charged two point nine percent as far as to make the wire transfer a busy exceptional pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty cents\nBut if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it

get the hobby started thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to that right yeah so I'm sort of like\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome Adil\n... then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things now this is where it gets confusing is that you've gotten the wave and ... and those are different standards\nA home and that works with the smartest things next to the uh everything works like um I have a a train air

[noise]\nI think the Saudis are an authoritarian government and they they are directly from the top down\nAnd you don't have people just going off and doing things on their own and I feel certain that the crown prince was involved and then he directed this and that's why I think we cannot continue to have relations with him and so I think he's going to have to be replaced frankly but I think that sanctions don't go far enough and I think we need to look at the arms sale because this is not just about\nSaudi Arabia is a partner at their ally against Iran and against missiles and against what they're doing trying to take over the middle east\n[noise] President Trump's standing by our alliance with Saudi Arabia that now faces a tough task going forward\nAnd it started out for our Sunday group former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich Charles Lane from the Washington Post former Democratic congresswoman Jane Harman director of the Woodrow Wilson center and Marc Short for her director of legislative affairs for President Trump Speaker Gingrich\nWhat do you make of the Saudi account of what happened to them all ... who was responsible and how severely do you think we should\nThe ... first of all their their explanation insulted me stupid\nI mean the idea that this guy walked in the room with Fifteen security people not in a fight and it was actually killed when that happened to have a parent and really they did is remember him and get rid of him that happened to me they're stupid so why is the president saying it's credible the president is trying to walk a tightrope\nBetween I think it's a big problem not a small one on one\nMe that if she just stupid so why is the president saying it's credible president is trying to walk a tightrope\nBetween I think it's a big problem not a small one\nOn one hand you know you don't want to break the alliance with a shortage on the other hand you cannot teach for thirty three year old crown prince can get away with things in a new show radiation is stupid or he will be out of control for the next forty years or did you do I think I my guess is going to get to select sanctions\nAnd they're going to be very clear about and I also think that I'm guessing but my guess is a ... pretty aggressively\nBecause you've got to come up with a trunk this isn't just the sharks shortage to why this stupidly\nSecretary of state Pompeo met with the Saudi crown prince this way it can sort of criticism for appearing overly friendly in such a serious situation here's what Pompeo said when he returned to Washington to\nTry to get to board first of all the member to where I Belong to so I think thirty two over long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nBombed us with an arm and I want to address exactly the dilemma ... said that Speaker Gingrich was talking about on the one hand what apparently ... is unacceptable on the other hand we do how strategic interests with Saudi Arabia how do we balance all that\nWell our foreign policy is based on values and interests uh values that we have our rule of law and free press interests that we have\nHaving Saudi Arabia is an ally against a\nA Iran's malign behavior among other things and maybe helping that Jared Kushner with his two state solution which doesn't seem to be going to fire between Israel and Palestine but at any rate murder I totally agree with Newt a murderer and uh this reckless war in Yemen or not there are values or our\nInterests and I think that that in addition the sanctions that would be good to talk to the king\nMoving a little ... on M. B. S. sideways car while and putting a an adult\nCharges Saudi Arabia such as well how to deny F the intelligence chief who was widely admired now his under house arrest because NBS his decision or even the Adel al Jabari that foreign minister used to be the ambassador here again highly regarded and various thank God\nI mean you have a much better sense of this what I Do think that the president were to go to the king and say that or to the ruling family to say that that we have a boat we we can apply pressure\nI don't think we have another thing yes I think we can and\nI Do think that the president were to go to the king and say that or to the ruling family is that that we have a boat we we can apply pressure\nI don't think we had another thing yes I think we can apply pressure and it is also true obviously it there a major financial transactions pending not just with aerospace firms but also with high tech firms I think the modernization program and I actually think how'd you agree with that\nWhen you're going in the right direction it was the access that are the railing at and I think the Arabian want me to a modern future so they they do a course correction here\nMark let's talk about the realities in Congress that used to be your job but uh until very recently as the legislative affairs director for President Trump\nAs we were discussing with Rand Paul he came within four votes last year a blocking an arms sale to the ... what do you think are the prospects for any future arms sales in the foreseeable future and how do you think\nCongress because a lot of Republicans are talking top on those two how tough forgiven prepared to get with a ...\nI think the prospects for any future sales are quite than by actually think the prospects are greater than perhaps at our policies indicating that Congress would actually take proactive steps to unwind the most recent uh arms deal\nI think very little that transactions gone through I think you could see moving by Congress to move forward particularly if there's a vacuum from the administration responding quickly in responding to sort of early so I think actually the risk there is actually much more significant than Senator Paul was saying is what Congress can do in the near term and what about other sanctions\nThink that's a thing go together crass because of the administration steps forward it take sanctions that are lower the pressure on Congress to act ... doesn't do that that I think you'll see of a vacuum in which Congress step forward and looks to move more quickly perhaps even as soon as the has the lame duck session\nChuck this is personal for you because ... was a colleague of beers at the Washington Post your reaction to the Saudi account and to President Trump's seeming acceptance of that Saudi account so far\nLet's take the Saudis account first it reminds me of that famous phrase from Watergate to modify limited and hang\nAll this is what you do when you've been caught your covers been blown and there's really no denying it anymore she was a little bit of the truth out where you try to reshape a more plausible cover story remember they had been saying that you're going to show the\nLeft that consulate alive than their previous view of the matter so the the story is because the speech\nAnd saying that you're going to show the left that consulate alive that had been their\nPrevious view of the matter so the the story is because the speaker and everyone else here said is is not a credible story it's they're desperate attempt to preserve the crown prince and his position and by the way they are even willing to sacrifice apparently some fairly senior officials that leads to the\nExtent of scapegoating them and then firing them\nBut the trouble with President Trump's reaction to this so far from my point of view has been a dog but it's taken him a long time to declare that this was the evil and stupid his first reaction was something like well you know it's not an American citizen and it's not on our soil\nAnd that was probably consistent with some things he said in the campaign about how you know we as Americans we kill a lot of people and so on he's got a lot he's dug himself a de Paul I'm afraid on that point and I don't think he's all the way out of it yet\nSmart I agree with what the Carson was saying before that there's there's a lot here they are trying to balance I think the president trying to give them a little bit of a the president came out of the Washington Post and said he does not believe they count as to what they've said\nA was a result of a fist fight he's acknowledged that incredible the of that but I Do think as well\nThat there's a lot that they're trying to balance here the the Iran funding Hamas and Hezbollah is killing west shares continually throughout the middle east and Saudi Arabia is our ally that is a challenge that we need to navigate the administration needs to step forward they need any more aggressive wells Congress will act I\nDo believe that I Want to bring the congresswoman in Iran that because I thought what what Senator Paul so it was very interesting which is that we over\nEstimate the importance of Saudi Arabia an underestimate our leverage over them that if they if we buy oil from them they sell the oil to us and as he pointed out are there airports is completely a a ... based on American planes if we held up a weapon and spare parts they'd be grounded in the months\nThe ... war in Yemen which is the largest humanitarian catastrophe on a planet right now I ... in capacity signing force a despite our weapons which they had paid out for and so I Do think we have labyrinth shop I wanted to say though that ... however\nHis name is pronounced but to be a journalist a scholar at the Wilson Center highly regarded in town and the irony of all of this and that he was writing about the modernization program in a positive way he was critical of and the egg creme ... extreme behavior but positive about the crime and and they need people\nAbout the modernization program in a positive way who is critical of MBNA green extreme behavior but positive about the program and they knew people I can uh two o'clock in the direction they're going in and they need the United states final thought\nThe Russians trying to kill to people in Britain we joined with Britain we put in selecting sanctions or pretty severe [noise]\nUh I think just challenging the principle that people can't go around the world killing people good thing the president's going to have to find a way to have a big enough hammer the dish selecting unreal\nHow the people can relax and say we're going we're getting the right signal through to them for the Congress will react with even bigger and work in a way that could really damaged the relationship\nOr a penalty will uh will see a little bit later in the program up next we're going to take a look at one of the closest Senate races in the country the battle for the open seat in Arizona\nWe'll talk with Republican candidate congresswoman Martha ... about the issues that are contests including cyber power of and that

sense that's what it's going to be\nPresident Trump now into his final mid term election blitz trying to fire up his base up or what he thinks a hot button issues and we're back now with a paddle alright Speaker Gingrich what do you think of the president's strategy in these final weeks\nBefore the election the issues that he's setting and the prettiest right even if they get there but you know he's been on the campaign trail saying when you go to the voting booth\nPretend act as if I'm On the ballot\nWell normally I Would say that's not a good idea but I think in this environment with this president\nIt's the only the only way you can campaign a means you need a bigger force is a bigger presence\nAnd the truth is he is mobilizing his base and he's giving them orange when I mean when they say look this is jobs versus mobs they're forty million people who pick up a coffee the next morning use it when he says this is about kind of an on the campaign and the caravans forty million people will pick it up the next ...\nSo what you're saying is it's going to be in this election is going to be nationalized because of Donald Trump whether he says it they're\nGoing to try to hide the truth is from election two thousand sixteen on this country has been in a national fight over who's going to run the country and I think that the Kavanaugh event was really historically important because both galvanized the right but also\nReminded everyone this is a team sport\nYou know you detest is not a moderate touches going to vote for humor and you are right down the list of every registered Democrat and then get up and say\nIt reminded everyone this is a team sport\nYou know you need to test is not a modern tensions going to vote for humor and you write down the list of every registered Democrat and then get up and say I'm really different the only question of desk was pushing them\nA new Fox poll this week ask voters water their top issue is what are they most concerned about here are the top results health care at fifty eight percent then the economy with fifty for\nPresident Trump with fifty one and an immigration and Supreme Court nomination is tied at forty six percent these are the top issue is extremely important to your belt truck\nLooking at that issue said which party do you think benefits most\nAh I'm In a cop out and say both but I have an explanation\nVery interesting if you differentiated within each issue how the parties view them some Republican voters would put immigration way at the top democratic voters would put health care way at the top\nTo see a lot of messaging all over the country on this issue of pre existing conditions you had that discussion with Martha McSally Democrats will understand eighty percent even Republicans favor protection of pre existing conditions\nThey've got uh some elements to work with on that so they're pushing very hard to get out their base this caravan I almost think that Trump's campaign paid for the caravan\nAdjusted the Democrats did and I I I'm just kidding but it's been a windfall getting two weeks before they already it's a windfall\nFor him he's now incorporated in his campaign bottom line here is that both parties have settled on strategy of these mobile I fish and\n[noise] and they're using these issues that are hottest with air bases [noise] she's\nLike well let's talk about the camera ban which is headed from Honduras and Guatemala and now a lot of dumb thousands of them on a bridge literally on a river\nBetween Guatemala and Mexico and President Trump is trying to use that issue to fire up the base bought at according to the latest box full immigration not clear winner for Republicans when asked to slightly different issue what should happen to illegal immigrants now working\nIn the U.S twenty two percent said deport as many as possible Seventy percent safe set up a system for them to become legal so mark\nWrit large how does the immigration issue play in the ... in this campaign I think it's a huge a winning issue for the president and the Americans want border security team to that last question the president offered a path\nImmigration issue plays in loose\nIn this camp and I think it's a huge a winning issue for the president and the Americans want for securities seemed to that last question the president offered a pathway to citizenship for the DACA participants always asking for Democrats to come to the table and more security issues\nAnd so I think because of the here's when issue for the for the ... what about family separation which was an explosion what an opposite sure it's an explosion but it's also a ball to this point Democrat administrations as well because Congress has not passed laws that enabled administration to actually have the tools to handle the situation\nIn your hands are tied because either just up the family's annual out in it for you allow them to go free in the United states because the law says within Twenty one days of families have to be adjudicated and of course you're not able to do to came that quickly Congress one\nYeah well first Abigail Adams and remembered the women on your list of priorities women are out there and force and women are on the ballot in almost fifty percent of the house race in the Seventeen percent of the Senate races\nAnd in Arizona two women aren't are a a a competing for senator and I think that this cabinet thing for me is the will of the base but it also will generate huge numbers of women I was elected in Nineteen Ninety two tier the woman\nRepublican women voted for me in a lean Republican district became Republicans for harm and and that's how I Survived in Nineteen Ninety four when it became the speaker uh and now we're friends go figure but my point is that\nI don't know if you saw that he comes to the point of view\nOn on the caravan my pants and John Kelly when he was in the department of homeland security secretary\nHad a better idea they had a summit in Miami in June of twenty Seventeen and the point of it was to provide help to ah governments in Central America to combat corruption and to provide for business investment uh Mexico which part of that conference\nAnd if they had the politics of this caravan coming to a new president saying I'm going to send us troops to the border and shut down the block\nIt's red meat to his base but I think thoughtful people much for for George W Bush's approach to comprehensive immigration reform I support it yeah I Know it failed and I we that's what we need to get back to is\nSupporting failing government so that they can keep their people they're stopping the push factor and then also doing comprehensive and where\nWould you agree that this ... going up and lots of just say right now due to the Republicans nor the Democrats at anything to do with it is a political plots for President Trump tried to mobilize his base\nThink and mobilize his base\nIt's up to say right now due to the Republicans nor the Democrats at anything to do with it is a political plots for President Trump tried to mobilize his base\nI think and mobilize his his base I think it's a human tragedy and a whole bunch of other people will be repelled by the fact that he thinks that is good politics and doesn't worry about the human rights issues involved speaker", "show_name":
