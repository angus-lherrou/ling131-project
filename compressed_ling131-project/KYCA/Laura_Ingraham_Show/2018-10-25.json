...\n... if she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's code a mindset in the\nSpirit of North Dakota which is one of hearty courageous a mouse still still has that frontier feeling that it's not very populist um state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people do that and I some she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him\nJust general fairness in the cabin ideal just wasn't fair and I think most people do that and I and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just pulled up with the cabinet thing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing cabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation that Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a progress report then she didn't believe\nHim but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing you know with the sound turned often noticed his demeanor you know it's just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota's lord that the independent spirit that the ...\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nI think again people have been well exposed during the Trump era\nMedia have had a ... mirror um\nI think raised up to their bias and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide frenzy and fury and upset and and that is left always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh uh we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump critics but people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with me get one thing and that's okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for\nThe theory there um and I and the leftist they're never satisfied with me get one thing and that's okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than a one lesson that you\nYou know assuming un which looks like you're going to um congressman in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about\nAbout this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy [noise]\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is let's return to a respect for states\n... you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states at places like California\nNorth Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up\nOkay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but\nI I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what ... what do you have a cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find a federal government is far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time by your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is much please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of his leads before we create something different than than the reality that that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior and what contribution that any we make to this\nThis course that's going on this lack of civility in a without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nNow it's a great way and I'm putting it um and we really wish you the very best in this election coming up on November sex Kevin Cramer I think it'd be the next senator from the great state of North Dakota I think North Dakota is the only state in the whole country I haven't been to congressman I got it\nBut we do I love to give me that opportunity perhaps for celebration or maybe in January or February\nOutright that'll be are dominated middle of winter\nAnd visited if you've ever visited in January now no no I got to come you know what I like some ground for pheasant

mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously that first caller mentioned what I was going to one of the Congress healthcare making the fact that there wasn't enough postage on at the post office he even accept it um the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages\nSo you're obviously not taking them again and paying for them you know having them weight and paid in profits properly um you're ... if you'd have to stick the post office box right across the boxes don't even have enough room to slip an oversized package into\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution center that makes sense I I I get I get that but some of them actually did show up at the residents so\nYou're going to think that\nOkay what what are you suggesting that and what are you suggesting hampered\n... I think our plant I'm Sorry that I just I mean you know workers are trained to look for things well that'd be the Cuban looking packages cheesy if you're a joke and it looks like a joke anybody can see that there's something in there and if you look at their address too don't you think that after going through it\nNow wait a minute see this I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought this up I I wouldn't want now I haven't been\nHi Raj Shah ordeal I'm good\nWanted to go up on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government itself but also give more than any other nation and the point is that\nI Am the choice when I get to charity I gave it\nAlso get more than any other day and [noise] and the point is that\nI Am the choice when I get to charity I gave it to I don't have the right now my neighbor who they should give it to see what the government do it they're telling us\nWho they're going to basically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give us a choice and that's my point [noise]\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting to the soundbites we play them John Case there was a ringing in his hands guilt over the fact the caravan is coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nAnd it because we're not in it but couldn't be Anna except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls because God doesn't want that\nAnd we've got to realize that that was just plain lucky it's kinda like written Richard got part out winners of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one day and then we got conceived in a moment in America and we've got more into America and and man that's that's so much luck that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special about so the fact that we weren't conceived in warms down in Nicaragua Guatemala means that\nWe all we really do when we gotta we gotta learn to walk in the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it we nobody has any trouble imagining what it's like to be poor\nThat's why so many people striving not to be governor it isn't hard to imagine we don't have a lot of people in fact uh most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income\nOr people that are in a lot of money and lose in all their people and burning the average amount of money on their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never they've never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world the United states poverty is not really poverty I get in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nUh statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say all\nOh that could be me and then run around feeling guilty about it\nBut but the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say all\nOh that could be me and in the run around and feeling guilty about it\nUm\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining well you know one accident and I could have been in that care of and and then having that impact\nThe way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism it never solves anything\n[noise] liberalism as a\nGutless choice because she had never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAnd all you have to do is tell people how much pain you are seeing and how it makes you so one comfortable it to someone fear look at the suffering and the starvation and its citizens\nAnd you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything all you've done to say\nThat you recognize and they're telling everybody else they've got to do something about it\nAnd as liberalism solutions are\nWhere the answer is and solutions to these problems are exactly why they have been happening in the United states for the past two years\nSolutions\nBy the way before we go to the break I just want to remind all of you again for those who are just joining us or maybe we're not here in the first half hour drive by media as part and parcel of the of the explosive device story they have a narrative going that\nThis whole bomb business has really dampen your Republican enthusiasm to show up and vote your really\nIs like overnight that Dr ... have been able to detect that Republican vote turnout enthusiasm is really really been tamped down because of this I just think you should know that's what they're saying\nAnd I think I Know why they're saying they're saying it because they're not
