Washington he can do that [noise]\nWhy tuning into any [noise] Washington based media and from day to day\nYou you can see what the a narrative the top narratives are at a soap opera scripted the day seems today at one of the overriding concerns among the drive by the president's relationship with Rod Rosenstein\n\nThe debate today centers on whether or not Rosenstein was kidding or not in a meeting with other FBI officials when he suggested in wearing a wire the next time you wouldn't talk to the president\nWhat compounding this or confusing to people is that Trump is not fire Rosenstein in fact had Rosenstein up to the White House and then they had him on air force one flew him around them got off the airplane with him so they have a good working relationship\nThe president still will not be classified documents that Devon known us and a number of other people want the classified which would answer a whole bunch of questions about the soft coup and who really started it and when and where and all of that\nThe presidents and I talked to Rosenstein and frankly told Fox News today in the morning on a phone I've I I don't understand why\nWho really started it and when and where and all of that\nAnd the president said I talked to Rosenstein and frankly told Fox News today in the morning on the phone I I don't understand why he won't tell people I had a great

this or how to deal with trust the Trump knows what he's doing here that's all I can tell you\nDon't fall for the fact that Rosenstein is playing Trump trust the fact that Trump knows what he's doing

been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family\nBecause it is open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul and

Fifteen\nMan menacing type guys from Saudi Arabia arrive on the same day they are seen entering the same soul a Saudi consulate or embassy they are seen leaving a few hours after they arrive\nJamal could show he has not been seen since the theory is that he was killed and murdered and be headed in disfigured dismembered and taken out of there in various diplomatic pouches and will never be seen again\nThis is why the president and others are being urged to get involved to find out what happened because we have an allied relationship with the Saudis and we cannot tolerate this if this is how the Saudis are going to treat their journalists\nNow the relationship we have a Saudi Arabia always has been very little leverage they've got an oil we didn't have as much as we needed we needed to buy theirs we needed them to stay friends we needed them to have a\nA open ended the relationship with us as such we treated them with kid gloves we protected them they left the sub build a base\nA air force base we protected them it was kind of a mutual back scratch\nA relationship but now it's changed because we don't need Saudi oil we have become the largest producer thanks to fracking of fossil fuels in the world and we have reserves that go beyond what even the Saudis have not been widely reported but it's true\nAnd so the pressure is now on to not couch out to the Saudis to find out what happened here to this journalist your mouth to show me\n[noise] and if in fact he ends up having been murdered and dismembered and men and disposed of in various diplomatic pouches\nIt would not

I remember about passion I remember I had it I still do that's the great thing\nA lot of people outgrow it a lot of people out of it\nWhen they when they don't see as much success as they envision when they don't see it happening as quickly or some people it's not that they give up they they just lose some of the pack don't lose the passion\nExactly who not only the passion as you continue to do this\nI Will not I'm so fired up and I just got left kind of gave me the more people like him to come out I feel so bad for him like I've experienced that sort of like um attack anything like oh I'm Republican around conservative I Can't imagine what it's like for him I think he's doing an amazing thing\nAnd I think this is a really pivotal time and I think I have hope that the less it just losing it and the unraveling and\nI have hope for my generation I think\nI'm so enthused the here that I I uh you're you are the second is maybe the third\nMillennial age color today with the same belief that that that what you're watching on on the left or something and I'm rebel if you're watching them come on glued and I I Hope you're right I I\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede\nRemember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump in one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nMedium became Trump didn't window washing stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nThis story New York magazine they think they're doing an edible here they think they're really appraising Obama's they are admitting that there was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome\nEnded up happening to the benefit of Hillary Clinton [noise] somebody some of the story over the Robert Mueller he may not find out about this\nHuh\nHere's Christine in Asheville North Carolina as we head back to the phones it's a delight to have you here Christine Hi\nHigh rise that the ... or [noise] I just wanted to um represent generation X. generation that no one talked about and I can speak for myself\nAnd hang on just a second Christine hang on just that some people don't know Generation Next generation ... what give us a date range you know I'm not asking you your age I'm ... [laughter] ... well\nWe were we were young adults in the nineties so I'm In my mid forties\nOkay All right fine so your job and your next step up from ... yes and my entire\nAdult working life has been in an economy in decline and not only have you\nKnow which has been a real pleasure you've I've listened to you for many years\nBut Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been in the public eye and in particular and and my generation my whole life\nShe you know I remember Hillary as first lady and working on health care and and to see this attack from the last\nUm concerning Donald Trump and his finances and as someone who is the in my country get poorer we don't have any money\nBut people who do have any I'm ready to play the where did you get your money from game especially concerning our Senate and Congress I find it hypocritical an unbelievable that these people who are completely there just have no self awareness\nWould be you know hounding Trump going after Trump for my part of it I Do not plan on abandoning my president it is the first time in my adult life that I Am in an economy that is\nAfter ... from my part of it I Do not plan on abandoning my president it is the first time in my adult life\nThat I Am in an economy that is growing I was just old enough and walking out into the workforce when NAFTA was really taking hold and the and and companies were leaving leaving leaving leaving not coming back\nAnd the Mike you say and I could not agree with you more the wife has nothing to run on but for my generation to generation who won't have Social Security is gonna bomb out we're broke were ten trillion dollars and that's when I hear\nA left is talking about uh all of these things that they want to pay for you know Medicare for all it's a it's a lovely idea but we don't have any\nMoney right there isn't any\nChristine you're making a really important point that I don't want to gloss over I Want to return back\nTo be a primary point you made that you are in your mid forties I'm from the first time in your life you are living through a growing\nPositive economy that prior to now your entire life has been lived in a either a flat line or a shrinking economy\nIt's hard and you know let's not forget something for most of that time in the last eight years prior to Trump people like you were also told that this was as good as it going get that you had to work and acknowledge that there was a new normal now and that America's\nGreat days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and ended this this was a morning like the way it's going to be now\nSo you were also told not only were you in a flat lining economy you were told don't have any lofty expectations here\nRight ... exactly how high outlet to jump forward to this growing economy my next question are you actually there is no wrong answer here it's not a trick\nAre you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living it and experiencing it are only are you aware of it because he was the economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI Am in a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate economy so I'm aware of it via information but I can I can feel\nI own separate economy so I'm aware of it the ah\nInformation but I can I can feel it I can sense that I can I'm I Know that is true that it said that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life and\nAnd I literally feel like the finances in America there's been a stranglehold on it as a depletion of it I mean I'm old enough to remember\nSitting around the table and my parents saying you have to finish your dinner there's children starving in China when I was growing up everyone knew that China was a core poor poor poor place\nAnd has done in a span and just the Reno Twenty years\nIt's boomed am I happy for the for the people of China absolutely we don't want to see anyone in the world struggling and and and not have what they need to survive but on the other side of it\nIt's because of poor management on a on our government that has a lead to all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you've talked about the opioid epidemic and and and all of these you know these the fruits the fruits of having no work\nWhich he used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other problems\nExactly right but the point is you're you're you're living economy you're you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it\nWell I Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because you know people want to act like oh well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later\nOh hey real skill all that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that as\nA whole other subject watery lottery winners at all what becomes of um [noise]\nYou're absolutely right I'm just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living it you're experiencing it but it's real did you that it's not just the results of me or people like me telling you that things are good that matters\nJust one thing my mom also told me Christie to eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China but I was a smarter\nMy mom also told me Christine they eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China but I was a smart F I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every example of parental discipline I could\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing I said mom you're telling me but if I eat everything on my plate a bunch of people in China arguably rubbing their stomachs and say boy it feels good to be full\nAnd she called me a smart alec and told me the stops asking her but she never told me that China starving story again [noise]\nRussian leaky I work\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a data of six and
