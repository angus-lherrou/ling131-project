he wants their grandparents\nTo be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication from\nAn interesting question yeah that is because it's still so Eric you want the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yeah that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say so it was just an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] no we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home for

know\n... and so forth and\nYeah I Would take out all the all the men of data and the E. X. I. F. data and you're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure uh because a lot of people don't realize that if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about it though if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pull it down is that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera and cetera\nAre just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you out of school photos number one\nOr you put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shutter fly okay\nShut are flying will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it or say once a week or once a month and so they can start seeing and then in addition to that and you get a record of them going\nTo see it as well [noise] okay uh so just had orders shuttered fly and then sign up for an account and again there's going to be some options when\nYou do this that you really looking for your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access\nSome options when you do this that you really looking for your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access\nThose photos and again uh aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics to with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of the race that stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors that there are works to relieve their works relief\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps and your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their or works relieved\nFast acting phone get their or works relieve today it's into the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their worst relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone call I got to tell you about of phone scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams are claiming to be from Amazon are totally on the rise\nIn here is how the scam works and listen up you get a voice mail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour or two maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month and catfish you're working from home\nUsually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website Web store jobs you name it but here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment cat and then once you make the payment poof\nScammers got all your money your dream of\nA telecommuting and earning cash and your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning belt and if you are looking for a legitimate way to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor\nA virtual ... tips or maybe you want to even watch TV and take surveys yet you can make money doing that\nLook no further than the official home page I became commando show which is of course ...

before we go back to all of your fantastic phone calls this show or the more interesting items that car across my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning week pass for that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats and routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the\nSmart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack passwords for example many routers and Web cams I have a default admin password like admitting her past her and so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMe to get something strong that the cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers who's cameras All right so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nTo that week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is that look to those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China\nSo the new law is going to require manufacturers just said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure and plays it forces the user to change the past hurt I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean\nBut how effective is really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones or because they had a major security breach\nAll right Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew of new pixel

there's Andrew ... and the ... come into show ... gay but before we talk about the call Josh\nThat are coming in here and third our this this weekend show\nI\nAm still wearing my apple watch no you might recall it was probably what was it eight or nine months ago when I was really excited about having an apple watch I mean you've got folks rewrite I had a serious threat\nAnd you know both you and Mike or like my brother's right okay so you've seen me embrace technology and throw it away\nOver the years so I was really super excited about having an apple watch\nAnd the first time I ward YouTube took ...\nHow long were you where are we had the over under going yeah yeah okay and so ... that that I think it was two and a half we are trying to quit [laughter] and and then after two weeks that would be like I don't need that it was stupid thing and so I took me under that you would\nWas that bad I think it was two and a half we'd have like two weeks [laughter] and and then after two weeks that would be like ride out in that I was dipping and right so I took me under that you would not last two weeks which would be you know two shows right to Kim commander shows and you'll be\nYou'll be to buy a mile I think the war and maybe seven eight shows in a row and then it does appear\nMinute tapered off a little bit right okay\nUm because what was happening is that I was getting like too much like like what am I stepped [noise]\nOne is my ... pm you know 'cause I can be a little obsessive compulsive what little OCD who ... who and who wouldn't dare say that about I mean we were just upstairs and I am a ... I'm a little hungry sure and so we went up to the break room and what did I Do Michael's\nHere for the pizza but are you I thought you were a guy thought holy cow Kim there's going to eat pizza [laughter] and I was going to be higher and she goes to here it is it's you open the box she was just showing somebody where the pizza off [laughter]\nSo I went to my house and then I got an apple\nBlame ah I Know [laughter]\nAnd it's really funny because I had to go get my annual checkup\nThis past week and so I was with my mail dock and I'm like oh she'll look at my ... pm and this this and that is right and you're showing them the app on your phone yeah your doctor yes okay\nAnd I'm like look like sometimes you know it's forty for a good and resting heart rate [laughter] what did you say it's a she always our eyes and she says she goes to that is like an excellent rest resting heart rate\nAnd she said you know what your cholesterol is right now\nDo you know what your cholesterol no idea what ... might do you know years is no idea how can you really need it let me take you guys need to\nKnow what your class clown Hi so uh we're good and you know it's a high because my doctor tells me to take our strong medication if it was high and give me bills right well you have to have everything in your online portal oh yeah okay\nOkay so that you can sign and you can see that stuff anyway so my cholesterol and I don't take anything like it was like one twenty started well\nTwo hundred and it's like good okay so yeah so and that's because you can afford to have one piece of pizza you know but I can do it [noise] I Can't [laughter] you know what I couldn't even do it it's it's a it's a curse is what I'm telling you so anyway so the apple watch for that I have right now\nThat was the one where it'll tell people if you fall slip or slide I thought the presentation\nYes and then it will get you know hasn't accelerated learning gyroscope\nBut I have right now that was the one where it'll tell people if you fall clip or slide I thought the presentation\nYes and then it will get you know as an excel around with her and a gyroscope they'll try to\nAnd so that you can hit a button which I think is fabulous you know then you can hit a button and be and then but it will also do an east Fiji which is kind of like an e K tree ...\nBut you know that's where you're going to put the will to put your finger on the dial and so you'll be able to get a in east Fiji have you on the you know 'cause it doesn't work yet it hasn't been ruled out\nAnd so that's

on indeed if you find people with the ... nurse practitioner for ... years experience acute care certification indeed have this huge pool of amazing candidate\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization\nTo learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars\nAnd and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars were which were the top of the Google Search results at well right All right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now\nAnd it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per quick campaign\nSo somebody types in whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes\nHe maybe pay ten cents for every click but you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff on line\nOkay does that make sense\nFor us to say um I I Do some sort of like customers tried to allow them to go on and on a positive review for us it was just to get them to do it as like a should I Try to at a pet or something\nYeah and that's and rank them so they can you do it here now\nYeah you put it I pat right there exactly uh that's really smart and\nNumber you know and you could have a former they fill out you know positive and then you may check a box that says this this can you know this goes up to health grades or whatever it may be\nBut the other thing too is you can have a basket there a gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket okay\nSo we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left in ... review for us\nLight and\nSo and that that can beyond that little card or that can be on the printed receive that could be part of the email confirmation or the tax to that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start to you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive\nMaybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make it better but you start going in and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature but they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least\nTelling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really\nGood nature but they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times 'cause the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work and thirty days\nAnd want you to give me a call back and we'll go to the next level but I think you'll find that people will give you that review as long as you ask for and thank you for your call or let's talk about one of our great sponsors I drive dot com and I always get\nSuper excited okay I'm

pushing the post capital message portraying Democrats as a law\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday grill Fox News senior political analyst read him fully Brian us former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton Philippe is Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press NGO pain strategist Karl Rove while the Washington Post is out with a new poll today let's put up a numbers\nYou chose President Trump's approval numbers are up five points from late August but they're still\nOh well the Washington Post is out with a new poll today let's put up the numbers it shows President Trump's approval numbers are up five points from late August but they're still deeply underwater\nAnd on the generic ballot question who do you support and your house district Democrats laid by a Lebanon points among ... a registered voters Thirteen points among likely voters Carl how do you see them in terms twenty three days out\nOf Republicans look I'm a ... to the Senate or because of the map who we have so many of Republican oriented states and so few Democrat or a Sophie Republican senators up for election houses a different question there\nTo Charlie cookie is a hundred and Ninety six solid to lean replace you could say he writes the cook Political Report it landed on the Bible on yeah it's there are several others but they're all sort of in the same place so he's got two hundred and eight solid ... to lean democratic seats so\nUh and thirty one toss ups to Democrats seats twenty nine Republican seats it was a ripping Democrats to take control we need ten if they hold all of a ... that's about a third of what what what other tossup states Republicans would need to take about Seventy one [noise]\nBut um it's going to be close and it's going to be a long night I Would suspect we're going to have a large number of racist settled by a relatively small handful of votes governorships a lot of those up this year thirty six some Republicans are likely to lose seats simply because they have so many and unfortunately there'll be a couple of big state governors in there\nTruly what do you hear from folks at the White House do they feel politically with a capital a confirmation battle that they have blooded stopped\nThe so called blue wave of democratic advances and to the degree that they still worry about especially losing the house how worried are they about that that if they lose the house Speaker Pelosi and Adam ship in terms of intelligence with the impact it's going to have in terms of investigations hearings and also on their agenda\nThink they see on your on your first question on the way if I think they feel like they've been able to ... on the Senate side there was this at this point coming out of the summer coming out of Labor Day weren't actually get looked like some of these Senate races\nThat shouldn't be a pretty comfortable for Republicans were getting closer and that seems to have shifted and we now do seem to be in a place where the Senate\nIt definitely leaning more strongly toward Republicans but the question about what happens if Democrats take back the house is really a big cloud over the White House because Democrats will that have the power in the house they will be launching it they have already said a whole raft of investigation that not that the ... things that we know Bob Mueller has been looking at\nTheir open to going after Trump taxes to go in after a financial dealings with other people and the administration in the cabinet they said something that I think would really uh basically dominate at twenty Nineteen for the president in part because he ...\nGoing after a financial dealings with other people and the administration in the cabinet they said something that I think would really basically dominate at twenty Nineteen for the president in ... because he hasn't done a particularly good job at laying out what his legislative agenda would be in a divided government\nUh he's got the idea that infrastructure criminal justice reform but there's nothing really proactive that he that he is necessarily pushing and and the White House because they are under staffed and has been for quite some time they do not have the infrastructure in place right now to deal with a lot of democratic and I think\nI mean while especially after the capital a confirmation fight there seems to be a push among Democrats to take on Donald Trump on his own terms to be more aggressive and it's coming from some unlikely sources take a look\nAnd you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about\nYou know when they go low\nLow rent we should make it clear that later in that same speech Eric Holder made it clear that he is not advocating violence but this move to the lab on issues on tactics do you think it it's good politics for ...\nWell I think I think within the Democratic party you see a couple of a political figures they're trying to catch up there a couple of weeks behind the music ah the core base of the Democratic party is in a rage\nAnd they want to seem to be in a rage to they want to be make sure everybody knows they're part of the resistance to\nUh so that's where I think this is I don't think it's good politics I don't think the spectacle the cabin or hearing in the demonstrations that surrounded it\nUm which got pretty ugly and pretty far outside you know bounce are helpful to Democrats at all and you know this this Kavanaugh business was a very very big deal because it went on so long it was so conspicuous\nLet's remember in the middle of it to the New York times came out with a story of very long piece about Trump's of pledged cheating on his taxes through the years\nIt sank without a without a without a sound practically so much so that a few days later the time to read it again and it still seems to have gotten no traction so that's how big a deal at the at at at how much that the capital controversy ground things out and I think\nRepublicans will benefit from this into the midterms whether they can match the Democrats enthusiasm is entirely another matter I doubt that but they are in better shape Republicans in better shape because of it\n... you can see the Republicans and the president certainly pushing this idea they're dangerous don't go on a match to an arsonist their logo crazy uh\nBecause of it ... you can see the Republicans with the president certainly pushing this idea they're dangerous don't go on a match to an arsonist their logo crazy or do forget the Republican talking points in Europe you do Republicans do Democrats\nTake a risk of being seen as too extreme the mob could that conceivably hurt them in the ...\nWell I say a couple things first sitting here as a Democrat I'm confused because prior to a few weeks ago I was the snowflake of the party of snowflakes and suddenly we're an angry mob of terrorists so but to the point you're asking um it doesn't really matter at this point whether we are as Rachel as build because we've been billed as Rachel\nAnd I would say the notion of when we go high stay high\nThat should have died on November ... twenty sixteen I'm definitely in the Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder\nCamp the anger among the Democratic party is genuine so I think in a very simple way is good to stay with that genuine emotion whether it is the most effective a tactic next month or in the next two years I don't know but it's genuine I don't think it should be ignored and I don't think it should try to be falsely mitigated\nAnd we're gonna we're gonna see unfortunately people trying to modulate or trying to out Trump Trump and I think in twenty Nineteen that's going to be a real problem for the Democratic field up real quick like are\nSo dumb move and I hope they keep it up but it looks like the people who will decide that does it the people who will decide this election are people who\nSort of like what Trump is doing but don't like how Trump is acting and the last thing they want is for the next two years to be a food fight in Washington so the idea of Jerry now they're saying we're going to move towards impeachment causes these people to say the system is broken and allows the Republican a smart Republican say the system is go we're going\nTo talk about impeachment I mean I think well they're saying well we're going to match their passion but\nShe is not somebody who at like Michelle Obama dead who developed strong relationships with certain people in the west wing and had people there who are sort of her voice and it's a more her to the president\nNot somebody who are like Michelle Obama did who developed strong relationships with certain people in the west wing and had people there who are sort of her voice\nThat there's more her to the president at in their private time but she does this effort to kind of put her in a box and and to find her and I think what we have seen over these last couple of years is that that's really impossible to do because\nOn the one hand she is as strong supporter of her husband as anyone\nYet she find moments where she is willing to speak out against him in a really public way some of his policy decisions some of the things that he says on Twitter and I think that that's what we're going to see from her and the next couple of somebody who kind of have to look moment to moment to figure out where she's going to be but but indisputably she is in line with the with the president\nI kept battled for your next Sunday up next the U.S takes more
