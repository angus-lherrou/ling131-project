the judge said is that people have got those tickets cannot a reasonably afford to pay them you can't take their driver's license away now I think that's a ridiculous decision\nBut I'm curious we always take naysayers to the front of the line on this program and Jason joins us now Jason you heard that story and you and I disagree on how ridiculous that that decision is\nOur first of all I watch it at that ... that can add add add to that\nIs\nA yeah our first of all I was watching it something about this on the news is chair of an add to that so it'd be picky that they got to do

over does and the overdose because of opioids but we're actually lumping to problems together\nAre based on the numbers I've been able to find about five or six thousand of those Seventy two thousand died because of abuse of pharmaceutical drugs the kind that come from a legitimate companies\nUh and the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs like heroin that comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derrick molds on who's a former special agent in charge us a seat of the United states brought to justice drug Enforcement Administration and the special operations division\nThat's all we get Derrick molds on who's a former special agent in charge us a sea of the United States Department of justice drug Enforcement Administration in the special operations division and he's involved in a documentary called not in vain a dark welcome to the program\n[noise] hey how are you great to be on the program\nI I'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody in my family at least that I'm aware of\nWho's had that but I I Know of some\nYou know some folks on the queen did with who've lost kids they've lost family members because of addiction to heroin an addiction to pharmaceutical drugs are I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not in vain this new documentary\nAbout this connection because for a long time I've emphasized the your former agency the DEA says about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nNo exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only a public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these Mexican cartels that dumping poison all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right\nThere are so low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now\nThat they asked majority is being killed from the mixture of this potent center and all the synthetic\nDrug coming right from China and the labs in China and then mixing it with everything and large the thing is is that it's not just\nSomebody that you picked it on heroin it's a college kid that things taken the Arab world pill is going to keep 'em alert in this class in class and stay focused but what they don't realize is the pills are mixed with pencil and by the way\nFor the view is one kilogram of fencing all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams of fenced it off to kill an adult but we have a we have a much larger issue laws because you know another thing is these terrorists groups like Hezbollah\nThey're tapping into the criminal networks to their funding and their resources or we had a case a couple of years ago on Jumo is moving to a hundred million dollars a month to support Hezbollah\nAnd he was moving the proceeds furloughs that is a\nYou know cartel here so we have a very serious problem and the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain Marron rakes was Twenty years old she was a beautiful young girl who had very\nAnd the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain Marron rigs who's Twenty years old she was a\nBeautiful young girl who had very much loved her family passion polite typical kid you know playing sports he was a captain of the golf team and lots of friends and then her brother finds a dead\nBecause she got addicted and then she went out onto the you know by some of this stuff and it's it's mixed with whatever was in the particular you know\nPackage you she she bought but the point is is they don't know what they're getting and that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have you know train cameras that are actually caring about quality control they care about making money and grow in their business enterprise and the scary part\nLarge is the fact that China is developing all of these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country\nAnd China is a communist country so\nYou know what better way to disrupt the Americans by you know then by killing their their their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple at facets of this problem\nDuring ... during the dirt mauled who's a former special agent in charge of the da da da\nDa da da da da da da da to try to interdict some of these drug operations inside their borders because that seemed like the logical place to stop it we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you pointed out a tiny quantity goes a long way\nOr the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way in China are a lot of these chemicals are not even illegal to export and these cameras that they hire\nTheir their very clever because they know what the controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so the U.S government\nThe department of justice that DEA has had several meetings recently with China to try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but lost honestly it's really not it's nothing to brag about I mean\nThe pope the politics the politicians will make like everything's moving down the right path but it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they not aggressive enough with them it is China\nIt's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese experts but we do know and you're listening snow that China is\nI mean they not aggressive enough with them it is China\nIt's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese expert but we do know and you're listening snow that China's it really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it you know their debt hacking off computers they're still on our identities they're going after our financial grades and I lecture grades\nSo you know dumping poison in our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say selling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west are making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans\nSo this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially you know what's going on depending on you know who in China is actually sending at all well\nIt'd be good about what they accomplished if they can manufacture the drugs tree in the Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen they not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash from producing those stuff\nFlows back into China one way or the other which is good for trying to because ... and the super financially so they they get ... to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cache of the same time it's a win win and I\nI call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just\nIn it for the money and they're making billions of dollars as you know and they're right on our border and there's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the commodity collections that drug distribution stash houses you know\nBuilding compartments these guys are all over our country\nAnd honestly we got a shutdown that damn border but I Want to really make a difference but stuck it in the military and Bob my ... my opinion\nMy opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website\nDepartment of state has criteria for how you designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense\nLook at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have different authorities to use our military and others to kind of feel that border\nAnd knock this nonsense off with just put the politics you know if you look at nine eleven\nThe Iraq War the Afghanistan war you add up\nOthers to kind of feel that border and knock this nonsense off what just put the politics you know if you look at nine eleven the Iraq War the Afghanistan war you add up every one that died and then he'd been a Vietnam War\nIt still is that how many people died last year from trucks so what is the American public and realized just wake up stop listening at least phony politicians that are in it for their own personal pocketbook sitting at wallet and if you choose to not really in it for the public safety or national security aspects\nThe story is told in not in vain to brand new documentary out Derek mold says are involved in the dark thank you for your work at the DEA ... tough job and things are working on not in vain we appreciate you taking the time tonight\nBut thank you and any time if I could help you let me know ... pushing the message\nI'm Glad to do it in ... I Want to see that wall built two I keep telling people use it the one hundred percent solution there isn't a solution and the world that's a hundred percent but build that wall and we can make a big difference coming up in a moment President Trump talks about fake news\nRegularly but what does that really mean I'll get in cultures take on a coming up next she's one of our favorite guests how I'll be glad to get your phone calls and emails right after that at eight six six four three nine five to seven seven females go to talk of Lars Larson dot com [noise]\nAsking will this Trump strategy work it's really absolutely outrageous and in my note to readers and I wish anyone listening wouldn't go find it in print it out\nUm put it in put it in your wallet for the next time people say oh there's no such thing as fake news um these are the guardians of the first amendment yes every once in a while there is a typo\nNo this was a deliberate vicious racists lie about the president not only was it not corrected I'm In that segment if there's been a mistake I think it would have been corrected before before the first commercial break\n'em and you know come up with something different to talk about as far as I Know and it's never been corrected on CNN Anna ... after 'em or I guess I don't know about the same time I called was running other people may have noticed this she send out this vein tweet I'm saying I made and\nDon CNN Anna ... after 'em or I guess I don't know about the same time I called was running other people may have noticed this she send out the vein tweet I'm saying I made an error I'm Sorry about that something to that effect no mention of uh what was it goes to her pathetic list of ...\nOf of of Twitter followers and as as small as CNN's ratings are I Believe more people saw\nHer segment with why then you know one to ... Twitter feed to see this vague I made an error how about a segment and ... and correcting the entire segment\nWell and what's crazy as they could have done some legitimate journalism and said it is a scary time to be a man now and I'll tell you this is one of the things I kept emphasizing is\nIf somebody can come out with a thinly evidenced accusation that that has nothing behind it no witnesses no nothing and the person bringing the charge\nCan't even remember all the details where where who how bad can destroy\nA man or and as I pointed out in these ... times a man or a woman's\nUh you know uh uh uh their entire career\nThey're good name their family wipe them out financially and say oh I'm Sorry it was a ... it was a false accusation or we think it was called but by this time you've already destroyed the British than it is a scary time when that could that one little accusation can end up destroying a person and wait until the first time\nYou know that a woman says well you know this this professional woman came on to me and they destroyed a doctor or a lawyer or a politician or\nOne time you can be sure you're going to see it again is Trump gets another Supreme Court nominee

this is where the last ... doesn't end well there there's so much pent up anger on their side\nAnd that didn't want to confront that he wanted her he wanted to cause a scene that's what they tried to do they actually train them to do this they train them so that they can cause a scene and then if somebody does something that a whole bunch of them as human with cameras\nAnd get the worst possible picture particularly it's done with police so that they can show oh look the police just puts us are hurting the states\nThey're they're done this clean they've actually got to thinking training is absolutely unbelievable Dan gain or is it the media researcher Dan thank you very much for the time tonight and I we always appreciate your contributions you're listening to Lars Larson trail [noise]\nThe party line surprisingly\nYou know the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a so something very sinister as been going on pretty much for the last year\nWhere you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along the bad people and you had some folds accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't think\nSo some good people along the bad people and you had some folds accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't think\nNo they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence or there's a case this case I mentioned to you in Colorado there were two very suspicious cases won in Colorado one in Arizona\nState led socked in Colorado Don shooter in Arizona they didn't stay on these people fighting back what they wanted to do was forced them out scare the heck out of them and asked them to resign they were targeted and and I'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a\nUm a day in which\nDemocrats and Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years never had been an expulsion and the Colorado State house of representatives that day a Democrat got up and said because my wife\nWas molested when she was Seventeen\nI didn't vote yes on expulsion of ... and now this is the law makers who are putting forth arguments that would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so\nI that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had flown out due process\nLong time ago\nIn fact the larva got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the letter guidance and went to the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate sort of charges against student athletes who are thought to have committed some sexual assault\nThen put it into effectively a kangaroo court ah and and in those cases\nIt's interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think most people too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student around played who may be officially a Democrat or a virtually Republican but\nYou know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like like a judge Kavanaugh had are now justice Kavanaugh had so I just want to hear died for us and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and eat\nLike a judge Kavanaugh had or no justice Kavanaugh had\nSo I I just want to hear a lot of that and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and eat almost instantaneous reaction well a peace accused you must be guilty and let's move on to the next one that's a dangerous standard to adopt in a due process country like America\nWithout a doubt and among my many concerns about this is the notion that you can build some kind of um\nWhen he goes well let me go back to what you said at the beginning or these are people who've been trashing the culture all along and and in a heartbeat they had made an about face and are now acting like Puritans so\nNumber one we cannot buy in to this idea the left is\nBrilliant and building a culture that's what I wanted to say they build a culture around these these false notion this and that's how you get I was listening on line to your last interview and it was it was stunning and returning to hear I saw that video and and you've got\nLawmakers who are actually leading the charge in lawless nuts\nYeah and that is they're developing a sort of a hard core double standard where when an anti per person does something that you use a criminal of salt in most communities merely by walked up to somebody on the street corner today and just started shouting at them and screaming at them and I did it for any length of time\nIf there was a police officer within you know within earshot he'd come over and say you're going to knock that off now you're going to jail because that's the crime of intimidation so we're excusing it for

dangerous or to risk in in going forward with one of these folks if you have to and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for education to learn what they were about what their business model is like so\nThat I can make an informed decision\nRight so the people who are approaching use your house\nA house in good condition and I are established neighborhood yes it is so go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar is there any particular company that you're curious about\nI'm One of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nI've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are establishing in their racing to establish the city after city in the country where for time I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes and\nAre sabotaging and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise]\nI guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll value at your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to see what they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors bleep they develop systems where they can properly price house get it I'm dressed up however they need to win the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can when you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide for what you get out of it is you're just done if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out\nNo questions no gifts you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay and you also have to decide the price that you were offered [noise]\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offer they're making for your house\nAll day does that make so yes\nYes it does I used to have an idea what they're or not you know they were totally\nTotally ... no doubt that this is a a a real thing\nHave an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally legit\nNo doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat and he's another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add in cities around the country very heavy emphasis on the south south west and west\nAnd the reason those areas because those are areas in the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing\nA lot of uh subdivisions and developments built with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing ... corporate thank you Tom how can I be him service\nWell out here and a half ago I got us let's say in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this because it never hurts to have a backup card case you need it [laughter]\nSo I got the cars started using it because it actually had a better cash back more than the one I was using previously cells and everything was all I'm fine [noise]\nOne afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called him stop the car to milk sent me a new one the whole smear [noise]\nAt that point I threw the card into the two lifestyle and started using my original car at the end and at last September last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the old Anton they sent me a new card and then it happened again and ... also times it's happened to spend a different addressed it by mail and then the car too [laughter]\nSo I talk to the company and they sent me on the front of the ... that whole thing I did ask him I said no other cars I have thought for a second level security worried and they would ask you a question life you know who's your favorite rock group lowers your your elementary school\nAnd you know as you're on a rock group\nFor a second level security word and they would ask you a question like you know who's your favorite rock group lowers your your elementary school\nAnd who is your rock group the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your credit [laughter] I'm not allowing gay [laughter]\nAt all or let's say that they they they gave me so lame excuse to say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security they should offer [noise]\nWhether it's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nHis business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections said a consumer car does thunder pre existing law and the card act was passed after the banking scandals so\nCongress carved out exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example let's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you are able\nTo take it over and run up charges the credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think that you Tom took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so the course of action is just as to how close you know\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take over the account\nAnd divert bills so that you don't know that false charges are being made I Would say three strikes and they're out somebody has somehow figured out how to crack down on your particular card and who knows how many others\nAnd I don't want you vulnerable since you don't have\nThe normal slate of consumer protections you can get any consumer card and just as a practical matter pay for it from your business\nIs also the cause of needs to be in the business and them no oh\nThe in the business and them no oh\nYou're liable anyway you know when you get a business card you know the that one of the things you've

make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland that is an area subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood blown error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it sure is

the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amounts photo incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the

[laughter] I'm great thank you\nAnd you know what I could never say the name disrupt dish it out without like raising\nMy fast enough now or anything I'm hoping that you're doing that al and\nYou know I did I did I won't be so first of all um you you got a lot\nGoing on here I don't even know where to begin a best selling author and we will go through all that stuff but first of all entrepreneur or not regular folks are\nThey I mean there's something in the DNA it's like it's like if you take a DNA test and they look at it they scratch their heads and they go well for jury duty and I can see that part Irish bar do spread would've disbarred raised a big chunk to like Fifteen Percent you know it's like it's the DNA of an entrepreneur you know what I mean\nI Do spiritual kind of crazy and they are out of it gets\nSo tell us first of all you just got done with your uh doing a whole series with a new or on their Facebook page on our face but you don't listen we're all try to disrupt his you know what was that about for those 'cause it's you know it's like something I Want to just get started with where you been where you are and where you do and so we are yeah go for it [laughter]\nSo it's all about the show so disrupted it's probably helpful to to talk about what a disruptor is and\nWhen you think about on the north that sounds like the same way I Do it's not a job at the state of mind and so disruptor in every entrepreneur or whether they are starting out or or they work in their community or they work for a large company it doesn't really matter\nWhat they have in common is that the status quo it no longer serves the world in which it than the than attention it's ineffective it's it's just it's awful and they can't stop until they take that status quo and create a new one that is more efficient more effective\nUm more friendly and so the the the challenge around being a female entrepreneur is one of the deck is stacked against you if I'm a system perspective and I'm sure we'll talk more about that that's what the book the chapters is about which was published by on our press came out in January and it's been on the publishers lessons that came out\nIt's really really understood the women right thank you [laughter] right well\nIt's good timing Allen right and it's it's definitely a topic that not just women but men as well not everybody leads to the way not all men are the same data limit saying it just doesn't quite work that way [laughter] so that's right so that's incredibly difficult to be a disruptor\nAnd you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable the other challenges if you are not just in the corporate world\nThat's right so that's incredibly difficult to be a disruptor\nAnd you have to get comfortable with the uncomfortable the other challenges it you are not just in the corporate world and we can talk to members but if you are a start up pounder coup brings your disruption to live that way and they were on it and he won't marry the two percent of extra funding\nThe Ninety percent of all external funding for it for their businesses and so we're still in that ... face with the now the chapters in raising them to the top and instead of calling out saying hey look there's a woman and she could disrupt their\nThat showed a column I write on the other writing I Do the speaking I Do is really about just telling the story about disruption and oh by the way it's just\nSo happens to be a female athlete that really that kind of place you want to go right to that when I think it gets up there I just don't think about the ongoing honey I Want to think about really anybody who bring to this or\nYou know it's funny my son in law who\nIs twenty five you know he's this morning he was talking about a lady that he's working with and he goes man she is on fire she's got this and she does that and she started this business and she did that\nAnd I was sitting there thinking to myself you know this lady you know it's almost like for a while it was almost taboo for women to be just bond game like that you know what I mean and but today it's almost like you know hell yes right it's like\nDisrupt the smuggling and listen I\nThe women in my world and the you know my wife included who recently has decided to kind of have this born again but not on a religious way but as a woman in business because you know she was a a soccer mom forever and ever and ever and I I always thought you know my wife just doesn't like movement\nAs an adult now I went on to win the seat on the line you know and all of a sudden like flying here and go in there and deal with contractors in last night she goes you know I got there at midnight and I had to have the guy who's paying the house come and pick me up at the airport and\nI'm like okay [laughter] I did a soccer mom all of a sudden I Love\nSeeing my wife do this I Love seeing my daughter who was an entrepreneur I Love seeing women come out of their shell for so long you folks you women have been kind of you know I'm pigeonholed as you know soccer moms housewives you know women\nBut today it just seems like the men women really have their game going I don't know what it is\nThe truth is we have that are wrong and we're seeing a lot of history\nSeems like the women really up there I don't know\nThe truth is we have been all along and we're seeing a lot of revisionist history kind of come to light right so you know starting with the mission to Mars right and we we saw we all many of us saw the movie\n... and then you write all I Love that movie all in\nRight so we're seeing some of that but you're absolutely right you're talking about is really what the book disrupt or is this about so I'm sure you've heard of the book leading by Sheryl Sandberg in that\nRight that came out a few years ago and I love that she brought this topic of women in the workforce to the forefront it's not going to mainstream topic I've been booed off stage is I've had eight emails or they\nHad all these things with oh yeah oh my God will hit on yeah so yeah and so and by the way I deserve some of it but you know we talk about this rupture them all and I learned the hard way out and that's how I roll [laughter] so we need to\nCome in but the truth is I I didn't like the book and I didn't like the book because essentially what it said was hey\nWent in in order to compete with the big boys in order to have this amazing career in the corner office the book made assumptions that one every woman wants to be in the corner office well not every person does it just doesn't work that way there's not one definition of success and the next thing is the reason that we are not\nAll out in the C suite in high growth entrepreneurship and all these things that we're told we should do or even stealing our own dreams were oh my God you can be a soccer mom and sit newborn\nI'm holy crap back on the bus right about that it's\nOur fault right that we have to be fixed in order to to be able to do this in other words they're all of these programs out there are trillions of dollars are spent on this topic trillions and the needle kids go on the other way and it goes the other way because instead of looking at why the heck\nWe in a world where more than fifty percent of the population and women more than fifty percent of the workforce or women were in this country women control fifty one percent of the wealth right more than half a PHD is more than half of MBAs blah blah blah Seventy percent of valedictorian we have all this spending power we're responsible for Seventy\nTo eighty percent bonds humor by decisions right to be held his power we're not in power the answer cannot be the blame and shame and that doesn't work and it can't be the fix

just brought back around people who may have forgotten about what she claimed before when she ran for the Senate\nAnd wondering why even once you get the results back when you see that it's a

all common to send a strong right\nNow no common sense whatsoever she fancier self as a presidential candidate in twenty twenty that's number two this week on the countdown the election already we're

a part of my heritage growing up for sure\nNumber one on the countdown this Saudi ah well what's going on in Saudi Arabia whether you're focused on the death or a disappearance of ... who is be headed

whatever the hell his name as I'm Out of these people figure they're going to get away with this\nThat's what I'm Wondering even with all of those who say that they have because no amount of oil they have right how are they going to Iraq but the this is what's been done to show me\nHow to get this big thing that the rich supposedly in Riyadh and that's not going to happen there nobody's going to go there unless they're trying to catch the butt of the Saudis they've overplayed their part there are plenty of other places to get oil they can say well you mess with us and the price of oil is going to go up and\nWhat it does is every time they pull that stunt or the oil price goes up for a while but then there is more of a leap into alternative energies because the price of oil has gotten

put a solar farm on my farm and the next year I'm absolutely going to do that 'cause I'm sick or paying for the technology\nIs getting to the point where they have to be thinking\nHow do we dominate the world market anymore ... with the amount of oil though that we produce here and and that is produced elsewhere around the world and then the renewable energy they have to be going okay what's gonna happen to us and fifty years\nYeah what does happen to them become they become your other than like most of the other deserts and sandbox\nHundred I'm always said with the middle east it's a stop buying their oil and they will have not they will not have the funds to attack you with it\nYeah well that you seem to have the funds or control Richie by that royal family\nHas so much that there's this they fixed it so at least for now they're worried about all of a change in the middle east but I Wonder I guess outside the box thinking is why is it that it's taken so long for a lot of

in the cabin or hearing the Democrats said at the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase the truth when talking about that testimony from ... to fold\nSo telling the truth\nIs no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what do you get this post modern is on this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics can be divided into two groups\nThose who believe there is well I'm sure this and those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty twenty first century\n[noise] well what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are\nCertainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how was it was a believer in subject the truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong with theirs is right\nI wouldn't subscribe to but how was it was a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth was wrong with theirs is right\n... you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the absurdity of of the whole situation so\nYes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's there's a theory that has the theology and then there's the ... so the question is what what is the practice or if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nA band or behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere as salaam becomes the legal system where show real law actually becomes the ... of the land ... such as Afghanistan than we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because\nWe have the Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest has ... allies that is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left uh pushing harder and harder to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\nYeah very good question\nStretched overreached I should say in that regard or is the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah they're very good question I Am disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist a at a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of\nAmerican millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the neighborhood socialism communism so\nYeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party have managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases who have an absolute axe to grind and an very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to try and even high that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor and presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such it's inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more when we abdicated\nThe schools the high schools and colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allowed the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had an show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\nHell chance that hey you guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject of chit chat with a\n... that is a this claim that there is such and then as such we both\nYou guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject of truth in that check the truth uh\nThey didn't say this claim that there is such and such we both repudiated the idea but go ahead well\nI mean that's still just an opinion no matter how you know no matter how logical far no matter how uh how much feeling it fought in Chile which has followed a difference between the two is failing logic\nTo sell that or is that the mighty big difference\n[noise] that it's just you know shit show we feel the getting rid of subjective jak sat through it and the ... and the first place\nAt them one oh three point five

classic message from Dr Oswald Hoffman talking about the connection between faith and fear joining me here now to discuss that is Dr Tony cook\nDirector of us ministries are at Lutheran our ministries Tony ... let's talk about fear in our lives and uh how face interacts intersects with that\nSure ah thanks for having me again this is a topic that\nI can get in the way back machine and go back to um I think if I'm remembering correctly about when I was seven ... and um I was going through some rough times are in my life\nAnd I started to have night terrors ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you can get out um they repeated every single night it was a thing\nHave night terrors ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you can get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream that that happened every time\nAnd when I Would uh when I Would wake up from this dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half awake and half asleep and I would see\nThe shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was that I had a closet that didn't have a door so less dark um\nAnd I had a a Barney Rubble nightly do yeah I had like night light and that was the only light in the room and sometimes it help and sometimes it cast odd you know shadows on the wall but what happened is I was going through this period of when I went to sleep I Would have this dream\nAnd I would wake up with this tremendous sense of fear and foreboding\nAnd I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things away [laughter] and um I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now and lay me down to sleep\nAnd I knew the Lord's Prayer and so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes and in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers they would make a brick\nAnd I would\nTake these bricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it's like a pillar you know ... and I was inside of this pillar of brick of prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was\nProtecting me if you will from the fears that came in the night and eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear\nAs well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see a childish technique because now that I think about it actually probably wasn't that bad bad of a thing to do but uh that was a time in my life that I had these kind of foreboding for years and and how he handled it\nAs you look back on that as an adult do you continue to use prayer as a shield and as a protector yeah for me it's interesting with prayer it as a as a Lutheran\nA lot of times we'll say a when something happens will ...\nAs a shield and as a protector yeah for me it's interesting with prayer it as a as a Lutheran\nA lotta times will say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a and a lot of times that's a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realized is that prayer has\nPower and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that\nMost of the times still oddly enough I I use prayer\nWhen I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off those worries and those concerns especially when I'm trying to sleep\nPrayers about the only effective way for me to to do that so it it's carried along with me this this whole time so it's it's more than just apply attitude [laughter] in it actually is is is powerful yeah\nWhat'd you say fear is a bad thing I guess you know it's what kind of fear is it\nAnd who you ask probably so when I was a little kid I felt that that fear was bad and maybe a it was my subconscious working out the issues that I was going through so maybe it was good but as an adult\nI found that that fear actually can be good obviously fear helps to protect us from things that you have that that a fight or flight syndrome that we get ... exactly what the hell the fear of of things that would do damage to you I also think that when it comes to fear that\nIt is something that can set of hedge or a boundary so that we remain faithful to God and then there is I'm not like a horrifying kind of fear but a a fear when we look at God\nIn who he is honoring him and that's a kind of fear too and I would say that's a that's a positive fear as well\nYeah actually the first use of the law would be a an example of a healthy fear the fear of running afoul of the authorities that God has put in place\nThe curb that yeah they restrained you from acting out on whatever sinful impulse you might have that might be against the law so in that case that would be a healthy of fear and a half you're correct so like the the the first\nUse of the law um why do people obey the law in in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment you know [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm I'm not going to do this because\nObey the law in in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment you know [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm I'm not going to do this because I Want to go to jail so you're not really a doing things for\nA wonderful virtuous reasons but because you're fearful of the\nPenalty but at the same time it's not like the man's trying to keep you down you know I mean it's it's really about protecting you as well as a maintaining stable society so\nWhile there's fear involved the overall goal isn't simply tear\nOverall goal is to Maine taint peace and to keep us protected and to keep us healthy\nIn the sermon Dr Hoffman said that all fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of death would you agree with that\nI agree with that I might put it a little bit differently to me to death is one kind of lost okay and at least for me personally I think that a lot of my fear is connected to loss a death being probably the largest one but yeah\nI I Would say that the death as a former Lawson and if you think about it that way that many of our\nFears are connected so uh we're fearful if we're gonna lose our job or if we're going to lose a relationship with someone that we love or if we lose someone in in death or if we're going to lose a part of our identity you know or part of our freedom\nUm all of those I think go back to loss for me and maybe maybe it tells you a little too much about who I Am I'm but fear of loss of of of many kinds has has been something that that I've dealt with over my life uh it it also I think it exposes the fact that\nMaybe we think that the things that we provide for ourselves are the only way that we make it through this world and if we if we lose those things we're not going to be able to go on\nWell my story begins facts\nGoes from God has touched the W is going to tell us about what God has done in her life so to get away ...\nMy story begins back in the sixties growing up with both parents thankfully that thought they were raising me the best they could but my dad had a major flaws [noise]\nI guess like a lot of dads back then he smoked drank but this was different he had his workshop and the basement wallpaper with playboy centerfold\nOh my ... thing when my friends would come over and we'd spend time singing on the pretend Mike seed mounted on broomsticks with real bases so we can pretend to be the monkeys our favorite group at the time and we needed a tool to fix something so we go on to the workshop and they see the playboy bought\nOne of those pictures and dad's encouragement of pursuing a modeling career by sending me to charm school and entering me in a couple of queen contests\nAnd I was off to catching the eye of every guy desire to my path\nWith my adoptive ways and clothing\nFrom miniskirts in school to the just goes to three years after giving myself away\nHaving an abortion all the while pretending to be a good Christian girl taken many boyfriends to church with me on the Sunday Morning following what a mess\nThankfully I was raised in a wonderful Methodist Church in Toledo, Ohio where a woman named Missy would include me in and interpret of dance group\nLetting me plan and leave the youths presentation of an Easter sunrise service every year letting missing special music with others is God would develop my harmonizing skills\nBut little details you know I was spending my evenings beginning at Eighteen disco dancing and sleeping around and even being the first girl to swallow a goldfish and earn to free drinks for attention\nWould be my leisure time for the next two years and was misty thrilled when the lay witness gang she had part of causing our pastor to invite to come for a weekend touched my heart to\nMany of us got saved that year I turned Nineteen\nOur first second and third alter cause after watching three and times movies and not wanting to be left behind act that our pastor didn't know how to keep it going to some of us decided to move to a Baptist church for the preaching would be stronger and we learn to stay safe I answered an ultra called there at that church\nKeep it going to some of us decided to move to a Baptist church for the preaching would be stronger than we learn to stay safe I answered an ultra called there at that church to shortly thereafter and was baptized unfortunately during that time I thought I could go to disclose and witnessed you guys and when I met so to me down\nI ended up marrying him in Nineteen Seventy eight and then a year later he got a wild hair to leave his job parents and home all his life since he was adopted it four years old and moved to Phoenix, Arizona we took a both of us with us though so the cheating bed at haunted our first year of marriage continued on\nAnd for five more years sadly until he finally admitted that he was cheating as the visa bill came in with two tickets charged on it to LA to watch the Detroit Tigers play the angels [noise]\nBy the time this happened I had been looted by many of my bosses at a very perverted law firm but finally in the summer of Nineteen eighty I was invited by Phoenix branch of the potters house to come here are Christian rock band at the park I always walking my dog that\nMy husband was all burnt out from the company river flowed we done that day was already sleep and so I wandered over\nAt the flatbed truck concert I was approached by a couple of gals and they helped me determine I was back when away from God and needed to pray to receive his amazing forgiveness which they helped me do and why\nGuilt left inhaling began to come in\nThat and I one of the gals offered to pick me up for church the next morning and I've come ever since six months later then I got filled with the holy ghost and had a new power of discernment and all of a sudden I realized every time I drink with our friends after bowling I was breaking God's heart so I quit\nThen once I got my husband to come to service but he claimed to much pressure to get saved so he wouldn't go again\nThen he began to cheat more earnest beyond me as I joined drama and a band and I had arrived home from a victorious Saturday Night concert and he'd be going out to the nightclubs along finally as I said he admitted he was cheating on me when I confronted him about the two airfares on the visa\nAnd I knew I had reached the point where I couldn't take it anymore which my pastor had asked me to wait for so I filed for divorce and I moved out and struggled through October to July still hoping he'd fight for men come clean\nPastor had asked me to wait for so I filed for divorce and I moved out and struggled through October to July still hoping he'd fight for men come clean but even so I celebrated July Fourth with a new freedom\nAs the divorce was final July third\nAnd buddy my husband to be that I'd been watching go through his own struggles in I began to date she'd gone through a short marriage separation for two years and it's believed for his wife to return from San Diego remaining faithful and wearing his ring until his parents showed up at three o'clock one morning\nAnd said she died in a car wreck on her way back\nAfter she called him and told and she'd been saved and wanted to work things out\nPraise God there are two year old daughter was in Phoenix visiting her and at the time so he got her back and moved in with his parents to raise their while he worked in sorted out what next so it was about six months after the divorce was final and we felt it was time for two broken off to be healed\nWe dated for months married in Nineteen eighty five and I became an instant mom and the little girl's Tupperware dishes and my hope that at home at last in our daughters to bring us around\nAll my what a wonder promises made and kept my buddy\nI'll never hurts you I'll be faithful\nSuch an amazing miracle especially for me after working at the law firm where everyone divorce that work there and so much foul play was going on from strippers hired for birthday parties to Christmas parties and such that my new husband\nBuddy immediately went to work and how to get me out of there we lost our first baby at seven months pregnant even after quitting and going to bed rest and God was there\nEven the perverted law firms friends took up a collection of paid our rent for the time I was off during that and they let me come back to work full time until we're expecting our son a year later I decided on my own just stay home and do that one right\nAnd he was the perfect nine pounds six and a quarter ounce bouncing baby boy from head and my dad and that would be my best friend for especially the next three years until we were asked to take over friends church across town and death or twenty five years of mystery would begin\nDuring that time I was learning patience as children teach you\nI was learning how to [noise] stay focused and witness and believe God for people and so he passed through a year and a half\n[noise] just how to [noise] stay focused and witness and believe God for people and so he passed year year and a half there\nThen we came back to her home church for re assignment to be sent to another church in red could Kentucky during that four years I learned a lot about flower arranging that I use much later when we went to a law because\nFlowers about it in our yard there it was wonderful\nSo much for later we moved to Marion and pastured another four years my parents divorced during that time and mom moved down with us and let me lead her to Christ and our daughter would joined a band with my husband in that church\nNext we moved like how to the city and served our next four years their God preparing us for overseas sheets and bugs in a major way\nDevon was being prepared to as you learn how to play drums and guitar and received the lord is his savior and became quite a good basketball player that would come in handy our reaching in our next assignment while you were offered pioneering a church and the island is a law\nThat adventure would be the next ten years of our lives as trusting Jesus with our very lived through Danny fever cold showers\nColor light is long scars from so much mould no power often aside clone the nominee a young man in our congregation who was leading

establishing a find Cora believers to turn over to a young couple that have since taken it to the next level and even sent out their first someone couple across the island to start a new word just last month [noise]\nSo now we've been back from being overseas missionaries my husband has been an evangelist for four months\nWhen when we first got back he was an evangelist for four months we pioneered one more church back in Kentucky\nSpending the last year my mom's life and her city and enjoying her and every Sunday Morning service and a few more that we turned over to another young

new study says brain power fluctuates by season\nResearchers find a seasonal pattern in cognitive activity the peaks or about around the beginning of on him which should be moving around ... maybe in a couple of weeks officially it's still the summer season a but it's we're starting to move towards the fall season\nUh according to a new study\nConducted by research in the U.S Canada France in Israel\nOr we may have more brains\nA than just one we may have winter brains spring brain summer and fall brains to be exact\nSo well what's up with that well they analyzed data from thirty five hundred participants who took tests they're thinking in concentration skills and uh they also looked at levels of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease\nAnd they found that actually there was a thirty percent greater chance of meeting the diagnostic criteria for something called MCI mild cognitive impairment sometimes referred to as mild dementia if the tests were done in the winter months\nAre amazing memories and the kid back in school now that life is quiet there I Know murdering his personality knock down project ties I mean we had a county contractors because he ate him with

us at eight seven seven seven to six talk where we got plenty of stories this week and one of the stories has to do with probiotics you know the last week a story came across\nThe media which then here's a sample headline probiotics are mostly useless and can actually hurt you talk about a click made headline [noise]\nUh this is a story that is highly inaccurately reported the steady based on a mere Fifteen volunteers\nResearchers at the Weitzman Institute in Israel gave probiotics to the volunteers and lo and behold they discovered that holy in some of them the probiotics actually\nAppear in their stool samples\nAnd as a result of that they claim that provide acts are useless\nAnd this is something that we've long noted is that\nWhen you do is to test on somebody taking certain probiotics sometimes the robotics don't appear in the stool suggesting that they don't take root they don't colonized a however the researchers themselves readily admits\nRelying on fecal samples as an indicator what goes on to the gut\nIs inaccurate and wrong and I'm quoting the researchers themselves never lost a journalist so fit to publish the headline probiotics are mostly useless based on this study\nAnd here's this study that came out just a couple of days ago actually just\nAre mostly useless based on this study\nAnd here's this study that came out just a couple of days ago actually just yesterday out of Georgetown University medical center headline probiotic use may reduced antibiotic prescriptions and here's what the researchers found\nUsed to provide access link to reduce need for antibiotic treatment and infants and children\nIt's in the European journal public health\nAnd the study found that when the results from twelve studies were pulled together\nInfants and children were get this twenty nine percent less likely to have been prescribed the antibiotics if they received pro buyout acts as a daily health supplements I'll take that any day but then they refine their analysis and they repeated it\nThey looked at what they term only the highest quality studies and then this percentage increase to fifty three percent reduction in the need for antibiotic sets the spectacular results [noise]\nThe findings very intriguing the researchers say quote given this finding potentially one way to reduce the use of antibiotics is to use pro bioethics on a regular basis\nThis according to the leading a study in just a gator Daniel ... teaches at Georgetown University school of medicine and they go on to say we already have evidence that consuming probiotics reducing incidents to ration andme severity of certain types of common acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nAnd more studies are needed in all ages particularly in the elderly to see if sustained provide accused is connected to an overall reduction antibiotic prescriptions have so this could potentially have a huge impact\nOn the use of probiotics in general medicine and consumers in general this according to Sarah king from Cambridge University who also participated in this study so what's going on here so the ... gets purported\nTo not work when you take a probiotic\nAnd to provide it doesn't show up and you're still sample so is it useless then will the answer is but doesn't necessarily mean it's useless and I've got to say that I myself have dabbled in checking my own stool samples using the various services that are ...\nReally mean it's useless and I've got to say that I myself have dabbled in checking my own stool samples using the various services that are available\nAnd mostly what I found was disappointing is I put on a daily basis take up robotic doctor here is provided which contains lactobacillus I've taken many other robotics and consistently I find that I have zero lactobacillus in much tool in\nMany my patients a similar finding so what's going on with that does that mean to provide acts are not working they're not taking sort of like spreading seed in the Sahara Desert it's an act of utility because the soil is not conducive to their growth [noise]\nSo does that mean that they're used as well the answer is no because probiotics may work in a different way and some people because there's something called bacterial cross talk bacteria in the intestinal tract\nInteract with our immune system a large part of it which resides in what are called the tires patches in our large intestine\nAnd these players patches\nAre actually receptors for information from the bacteria that populate\nOur intestinal tracts are micro biome and if you have a healthy microbiomes you have healthy beneficial cross talk and if you have an unhealthy micro biome was bad bacteria and a lack of good bacteria your immune system gets the wrong signals\nAnd so based on this idea of cross talk certainly as possible even if antibiotics don't in plant and grow in your intestinal tract they're doing something more over\n... may be responsible for the synthesis of beneficial compounds\nVitamins nutrients that are essential for the functioning of the immune system and for the bodily functioning generally [noise] and so the claim probiotics are mostly useless\n[noise] is\nAn act of journalistic malpractice [noise]\nYet another distortion [noise]\nFrom the mainstream media [noise] I'm Dr Ronald ... and our number\nEight seven seven ...
