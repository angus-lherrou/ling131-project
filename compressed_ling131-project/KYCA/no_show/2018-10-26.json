things a lot of my guest onto the winds here this morning is on me to Vandenberg choose the training in compliance director for ... works locations in northern Arizona good morning\nGood morning how are you doing to the great and you are\nWell so okay tell me they wanted to talk to a little bit about a new law that has taken effect and I guess it's a law and it's also across the country uh concerning uh travel I'd be snow this is a I guess a new kind of a driver's license but basically tell us what it's all about here in Arizona\nSo what it is is that the new travel ideas actually been in effect for a couple of years now and what it's doing it that the federal identification that allows people to enter a federal locations like a military bases nuclear power plant\nFederal court buildings and commercial airlines it doesn't take effect though till October twenty twenty so a lot of people are getting anxious about that I'm also to something that is because it is a federal id passports will also work in lieu of this idea is well\nOkay but you do something that is going to be required as a driver's license for Arizona's got what I'm understanding or can you clear that\nSure on yeah it's not a requirement Arizona made a voluntary because there's a lot of information that you do have to supply to get this ID and\nArizona's legislature is Len hey look you know that's a lot of personal information for people to have to fork over so they made it all and Terry\nAnd so if you'd like to have one you can have one just as an ID card or you can combine it with your driver's license if that something that you need specially uh those people who like to travel a lot or require to travel a lot further work really seem to like it because it's an all in one type card\nOkay so you can still just ... on a driver's license by itself if you want where you can combine it with the travel idea and you can do it any time now get that is correct okay why is there a requirement for a certain timeframe because you're saying because it doesn't go into effect until twenty twenty well what does that mean exactly\nSo what happened is the federal government got everything had a role in the ball a couple of years ago and realize that not everybody was on board with all these changes and so they kind of had to take a step back and said okay we're going to extend out this date on October ...\nA couple of years ago and realize that not everybody was on board with all these changes and so they kind of had to take a step back and said okay we're going to extend out this date on October twenty twenty but then that's when it's going to come mandatory that if you want to enter any of those federally regulated facilities or flat a commercial airline you have\nTo have some type of federally recognized ID and it where it really all stems from nine eleven so it's a way they're trying to find a way to uh\nI guess make all the states can form and make sure everybody's checking all the same things to make sure people who are applying friday's really are who they say they are\nOkay so it without this idea after October twenty twenty two years from now you're not going to be able to go into certain federal facilities won't be able to fly um also what about a ... vote Amtrak and other services like that\nYou know and those are not really federally regulated and also do you want to clarify if you have a passport you do not need this ID\nOn that is one thing that's being left off a lot in a lot of advertising and literature out there and so people are panicking thinking they have to have it no matter what but if you have a passport it does the same thing in terms of being able to enter the federally regulated facilities\nBut Amtrak is that as a private company so that would be something that companies like that would have to make their own decisions on what they would require two I'm bored their facilities\nTo cook so a then let me ask you this with this if I had this travel I'd be than I Would be able to fly I'd be able to get into ... into of government buildings or does this work as a passport can I go to Mexico can I go to Canada or do I still need a passport\nYeah no this is just for using the United states only and a lot of people have been coming in thinking that it is like a border crossing card and it's not it's just for the United states only so if you want to leave the country you will need that ...\n... well maybe we are going to pause briefly here on MORNING report for an important message when we come back when I talked to a little bit more about this idea and what is going to take to get one right now let's pause we'll be right back\nHello this is ... really the new commercial airline for ... will feature a commercial

United dot com\nWe're back you're on the news fourteen Monday morning reporter and ... them I guess to me the Vandenberg she's training in compliance director for footwork and all their locations in northern Arizona and go\nTo one quick question about the ... be also notes that I wanted to fly commercial you I have a passport is not good enough to get on the plane or I'm going to have to have the idea to travel within the United states from on her lunch\nNo passport is efficient because it is a federally issued identification so yeah you only need that to fly if that's what you decide to do\nOkay so for anybody who does want to travel I Do however uh how do we get to where do we go and what do they need in order to get this because you're saying there's quite a bit of information people are going to have to supply\nYeah and and so what we did is we actually on our website at footwork dot com and that's ... s O O T E W O R K we actually have a whole page dedicated to all this information so if you read all scrambling to find pen and paper don't worry we've got it on our Web sites you can see a whole list of the requirements [noise]\nUm so what is going to take as you're going to need either a birth certificate a\nPassport or another document that allows you authorized presence in the United states\nThen you're going to need your Social Security card and and then you're going also need to documents proving your physical address and that right there isn't a stumbling block for a lot of people because the documents they're bringing in a lot have don't have complete addresses sometimes they have their appeal box\nAh they are how one spouse but not the other so I'm On that we're recommending that you do check out that list of a a identification or I'm Sorry for the address requirements\nAnd then making sure you're following that list exactly and that you are making sure it does have all the pertinent information 'cause a lot of people are coming in and they just don't have all the right documents and of course we're happy to take a look for you if you just want to stop by and before you actually decide to do the id and we'll take a look and let you know what you have will be sufficient\nRecruits so uh from lose points for word right now you're going to fly you can do anything we just your driver's license for id or whatever but ah October twenty twenty um I Would think that they're going to be publicizing this because you only two years\nIt is and buy their law I Believe it is a hundred and twenty days in advance they have to notify people um and remind them that they do have to have those extra documents and so I I Would bet that probably coming closer that time there's going to be a lot of extra advertising\nAll I'm and remind them that they do have to have the extra documents and so I I Would bet that probably coming close to that time there's gotta be a lot of extra advertising going out I'm sure the airlines are going to be specified that when you buy your ticket and a lot of different things like that so that way make sure everybody's prepared at that time\nOkay so let me ask you this if you go somewhere like ... or to footwork and say you know we'd like to combine this with the Arizona driver's license all those requirements for the Arizona license still are in effect as well you've got to do everything correct\nCorrect yeah enough time with a with a driver's license and getting they both combined his making sure you have valid driving privileges so if you're coming in from out of state you just need to bring in that current driver's license so we can transfer that over to Arizona along with those documents\nOkay All right so basically we've got two years to go before this happens and it's if you have a passport you really don't have to worry about as long as your passport is a correct correct\nAll right so I mean I guess that's about it one more time give us that a website for the information for your company\nSure it is but work dot com F O O T E W O R K dot com\nOkay Vandenberg thank you for joining us here on the morning report and we'll keep you up to date on this new travel ideas a time gets closer for the requirement thank you for joining\nStinky every day\nThis repeated morning report has been sponsored by your ... studio ... encouraging you to support your local businesses\n... go to W.

which is a trunk view of everybody right now\nSo I don't know what political motives are trying to establish your what they're trying to ideologies are trying to push for it but the bottom line is there's a clear cut a disruption of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about how this individual would be track what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to establish who the person did it not to give away all the investigative techniques but I mean right up right up front you'd be looking at a fingerprint analysis from a tape of device or\nUm you know the other other um modalities that you can use to to get um DNA evidence off of off of the device if she if in fact it was the last I mean you're never gonna have a completely sterile\nUm uh item there are a specially since this wasn't render ... I'm a bomb squad um there's lots of entry a value to this\nUm which they should be able to ascertain a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a a ... they had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nSalvo hot yeah it is odd and you would think someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person you know who actually delivered it trace it back to where or came from I mean\nThere has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who you know where they picked it up or they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in in you really wanted it to cause damage she wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be ... much more lethal than a package linked with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb\nLike this through\nCan be ... much more lethal than a package with with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb\nLike this through the\nPostal service because it's too easily detected is or anything to that\nWell I mean if you look or you know historical data but he uh bombs have been used you know through the mail um especially when you have like a\nKnow Ted Kaczynski and what he did as well go the Unabomber stuff I mean you can use the the post office or you can use other means of courier service FedEx or whatever but I think when the day you're not going to use what they used to in the last few days that you're going to use something that's not detectable\nUm look at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we are where the device who actually went off um those were intended to go all these ah these are intended to be found in my opinion so they were meant to instill fear in people that's the bottom line here in America and that is just my opinion\nUh Brian Morris uh Ryan we appreciate your insights here and we'll bring you the latest as a press conferences will be taking place throughout the day on this issue with these\nOr does it their terrorist uh they're ... they're they're not attacks and that they they didn't\nAchieve their go if they didn't achieve a goal of violence however they're terrorists and that they do terrorize people\nAnd they're meant to intimidate and dominate the news ah and get attention and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what went down\nA with a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign uh it's heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santas and Andrew Gillum\nAnd now it's tightening Gillum had opened up a sizeable lead over on the fantasy congressmen that all important governorship\nIn the sunshine state and now it's you know about six points and Andrew Gillum is now having to explain themselves and given the fact that he lied on TV about accepting gifts\nOr from a lobbyist well it turns out that the land developer that he believed was land developer it turns out it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him and it looks like he had\nWalked right into the trap and\nOut it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him and it looks like he had\nWalked right into the trap and I guess thought he could get away with lying about it I don't ... to me this whole thing is it's very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... but with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors [noise]\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so Andrew Gillum and finding himself in a heap of trouble and of course is playing the

fear they give it a few talking points that are already given to them on the way by immigration activists and then they get waved another country they get a driven to a bus depot they get a bus ticket and then they're off\nSo why wouldn't all of Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras eventually figure out a way to get to the border and come into the United states they're not going to be deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then\nThey have sanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked up by ice and deported so we're making\nIt an obvious choice for\nPeople who want to come to the United states and not go through legal channels we're we're we the people of this country if we don't get leaders in place who do this job right then we're going to see our country ultimately lost to illegal immigration we have now more than twenty two million people\nWho are illegal aliens living in the United states many of them are children who then have family ties here they've worked here are some of them criminals from the lion's share or not but they are here\nAnd they're not going anywhere so the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border at this point it might I mean you can see the art and it's just easier at this point you say we don't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want\nI don't think most people want that there was a great piece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans\nMost just published yesterday and the reason for this is that\nIllegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work\nBlack Americans most just published yesterday\nAnd the reason for this is that most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work\nIn the low skilled labor market first and because black American labor force it so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector of the same urban areas where illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlap in competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skilled black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers' wages are under\nCut by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fake Social Security numbers and African Americans\nAnd other poor Americans are\nLeft to deal with this it's wildly unfair uh Bob in Florida on line four\nAnd I will tell you this ah Rhonda Santa is the only choice for Florida oh we're going to play the sound from\nA last night's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum\nCompletely and I played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and\nThose who seek political favors are political consideration which that shouldn't be ended up itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming race of course for any question about his ethics so we'll play the race card or a soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome [noise]\nToday or do you bring it up as Andrew Gillum gets elected up without a leash Florida with but that's that's just the first point but\nThe case excited about all the people she going to be down there at the border walking and people will take them into is all\nThat all those people are ...

it's neck and neck it's up to point down two points\nSo this is a tight race we're going to talk to Mike about Indiana as a ... it's a reliably red state meeting a conservative state so why should

people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or and what what is your take on this the criticism of the president it was almost instantly even though he condemned this of course and asked for national unity it was not good enough\nA and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these a package is being sent\nOn the president's been blamed for everything gets knowing knowledge when in for the main thing he's done the reason I'm running is\nUh I wouldn't be running a invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity to kind of shake the system and fix what's

popular in sixteen here among conservatives and even more so and I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh I think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to\nBecome so Trump you when you know you never you know it's been all with the liberal side of his party so uh\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract than a give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the

...\nAndy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened in fact I wasn't stopped by the security they would have been dozens dead\n[laughter] exactly I mean it to me of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the cabinet hearings and olive is challenging Democrats and these red states or the amount of just absolute negative lives and distortions\nSchumer's packs dump into George Soros and the rest of 'em uh\nI think it's exposed an ugly underbelly of what they're about which is a lack of any message completely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold him accountable I think the Kavanaugh hearings for who's yours would have been part\nThe point where our race changed in many others I think enough was enough for him they related back to my race and many others I saw something Fox dead on across the board the negative advertising that just swamped the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because he has absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or grow our prosperity earned forced the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to\nPersonal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade he won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'm going to be a great example my race I took on the health insurance companies about ten years ago to\nMake sure you know be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail but your big government hooked up with big healthcare specifically insurance covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nLaura health premiums flat for ten years and then the absolute truth and\nKind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative actually might have a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was made it consumer driven made a transparent the kind of things that you'd like in free markets\nYou know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was made it consumer driven made a transparent the kind of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result that I go to the Senate I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race against the guy like Joe Donnelly and it's been\nA career politician but it's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progressive results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on his heels and constantly apologizing ... that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like some of like a John Case that coups forever back on the heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on and and I think it's ...\nWell on since pass the time and we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from a large the other thing you're going to get as its agenda\nReally heals and I talk about tax reform but I Do think it's incumbent upon conservatives business owners now you got more Django in your pocket share it with your employers we've done that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping them for ten years and preach out all the time but you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated we've had ten months people now adding up more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us\nThat have gone gone out there and touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employers\nPeople quit looking to the false hope of a federal government but the\nDemocrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really put us on the brink of\nA financial calamity if we don't get more people in there that are going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going in there will be more of us I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and\nJoining the Trump train so\nWell we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race\nOr the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana you got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the polls sold for ... dancing economy and an America that's growing that's more confident and\nGot to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the polls sold

Institute for Near East policy former treasury official K. to very good evening to Malcolm in I've been arguing you know because we are getting in your presence between break\nIn the break about what we're going to start with ... I Want to start with a swift Malcolm ... swift and why is it part of\nA ... on November fourth said everybody is pointing to good evening to [noise]\nFor pleasure to be with you I'm so said swift is a financial messaging Curtis um it is I like to kind of explain it is it's like an email um it just carries a message from one thing to another state the predominant way in which banks send financial messages\nAnd financial messaging services are one of the activities that provision of financial messaging service to Iran it's one of the activities that will become sanctioned up all at the end of this wind down period that we're in right now that ends on November fourth so as a November fifth that would be think shovel activity [noise]\nTo to do other alternatives ... outside of the switch swift which you can use to force the zero important policy been\nSo so I should take a step back and look at the last round of sanctions um I Know the last round of sanctions twist um did cut off a number of Iranian banks and so that's what the U. S. is seeking to the again at least in part\nA what we saw then was that there are other ways to send messages and in fact a without the underlying relationships between banks that messaging services don't mean very much so if you think of the email analogy\nI could send you an email um but if you don't know me or don't want to have a relationship with me or not necessarily going to respond to it so it's not the way in which funds or move to just the way in which messages there that\nUm if you look at when the sanctions relief was put in place as another good way to consider it so a lot of of of people thought that when Iran was given access again to this with class\nSome relief was put in place is another good way to consider it so\nA lot of of of people thought that when Iran was given access again to the swift platform that it would be like turning on a switch and all of a sudden Iranian banks it'd be reconnected to the international financial system but of course that we didn't see that\nA lot of things for or wary to reconnect with Iran a for a variety of reasons that were uh in some way it's related to sanctions overhang but it related to all kinds of other concerns and dealing dealing with Iran\nAnd so does underlying relationships didn't necessarily materialize\nWhat we've seen since the U.S withdrawal from the uh the Iran deal in may that even though it's banks that did re engage most of them have had since withdrawn those relationships are so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily matter as much it's not a silver bullet\nUm if the banks won't uh aren't willing to do that the business anyway\nAnd I think that that actually the announcement that the special purpose vehicle that the Europeans have had said they're going to put in place um to try to maintain a financial linkage with Iran when the sanctions reimpose\nIs kind of an individual indication and acknowledgement um that those banks with or without swift aren't going to do it and they're trying to find an alternative even though it's essentially a barter system that they're proposing\nThen not likely to be very effective given to pissed records but I'm Wondering if you are two things one we know that he run look for ways to evade any kind of restrictions\nSo we see you know on the world where they're they're turning to disable do tracking system oldest we do if you don't see the destinations volumes and it was a swift also means for us to track\nThe money flowing unit in Iran so those who raised a concern that we're going to lose that information you know valuable information for tracking the Iranians use the general trinity means to do so\nSo uh first I think that that some of the the the conversation around losing access to to to tracking Iranian activity it's it's a little bit of a a a Garbo and there's there's two things that are apples and oranges there's a program called the Tara finance tracking um\nI'm Sorry to hear that the terrified of tracking program that uh that the Treasury Department and ministers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from sweater subpoena that can be searched to look for terrorist finance\nA shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from swept under subpoena that can be searched to look for terrorist financing activity um and that's that's a separate kind of program ah\nThis this and that continued when a Iran was taken off of swift previously under the previous round of sanctions\nUm so I think that those are two issues that are getting mixed but but on the issue of Iranian beige and of course first of all there's other ways that they can send these messages and that they did last time whether it's by facts or email or any way just to to signal that they want to move on from here to their\nBanks that are willing to take the sanctions risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November fifth are probably going to do so regardless of whether or not ever on his on this program ...\nNo no our our our don't want us to run out of time and we did not ask about the efficacy of the sanctions so far\n... you should do to address that in your opening about the first round I mean we we try to keep track of the companies that have pulled out we tried to report because people don't know would you judge the effort to see the first round of sanctions successful and really impacting the target you saw\nSo I think that's a really important question and we as we approach November fifth because I've I think one of the thing to remember is that there were these two Ninety Days and a hundred and eighty day wind down periods and what that meant is that businesses had that period to to pick an elite any business that had been allowed that they were doing\nAnd that a lot of of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and end with drill and so I'm In terms of of assessing the ethic and see it but I think you've already seen a lot of pressure um that that's going to be brought to bear through for the first\nYear the sanctions that went back and play it's August ... well before then it says you're going you know we've probably seen a lot of the impact\nUm that we're going to see a as of November fifth ah because this activity should have a already stopped and in fact\nBecause this idea of sanctions snap back within which was written into the J. C. P. away perhaps not foreseen and that's the way up but most terms that that that would have really engaged would have had plans on the shelves to put in place to to quickly wind down to business\nGot

China\nI'm John ... China\nFirst story that looks positive for vice president of China visiting Israel to whatever\nIt is a I think a very interesting story because it's kind of thing that gets very little attention but I think long term has great significance\nBecause for for a number of years there's been a an organization to Israel China joint committee on commission on innovation\nAnd cooperation and said this is the body that meet annually and was under the guidance of a very high ranking Chinese official but the government of trying to clearly\nHas upgraded this and designated a vice president who's I think the number eight in the hierarchy to come a ... a a ... and I think is his name as I said a very significant player very close to the present Jean\nAnd he came and visited and publicly appeared with the prime minister and that they opened a conference at the Paris center in Maine for the late president of Israel Shimon Peres who appeared in a hologram and gave a spiritual will because as you know he was always the one talking about nano technology and\nAll sorts of a visionary or have used for Israel inserting Israel as technological ... and it strengthened even ... there are many others came\nA but the relationship with China to Israel despite the fact that on the run into other things are tensions and the investment in the nineties it was fifty million dollars Chinese investment in Israel in sixteen it in in twenty sixteen it was a sixteen and a half billion dollars\nAnd so the trade is growing a all the time they trade with the Arab world is like a hundred and Seventy one billion but the difference is that that's mostly sale of consumer goods lower end goods with Israel it's high tech I T a and you know there are restrictions because Israel ... doesn't sell military technology\nOr but health care and and um other things that that can be beneficial\nAs sustainable development and things that the that China really needs and they find the news where they bought a dairy from Israel because they found out that the cows give more milk and they they are now working cooperatively in many areas and it's the same time they still have a relationship with the Palestinians to vote in the un with them\nMilk and they they are now working cooperatively in many areas\nAnd it's the same time they still have a relationship with the Palestinians to vote in the un with them um but no longer have the pressure you know that the Arab states are demanding that as a condition or or um ... ... in any way restrict the access to Israel\nSo this is the I think reflective of a bigger change that doesn't get noted that but I think long term you know a hundred and fifty thousand Chinese visited Israel this year you know when you were there we saw the delegations every other\nUh if I read in the economist okay Hi Betsy my that's my we used to read the economists look at America from mother Britain right [noise]\nI read it in the economists that there is fresh concern in Israel\nAbout Chinese espionage just about Chinese or interference in\nIntellectual property because they really start up nation there's even a building that the Chinese workers are working on in Tel Aviv that is part of the national security apparatus and there's concern there as well\nMalcolm it's not an idle concern the economists said that the prime minister is freshly moving on this so while there is an investment dollars\nAnd jak laws present\nA impossible to ignore the fact that if you were going to choose a country that gave you access to American technology he would choose Israel because of the relationship between the two countries I think\nYou're right on all counts in and the concern is there it's actually universally true in most other countries because the Chinese have a record in that regard I Do think that there are those who are trying to counter it into a tablet should a different platform I met with\nChinese business people who who are very interested in coming ... are working with Israel building tourism to Israel and from Israel but there is a universal concerned that that technology has often been stolen from American companies as well and because that's what Israel has its main export yet it is is it\n... as as the knowledge economy say knowledge base it correctly and and the Chinese agents of the Communist Party are bad actors when it comes to my knowledge economy right\nSo so those restrictions and that is why they don't deal in the technology in the military technology areas and they have restrictions on it except things that can be used for\nAll right I'm not I'm not the prosecutor I'm repeating what I read in the economist perhaps I misunderstood I don't know if it's true let's go to China and let's go to China because there is at a bank and China that has closed its doors I think they even caught the fingers\nUps I misunderstood I don't know if it's true let's go to ... let's go to China because there's such a bank and China that has closed its doors I think they even caught the fingers of an Iranian agent trying to get into the door and then they say at the end they slammed the door and a tattered what may laugh\nWhile I think it's part of our own going effort to get people to understand how the sanctions are working and even in the countries that were least likely to to adhere to it we see that the Chinese ships now are are at least a turning off their trade sponsors as well but some of them will not carry Iranian oil\nAnd the and other countries as well but now we see a key Chinese bank and ... it's the bank of ... but it's it's very important because it's controlled\nBy the state ... energy groups the ... sea and they they uh had stopped euro denominated transactions with Iran and while ago but now they stopped US Currency\nAh this is a a really important indication that the uh sanctions and what's coming up in different before that we discussed earlier this evening\nI'm with Catherine Power and others\nIs really a even in advance of of the application\nI'm already affecting so many companies and so many banks insurance shipping others who take this seriously and and the predictions that I saw from the ... the assistant secretary of treasury under secretary of treasury who's in charge of this of the sanctions\nUm they they are a seriously applying it you know the treasury has this office\nOn terror finance they have seven hundred professionals they're tracking capital and tangible assets and the transfer ability a bill of ... of these assets to keeping track to make sure\nThat the terrorists in Iran don't benefit from ah the salad and profit from these things and this move by a Chinese Man could of others follow it's increasingly turning the news on the options open to Iran to avoid the sanctions quickly we have\nLess than a minute for the last time you mentioned that there was a ... in a rupture and and a disruption between Jordan and Israel over a long standing peace deal\nThe twenty twenty fifth anniversary is coming up next year so they had to Jordan has declared one year in advance which is what the deal required\nThat there are two piece of land that were released Israel under ... and Jordan was given sovereignty as part of the deal it was expected be renewed it's used for agricultural purposes by Israeli farmers to 'em but now Jordan is demanding that the they take full control\nPart of the deal it was expected to be renewed it's used for agricultural purposes by Israeli farmers to 'em but now Jordan is demanding that they take full control\nThey said that it will not and they've gone to great lengths now in the last couple of days so that could affect the peace treaty today Eighteen young
