to the news fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's let them I guess ... this morning is ... is a spokesman for the pike county sheriff's office in\nThe morning or good morning Jason you doing today very well thank you how about yourself oh\nAll right so you're at the end of October Dwight and we talked to several weeks ago once the county passed the new ordinance concerning uh a hands free digital devices and texting while driving things like that bring this kind of up to speed and remind everybody what the ordinance says for for the county to begin with\nSure well ah this Friday November second the county ordinance goes into effect\nAnd very simply a and it's all one sentence or a overview of the violation a person's Sean I drive a motor vehicle while holding in his or her hand typing on or otherwise manually operating a portable communications device\nAnd are those are the definition on communications device includes core cell phones personal digital assistant device with normal day to access the laptop computer pager electronic game or computing device so pretty much runs the gamut\nSo again that goes into effect for the county this Friday November second\nOkay now first of all I just wanted to clarify a question that we had that came in this does not include something like a CB radio was over I\nKnow there are some exemptions and are essentially to a radio uh type activity is exempted so no uh and and this also includes radio communication that's done with the\nFolks in in a mobile fleets where they have to weigh radios and things like that that is also exempted driving on private property is exempted the one thing that ah folks have also question is well if I pull over quickly on the road and make a call\nIs that exempted and yes it is [noise] uh but you must pull off the roadway\nQuestion is well if I pull over quickly on the road and make a call is that exempted and yes it is [noise]\nUh but you must pull off the roadway and according to the ordinance have your vehicle and park and operate your hand held communications device so that sort of a technicality but of course the idea is just to get you off the road\nOkay so so far though this has been a this was passed by the county board of supervisors almost a month ago right which is why it's going into effect this coming friday and it was just wondering what the sheriff's department is seen so far in terms of reaction and also a ... year deputies and seen out on the road since this is starting up\n[noise] well the reactions been mostly positive I think some folks have question uh well if it's gonna be cell phones and\nCommunication devices what other distractions do we need to address eating while driving reading a book which you know I Believe it or not I I've seen on the road things like that\nWhat we found and obviously the board consider this as many other towns and cities that that is at the level of distraction using a cell phone is much higher than it is with some of these other things that you're doing in your car and honestly I I've noticed that myself a few times when I've had to be on the phone\nFor a work related matters talking to our dispatcher and driving and I tell you you just sometimes they'll drive a mile and and just kind of forget\nWhere you are with intersections you just went through because you're concentrating on the phone so it it is very dangerous there's no doubt about it and I think that's why ah the board decided it's time to uh get an ordinance out and and hopefully the state's gonna follow suit at some point\nYou're deputies said anything about any habits changing out on the road that they've seen so far in the past month maybe more people pulling over or something like that\nNot specifically they have not to report it anything back to me we will\nSee how it goes a beginning a friday as far as ah any activity with a vehicle stops\nAnd citations the sheriff share of master's indicated he really wants to Japanese to use discretion and uh with initially prefer a warning but leaves it up to the devotee to make the final call and of course if you're driving your radically\nA in and out of your lane are not paying attention following too closely and you're on a cell phone and the deputy is able to see that very likely you're going to get ...\nIn and out of your lane are not paying attention following too closely and you're on a cell phone and the deputy is able to see that very likely you're going to get cited for the movie in violation and they distracted driving violation so um it's just something to be aware of\nOkay All right well we're going to pause briefly for an important message here on the morning report and when we come back we want to build into this a little bit further because the deadline is approaching and this is going to go into effect at the end of the week for us right now let's pause we'll be right back\nBy this is John ... with the the ... did you know there are thousands of businesses in Prescott in each one is needed significant investment in our city that's why in the city Prescott independent the chamber of commerce and union other organizations to promote shop\nPrescott third year this campaign is designed to remind shoppers or local brick and mortar businesses have all kinds of moon gold shot printed signs in Norway nose on science throughout in around Prescott most importantly support local brick and mortar businesses throughout the year\nWe're back here on the news fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's in a lot of them I guess why do you have a link from the county sheriff's office concerning\nThis new ordinance going into effect on friday and this is concerning the a hands free digital devices and things like that now also just because it was passed in the county where do we stand in terms of the towns in the area to like\nWell my understanding is that I don't have specific details as that uh the city of Prescott did pass an ordinance uh they've added\nA couple of things that are a little bit different from the county from what I understand but ah and I'm not sure when it goes into effect but uh I Do know they're\nOffering and grace period a up and through January first I also understand uh against secondhand information the town of Chino may have passed a similar ordinance in Prescott valley was looking at it this week so bottom line is to avoid any problems as do not\nHave a communications device in your hand when you're driving that just solved the issue as you go through these different jurisdictions\nOkay now one thing also very quickly this is the kind of a violation that a deputy can pull you over for immediately it's not a secondary violation correct\nYeah good point it is a primary violation so even though a deputy may see a in some cases a ... as I spoke before some type of a hazardous driving situation and then sees the use of the communications device if that's all they see is the uh the cell phone ...\nOf a hazardous driving situation and then sees the use of the communications device it that's all they say is the uh the cell phone main news they'll be able to stop you for that violation alone and either site or warn\nOkay All right well Dwight also wanted to just touched briefly on the fact that Halloween is coming up this week and we know it's a big county and there's a lot going on so what do you have to say the people who are out and about the on Halloween to do those who are driving and those were walking [noise]\nWell be extra careful as we go through this every year warning folks and fortunately we have\nVery few instances where where people are hurt but\nWhat we're trying to encourage parents and guardians to do is to sit down with your uh children ahead of time give them an idea of what you expect out there\nThey need to be extra careful not run across the street not run across the street without warning watch for cars so on and so forth and of course for the drivers just watch your your speech and be fully aware in these neighborhoods and of course going with that I was just talking about [noise]\nDon't use your phone when you're driving around these neighborhoods are that just adds another level of distraction and could result in a in a real problem so be extra careful out there and watch for the kids and a well hopefully get through this without uh any major problems\nAlright worldwide gambling that's all the time we have on the morning report runs thank you for your time and good luck to you and the

three Seventy two Seventy two let's go now to sue sue welcome to show their own\nThanks for taking my call and thank you for allowing God help us I have a lot\nAbout my sister she's fifty five years old and she started six weeks ago and I thought what a stomach virus than she ... had diarrhea for about two weeks she kept getting more than ... diagnosed her about\nThree weeks ago with the death calling and I read her only seven days and she kept telling them she was getting worse but anyway she spent in the hospital and she came out yesterday or white count dropped at one point three [noise]\nThey found out the only did she have that he had salmonella also\nAnd she feel having diarrhea white count is only up to now and she's having a lot of ... it's ... like I said our home own pro or all ...\nA really really concerned because he doesn't think he's gaining much ground and I was wondering what your ideal on this or what can we do to help her\nMom and so she's taking they sooner homeless a pro\nYeah she's she's on the phone now at the antibiotic she sounds like they said that one would help out the salmonella\nYeah that's what we'll do but what about ... are they saying that they they feel like they've got to see this house well call\nTourists didn't show up say the F. this time but he said that sometimes antibiotics can math flat and cover it up but she does Neal Madden screenings green water or you stole that's why she\nTo have her on the program I mean that's not going to cover for for some knows for sure [laughter] so I mean they got everything they're doing everything they can\nThey have on the set pro I mean that's I mean that's going to cover for for salmonella for sure\n[noise] so I mean they got everything that they're doing everything they can that's why they're not keeping her there because if she's somewhat stable and then all they've got to do is punish killing off the bacteria and they just there's no reason to sit around ... will go home [laughter] so you're wondering is there anything else you can do on\nTop of that I can start after coming out [noise]\nYeah I mean they absolutely she can I mean technically when you're taking antibiotics you can take probiotics as well that's kind of a standard just because it it won't really interfere they don't just keep replenishing\nHis along as far as far as the pro or any antibiotic it's going to wipe out everything and neutralize the guts\nAnd robotics obviously you're just gonna keep good bacteria and there can only help her digestion and and that sort of thing and it's smart to use probiotics when when you're coming off of a round of antibiotics but you know obviously I Would do with our family dog in in discuss some of that but I mean as far as where she's doing right now that what the hammer on sounds\nIs towns you know like the standard of care so I mean I wouldn't\nI wouldn't really pushing the diet and everything else building the immune system up that you know pushing him for a lot of water all the basic things she says she just would I Would watch your diet if you're asking my thoughts on it it was me and that's what I Would do as well I'd watch what she's eating making sure she's eating non inflammatory foods you know the whole thing when you're dealing with a bacterial infection of any kind\nTo just eat whatever and don't worry about it I'm not a big fan of that I think you have to be really careful things you eat obviously bland food but [noise] but even so much getting salt in\nLet me when I say salt and she had high blood pressure\nOkay yeah I mean like ... like chicken broth and beef broth and that sort of thing when you're going through recovering those are really good for the just stepping on those throughout the day along with drinking plenty of water helps the electrolytes the body and that can help build the body up so there's some things to consider\nUm being might want to do some research on that but I mean with the death\nYou know it's about killing the bacteria but at the same time you want to keep the body restored as much as possible and and eat healthy foods that you know just common sense things there's there's no silver bullet I guess if you're asking me for a silver bullet\nThere's really not one for this they'd given her the silver bullet [laughter] they pulled the wife is out there\nThat kind of how how long\nHow many ah when did they get rid of this the ah\nThey pulled the wife is\nThat kind of how how long they're going to kind of get over there\nHow many ah when did they get rid of this the or so from\n[laughter] because I [noise] I'm\nPlanning on week yeah no I'm typically typically just depends on how many of those antibiotics typically tend to fourteen days so she's looking she's looking at ... probably a couple of weeks to to be completely recovered that that's what's typical and you know obviously\nYou know as far as that goes depending on how strong your immune system isn't and what kind of lifestyle habits she does for the next couple of weeks that will play a big role too so just Korean you'll get a healthy environment for a body to to thrive in that would really be me my thoughts on it\nSo I mean I think that she's she's had some of the best care she can she can get is what they've done is I mean again this is just my thoughts but it sounds like everything's standard of care right down the line which that they're going to follow everything it's evidence based anyway\nSo I Would just encourage or be a cheerleader and and just you know make sure she's not eating much fast food [laughter] just basics and and there are things you can keep her body strengthened in the middle of it all but I'm Glad you called for her I mean just so you know there are some natural things that can help\n'em I mean but at this point with all the antibiotics she's had it not going to do it it wouldn't be worth looking into I don't think like ... silver and some of the other there's some other all formulas and all but it's not even worth talking about because what she's doing right now\nIt's the big guns so she's got everything they've put in her to make it happen so it's just about blood and all of that medicine\nDo its thing and then her making the right choices every single day to you know to make yourself healthy and make better choices and all that sort of thing so keep me posted in and I'm Glad you called for her and she would appreciate that as well and\nNow we're thinking about her by police and Bloomingdale, Illinois she writes my doctor just an email\nIs diagnosed me with low tar road function and wants me to put me on sense Roy that hypo ... what do you think what I think I'm sure your doctor is not an idiot and they you know definitely want to do the right thing that standard of care by the way I remember it's what you're dealing with so there are some other options you can look out for low soured function\nAnd not an idiot and they feel definitely want to do the right thing that standard of care by the way I remember it's all you're dealing with so there are some other options you can look out for lunch hour function with iodine

that's going on\nAnd I just didn't interest in life and we burn up a lot of zinc for testosterone\nSo this one of the reasons that that happens and then also with any kind of skin condition you want

are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime they've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number

number of murders more murders at any time in Tallahassee history\nAnd I'd been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because\nAt the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum and uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities and they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow in a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection the Senate uh in Florida how concerned are you about\nThe allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\n[noise] some I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for\nFor Andrew because I think folks will uh who may not otherwise one vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the ... regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama should be paying for his travel expenses that come down and don't forget you know we have the president\nOr the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida\nAnd then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas\nUm you know that put the race away for cat that I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWe'll get one is silver Tunde order I mean it's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice to that um about about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tested he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen\nTo my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\nAt Santa spoken first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at racist conferences not calling this a dissent it's races I'm simply saying that race to believe he's a racist\nAnd of course they are are loving\nHe has spoken a racist conferences not calling this a dissent is the races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course they are our\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today um there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel these anti Israeli organization supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers\nAre of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli\nGroups supporting Gillum honey respond [noise] like\nI mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew was the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott by best and sanction of the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they have special trips a\nJust a target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of God's strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice\nUm and that law enforcement should be to find it so that's what he said I'm In terms of the pledge he signed on but I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course at the FBI agent as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption and turned\nMight have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course at the FBI agent is part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption and turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks\nBut want to Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said this last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff well then it turns out just a couple of days later\nThere was a text message is showing he acknowledged that its price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton\nWas actually paid for by an undercover FBI agent who he thought was a was a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago\nThat that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote it almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Dylan's nation governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nDisclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigator and being investigated but I Would ask the question what other reason what an undercover agent have\nFor Greece and its bombs with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating don't that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nThe laser ... down to some really simple in these last closing day is such a sleazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politicians jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need for do you need a lot of ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurants it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida than definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled\nIt's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership it's not it is\nAnd it's unparalleled it's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama want to be Gillum for good leadership it's not\nIt is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan you heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you've got your diagram that sends\nA but ... but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll\nShows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better\nThirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life force in forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states\nAh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants in the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the uh care about\nWell this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance or the nearest refuge they rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum\nA support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday that we need to welcome in the Caribbean and in the United states um and so you couldn't have a more stark difference um for borders Andrews for open borders I Want to support our men and women and if he wants to abolish ice\nWell again this is a this is an issue that I think the American people are following very closely I'm Andrew Gillum actually speaking now in Miami and I'm ... down there a Kamala Harris stumping with him right now so they they see this race a congressman\nAs absolutely critical for not just the state of Florida now but for twenty twenty

we have a United we had the unified development code meeting I did this morning how do you feel about the science at our everywhere\nI think there are of noxious\nUm you know I I I get it I\nI think that the signs in public right away or or particularly irritating to me and and I said to myself I said if if if one of my science ends up in public right away up personally go take it there yeah because I just I just don't think that that's what\nThat portion of Prescott ought to be used for\nYou know and I and I agree I think it's on private property that that ... that you know the property owners right to do whatever but we can't look at content so if you allow any sign him to public right away\nYou can't take any of them you can't take any of 'em down see by that I mean if there is a political science or real estate sign it's a it's a sign that's obnoxious or you\nCan't just allow real estate signs or you know political science you have trouble never bother you if you allow signs in the public right away you\nCan never judged by content so you know and I I Believe you know science to me are afraid to freedom of speech issue but should not be in the right away\nWell you know science to me don't necessarily make people let's say vote for a certain sanity what they do is I think that that they assure the candidate supporters that they want\nTo make a difference in in when the alerts\nLike Egypt I mean I ... I Love the political science I just think they should not be in public\nOwners that they want\nTo make a difference in in when the alerts like Egypt\nI mean I ... I Love the political science I just think they should not be in public right away and that's where they all are today oh yeah and so we know we can set that example we run next year about where they should be and where they shouldn't be and it's easier to do with the local level\nYou know my my attitudes of the tricks assigned to you know get somebody to vote for you and that's pretty bad\nWell I think it does you know you have a lot of supporters and I think it does show your supporters to borders around ... minutes so we have a messy calling in and we actually have to take a break so we are going to come back and uh and talk with let's see um but before we go Steve I thought you meant a great comment or question\nAt city council meeting and that was how can we tell where the right away is and it's very complicated so and all you know due diligence to the candidates they need to find out\nWell that's exactly where the kitten was shooting that needs to let people know where the right of way of life and where they don't want\nSon and and they need to they need to elect candidates now so that's the discussion that we need to have and uh when we come back Betsy hold on we're going to take a break and when we come back we'll talk with you about the jails to appreciate your calling in\nRussia might think that that's a perfect subject for it's a very timely subject\nFor now it is so and lie for one Winter Olympic ups we'll\nBe right back [noise]\nThis is Tom we believe the projects true value stir rice story here first country value the forty six Miller [noise]\nYou do your best to protect your loved ones and while you may keep it fresh bettering your smoke detector and have a reliable home security system there is a whole different type of protection you might be missing a life insurance policy from the owner's insurance is a way to safeguard your loved ones now and in the future\nSmoke detector and have a reliable home security system there was a whole different type of protection you might be missing\nA life insurance policy from auto owner's insurance is a way to safeguard your loved ones now and in the future mate with your local independent agent and secure policy today to protect their is tomorrow Hi this is Corey Rosemont which I was chosen insurance we're one of the only locally owned independent insurance agencies in Prescott come see us today at four hundred whites by road or call for four or five\nForty six hundred\nWhen you smile do you like to weigh your teeth look\nAre you wearing loose warned oriole fitting dentures\nAre you missing teeth you would like to replace or are you just long overdue for that dental visit an advance dental center we can help I Am Dr David Edwards than I Am truly privileged to have located in my practice and beautiful Prescott, Arizona for over Eighteen years that has been my passion and pleasure to get people back or a smile at advanced dental center we have years of clinical experience placing dental implants\nReplacing dentures and creating beautiful smiles we have the latest technology including lasers three D. imaging and the ... system which allows us to make rounds in a single visit\nDon't like going to the dentist in our office we can help even the most anxious of patients feel comfortable are friendly courteous staff we'll put you with these I'm confident we can help you with all of your dental needs for our K why ca listeners we're offering a free consultation\nFor dentures or implants call advance dental center today nine to eight seven seven eight zero nine seven zero or visit us online at Prescott dental dot com\nThat's Prescott dental dot com\nYou've heard a lot about ... but it's really a very simple equation problem one twenty seven makes you pay more problem one twenty seven in ...

line autonomy wanted to talk about science\nWhich I Am yes he's still\nStuck out my idea about solving the problem I think I read somewhere in the paper that the city employees to identify these signs on right away there they are unable to pick up the signs they have to notify the campaign I'm of the people that have put signs or is that\nCorrect that's correct and that's actually state law\nIs a state law it is yeah okay yeah so\nWhat I was going to suggest as if it were something that was local just demand the law that ... that city workers may pick them up\nRight and and we can if it's if it's blocking vision like there was one that was on Ross her and and I called because you couldn't see because to sign was liking the vision so we can ... the police can go and removes nose or code embarrassment but you're right\nBut it's hard enough that we suffer all of the ads on TV and radio that's isn't that bad so bad around Prescott and what's your second you know if it if we could use the time and effort of the city employees to pick 'em up right up there I'm\nI'm you know that would solve that problem if we can't do it\nIf we could use the time and effort of the city employees to pick 'em up right up there on the um you know that would solve that problem if we can't do it it is there a way to weaken Amanda a state law to say that a local city workers can pick them up\nYou know and and that basically is um the legislature our legislature and a half to pass sat and of course you know we had the state of Maricopa has\nThat most of the legislators in it and I will tell you when I was I was in Scottsdale not too long ago and there are tons of science there too and they're all end up right away there on their on post I mean it's even worse than it is here if you can imagine\nYou know I get on the other question yeah you have to shut down the fires writes ways which I think Steve indicated um and it's your legal to have those sites on there wouldn't be who for citizens like myself to be able to grow up and pick them up\nWell actually I think if you pick up a sign it would you would actually be breaking the law so you don't want to go to that yeah no I don't want to do that I Know you know I mean we either\nChange I mean if if there is something that um doesn't allow us to do something that makes sense in his logical like city workers picking up these ... let's change the law\nAnd that's why I think you know private property I think you know that's everybody's rights to get permission that people should have to get permission to put a sign rare but to do what what what's happening today I'd like to see that that'd be changed and then did\nThe time you said you said a couple of ... a couple of things makes makes sense and logical and and when it comes to a particularly state government I I really wonder if those are words that they understand\nYou're skeptical stays on the other\nThing that I was thinking about order ordering a far I mean we have a lottery laws in the city of Prescott but yet we have folks are almost full shore panhandlers\nThat sit on the corner of let's say it's a street corner and ordering an actual legal\nAnd shouldn't we be able to make the move off you know off the property but it just seems to me that we have laws that are on the books that could solve these problems but we don't we don't enforce\nPrivate property to private property owners\nHave laws that are on the books that could solve these problems but we don't we don't enforce\nTheir private property to private property owners can ask someone to move our to to not do that but that's you know public sidewalk unless that person becomes aggressive are kind of in your face there's really nothing that can be done for him it was really ...\nYeah but lord or his Law Order and if you look at the definition that somebody sitting there not doing a whole lot for for any purpose for the rich are on private property the guy I can sit there all day long for the public property yes I think if I'm reading middle ... correctly um they're not allowed to do that\nWell you know there's the lawyer in law and then there's free speech and and and what's interesting is these folks know their rights and um you know if they're being obnoxious then you can use the lord ... if if if not then they're out there with their free speech rights and I don't agree with it but that's reality on\nThe right time we need to take a break but we really present you with us they have some pre she ended up marrying weak and Bob they'd be able to

to me and and before we left we were going to talk a little bit about um [noise]\nA trading decay and how they do that these days at a the dentist office so that the German\nSo um do a lot of times if you're going to the dentist regularly we can catch the decay small enough and we can reverse it without doing anything\nOkay stop I don't want to interrupt you but stop for say on there when we when you come to the dentist often enough I was that's one thing I forgot to write down I asked for sure what should people do about making\nYou know how often should they go to the dentist to be sure that they're doing about what you're getting ready to talk about and and that's to avoid decay\nUnfortunately it's not all the same answer for everybody everybody's an individual and so oppressive Dennis you were looking at you as a whole person\nSome people are going to have high risk factors and we went want to see him every four months um for most people every six months is good and for some of the population that are that haven't had a cavity ever in their life for the ... have really good meticulous or hygiene once a year might be fine but probably six months is a is a good average\nSo you so okay that's what I Do once every six months just 'cause okay so [noise] All right so on and general speak and generally speaking we once every six months would be you should be able to catch now let's get back to the gay thing I Apologize yeah interrupted\nSo um if we catch it early enough if it if the if the decay is limited to the outer layer the tooth enamel it's reversible that portion of your tooth is Ninety eight percent minerals so\nIf we can get more minerals in their rubs some ... ... on there some other stuff you know\nWe also have probiotics that we can change the bacteria content if you don't have a specific type of bacteria in your mouth is to creating acid as its waste you're not going to get to ... and so we can do things to try to change the bacteria in your mouth micro biome or body is so powerful when it gets out of whack bad things happen\nAnd so there's ways that we can try to get that healthy again we have um other components that have lots of minerals and then that we have a a a product that we used it's has milk protein in it it's called ... and that has calcium and phosphate in it\nUm other components that have lots of minerals and then that we have a a a product that we use its has milk protein in it it's called Keynesian and that has calcium and phosphate in it the kind of help push minerals and your tooth [noise]\nUm my favorite thing that I recognize patience is brushing with baking soda\nIt is a a great toothpaste and it and there's two ways that we can push minerals and your teeth one is we can put a really high concentration minerals outside your ... outside of cheat the kind of have um slide down hill ended the teeth and the other is with with acid in would would acids and would basis so cavities or cause when there's an acid next the tooth for too long\nAnd that leeches the minerals out if we can increase the al ... in your mouth and for\nA longer amount of time they will you be able to push the minerals in that way and so baking soda is a phenomenal toothpaste to be able to push minerals back into your teeth it's about a thousand times more alkaline between a thousand ten thousand times more alkaline than what your teeth need to be able to be healthy\nAnd so I tell them spit and don't rinse then you're keeping that in there for a longer amount of time and your natural saliva has all the minerals that it needs\nAnd and it will push those minerals in your teeth in an appropriate amount\nOkay we're talking to Dr germ and I'm from Prescott dentistry here five four one one zero one six you have any questions are so far we're we've learned all kinds of really interesting thing then is a short half hour that we've been on the air um [noise] what's the worst thing for a mammal\nTo deal with you know your to your teeth what's the worst thing you can you can do\nAh it it's frequency the diet it's what's in your diet and if you're eating things that are ... our um I had a patient that she was ... she thought it was real healthy for and she was just sipping on it for about three or four hours in the morning\nAnd she came in to see me and she had decay all over the place she had several crowds and the fact that it would just rotted the teeth underneath the crowds and then when I told her I said hey you know you\nJust got eight cavities she she broke down and started crying she's like what she couldn't handle it\nAnd we just we took we take pictures of me show 'em and and I started digging deeper of you know what's changed what are you doing and she started drinking temperature and I said and ... is a it's a pro by Arctic beverage that is it's\nIn the health world it's it's it's coming on to kind of increase your but how your [laughter] your guts guts healthier and an increase your microbiomes so but it's also acidic so it's not it's not that I have anything against ... it's how she\nYour ... your your God help me God healthier and an increase your microbiomes so but it's also acidic\nSo it's not it's not that I have anything against ... it's how she was drinking okay that frequency of four hours of of basically an acid bath at a ph of about too is going to leach all the minerals on her teeth out she ... she drank the whole thing and twenty minutes\nShe'll be shooting golden yeah no problem so city overtime is is the worst thing for your name will so okay acids\nAdds to the worst thing for you know they are in your teeth so if you if you do that in moderation you should be much better shape as far as\nCavities go about kids do they do they have are things that they consume I our kids have been gone for a while uh that that have asked for them that they would normally be consuming that might cause them\nProblems yeah the acid can come from just because something doesn't have acid in it you if you had the bacteria in your mouth it can release that asked it as a waste products so most processed foods will be more easily to be more easily digested by the bacteria in your mouth and they can cause more more problems outweigh so yeah\nI recommend to whole foods whole foods diet that's the best thing for your teeth it's\nBest thing for your health and it's going to make the bacteria work harder to get those sugars out if they're going to come out slow or you're going to have less decay better health\nThe whole the whole thing holding whole foods so away so so\nWhat you're saying is that it it I guess it's just common sense it's if if you're taking care of what you're eating and what you're drinking that your teeth are just part of that whole thing and if you're doing things like you're talking about right and you're cleaning your teeth properly\nThat things should be okay as time goes by and we got like Fifteen seconds left before the end of the before the bottom of the hour break so we'll we'll talk a little bit more about this after the bottom line break so hang with us we'll be right back after these messages [noise]\nIf they're if they're drinking two gallons of water a day they're going to be getting a ... a lot more fluoride\nThen you say they were going to make bread out of the forwarded water it's another getting Floyd from their bread and they're getting four from their water\nAnd so the therapeutic dose for Ford is very low um I also don't think that\nGoing to the dentist and having putting forward varnish on your teeth and having people swallow it was a good idea because you're getting a large systemic component to it there's ... I think there's enough Floyd in the environment that doing good hygiene and doing all those things is going to be beneficial to the effectiveness support for it at reversing\nDecay only reduces or stops the K by about forty percent forty percent of the time has an\nEffect on German why do so many municipalities across the country or put fluoride in their water\nSystems because there's research that we did shown that is effective especially in the lower socioeconomic class it can reduce the incidence of decay but maybe twenty five percent\nAt a cost of about ten cents per person per year and so it's it's very effective if those are the people that are on Medicaid and they are those are the kids that are going in and the state is paying for those kids to have their cavities fixed\nThen they want they're just trying to reduce their financial liability and increase the quality of health those kids and I think it would be better to have hygiene programs in the schools getting those kids checked up earlier than putting in the water cause that does everybody that doesn't just to kids\nYeah out great great great question they said every month thank you All right we've got to take a break so Derrick hang on we'll be right back after these missions were going to talk a little bit about things that affect a lot of us that's dry mouth so hang with us\nHi this is Jim Lehrer soon I maintain that jury industry accolades certified demolished appraiser graduate demolished in registered jeweler I've spent the past forty five years\nAssembling a fabulous collection of unique and sometimes rare gemstones I create unique find gold in sterling silver jewelry for jury shopping experience you won't want to stop in today at ... jury one oh five ... an historic downtown ... are you\nFacing criminal charges such as a DUI or even something more serious yet so you need a criminal defense attorney who will protect your rights\nUm town ... are you facing criminal charges such as the DUI or even something more serious it's so you need a criminal defense attorney who will protect your rights you should call must grilled dream cat and flack for four or five five nine three five we will prepare your case\nTo provide the best defense possible I embarked troops and I'm sharing flack\nWhen you need a lawyer you want much group cats\nAnd flak press gets treated legal team Paul for four or five fifty nine thirty five\nHello northern Arizona folks ... blame brothers Arizona I'm here with my good friend inside kicked Eric ... hello Erica I'm so excited about celebrating forty years I feel so lucky to bend dressing windows around Prescott for so long Stevie\nMight watch every word that white dressing windows or the proper term okay it just sounds so Nineteen Seventy nine well I guess I'm a little old fashioned let's move on and share the best part of what's happening where kicking up our fortieth anniversary and folks can now take forty percent off blinds or shutters that okay that's pretty a blender those Arizona the original since Nineteen Seventy nine\nI can build your next custom home remodel any project you've been putting off and we're the only certified fell a door and window installer and the Prescott area high I'm Jeff Edwards with Tripoli construction\nTripoli is your source for high quality construction no matter what you need calls today at Tripoli construction seven seven eight thirty fifty six that seven seven eight thirty fifty six Tripoli construction for a job done right and integrity you can trust or the number two zero eight for for three to six or six six five\nAt Arizona you were still means something for Washington politician like more than ... it doesn't mean much at all it's bad enough\nBackpackers continents dally lying about her pony seated ... great book queen\nWhats even harder to stomach she lied about our future Sally told us she protects our medical didn't she voted for the wall Street Journal said the century [noise]\nAnd when she promised to protect millions of Arizona and to have you been condition she lied about the only times that got those protections in the insurance companies to nine people with diabetes asthma cancer\nEvery broken promise\nSally betrayed if we can't trust the Knicks Sally [noise] we can't trust her to be\nPaid for by the WW down projects that are not offering any candidate for Canada is responsible for the country but this advertising [noise]\nI don't doubt that or not and I mean he's responsible for the country just advertising\nTo the Y.

what this guy is a good and you guys are looking for somebody to take care of us because we're kind of in an era of clinics now in the community\nAnd they're not so good and they have people pretty good for your wallet before you get through the\nDoor you're not here I'm going to take care of you and I just want to shout out there and the ... of last of the community bought a couple of young

time has passed a law\nThe radio station so I listen to it and there's a lot of people that do fall the old guys like me in town and you need a dentist last year and the guy who just wanted to put it out there All right thank you for your phone number out before you go to that would be\nGood that's a good idea I think there and I also have a great thank you see I told you ducked German that um when people call they think of things that are just don't go through my little brain so uh why don't we do that right now before we go onto the next subject and to give her ... her phone number and and um you know where they can\nFind you are off his number is Ninety eight for four or five one six six zero we're also Prescott dentistry dot\nCom I'm In\nMy late nights a week for four or five one six six zero okay\nEric that was a really good phone call we really like it when people call in and there are positive and and say nice things about the our gifts and I'm Glad to where we abduction Germany or today it makes me look smart too so they have to take whatever and get 'em one one of the issues\nThen say nice things about the art gifts and I'm Glad\nI'm Glad we abduction German air today or makes me look smart too so they take whatever and get 'em one one of the issues that that happened a lot a what a lot of folks are is dry mouth so let's talk a little bit about what causes dry mouth and what you can do to help fix that\nYeah dry mouth is real tough um it's the number one side effect side effect of prescription drugs is very common and if you're fifty five an older your chances are you've had it or you've you experienced it\nAnd as we age we dry out anyway so you know so you're going to have less saliva ... how'd you get older and then if you're adding prescription drugs on top of that it can be very very challenging\nThe natural saliva in your mouth has there is no substitute there's over the counter things you can use that her saliva substitutes but they're just not as effective\nAnd so I typically will recommend that the oil oil pulling more frequently because you're going to need a little bit more help keeping the bacteria loan your mouth down and and doing the baking soda thing um there's there's also\nNatural sugars exile a tall is or you can get ... candies ... works by coming up the internal machinery of the bacteria still can't function\nThe biggest downside of his ... and you get stuck on them as you've got to take about five grams a day for it to be effective and that that does that is also going to affect your your GI tracked the uh the bacteria in your intestines and it can cause increase bloating or gas or other issues so it has it's drawbacks so\nI'm drinking lots of water don't ... not drinking acidic things renting amount of water after you drink coffee or ... or other things like that just a quick rinse with water to just get the ph in your mouth back to normal level\nOkay All right so there's some easy common things to do you don't have to have anything fancy to to fix the problem I'm necessarily\nI'd say focused on your health tried to get off your medications eat a whole foods plant based diet exercise get good rest take care of your body so your body can take care of you\n[noise] okay five four one one zero one six phone number here we've got a doctor German ... works Prescott dentistry and and he has given
