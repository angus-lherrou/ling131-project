stage work at all the same time the Ross old brick is a a person we've talked a lot about here on TALK live or even when you haven't been on the show since before you were on the show since back when uh\nThe first time we heard about you is when you were the the mom who was concerned about our friends who were holding signs outside of the the court house\nBack when Derek Jay who is one of our co host here on free talks loud was doing the jury outreach and it's like oh no Ross's mom doesn't want us holding these signs and we had to go home and and uh snow\nThat was the lawyer oh well it was no\nNot at all it was in fact you know it was thought was first day of trial the judge threaten to question the jury and and and fly to them that Ross was dangerous right and the lawyer came to us and said this is going to hurt him you've got to ask them to leave we never\nHad asked them to leave I was totally support as\nThe good thing and we did\nWe you know you don't know what you're doing it probably Earth Day and it and we're going to a federal trial Willie hadn't it wasn't going to make a difference in the right at the age that judge was going to make the other thing is they get their picture all over the media including the Drudge Report that first day\nThat weather away was but now now that was not are instigating at all okay good fat because that was the director\nOf a so rough

don't know he's the founder of the Silk Road the or the world's first underground market place a it was on tour which is the ... system or for the Internet although how ... how is it really is and we still don't know because the evidence of how the federal government found the site\nWas never presented at the trial and we could and I always have to say this whenever we talk to you in as we could spend the next three hours talking to you about what happened with the court hearings and how it was just\nFixed and screwed and railroad railroaded this new documentary we're going to get it all as much as we can but we we can only do you do so much recapping of this because we always you know we're doing a radio show and so every time we talk about this somebody news tuning in for the first time right and they've they've never heard the name Russell brick before\nThey weren't paying attention to the situation or even if they weren't paying attention to it as I found out because we pay close attention to it\nUm you still don't know everything um I was I was watching the the railroad a railroaded which is the new documentary that you guys are putting out over it free Ross started work\nUm in parts and I don't think it's quite done yet within six parts yeah six parts I'm Out in force that sorry okay more I've watched the first part I Do want to see the rest of it and when I

it's very rarely good news when we're talking to you and about your son Ross ah who is currently in federal prison for a two life sentences plus forty years sentence\nTo serve so called send a message\nTo people out there who might want to run a website for those that aren't familiar\nRoss was convicted in twenty Fifteen at this point [noise]\nUh it's been in prison now for five years [noise]\nUm that was as of early October I Believe that it was the five year mark [noise]\nAnd uh for the dastardly crime of running a website I mean that's ultimately all we're talking about here the people who sold drugs on the site got what five to ten year last sentence is less well than down yeah\nAnd he's in there for the rest of his life plus a license for forty years so it's insane and it really is a violation of you know his freedom of speech because he when he program a website That's all we're doing we're talking about here we're talking about somebody who wrote some code onto you know the Internet and then other people use that code\nTo sell things that might have been illegal in some parts of the world but you know that's a whole other story and and as far as sending a message obviously they haven't succeeded because there are I don't know half a dozen two dozen or more sites at least two that are currently an operation that are doing the exact same thing\nUh allowing people to buy and sell drugs and other things on line\nWith you know no government involvement and so we've talked about how Ross is a hero or for helping save people's lives because of the harm reduction from his site he saved people from being robbed\nA in real life drug deal gone bad he saved people who would otherwise have purchased bad drugs on the black market they got\nQuality product through uh the Silk Road that may have saved their lives because they didn't overdose on it I mean there's so many different examples of how the Silk Road was actually really\nA benefit to to mankind and your son is a hero because of that [noise] um but this is the world we live in where people who help save lives end up in prison cells and we were just getting an update from you on raw she'd been put into a a a\nBut this was the world we live in where people who help save lives end up in prison cells\nAnd we were just getting an update from you on raw she'd been put into a a protective custody due to some gang activity in the prison where they tried to coerce them into beating somebody up which he refused to do feels he's not a violent person\nUm he's a libertarian who's a peace loving person who\nSpoke as when he was ... Roberts he talked about libertarianism and so in peace when he was on the site you know he had a book club I think for ... Roberts at a book where he recommended people read books and that sort of thing about freedom so the guy's a hero\nAnd I mean I could say you know we could like I said we could do the whole three hours on this Lynn but for listeners that do want to get the full story you guys have a documentary series that has been coming out in parts it's going to be six parts you said four of the six come out it's called railroaded there's a longer title to the flower\nRailroaded the targeting engaging of raw celebrate and it's a\nIt's basically we started out thinking God there's so much people don't know including myself away and\nStarted delving into the public record or we don't have access to the seal documents that undisclosed material encrypted material the government is keeping a from anyone knowing that there's still a lot in the public record and I wonder what they have to hide\nYeah why are they hiding it I mean you know isn't it over why were they hiding but in any case I'm\nAnd started writing yeah kind of narrating at which sounds kind of boring and it's like oh narration of the public record it's really not boring it's really quite jaw dropping spreading stop\nAnd then we thought hey why not do a audio companion so we did that and that violence here support or has a professional narrator ... great\nAnd then we thought well why not have that little video of different images go along with that and so it's kind of evolved [noise]\nUm yeah check it out you can read it it's it's got over I think it's that close to four hundred foot notes it's always there's always a patient is not our opinion this is not our you know what we're saying happened this is what the record as saying\nProvided by the government\nA court documents and other things that you guys were pouring over I I was wondering how the you know the genesis of the project started dude we came from you guys originally yeah we\nIt's and other things that you guys were pouring over I I was wondering now that you know the genesis of the project started dude came from you guys originally\nYeah we're in a moment of team who just were like wow there's a lot we don't know you know and I didn't realize this and I didn't realize that that we had to pull it together if we don't know it\nYou know most people I Know it and you can't rely on the mainstream media and there are frankly often very shallow coverage of ... to actually know the truth the jury sure as hell didn't notice it right now and now they they know the judge\nThey wouldn't even let in you know some of the most important presidents and witnesses are in that case there are just did that may be Ross wasn't dread pie Roberts all the time and in fact the evidence shows pretty clearly that he was in ... but the jury wasn't allowed to know that\nAnd there was just so much that they were precluded from you know knowledge that could have helped them and making them or just decision and then once they turned in their verdict the judge threw the book at him and and now here we are where unfortunately uh you've exhausted the appeals process you went all the way up to the Supreme Court I didn't want to hear it\nUh so that's the end of that which means that there's only one more way out and that is through a presidential either a ...\nOf the sentence there is the um courts potential very hard to get a called a twenty to fifty five\nBut we're really think the best chance is a presidential commutation because this sentence is outrageous and um it's really puts everyone in peril to have this kind of excessive sentencing and also it's a horrible precedent which are in in place of\nThe criminal justice system so I think that's the thing that is keeping people caged for so long\nAnd so wrong people who've never harmed anybody else\nWhy many of them have never harmed us all up so [noise]\nSo the the railroad a documentary it's on free ... or I just got our home page and there's a banner and he's right there at the time and yeah so definitely check that out like I said I'm going to watch the whole thing I just doing it so easy to get busy so I'm Glad you're doing it in parts\nOf added wire figure nobody's going to sit and listen to the whole thing is already long\nPeople do this and if you watched the first part you're going to want to walk to them and when I watched the first part there weren't any else that a little bit so you're doing like one a week basically the ...\nAnd ... and you can just listen to it on a I tend to another cloud and stuff\nSo so video audio and uh\nOne a week basically they're Abyei on outlay and I and you can just listen to it on a I tens and other ... video audio and a print or a ... dollar for now it's like so whatever your preferred method of taking this information in are you guys have it they're free Ross dot org I'm\nThere so you you said you'd think that there's a chance I mean because to convince somebody like Donald Trump or whoever it is it follows him who Shirley won't be any better or to to let somebody go that they don't have a personal connection to I mean you really\nFor this you know I actually do because I'm President Trump has said\nThat he wants to pardon about three thousand people that have been treated unfairly by the justice system really open to it\nI used to have\nYou know what this is a pretty exemplary that you know a case of the greatest sentencing if I ever saw launcher and what I Am hoping he can realizes that rather not a drug kingpins ... technical technical innovator pioneer who was that young\nAnd enthusiastic libertarian who passionate about free markets and now the potential crypto currency to meet some monetary freedom I mean that's really what I was about not drug\nAnd I suspect he still is

hook it up and move marketing budgets to our budget so that I can get paid to do what they love sure and I\nDon't want to get paid to do what they love and if you can and I know that when we talk to

clerks denies you access to some documentation a and claiming all you're not an attorney and then so you call the police are actually called the bailiff over he refused to arrest her she called nine one one on both the Baylor fan the the woman police showed up and that's where we kind of picked up her left off your story\nAnd here's where you get to see\nThe police do this little chicken dance [noise]\nYou've called nine one one [noise]\nAnd that's been recorded they can't do anything about that right so you're the ... do\nYou ever being a cost the bad guys and you call this policeman to effect to remedy ... but he gets there and he finds out at some of his buddies yup so he's not going to do anything and he he doesn't want to but he's in this thought [laughter] so\nYou watch him and he'll start shifting from one foot to the other\nThe chicken best you can you see a chicken and they're they're afraid they will shift or wanted to put to the other so they start doing this little chicken as well Mr ... I I Can't arrest him and says you have to just show the cops on him and dragging off to jail\nHeck you don't want to go it's right down the road and\nThe policemen will [noise] refused to arrest him and I tell them well\nLife is filled with little decisions we all get to make some [noise]\nYour return [noise] are you going to perform your duty as prescribe articles to point one three code of

district attorney no no no no\nI Need to file that with a grand jury [noise]\nSo you need to consider what you're doing\nAnd consider how that's going to play in front of a grand jury of my peers [noise]\nYou're turned decide\nYou don't do it we'll go to the next step I got the Texas Rangers number will call them next is that the state police\nIn Texas Rangers [noise]\nA little bit of a long story um I don't want to get another long story in the middle of the two longest is rangers are the if you have a complaint against a public official on\nThe net specifically goes to the Public Integrity unit of the Texas Rangers the highway patrol is the state police and and the Texas Rangers is at a division of the highway patrol okay\nBut they have begins begins been given specific authority to investigate public officials now stand in front of this cop you give them the choice then what happens then they always refuse of course then this is great\nBut you know they're going to you know ask a public official to do anything you actually want him to do because now you want to be able to file against this public official\nFor following policy [noise]\nSo you filed against him with his boss the chief of police\nAnd the chief of police refused to do anything at least we hope to us\nThen we filed against the chief of police the police officer the bailiff the clerk with the district attorney\nAnd under Texans code we have a specific statute that tells a district attorney when he's made known any matter that a public official has violated law relate to his office\nHe shall reduced to blame to an information to me it's the grand jury\nNo discretion shall meaning he has to sell does not mean may matter can if he wants threat means must\nAt least we hope he does

a better than even chance that the Democrats could regained control of that chamber with all that means for national policy going forward\nCar sets includes what's referred to as the immigration issue although it's actually matter of illegal migration into the country that is the concern\nSince that recent ... study or came out than it actually ah found some what North of twenty two million people\nIn the country illegally we have no idea who they are um what they're up to that issues really come to the fore since that study as well\nAnd of course the a ... while caravan coming north now through Mexico or has helped a focus on that as well um fact the individual voter view priority on those two issues healthcare immigration\nAgain seems to be the determining factor in how people are going to vote this year uh\nApparently to some to many a turning over one third of the national economy to government control under this rubric of Medicare for all which is at best a misnomer\nA seems to be the preferred solution to the so called healthcare crisis and the same time it's over a hundred and fifty million people and basically half the nation's population\nThat are covered by employer plans\nScare crisis the same time it's over a hundred and fifty million people and basically half the nation's population that are covered by employer plans and are\nThose would all be eliminated under the Sanders Medicare for all built um yet it sells and it seems to be the issue that to\nMany if not most are really concerned about um we've even heard people say well it's it'll be voluntary in it and it won't cost you anything I'm well\nWe'll see how that goes but one thing it won't be as a voluntary sign up\nAt the same time as we alluded to who is the caravan moving north through Mexico headed to the U.S border a myth Mexico is actually offered asylum status to over five thousand of the people in that in that crowd\nBut they've rejected the offer are proceeding toward the U.S apparently not believing that they will not be allowed to enter a cross the border even if U.S forces half to detain them on the Mexican side in order to sort them out and send them back where they came from\nNow exactly what actions the border patrol and the\nMilitary now the troops being sent to the border will take is kind of an unknown\nA fact is that their presence should cause a lot of second thoughts among the folks in that took care of in\nThe numbers were talking about it's hard to see this as anything but as serious invasion across the southern border um there are a number among that group that they uh news people been down there covering it that they found\nSome people already has been deported and are trying to get back in so joined this caravan in order to get back previously deported folks um any number of them have been identified as Mr team gang members\nAnd in another number all albeit small a middle Middle Eastern folks turned up in that crowd as well so we shouldn't be afraid to wonder just who's trying to get in here\nAnd what their intentions you know might be um some some even on on the left have already announced that the column you should be allowed in everybody in it [noise] um others [laughter] looking for a way to stop it\nEven on on the left have already announced that the column you should be allowed in everybody in it um others [laughter]\nLooking for a way to stop it to break up that column or one of the suggestions ones to meet them as they're proceeding up the highway with a forest service slurry bomber\nThought that might be an interesting interesting way to break up the\nTo break up the caravan 'em down just get it deep and Mexico with the forest service slurry bar\nThan that do an air drop that'd be interesting and invent these are seem to be the issues and the um perspectives on each that separate their votes separate the voters this year into their respective camps\nWe'll find out next week just which way the winds blow\nBut the potential for Democrats controlled house and this announced agenda of Medicare for all open borders which they call asylum for all a repeal of the tax cuts\nExpanded regulation or the ... treaty the Paris climate accord both of which they they announced they want to reinstate\nNot to mention the promised investigations of the administration or potential impeachment of [laughter] new justice Kavanaugh in the course of Trump um\nThat'd all to combine really burned a governing process to a complete halt\nUh with the the Congress split between houses a Democrat controlled house of representatives and a GOP controlled\nSenate ah be awful hard to get any of these issues addressed because the two sides are just so far apart on\nOn what they what they think I'm by way of contrast one potential speaker of the house um should the GOP managed to retain the majority\nJim Jordan of Ohio has put out his vision of what he would like to see 'em if if he were to become speaker\nOf majority party steering committee interestingly enough chooses who gets the chairmanship of the various committees\nAnd of course the numbers of each committee are determined by the majority a majority party having more votes on each than the minority party it's in the steering committee however\nA majority party having more votes on each other than the minority party\nIt's in the steering committee however the house speaker gets for violence\nAnd the majority leader gets two votes sitting in that committee when they make these decisions\nAnd it actually even gets worse than that the speaker gets to appoint a member at large who has one vote but basically gives the speaker of five votes on the steering committee when they're picking the chairmanship so the and the\nAnd committee members uh Jordan says he would like to see a consolidation of jurisdiction\nOver matters into 'em one committee when it comes to welfare reform put instead of the five committees that currently deal with welfare systems in the country he'd like to see that brought under one committee he'd like to see the change of the uh\nThe speaker allows having five votes in the committee and when they're making those decisions\nHe also criticized the omnibus spending bill that Congress passed a last year instead of the proposed budget which cut agency budgets in line with the tax cuts\nOf course that dominant was bill is what resulted in the deficit arise\nWe've seen which he so uh regularly opposes lot of issues on the table\nAnd a more than just the two that seemed to be
