close now we're only two weeks away from election day itself\nAnd we call you periodically during these elections seasons and they seem to go on forever and ever but you know we just wanted to get an update of what was going on so this will be recorded on friday so can you tell us the latest I Believe\nAs a Thursday where we are in terms of voters\nSure I'm so literate distraction mailed out a hundred and nine thousand nine hundred and forty balance and that's on record for us we have more and more people that like to get their ballot in the mail for that is a huge mail out\nUm and we've received back sixteen thousand three hundred and forty three as a Thursday night\nAnd we have accepted three thousand seven hundred and twelve of those that were working on it so\nI'm all probably work through the weekend and we'll have many more of those all done on Monday ready to ready to go so uh and what I mean by accepted is what they do is they check the signature on your mail in ballot against your voter registration record and they do every single one of them and a person looks at it\nSo that's what I mean by they've accepted them and they're ready to go into tabulation now\nOkay so by having to do that of course it's as you said mail in ballots have become very popular now people are more willing to turn them in and we're getting a higher percentage with the number of votes coming in and ballots coming in over just a very short time\nOr do you have the need to hire more people are just your staff is your staff able to handle the workload knowing that it's just for a few weeks out of the year\nSo what we do is we hire seasonal employees I'm only hire them for a different aspects of the elections so like voter registration\nYou're so what we do is we hire seasonal employees um we hire them for a different aspects of the elections so like voter registration will use seasonal employees for this part to\nMatch the ballots as they come in to check for signatures to make phone calls to people who haven't put their signature on there like if they leave it blank we tried to call them and say hey we can't count this without your signature\nUm we also have people working in my elections warehouse that are getting supplies ready to send out to the vote centers and they're testing machines and they're doing all sorts of things right now so we do hire between twenty and thirty seasonal employees for these bigger elections\nOkay now you brought up an interesting point there were ah sometimes I guess people forget to sign their ballots or how to do this is the biggest problem you have we will mail in ballot or are there other factors that come into play morals [noise] um\nNo I think that's the biggest thing we have is um they just forget to sign it or the signature doesn't match like um if you sign your wife or I don't know if you're married tired or your husband um he knew we can't accept that it has to be the person voting that finds that\nSo um and we take signature verification classes and make sure that you know we can tell\nA different handwriting and and it's amazing how different people's Han writings are just even people that grow up together and live in the same house and go to the same school their handwriting is completely different from each other so we have to make sure that\nThe person voting as the person that signing that ballot\nToo so does that happen often I mean are you getting a lot of that on a regular basis\nIt does not happen that often sometimes what we get is um when you get your envelope it has your name on it and then like my husband he gets one with his name on it\nAnd sometimes we get those envelopes mixed up and I signed my name on his and he signs his name on mine and I'll mail mine and like now and he won't male his and for two weeks and what we do those as we basically hold them and wait for the other one to come in\nAnd match them up and then just switch the envelopes oh okay yeah so\nWe want to make sure that um because what happens is your name is on there and a little a bar code and that's what brings up your record so we want to make sure we get the right person in there\nOkay All right well we're we're going to pause briefly you're on the more you report for an important mostly when we come back more on the election coming up we're right now\nI heard so we want to make sure we get the right person in there\nOkay All right well we're we're going to pause briefly here on the more you report for an important message when we come back more on the election coming up are right

limit on this election uh people still have plenty of time to a turning their their ballot or tell us about that and we want to go over the rules one more time for people who may be new to the area that there's early voting their vote by mail and then there are vote centers on election day should tell us about those\nSo let's start with early voting early voting started on October tenth and it goes through November second which is basically the friday before the election and that's at three quarters office and the recorder has two locations want impress getting wanting fountain what you can come in in person\nUm you can ... a vote right then and there you get your ballot they printed on demand um you can vote on paper or you can vote on a touch screen so I Know a lot of people like to use the touch screen because they can't hold a pen anymore or it's hard for them to fill in a little bubble\nSo the touch screen is really nice 'cause you just touch it and it puts your vote in there\nAnd our touch screens don't count votes but they do is they\nPrint out a ballot for you so you get your printed out ballot so I call it it really expensive pen and\nIt prints out your ballot and then you look at your ballot you make sure it printed out the right thing and then you put that in an envelope signed the envelope and turn it in okay so that's early voting so again from October tenth through November second\nThe last day for us to mail you a ballot is October twenty six\nBecause we want to make sure that we get it to you and you can get it back to us so that's the second friday before the election October twenty six so if you want to come in a or call in for a one time mail in ballot let's say you're going to be out of town\nTo us so that's the second friday before the election October twenty six so if you want to come in a or call in for a one time mail in ballot let's say you're going to be out of town in November six and this tiny you really want to vote and you need a mail in ballot but you don't have time to stop by an early vote\n'em till October twenty six you can call our office and will we will mail you a ballot\nAnd when you return the valley you can return the mail in ballot up through November six\nSo we have that you can um you can put it in the mail which we usually say about the Wednesday before that's about the deadline for putting it in the mail and for us to get it back because we have to receive it on election day\nUh seven PM election day as a cut out for everybody so you have to vote by then or you have to we have to receive your ballot by them [noise]\nUm so you put it in the mail you can drop it off we have Thirteen drop boxes countywide that you can drop it in any of those drop boxes and they're open now I'm twenty four hours a day and most of them are drive up and drop it in\nUm and there's a list of those on our website or on election day we have twenty five votes centers that you can drop off your early ballot at any of those twenty five votes centers they'll have a little bit and you don't even have to wait in line just show them you're envelope and they'll let you in and deposited\nOkay but also on election day you can go to vote centers of either of them\nYou can go to any votes on there and you have a pi county so we have um electronic poll books everybody's name as in them that's registered to vote and you can go in and sign in at all any of them but not all of them any of that one of them and if you voted one it actually send your information to the other twenty four\nAnd it if you try to go to

sugary drinks and of course the energy drinks as well what can I give them that will help them had their energy in the heat of the summer it that's pretty simple just keep them hydrated\nForget the ... energy drinks definitely stay away from this sugary drinks\nOnly because obviously that's not going to do much for them is it raises blood sugar and cause all kinds of issues like leaving toward diabetes low blood sugar levels hypoglycemia and of course excess weight gain is the big issue with it as well\nSo you know I'm a big fan of plenty of water enough kids don't like if if your kids are

good and of course healthy and you can just figure out different ways to get the fluids in there but a lot of times kids for the most part\nDon't have a whole lot going on from a health perspective and usually if they're getting tired quite a bit if it's\nNot the hydration in the summertime you might want to take them their pediatrician had an object out but for the most part staying away from the caffeine and and the sugar is best and getting some form or if you want to fly over the water a little bit with something that's\nFor the most part staying away from the caffeine and the sugar is best\nAnd getting some form or if you want to fly over the water will boost at the natural is fine but plenty of water especially for kids are out in the active like you're saying uh quite often

of business going on about\nComing in the summertime so for saying that weather now is triggering migraine headaches especially the mild one new study\nAnd with the heat coming in and the temperature changes researchers have found as they tested this that the temperature change can be a culprit about a fifth of the time or study provides evidence they said that there's a link between perception of temperature sensitivity and the actual temperature it's still so it's interesting some of the mind plays a role\nIn this but doctors to Jim Wang\nOr the hospital in Taiwan set in a recent news release said whether more commonly trigger mild headaches and moderate to severe migraines the study shows however when people perceived that the weather was a certain way the migrants were still strong about thirty six million Americans have migraine headaches\nAnd six million them experience them as debilitating headaches at least Fifteen days per month so if you've ever been around someone or even you if you have headaches on a regular basis migraines\nThat just completely debilitating or many of the triggers I say that we're a part of this study or the hormonal fluctuations that they looked at food sensitivities stress bright lights son glare and loud sounds unusual smells can be a big trigger also changes in wake sleep patterns\nPhysical exertion answer medications so several things going on\nThat can be really helpful or for migrants and I hear all the triggers what can you do for a while from a natural respected there's a couple of things one\nIf their food since devotees obviously you want to remove certain foods for a period of time at least two to four weeks and you can really see as the body kind of gets rid of the food at any any buildup of that in the system is kind of a basic way to say that\nThen as it kind of leaves the body you'll notice a if not you start adding to foods back in ...\nBuildup of that in the system is kind of a basic way to say that\nThen as a kind of leaves the body you'll notice a if not you start adding to foods back in ... you can actually notice the triggers will happen again so\nA couple of things on that another one is from migraines if they hurt really really bad over the right eye you might want to get checked out and see if you don't have some form of an iron deficiency ... or ... you can have a deficiency or it can be an excess either one\nAnd simple blood test can do that they can check ferrets in levels which was show you the storage tank of the iron and if it's on the left hand side\nAnd that and this happened to me the other day you know I I'll I'll just talk a lot about myself much here as far as what\nHappens if it was interesting is of course I teach this all the time right so you think [laughter]\nYou ever take my own advice which is kinda funny but really this to this that and the other day and I was taking a some supplements and I was ... there was some new supplements I was trying out and it was actually from a different company and working on those and I was already taking\nWhich I didn't realize I just just didn't think to look at it but I was taking the supplement that has a natural form of zinc in it it's like a whole food based something which is what are our brand has and I was I was taking one that already had sink in it so it was already getting plenty of that plus I eat a plenty of proteins and and nuts seeds\nAll of which have plenty of zinc\nWell this is the one supplement that I was taking for I don't know maybe a week had excessive amounts of thinking and it was one of the one of the key ingredients and the milligrams was quite were quite high and I started getting this headache over my left eye I mean pounding had never get headaches ever\nPounding headache over my left eye\nAnd I went to a friend of mine of course you know when it's happening to you all your knowledge for for some reason says go out the window\nAnd went to a buddy of mine who does a lot of natural based medicine and and we were talking I just I've got this headache over ... you know I Know deficiencies and in an excess can cause it and I think it was all you teach about the left I all the time what is it not civil zinc\nAnd so we we we we did some some looking some research on that and I looked in the ... and sure enough so I came off everything and within two women two to three days it was completely gone as how to build up of making the body my body was letting me know that your course there was an excess now here's the deal\nThat's not in standard medical literature about that that comes from\nMe know that your course there was an excess now here's the deal\nThat's not an standard medical literature about that that comes from more natural passing based research a lot of it was known in Europe and so it doesn't hold a lot of ways as far as medical studies go some traditional medicine\nWe really wouldn't look at that as as anything substantial but I can tell you that learning about that years ago\nJust from more of an alternative approach it's amazing what some of the things they have found throughout the years that aren't technically uh\nIn the medical literature but yet still you can see really good results from it so interesting to say the least triple late to make three seven to seven two lines are open let's go to is it a June is that I'm not saying that right eight in\n\nAll right so um I've got two questions one is a first I'll start off like five years ago I got electrocuted with some high tension power lines that was in ICU for about two weeks\nAfter that um several months later started getting massive heat cramps are now I don't nutri work anymore and stuff I work at ready guy and he caught a I'm In sixty degree weather and I'm getting the cramps\nAnd when I get a hate crime it's like it bends Neal rates in like near where my kidney is but in my back more\nThan me over where I'm Crying out that God and\nThe only way it or leave it to me is uh if I mean I can drink all the gator right I Want and hardly anything but if I drink probably half a gallon of water in that period ah\nIt it it it\nEventually stop and that but I'm I'm completely drained\nYou'll often are you exhausted in the mornings when you wake up [noise]\nI Am I sometimes but like I mean as long as I get a cup of coffee and me or do my uh I Do like and I exercise which is I stretch my eyes open them up as wide as possible and then when I Do that usually I'm I'm pretty wide awake but um\nYou're getting the cramping like mad and drink all the water and then the cream and goes away but you feel exhausted it sounds like you've got some issues with the\nAdrenal fatigue and that's pretty common your adrenal glands little glands on top of the kidneys\nLast and it sounds like you've got some issues with the\nAdrenal fatigue and that's pretty common your adrenalin little Glen is on top of the kidneys which kind of interesting because that's where you feel like some of the cramping is\nSo I've got a couple of ideas and so we'll talk about that one commercial breaks lined type girl back\nAre helping to determine by the choices that we make every single day health is not the absence of disease living mindful about our daily lifestyle that's where my and he'll be comes in to the easy to use mine helping out the design to improve wellness

really say anything just goes to your family doctor\nSpace played your blood that perhaps get cheering get into the bill\n[laughter] she [laughter] she passed that one off well here's the deal first and foremost it can be everything from I mean I'm just telling you what a what a physician's going to think it can be everything from\nUh\nAnd foremost it can be everything from I mean I'm just telling you what a what a physician's going to think it can be everything from\nA bladder infection to potential kidney stone to me bladder cancer that they're gonna think all of those and but I don't I'm not saying that to to freak you out usually that's easily nothing gays or any pain with it\nYeah\nThere is a guy that come out of no alarm Fletcher is their pain when you nominate oh there's no faith okay and did it come out of nowhere\n\nBecause my doctor gave me a month ago it may be good for you know he didn't stick up for a month ago\nWhat do you do for a living for work trucks yeah drink plenty of fluids\nFollowing more scientists than I Do but your fluids during the ...\nHow many soldiers do you drink a day I'm maybe three yeah bringing about Macs\nYeah sauce person in Boston for gas and that that are in those sometimes can be a little bit challenging and of course the advantages as it can it can lead possibly to some kidney stones and whatnot I you know it's it's tough to same and that's something Dr definitely is going to get when you on I'm just letting you know\nLotta times infections the first thing kidney stone second it's got to be a pretty bad case for it to be big C word so I I don't know that I'm worried too much about that but it's probably something simple a lot of times\nYou know if you do a lot of physical labor or guys that exercise why do heavy weights a heavy weight lifters and whatnot can have all enemy urine that literally just breaking down of tissues train on the kidneys and all that so there\nCan be a whole host of things that will get it checked out it's probably was above ... did she tell you is it like it was on the your analysis was only two plus one plus did they did she mentioned numbers like that\nIt is yeah it's a quiet little scripts and that that's the way that\nShe just said OK yeah just kind of just going to say\nMentioned numbers like that yeah\nShe just said okay yeah I just got to just go see him I wouldn't worry too much about it just like let them run their test and and come up with it you know a lot of times it's an infection some time\nAnd you won't even know it like low grade infection and you wouldn't even know anything was there they just found it in the in the UAE so having to take a look at it if it should be pretty easy to get rid of if it's even anything okay I mean sometimes you can do a test and have some blood in the urine and then two days later test it and it's gone\nSo again it could be you know getting tested again would be a smart thing to do most doctors when they see it if there's no major symptoms they'll wait no tested again they're short lanes in terms of maybe wait a week or something\nAnd see if they're still blood you know there and if there is well then they can kind of goes to different directions with it but I Will get it checked out again just kind of see what's there but don't don't stress\nWouldn't worry too much about it just stay on top of it make sure that trading it OK AAA to eight three Seventy seven two lines are open with questions about your health people to live alone of course you'd probably never heard this but they said those who are married or have companions tend to live longer well\nLoneliness they're saying now two new studies actually saying that living alone are being lonely can raise a person's risk of dying from heart disease or just about any cost in one study people with heart disease who lived alone were more likely to die than their counterparts who did not second report showed that people age sixty or older\nWe're at an increased risk of functional decline in or death if they felt left out isolated or reported a lack of companionship\nBoth studies were released on line June Eighteenth in the archives of internal medicine living alone may be a risk factor for bad outcome said study author Dr Deepak bought who's the director of integrated cardiovascular intervention program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston\nHe said the study only looked at what an increased risk of death during steady six year follow up period and what's more loneliness was also associated with functional decline thinking together the studies show that social isolation is associate with cardiovascular mortality and people with heart disease\nSo if you live alone\nRealized is that the statistics\nWork against you as far as long life being disease free\nSo if you live alone\nRealized is that the statistics\nWork against you as far as long life being disease free and\nReally be able to to kind of\nRival those was within like a happy relationship at some level who have companionship it is important and if you're in a relationship\nYou know toxic be careful that too because that can also create a decline in your health\nSo it's about being unhealthy relationships I think that needs to be more of a clarified statement that really where you bring up the best of both in someone and that

makes a compromise is trying to do for immigration healthcare and all these big issues with one of them will be released rivers and people were more so\nThan it had eight years of Obama motivated and most of our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what is he talking about\nLike well you know this is going to be language that you hear from liberals\nWhen they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continued to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFaith family freedom pope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's\nSovereign case and protecting our borders securing the southern border or in my opponent said he sought building along the southern border where it's political theater\nWhen he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one files them\nIllegal aliens teammate tendency a haven for illegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but it's a difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater I fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them\nA dose certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policies I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think so brightest would be somebody there at the border welcoming download giving them\nA state issued id and of course well you know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders show\nThen giving them a state issued id and of course we have the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so I'd say like stand firm on this enter what to make certain that these caravans snow they cannot just come walking and our country and receiving benefits\nTennessee and want to see eye to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers insecure that border\nWell again we're getting reports from\nRural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down in South West Virginia or illegal immigrants there uh again demanding services often getting paid in cash\nAnd this undermines us a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond fed up with us and how it has to stop a congressman who Blackburn what was what who you\nAre in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mob should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise]\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get to the Senate to take that up and it that is a good place to start and to remind people that that is and it gives them a program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I have a show for putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing the southern border you know large realized walls work anybody doubts that don't talk to Israel\nWalls work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat are not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day and the Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by an illegal alien who had helped several\nWhere our hands with law enforcement and of course\nSeven year old daughter was killed by illegal aliens who had had several where our hands with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and\nThis is not ... it's it's not right and for the families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do eat verify employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in western mushy I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar say a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nKnow totally out of hand\nAnd then he and his son go in and do it\nRight but he said you know in these big jobs for he and his sons to keep them ... in in gear to keep it growing again and so\nThese are real issues and one oh tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue I think you see it as a security issue not having the borders secured every challenge a border town every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police\nHas endorsed to me and my Bryson ... crime tough on trafficking truck on\nTop found a drug issues the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue they see it as an issue that affects them and their community and to law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community shame\nOn again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here\nOn a ... show we've hit the issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by\nA record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in this mid term cycle or that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them including on trade and all the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade\nIncluding on trade and all the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\n... they have a I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focus\nTax cuts pick on China get more manufacturing it home and it's working [noise]\nWell it is working and I'm not\nA fan of tariffs are like free and fair trade and in West Tennessee where I Am right now we're our farmers our sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China China a trade war on us for decades\nCongress how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so what they will say is if\nWe're in a war we got to be sure we win this war and it brought us what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price or that is tough on China they than stealing our intellectual property take them reverse engineering drawing her\nThan taking American Jobs and our owners will say oh\nWe get it but we've got to have some breeder leaflets they sure we win this trade war and that we open up markets

today\nYou know I'd love to go to ... to ... oh my goodness Steve oh my\nGoodness so that was a great introduction by Eric and all of them here and we're on our cable I ca is because we have our rockstar airport manager Dr Robyn ... with us today\nWe're going to be talking airport and airplanes and fights and and pine nuts and all those great things that are happening at the airport\nIs on the tip of everybody's tongue these days rest can't reach an absolutely incredible yes we are the press has ... we represent the entire region and hope that the entire region come some lives with us\nAnd Mrs ... are they doing that or they find well that's absolutely actually we had almost eighty percent load factor for the month when I got over it's been absolutely off the charts we kinda know what that means robbing\nBecause we've been talking a lot about it tell the listeners at K. why ca with at me when when the contractors originally bid for central air service back in July the estimation by the carrier was about forty four percent what that means on a fifty passenger airplane is about twenty two people on board the aircraft\nRight now we're hitting about an eighty percent load factor which means out of the fifty seats on average approximately forty or failed this Sunday of the four flights that went in and out we actually hit over in Ninety percent load factor there were only sixteen seats left out of four flights and the more that is\nFantastic and it's not just because people are going to LAX or they're going to Denver they're going to everywhere they want to go in the world because they can pretty much get anywhere from LAX in Denver\nIs fantastic and it's not just because people are going to LAX or they're going to Denver they're going to everywhere they want to go in the world because they can pretty much get anywhere from LAX and Denver that is so true a lot of people don't realize by going through Denver you have access to four hundred and fifty possible connecting flights\nAnd within three hours over a hundred and flights are connecting within their banking system in Denver so and Robin those slight fix it tickets cost of those flights\nAre actually comparable or even better than you would get some sky harbor\nThat is true and the airline actually did benchmark against Phoenix as the target airport but for those nonstop flights to Denver in LA there absolutely unbeatable we've had a record number of people coming in from Denver into\nPrescott and then renting a car to go down to Phoenix to drive down the hill which is so amazing because there are so great\nWhere they don't know about are we going\nTo learn but also we've had the same thing happened with those fifty dollar flights from LA we've had people come over rent a car and go down and in fact the rental car agency about two weeks ago had three hundred car reservations in one week they had to bring in Seventy five cars from Phoenix in California to meet the demand lovely\nAnd I just want to suggest intend to other people do the math I was like twenty eight people a day you know turn sixty five or they would have to have with a ten thousandth person for motivation\nThey get like a free ticket to fly you know wherever definition if there is a recording trouble for Apple and that sort it out there to motivate us\nTo want to purchase tickets to the airport\nWow that sounds like a lot of fun Frank that's a\nGreat suggestion actually oh You're welcome very yeah it would be fine yeah that was signed it was it a good very Frank was it a good experience or\nThe left hand next a next month on on the night but what I was going to have to do if I took southwest set out to take a two hour shuttle flight to O'Hare and then take a three hour shuttle bus to Madison to win this flood I just wanted to Colorado and um\nGenerally people want to know how early we say at least an hour and a half before the flight that works out good\nAnd then other questions that we get from people are about the carry ons and what they can bring on board the plane if you're not sure we do say call the airline and get your you know individual ticket what you booked if you've already booked it so you know what you can bring on\nThe other thing is remember the old liquids right you have one court bag and we have people ask can I use my TSA pre\nTSA pre as a trusted traveler program by the TSA so that you can not take off your heavy jacket so just so you know TSA previous partially about black press get\nThe luggage goes through the regular check but for your person if you have TSA pre you're given special opportunity to not remove your shoes not take off your jacket in your belt so it does expedite the process a little bit\nWow that's great that is totally off some um you know I still think that that the most beautiful thing about this is that we don't have to get on a Seventeen so I have to kind of slipped down to the valley and uh you know the typical drill is you get up\nYou get you know you so you can get down to the airport two hours in advance don't in Phoenix then you get there two hours in advance so they you can go through to you say and a walk through a gauntlet of all the restaurants that they have so you can spend more money and so you woke up\nAbout four o'clock in the morning you got out of the house by five then you drive two hours then you wait two hours and then you finally take off\nAnd so what is it when you do it here it's you get up and you go down there say an hour hour and a half early\nYou get out of your car you go right into the airport you or any of the terminal and you take off into Prescott United friendly skies and you go and then when you get back that's the neatest thing was the best smack\nYou just leave the plane go through the terminal and walk out your car and get home and Fifteen minutes\nAbsolutely and we've had a lot of people they didn't realize that this is United because it's United you actually going into the same terminal with the United airlines families so when you get to Denver you're in the same concourse\nWhich is super and you don't have to go to you know terminal aid to get over to be and have to factor and all that extra transfer time same way in LA you're going into terminal seven\nWhich is super ... you don't have to go to you know terminal aid to get over to be and have to factor in all that extra transfer time same way in LA you're going into terminal seven instead of the old terminals six with the you remember the old white bus that you had to tell you and then changed terminals this is super convenient for the passengers\nAnd so when when you get checked by two years so here in ... you go sterile all the way through to wherever you're going right\nAbsolutely we've had a few people that were going to France or London or several areas internationally you elect do you see cases you don't see him again till you get to the other end and you never have to go back to TSA is what you mean by sterile [noise] so that's the worst things you know the you get in and then you've got to go back through the TSA again another but yeah exactly\nThere's no recreating unless you change airlines we had a few people that say well I Want to do on my own change airlines that option's always available but it's a fully networked coach air airline so you will be able to stay within the sterile area and not get re screened again which is super as long as you stay in the United family and the star alliance\nThat's great yeah Robin I Would I took a little bit of that your background I mentioned that you actually wrote the textbook and I understand the fat textbook has actually your husband was telling me that it's actually in the\nHall of fame or something [laughter] and I love that\nIn the ... air museum down in Tucson okay yeah thank you up to actually I've had experience at five prior airports a prior to Prescott um three commercials service to general aviation airports but of course press ...\nMy favorite ad ... and ... are we are small airport well\nBy did yes by the F a it's kind of interesting we're ascribing to be a non hub it sounds like not very high but to be honest we're talking about the five hundred busiest airports in the nation right now in terms of\nAircraft operations versus passengers were the thirty fourth busiest airport in the country as a twenty Seventeen figures\nThat's really a busy airport is but they also mentioned these in ... and that tells you passenger numbers so that has said about five hundred and fifty right now in the nation realize there's Nineteen thousand airports in the United states so being in the top save five fifty isn't bad\nBut once we get to the ten thousand employments will actually go up another layer to about the four hundred busiest airport and we might do to three fifty if we get to the estimated twenty to twenty five thousand pass employments next year\nAnother layer to about the four hundred busiest airport and we might do to three fifty if we get to the estimated twenty to twenty five thousand passed in ... next year\nYou know what's funny is when when my pilot's license was active um and it was wasn't too long ago oh we flew to San Francisco actually flew to Palo Alto flew to suffer the Palo Alto and\nEverybody warn me they said oh my gosh when you fly in there the traffic going to be horrible and of course but having cut my teeth on flying into Prescott when we got there I'm going where is everybody sort of like the little be hired the flying around in Prescott\nThat's so true and it's so busy now it's amazing people have come in from a year ago to now and they come into determine like oh my God there's so much activity\nBut you know what there's another exciting announcement I don't want to forget\nYou heard about what's happening in\nDecember right with the ... yeah okay go ahead\nFirst then we're going to happen pretty soon okay well the neat part is that we are so busy and looked actors have been so high the airline decided to add in the Saturday flight we were six days a week to LA now we're seven days a week to LA so every day of the week you have a nonstop flight to both Denver and to LA\nAnd they added the Saturday was because we didn't have a Saturday right absolutely that only ... summer\nWhen it's all five ah Saturday isn't in December\n... when we get back after this hard Rick I Want to talk about where people have to have talked to you about where they want us to to fly okay\nAnd then I'd like to talk about plans as to how we can get more people on the planes by the end of this year so that we mates that meet that ten thousand employment and because I thought the ideas and uh so as soon as we get back to that\nAnd I want people to call in and let us know what they want our new terminal to look like\nThat's a good idea you know because we've been working on that folks and I will tell you we actually had an open house so we'll be right back [noise]\nSo I have some good news for you the airlines to his last week and said that they're going to be unlocking the two thousand Nineteen schedule and we're going to go back and look at a flight scheduled to see if we can optimize\nRemembered the carrier has the goal of doing what's called banking and what that means is they bank a bunch of flights to come in all within about two to three hours of each other so there's maximum connectivity\nThe problem sometimes with leading earlier is that it would be a longer time and that connections days before you would get to the flight that needs to connect so you know Frank I'll look into that and will continue to try to optimize the flight schedule in concert with the airline\nFor your call thank you\nThank you So Frank was our ten thousand than playing but I Want to do them for all the balloons are coming up soon though [laughter] you\nKnow and and that is is really a good point that he has because we we have a lot of\nBusiness people that have retired and the city of Prescott but they are still consulting I talk to them all the time and while I'm retired but I'm Still consulting or I'm Still doing this or that and so we do have a lot of business traffic\n... now we do have one challenge that flight at nine o three in the morning that goes out to Denver is amazing right everybody loves it but it's actually slightly above and load factors in the LA flight in the afternoon the problem is our terminals so small we cannot have both flights at the same time there'll\nBe a possibility of moving up the flight but there's just no way we can have concurrent aircraft operations and be able to get everybody through the checkpoint so let's talk about ...\nSo tell us what the plans for the terminal are robbing and do that's course going to depend on money but it's coming in that's why we need to get on this airplane folks before December thirty first and fly somewhere\nAbsolutely thank you for that so the neat news on the terminal building is we're in thirty percent design we anticipate to come out of thirty percent design in December so what we're looking at right now is we've asked some technical folks what they need in terms of TSA equipment and how much square footage they need\nDesign in December so what we're looking at right now is we've asked some technical folks what they need in terms of TSA equipment and\nHow much square footage they need and right now it looks like it's going to just be a shade under Eighteen thousand square feet not big but it's about eight thousand square feet bigger than the current terminal building complex so we're going to have the ability to perhaps have simultaneous flights\nOccur which will be a really great benefit to the community and it might address something like what Frank side where we can actually have simultaneous flights\nThat's actually going to come out at thirty percent design and go to counsel for review and we're looking at some elevations right now and some site plans the exciting thing is we're looking at us through roadway that will actually be able to maximize access from\nThe town of Chino valley as well as the town the town of Prescott valley the city of Prescott Dewey mayor because it's truly a regional airport and we want to maximize ... threw out the entire region Sedona\nAbsolutely we got a call last week the uh we had a ... a woman call and say this is the very first time she's flying out of Prescott airport and she said how do I get there and so we were giving directions we had a ... several people from Flagstaff say fifty bucks to LA I'm common I'm coming down from Flagstaff\nSo we had some people that were a little skeptical at first they is this truly a regional folks it's a regional airport we've got people coming in from all over\nSo what about on time tricks for United can you talk a little bit about that\nActually I can I get to report from the airline about every two weeks there have been some occasional delays in some parts that with weight and balance issues early on because of the wind direction and there were some delays there it's been amazing like for the last week it was at a hundred percent\nHundred percent which usually means that anything within Fifteen minutes of the anticipated isn't considered an actual reportable delay they track even two minutes so I talked to the air the general manager and she says hey if it's two minutes late we post that we let folks know but they've done a great job of getting that aircraft off on our on a runway\nRobin I have a friend that that works with the shuttle back and forth and driving\nAnd I used to be exhausted when the the schools get out of college ... college\nAnd move at all because I mean you think about all of those two students wanting to go home for the holidays oh yeah how are we connecting with Prescott College college and we've been able to say you know let's make sure that we can ... the students know that they can fly home not have to go down to sky harbor\nWe've talked it well a lot of Embry riddle\nWe've been able to say you know let's make sure that we can set the students know that they can fly home not have to go down to sky harbor\nAbsolutely we've talked it well a lot of Embry riddle students are going through the airport I see the jak all the time but I'm also seeing any new jackets I've seen ASU I've seen ... wow all over as well as you have a pi college so it's neat to see those folks coming in and when you're in the parking lot you see all the Flagstaff license plate covers and holders wow that's great\nAmazing folks we have to take a break and we'll be right back we're waiting for your call at five or when

lot of money or those years and they get into the bad guys off the\nOff the streets is is a is a good thing [noise]\nOkay um well let's see what are we got here\nGot a few minutes the bottom of the hour so I'm I'm I'm thinking that uh and and tell me if you think I'm wrong about this texting and driving thing the county passes an ordinance or not an ordinance but law I guess saying that if you get caught texting and driving in in the county in pike county\nThat um they're going to give you a ticket for that or they're going to be giving a warning or going to do something and um\nI guess each municipalities would have to pass their own ruler law just to kind of a dove tail end of that but I Would think that the jeep the county passes at the city or it would be a little confusing if the city didn't follow suit and do the same thing\nSo I'm kinda interested and your thoughts about that I Know that\nPeople get very frustrated\nWith people driving when they they're they're at a at a stoplight for example and they don't move because they're not paying attention or their ... around in their lane and he gets the part where he thinking they might have been drinking or something because of the way they're driving and all they're doing is trying to do two things at one time which are\nThe only person I can do that is Pete he's he's the one guy that can answer the phone and and take votes that were calling in and and uh all at one time and [laughter]\nFive four one one zero one six were still voted on and make salad to send them ideal it'll be interesting to see how that comes out two weeks from today a November the sixes a\nIs a voting day and and uh you're truly is going to have a an open open line on that day too because I'm I'm anxious to see that we uh we are going to be talking about uh [noise]\nUh all kinds of things going on in the whole country and what what's happening I'm interested to hear your thoughts about what you're seeing on TV and what's going on and how you feel about everything and and ah it'll all be interesting to see what kind of crazy things happen\nBetween now and then that might change everybody's mind about what they're doing to a couple of other questions that we haven't touched\nCrazy things happen between now and then that might change everybody's mind about what they're doing to a couple of other questions that we haven't touched on yet is uh uh the issue about the bells and and this is an ongoing issue that the the um\nThe city council of Prescott city councils going to be looking at a here\nProbably early next year and about how we're going to come with all that and and I'm interested to hear your thoughts about that if you have any ideas about that particular thing another thing that we were talking about some time ago\nWas if you're on the mall the gateway mall up there which is struggling like like all malls across the country are because of the issues like with the Amazon and everyday people are just sitting at home and just right and you know just ordering this stuff is coming to him\nOr what would you do with the mall if you owned it um I've got a few ideas which will share of after the after the break at the bottom of the hour but I'm just kind of curious as to\nUh I I Love it when people call in because they they say things that ah I've never even thought of so it's always it's always a good thing and it's interesting to to uh\nTo see what you're thinking about out there because it's a [noise]\nKind of fun to hear what's going on out there\nSo um that would be one another question that somebody might have now we're getting really close to the bottom of the hour so what I like to do right now is give you the vote total right now I'm for the bottom of the hour we'll
