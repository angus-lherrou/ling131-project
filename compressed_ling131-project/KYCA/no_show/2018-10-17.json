been\nAll her hand and said that was so uh if you wouldn't mind through to try to refresh my memory of uh once the plans are approved a the FAA has to approve the as well that's right okay and they are going to be footing the bill for how much\nThey will be doing um like Ninety five percent okay the city has put has put forth a four hundred and right at five hundred thousand dollars for the

United it was expected to be about forty percent low capacity and it's grown and and then we're actually up to Seventy\nSeventy plus percent one one time it was like seven eight percent so it's really far surpassed what they expected and therefore they've actually added another flight LAX it was six days a week every day except Saturday\nAnd beginning December one it's going to be seven days a week\nOkay so the seventh day is this going to be a round trip to LA\nYes on Saturday okay but it is only one flight is still one flight ... by them and are in play months are really up you know what we really want to to hit is ten thousand implant let's here and and where it actually try to get that done this year while and if we get that done and then we get\nA million dollars from the FAA so

um Arizona eco development which is is you know there's the north and south and of course the one that's there's a lot of conversation about is the one in the south I Know that there's another event this coming weekend with the save the Dallas hiking boat and said the details\nAs I just thought it was really important that that we get the information out there about what the city currently has within the jealous because we actually have\nRight now in the jails the city has acquired four hundred and Eighteen acres\nI I Know that the say the Dell folks want more acreage but I just think it's important you know let's get let's get the facts out about what we have done because this has been going on and actually I asked for a review of this\nI'm In two thousand and one uh for you know there was a purchase of details\nA twenty six acres and now we're up to like I said four hundred and Eighteen acres\nThe last big purchase that we made was um four let me find that Jason was for one hundred and sixty acres of the storm ranch\nAnd wait for that we we used to ... million to two million dollars from the open space find allotment and so it is and we've gotten some really nice space out there and ... and the over the hill gang\nThey feel beautiful trails you know of course there's also includes the you know watch a well a leg or we just acquired a piece on Dr ... who ah gave us twenty acres which is also within the Dallas that teaches piece is not continuous\nBut it is still part of the Dallas as the kinds constellation trail and that we acquired from the James family trust and I'm

going to get our city because it is a huge opportunity\nOne of the things I think as as wonderful as that what we will be able to do is actually gain more access because right now if you get off the trails that are out there you actually trespassing\nBecause that is private property and so hopefully through this process that we're going to go with ... with the jails and building on what we have we're going to be able to acquire more property he has access to people that have not really had the opportunity because they're not as\nMaybe they can climb over the ... some folks can and I I I

important is to go to your family dog\nAnd have them do any necessary testing that can be quite helpful because once they find out where any of these weak areas might be\nThen they can come up with with a really good game plan that were you when it comes first because even if it's something simple like blood sugar related issues or or something of that nature that can be corrected pretty easily

what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nWell every time we passed nominate this bill or something massive funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep its promises securing the border your lead and bumper where the\nGentleman that I use that term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explained to me when\nDefending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because essentially what they've done is said if you don't want to open borders than you are mean\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand that very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and why is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president and as a relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nJust well let me tell you about something that happened Congress men that's what it is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity terrain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear a categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so\nA bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no\nA domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear Congress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a his demo a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives for Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nLook Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and\nThey took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do there\nWhoa Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think that moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place it was some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who Rania um and and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody is what's the right that's a joke but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house and maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nThe upside you know the Republicans might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans\nWho are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but\nWhen I said ... except maybe we'll get some some ... UC UC leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now\nI fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters in in twenty eight teen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but I was going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnd Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that they didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change\nThe stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught and ultimately release because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWell about prosecuted for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge upon any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the Clinton emanates from El Salvador\nOh they're saying here fear alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nKnow well again I think that's you and you seemed ... you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people are like we we got cities with with the homeless a village is ten villages we got a veteran veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nHomeless a villages ten villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted we need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ... we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with if with rage about the situation a congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV than will take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate\nUh against affirmative action don't go to\nBill O'Riley here my new book and the killing series was killing the assess the hunt for

here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and we're just about up your computer often\nA an internal team who they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury the report that's on trial right now and uh one important point I Want to make your audience today is\nThat Harvard receives billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nHow am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money\nThey have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money ah but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism a type of racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I end the Supreme Court's Fisher decision a you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism\nUm and it it has a huge impact on missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America\nA is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity is a founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be the Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I kind of this is the point I Want everyone at this point I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out\nUCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great\nQuality of education you have a great education you just let people in based on merit because there are smart people\nOf all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is\nIt's a vast we must give a leg up our special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nI Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete a based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across this country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nThat lawsuit is not about protecting Asian American men brought by an anti civil rights activist named had were well mine rights activists who has been trying to bring down Marion similar rights protections in American society town hall and mentally about his goal to bring down and since\nThen I mention that is actually designed to increase fairness increase opportunities increase them or anything make education\nBetter for everyone which is good for Asian Americans as well\nUh your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard costs like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nUh who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies\nThose vehicles spoke at the Asian American coalition for educations Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in where there's a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down\nIt it it comes down to a ... ... it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court ah we have a Justice Department who is on our side\nWe for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court ah we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and white to the form of affirmative action\nUh so because we have this powerful ally who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think than India and we may prevail\nOr going to be that this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level the new court of appeals and ah if they determine the circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating are we going to get you on TV you got to come on TV with us soon\nA BJ in them now his book almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black\nOr what do you think about this the the it's racial been counting and the words of some it's contrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society a and does it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others\nI instead of just respect for talent an individual merit aid five five forty Laura your reaction to this and a lot more coming up\nWhether or not you're for or against affirmative action it's still important to see how many of action negatively impacted Asian American groups and you can be for affirmative action in fairly

everything he does\nAs what it is not as I've said many times people are terrified to speak the truth or just I've got to tell you this just last week on my radio show I talked about a woman I met from Hungary at emigrate who said Michael\nPeople are more afraid in America right now to express their political opinions than they were in the Soviet Union I was stunned and I talked about it and then an article comes out today I sort of the Drudge Report\nAlong those lines that uh people are terrified to express any opinion about Islam any opinion\nAbout minorities even minorities are afraid to talk about things in the country today was living with more than ... than during the Soviet Union here because of the political straight jackets that we've been put in by the left\nAnd I think

Shaw from food to energy to a knowledge economy the republic of Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea bass\nIs a region well worth exploring I welcome my colleague John tending to comment on the news in these last days you might have noticed\nThat the Federal Reserve has been raising rates for some time now which is consistent with it what it believes it his mission to worry about inflation and employment at the same time also you might have noticed that Mario Draghi the central banker for all of the European Union\nIs commenting unhappily about the Italian budget and how this may or may not be acceptable to the European Union\nIn response to this in the American market there was a dramatic sell off in these last week of of the most popular stocks especially apples and everything else including small cap in Europe they've been selling off for some time and everybody is in tears over breakfast or no Brexit\nJohn I welcome you tonight because over many years now you and I have discussed central bankers the Federal Reserve\nAnd how they relate to the news cycle and what I've learned from you is that they don't relate to the news cycle it's just our understanding that when the Federal Reserve speaks in some fashion we must react I'm going to guess that I can extend that to the central bank or a viewer Mariel jogging\nExplain again John how it is that the central bankers have so much power who is who we warships them where is this cold and how how do we get out of it ... to ...\nWell John I think economists worship central banks central banks employ a lot of them and economists are the source of information for reporters who are trying to create a narrative about what's happening in the markets and the economy\nPlus remember just as an example economists almost to a man and woman thing that the all the maiming killing and wealth destruction that was World War two at an upside called economic growth and so it's based on bad information but we're supposed to believe that the ...\nDestruction that was World War two at an upside called economic growth and so it's based on bad information but we're supposed to believe that the Fed's\nInterest rate hiking its its attempts to hike the short rate of credit which is really all of this as a target\nHas somehow out of nowhere spook markets will such a view isn't serious not only is the fed and not a race setter the fed is a rape follower of the fed follows markets and moves up its rate based on what the markets are doing [noise] but we have to remember\nInvestors have known for at least a year or two that the fed was going to do what it's doing so the idea that investors would just now be reacting to what's been known for quite some time isn't serious the markets story is not a fed story but that's the story that the media like to promote because that's what economists tell them is the story\nThe Federal Reserve sets a target rage uh for the best lenders we're told John that the best lenders that would be the banks too big to fail even bigger\nAre having a very good quarter and they've had a very good year and all the other indices and indicate that corporations are making a lot of money the profits are very strong that the U.S economy is very strong\nThey want and are asking the attorney general and the department of justice to the United states the launch a full blown investigation into

show\n\n[noise]\nMm\nI'm joined us or this is the John ...\n\nMm\nI'm John Bass or this is the John ... show this segment of the global business reporter ... by the Republican massive I shot food energy into a knowledge of\nThe republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in the region well worth exploring I welcome Josh Rogan riding global opinion\nFor the Washington Post and we start not with the mystery of the missing perhaps murdered\nA journalist for the Washington Post in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul we start with the number one hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia announced claimed asserted by the Trump Administration that is part of the mystery of ...\nJosh I'm very good evening to you one hundred and ten billion dollars sizeable and the president was commenting on it most recently in his interview with sixty minutes this hundred and ten billion dollars is a guaranteed is Congress part of this conversation about\nSaudi Arabia are arms sales to our GDP our jobs and the murder of a journalist good evening to you\nKnow good evening on the issue of us arms sales to Saudi Arabia is back in the news\nBecause members of\nCongress in both parties on both chambers have are looking for ways to exert pressure on the Saudi\nRegime to give up information about the disappearance of ... and uh this is the thing that they think that they can use to um at at least try to convince the Saudis to reveal what they know and uh participate in\nThe investigation and the way that she has laid on his disappearance now going on over two weeks and\nOf course when president was asked about this he immediately said no no no we can't\nDo that you know his excuse is reasons were that it would affect us jobs and met a Saudi Arabia might\nTurn to us rivals like Russia and China are but it's also important to note that President Trump\nLikes these arms sales because he tells them as a major achievement\nIn the U.S Saudi Arabia relationship that he introduced himself a mostly because when he went to rely on his first ever trip abroad last year\nThe this is what the big announcement was this was the big deliverable this is what she says she now if you look at it that a hundred and ten billion dollars is grossly exaggerated some of it it deals that have been in the pipeline through the bomb administered so many red or\nLiberal this is what he says you can see now if you look at it that a hundred and ten billion dollars is grossly exaggerated some of it it feels that have been in the pipeline through the Obama administration\nSome event or aspirational deals that may or may not ever materialize and then there's a small subset of that where those deals are actually moving but those deals that are actually moving are now in limbo because they have to go through a congressional process to and there's no way that in this current environment without\nSome sort of resolution to the question of the Saudi regimes role in his ... his parents that Congress is going to let this happen now what I argue today in the Washington Post very simple as that\nYou know whether or not you believe that our arms sales to Saudi Arabia represent leverage that we could use to pressure them what President Trump is done by taking it off the table by saying that actually\nKnow this is something that we need from the study is he's completely reverse that dynamic you turned it into the outer delivered drawn us\nFor no particular reason that I can see you and you know what that's done is sort of now please you know states in a position where any country who is selling us arms has it easy\nOut of jail free card whenever they run afoul of something that we believe violates our norms are rights or you know the rights of our citizens and residents and\nWeak as it is a but it could have far reaching effects and uh it definitely doesn't help sector Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh trying to get the Saudis to play ball and back here in Washington President Trump is just taking quiver\nOut of his quiver disappears genuine geostrategic paradox Josh\nI mentioned that staying with Riad we also have to deal with Iran\nWe also have to deal with Ankara and then there was the Gulf Cooperation council so there are crossed purposes in all directions as we go forward I cheat on the hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales because that is a way of supporting what is our all ally in the contest with the wrong\nAnd I puzzle about Congress and that contest putting pressure on Saudi Arabia doesn't dad boost Tehran isn't that also a factor here in addition to the money\nThat was ... you're right there's no doubt that a a U.S Saudi diplomatic flare up undermines this drop in ministry ages main diplomatic initiative right now which is to coalesce coalition supports pushback against Iran's malign influence cut off Iranian oil which depends on the Saudis pumping more oil\nDiplomatic initiative right now which is to coalesce coalition supports pushback against Iran's malign influence cut off Iranian oil which depends on the Saudis pumping more oil and given that we're not working with the Europeans on that really you know the goal fees are the ones that are going to have that\nCame up with us if is Iran strategy that Trump is already announced it already done is is get it has any chance of being a success\nSo yes it's a pickle you know there is no clear way out of this for the Trump Administration their tactic right now it seems to be a bit to try to avoid you coming to the point where they have to make a decision whether or not to\nPunish the Saudis if and when we actually discovered that they did this thing to me that they have this thing um it undermines Trump's administration's plans to roll out of a Middle East peace plan because that Middle East peace plan is\nBased according to the White House on getting Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries to throw in and also undermines the effort that chair 'cause you're always talks about to build the middle east security alliance an Arab NATO doubt the critics they made a stray she will say that all of these policies were destined to fail your\nAnyway the Palestinians are not going to come to the table while the Trump restrictions punishing them there's very little chance Iran is going to come back to the table negotiated deal and Saudi Arabia itself blew up the idea\nSo to speak bad choice of words you know of having a Middle East NATO when they\nStarted embargo against cuts are so you know if you\nBelieve that there was a reasonable chance ... ministers are pulling off his hat trick a really complicated difficult policies of the middle east you have to see that this crisis hurts their ability to all sorts of things that you can understand why the White House is resisting dealing with his head on\nJosh it's possible we been on this road for some time and the reports from Yemen about the indiscriminate bombing and the aggression by the the by the surrogate for Saudi Arabia for Riyadh\nHave been have had trouble with Congress for a long time and it looks like that's all now galvanized with the murder of the journalists but it isn't it isn't an isolated complain about Saudi Arabia\nAnd you know the there is no doubt that there are some a lot of people who already had issues with the U.S Saudi relationship or now taking the opportunity of this crisis to push forward an agenda they already had the worst namely to\nUp the he was Saturday alliance in ... that but when you add that to the people who are genuinely concerned about\nCrisis to push forward an agenda they already had in the works namely to\nUp the he was Saturday alliance in that but when you add that to the people who are genuinely concerned about the disappearance of Jamal which are a lot of people that begins to create a momentum that could actually have the effect of changing me was that it really we don't know\nHow it's all going to turn out or you know it's sort of Americans generally give the government a pass to do things or national security that have collateral damage and you know that doesn't really affect the American soldiers right so if the Saudis are killing a lot of\nInnocent people in Yemen you know there there's not a big likelihood that your your average American and therefore average congressman is going to raise a big stink outta that but when something like this happening right sometimes to have the effect of drawing the public's attention\nTo our ally Saudi Arabia and agree just practice is on a range of friends\nIn a unique way crystallize is it for people okay and this is kind of ... when the relationships change and when you know a a a small movement in Congress to stop the U.S aid to Saudi Arabia and the Yemen War can really gained momentum and I think that's what you're saying\nHappening right now ... for the Washington Post Tom John bachelor this has to John ... or so\n[noise]\nRight slam ball the Democrats have just reached in absolute bottom whatever hidden they live in a rush of this I firmly believe is the plan it's a\nPreviously conceived plan that they are in the process now in their minds flawlessly hadn't I think the level of discussion and the anger at Washington on the market average ordinary Americans use near a point when\nBut wait there's more fondly last minute\nDianne Feinstein week this thing out her letter rush because they had exhausted every other legitimate attempt to get capital he passed his own testimony with flying colors there is nothing that has been found to disqualify but it's quite the opposite he is among the most qualified to\nAnd if you were to improve the management the public lands for example would make it much greater difference and the severity of forest fires than trying to do anything for global warming\nThe contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed lands are very very great if you look at the aggregate I went back and check some of these numbers forest fires down globally about Seventy or eighty percent from what they were around Nineteen hundred\nIt's a striking decline that is going on and so it was ever you don't want to look at a dramatic incidents that day when you have to do is to get aggregate data and the aggregate data doesn't\nSupport but claim that the fire system is going out of control and to the extent that there are changes the thought that somehow they would want to change the entire economy instead of figuring out how to manage forests in a more sensible fashion\nIs wildly over broad you're looking at the wrong thing there are now solutions that would work better even way you build houses the kind of clear as you do and so forth there are many many things that could be done to deal with fires without having to have the kinds of transformation that the PCC is talking\nAbout hurricanes do or die clones the allegation is made that they will deepen and increase in severity and striking the land you provide a chart in your defining ideas these\nThat suggests we're not looking at increased since we're looking at cycles and this goes back to Nineteen Seventy I'm going to get than we go back even farther anecdotally will see the same cycle\nYes generally speaking the data gets a little bit spot here's who go earlier but it's the same thing and they were huge hurricanes in Nineteen forty five I still remember living through hurricane hazel in Nineteen fifty for not attributing it's a global warming the worst storm ever to hit\nMainland United States is still the Galveston hurricane of Nineteen thirty I'm Nineteen hundred oh there are pictures of Houston being flooded in twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen they're also pictures of Houston being flooded in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd they're essentially the same kind of picture the cyclical phenomena are pretty much uniform with respect to everything that we look at and and the basic problem the global warming theorists is if in fact you have all these things going up and down up and down you can't explain\nEverything that we look at and and the basic problem the global warming theorists is\nIf in fact you have all these things going up and down up and down\nYou can't explain the ups and downs by a movement in carbon dioxide levels which has been consistently but gradually output over very long period of time see we got to get other forces to explain what's going on when Richard Lyndon gave his lecture in England but he says you know a bunch of other forces like water papers for example that can be doing it\nAnd other things that are local which do this so\nIf you're trying to figure out the way in which the system works\nIt's a terrible mistake to assume that the only independent very ... you have any source or significance\nAs carbon dioxide the deep pendant variable is temperature or what happens is there is a law known as the rainiest this law which says that given ... insensitivity assumptions as carbon dioxide changes you take the log with them to the base to the base the\nUm it means that you're going to get a slower than linear increase in the amount of combat but that's everything else being equal but the moment you realized that reward of vapors probably the more powerful greenhouse gas\nAnything you do to change what's happening there carbon dioxide may be able to fix a fifth of the problem but it's not going to touch the other eighty percent of that particular problem so the return from investments are going to be lower\nAnd you don't see anything whatsoever in the eye PCC\nStudies that I've looked at which kind of try to do an intelligent of cost benefit analysis of where we go my own view on this stuff is\nUh if you could basically have orderly technological progress based upon other kinds of considerations in the end if you reduce the amount of pollution if in the end you managed to increase the overall efficiencies of all the legal or the\nBusiness infrastructure systems we have this problem will not quote unquote take care of itself but it's wildly overstated there is nothing whatsoever in the past

hours I won't turn on all the inside or\nA chatter I'll just read the tweet from President Trump on this investigation\nThe president rights just spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish consulate\nHe was with secretary of state Mike Pompeo during the call and told me that he has already started and will rapidly expand a full and complete investigation into this matter\nThe president ads and says will be forthcoming shortly fine we're going to get answers but I Want to back up as you do in the federalist\nAnd ask about the geo strategic rivalries and alliances and end the teams that are involved in this report and first of all\nYou mentioned that turkey is a major source of information about what may have happened inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey what is the\nPresent understanding of Turkey's relationship or not relation ship with Saudi Arabia good evening to you lay on\nEvening John thank you for a for having me on 'em and getting into your listeners um I I uh I counsel extreme caution\nOn the entire story I think there are very few things right now that we know that I think there are lots of allegations that and claims that have been made\nA very male possibly be true however we hadn't seen very little evidence in these things yet and the press and the American in a press and the regional press especially Turkish press that his reporting as\nAlso has a scene and shown no evidence or very little evidence the one thing that we do know the one piece of video evidence we've seen as Mr show the walking into the um walking into the Saudi conflict in Istanbul October ...\nPiece of video evidence we've seen that as Mr show the walking into the ... I'm walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nOctober second or anything else right now is largely here say here it's coming from\nTurkish officials or Turkish sources and other things but again we haven't seen anything that the sort of see no official announcement ah regarding what may have happened two weeks ago or what may have happened somewhere along the way so I just wanted to put that out front and say now we talk about\nUh relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia the big issues that Saudi Arabia has had the major issue that Saudi Arabia has had a bunch of aside from Iran for a second it's within other Gulf Cooperation council member cuts are\nI'm joined us or this is a job that show I welcome satisfied hotter and Andrew McCarthy we're following the mid term\nThe midterms in Arizona turn out to be specially colorful\nBecause the Democratic candidate for the Senate hopeful\nWho has polled well I Believe in that it's a very competitive race\nAgainst mixed Ali she has a colorful past that connects with Andrew McCarthy experience as a prosecutor against the protestors back in the late twentieth century especially a man named Omar Abdel ... no longer with us\nAnd and attorney who at the time Lynn Stewart within the news all the time I missed is Andy this was amazing to me when you published a piece of National Review online because I followed ... Stewart\nAnd to call her a radical lawyers an understatement I did not know that she intersected with now Democratic Senate hopeful in Arizona\nKirsten Sinema how is their ... what is there a connection in the past and Lynn Stewart is no longer with us so we have to speak for a good evening to ending\nGood evening John well after the blind shake was convicted Lynn\nStuart is no longer with us so we have to speak for good evening to Andy\nGood evening John well after the blind shake was convicted Lyn uh got herself in her own methicillin by the way had been the ah ... Stewart had been the blind shakes a main defense lawyer at our prosecution\nHim and his a jihadist cohort in Nineteen Ninety five\nThen in I'm In the late nineties Lynn got herself\nJammed up as it were a for helping the blind shake get messages communicated from him in his prison confinement to his Egyptian terrorist organization does not all is Loni or the Islamic group in Egypt and Lynn herself\nEnded up being prosecuted for material support to terrorism\nIn a ... the year two thousand two two thousand three uh and and it's all going forward and that is where she intersects with a Kirsten Sinema who hosted her\nA at a couple of events at Arizona State university where ... was studying law in two thousand three\nTwo thousand three that the intersection and at the time Lynn Stewart was not a small story maybe in New York it was a very large story would there have been a reason to believe that Arizona was fully import of formed of lens towards activity\nOh John the whole reason that she was being hosted is because she was as you say a very big story she was a big national story and she was a cause ... of the uh of the radical left\nWhich pretended that she was being prosecuted for her laborers as a defense lawyer for the blind shake which interestingly and to me amusing way a who is the\nStory that a myth send them a is sticking with I guess we should call a representative cinema she's the she's a congresswoman from the nights district of uh of Arizona [noise] ah but you know she continues\nTo contend that uh they were simply protecting or arguing in favor of due process\nAnd were against the prosecution of Lynn steward because\nWas in a way criminalizing the work of a criminal defense lawyer which is an absurd position to take by the time\nIt was in a way criminalizing the work of a criminal defense lawyer which is an absurd position to take by the time Lynn was transmitted messages for the blonde shake\nOut as a prison a blind shake had long been convicted his appeals had run all of his ability to appeal to the court or for any relief or had passed and Lynn was not performing the shake was not an accused\nAre under American law and Lynn was not performing the work of a criminal defense lawyer she was a performing the work of somebody who transmits messages\nFor a a jihadist chief into his subordinates Saturdays\nOr water than now representative center of our hope to get out of this arrangement [noise]\nI think she'd like to stick our head in the sand and and pretend me when that happens actually um I think this is a quote this is a situation a fatty is where um she was trying to put herself on the map politically\nAnd in her community and the ah the way to do that at the time was to appeal to her fellow radicals and then when she thought that it was a expedient in Arizona or\nTo change spots\nAs it were in order to rise politically or she met a more focused as a\nUm I guess you would call a moderate progressive and that's the uh sheep's clothing she's been in ever since the problem for her I think is that she's now trying to go for statewide office rather than just her uh her\nHer place that she had in the ninth a district in Arizona and sober I says much more competitive there are many more eyes on it there's a lot more money involved in it and her her past is catching up\nWith her let's be very specific Andy for people who are not less with us in the late twentieth century the blind shake he was convicted for participating in the attack the first attack on the world Trade Center\nAnd though that attack did not lead to mass casualties that could have as I recall that explosion was capable of causing mass casualties it did not bring down the building because maybe we just got lucky the first time\nThat's exactly right John it was a fourteen hundred pound chemical explosive that the jihadists\nMaybe we just got lucky the first time\nThat's exactly right John it was a fourteen hundred pound chemical explosive that the jihadists are not only composed with an idea of\nI'm knocking one of the towers of the of the world Trade Center as it appeared at the time into the other tower or they also attempted to air raid\nCyanide in the course of the explosion they had hydrogen tanks and I and a cyanide or which\nThe bomb and the idea was that when it exploded the hope was that the tanks would explode and they would be able to kill people not only at the epicenter of the explosion but also very remote they were hoping to kill tens of thousands of people and the fact that they only killed six remains one of the\nUh really major miracles of modern time\nAnd it's not it's not rational to conclude that cinema did not know this connection between the blind shake and the attempted mass murder of Americans and her hosting Stewart that would've been entirely available for send them at the time\nI think the only reason that Lynn was notable John was because of bad\nRepresentation and and the reason that she was particularly famous or infamous depending on your perspective of it at the time was because she was under indictment this move very publicly known\nA she was under indictment for helping the blind shake basically run his Egyptian terrorist organizations so if you would go through the the\nUh the labor is hosting her\nOr it would be because she had this notoriety\nOr minutes at ... go ahead\n[noise] oh it sounds very are carrying the radical ... soccer opposite sex where the lawyer who does something wrong or ... something wrong then becomes a cause a lot of the left as soon as an allergist and the situation doesn't it\nNot only does that he is I think that Lynn had her roots in the in precisely that radical lawyer some Nineteen sixties she worked closely with ah with Bill consular who of course was one of the\nLawyers on the Chicago Seven um so yeah I Do it all goes back I think the same thing\nAndrew McCarthy riding the national Review Online this is about a Senate contest that is right now we're looking at the midterms\nI Do it all goes back I think that the same thing\nAndrew McCarthy riding that National Review online and it's just about a Senate contest that is right now we're looking at the midterms are Christians cinema is the Democratic Senate hopeful and a mixed mixed Sally Margaret ... is that correct Saturdays Martha Martha ... it's a Republican candidate\nBut Andrew McCarthy has done is the favor of connecting some of the dots that perhaps ... will explain before or after the election that its McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes I'm John ... [noise]\nTo choose those ... those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it just like on the far today and the Occupy movements ... which are lawless and violence the ... that I had gone by Nancy Pelosi says we're all the structure given the green light to attack anyone they want you to say\nThat we're going to be our senators powerlessness that car sales\nMuggy so light you know what\nI should have on the news for the night hey why Seattle\nSo for services the guiding principle that drives Army National guard soldiers to be always ready whenever disasters strikes every Army National guard members serves not only to protect the nation but also their local community so they each have a stake in the security\nI think like us rushed to to push that strap on away so it didn't separate that's where the problem came from and they have not said when what's going to happen in terms of launches there is a man to assemble launch\n'em ... of the crew onboard supposed to return in December because it's being replaced by another crew in December the Russians are saying they have not yet\nRescheduled that mission they are hopeful that we'll have\nA solve this issue and moved on by December and that might be the case\nSaying they have not yet rescheduled that mission they are hopeful that we'll have\nA solve this issue and moved on by December and that might be the case they're supposed to be a progress launch a in between and they and that's using a Soyuz rocket they might use that launched to test to see if they solve the problem\nThat you know once again now beginning to look at the sub company in Russia which is really just the division of earth cosmos to that builds a strap bombs to see if the sauce and the problem came from there will have to wait and see\nRight now we're in a holding pattern we don't know how the weatherman program will be affected the American we're trying to build the commercial replacements to the Russians and it's unfortunate that American government doesn't seem to have much urgency to move that up or push that forward\nAnd they're just saying wow what kind of go along and safety panel that NASA yesterday was saying wow we're not so sure you can get it done on time you got issues there is not right the paperwork hasn't been done right we think you should delay those larger so that's where we stand right\nNow ... ... and ... all three of the champions hum biggest drawn them a buck shawndra X ray observatory and they smoke what's that mean\nWell it's actually back in operation that went into safe mode a middle of last week they announced it over the weekend how convenient trying to hide it um and it was because one of their gyros went into the cost problem that force them to go into\nSafe mode while they were very quickly able to figure out what that issue wasn't they switched to a backup ... operation ... is one of the four great observatories that last last has launched since Nineteen nineties\nUm uh the Compton gamma ray observatory was the\nFirst to launch if it was the all but it back in like two thousand and one of the other three were as you mentioned Hubble Chandra and Spencer Spencer is in what they call war mowed it doesn't ... it's a it's an infrared observatory which means it needs refrigeration to really see in ... and they ran out of refrigeration several years ago so it's no longer\nDoing the observations as it was originally designed horrible isn't safe mode because it's charter school problem in might never come back\nAnd now ... ... is really beginning to run out of its drivers scopes and I point out that these these these problems are really the fault of the restaurant or make commuting entirely they take the blame\nBecause back in the early to thousands they made a decision I'm as a group that uh astronomy a community that they were going to put all their eggs in the basket of the James Webb telescope leaving nothing for replaced\nUm as a group that a stronger me a a community that they were going to put all their eggs in the basket of the James Webb telescope leaving nothing for replacements for these are war costs telescopes\nHorrible you know we know what's happened with the Web it's been it's now a decade behind schedule and it's cost has caught up eight to nine times from a billion to nine billion and so nothing else has gotten built and we don't have replacements for ... or ... or anything\nAnd the strong acumen he's continued to put money into big expense who giant projects like Web because they started to push\nIn two thousand and eleven the building of W first another giant in for a telescope that's going to take a decade to build a cost millions assuming there are no cost overruns well I won't make that assumption\nAnd so this is partly the blame of the ... it's also partly the blame of the ... the the big government space in General John which we talked about what the Russians\nAnd we talked about here with the this astronomy big projects that are mostly pork and don't produce anything like Web and you know so I have an op ed\nAt the federal is fabulous right now and which Bob identifies\nThe big base predilection of the Congress and now the Trump Administration because it's buying into it Bob despite the disruption and swamp draining a metaphors we see a continuation of the big space companies\nYeah you know where it with\nCalling draining the swamp pays off an obvious ways Trump has been doing it like at the EPA but something like space in is a NASA\nWell he wants to have a big space program and so he's all well the willing to go along with the lobbying of the big space companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing and Northrop Grumman\nUm they've been doing heavy lobbying on both Congress and trucking industry compared to be buying into it to build the gateway the lunar ... temporarily occupied\nProbably ... not to be built for maybe a decade in that decade plus a boondoggle around the mold and this would\nGive asset less itch it's project its mission that doesn't have one right now and what these really ours just boondoggle because they don't really ... Congress doesn't care um the bureaucracy at NASA doesn't care these big space companies none of them in care whether anything ever gets built they're not interested in the national interest not in\nWhat they're interested in is their own personal interest the bureaucracies want to maintain that\nCompanies none of them in care whether anything ever gets built they're not interested in the national interest not in the slightest what they're interested is their own personal interest\nThe bureaucracies want to maintain the jobs that department's their agencies\nCongress wants to claim that uh pork chops the district so they build anything or not and ... and ... and those kind of companies\nSuggest as they've done with ... and they just want to have that the government money coming in and year to year whether they build anything or not they don't care for ... for the launches an gateway will be that way it's going to at least be a decade plus before it gets anything done\nYou know in that decade plus down the road we might see three launches adventure less and ain't going to build anything but that's what's going on now and that's what I write it about wrote about on the federalist it's a boondoggle is disaster if they really want to clean things up there's other ways to do with space sex has given us a hint\nGovernment should no longer be building anything it should be buying the products from private enterprise and that's the bottom\nAnd Bob there's no prospect of the Congress changing directions whether the Democrats are the Republicans are the majorities in Congress both both parties have found a way to profit from big space\nYeah ... or my whole point of my op ed is to point out how the corruption and in Congress and the ... and the bureaucracies in the Trump Administration and Trump because he's not paying attention to this is is is is continuing they pour money into things that will just not produce anything but it\nPays off their friends you know so you have big companies be of a campaign contributions fun we think tanks in DC everyone looks around and says oh isn't it wonderful we're doing there's a lot of the press that reads about gateway and without doing any research says oh that's\nWonderful they talk about this less like it's wonderful but nothing type of accomplished it doesn't go anywhere it's it's a waste of money gets launched it but now\nWe don't we will we have a gateway twenty thirty yeah I doubted our money for it out of twenty four now maybe\nYou'll get launched in the late twenty twenties but come on look at how the lessons gotten delayed the odds are willing to bet that this will\nGet you don't have to involve I just wanted to give some numbers out there and people can calculate how old do being twenty thirty how 'bout twenty forty gateway\n[noise] no I I honestly don't believe that's going to get launched for decades it's just it's just the way this works look as it lifts has\nI Know I knew I was talking to you and two thousand and two what George Bush in the White House and I said ... twenty twenty you would have said well maybe nope not going to happen not going to happen\nI was talking to you in two thousand and two what George Bush in the White House and I said Estelle at twenty twenty you would have said well maybe nope it's not going to happen not going to happen\nIt's not going to happen and uh you know it's like it is first launch off maybe by twenty twenty four that would be Twenty years after Bush proposed right now will be Twenty years to build a single\nCash and asked about sick one and two thousand ... no one would have believed as Bob if we said twenty twenty well I'm saying it now without gateway and I are now ... facts to twenty twenty\nThirty eight to twenty forty four somewhere in there okay for\nEvery you know if we're lucky if we are lobbying guarantee\nThe Chinese will be settling colonies on the moon and laughing at us\nBob ... keeps the Web site behind the black we're going to turn to exploring when we come back I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

Arizona [noise]\nAnd I'm\nMember of the American legion writers and the American legion post sex in Prescott\nFantastic well let's talk for a minute about the American legion as a whole um you're involved in the post and I've talked to many many times about some of the activities that the post itself does and the programs that have sponsors but as a veteran tell us a little bit about your experience with the legion and things of that nature\nOr the American legion was chartered in by Congress in Nineteen Nineteen next year we'll be celebrating our one hundredth birthday a Nineteen Twenty one\nThings of that nature or the American legion was chartered in by Congress in Nineteen Nineteen next year we'll be celebrating our one hundredth birthday a Nineteen Twenty one um the legion was um\nResulted in the creation of the U.S veterans bureau which is the forerunner of the Veterans Administration\nSince then legions been actively involved in various uh veterans' issues and patriotic issues of been pushing 'em we push the flag all got the flat goat adopted by Congress in Nineteen twenty three in Nineteen forty three of the American legion wrote what became\nThe GI Bill

well that may be one that people are not as familiar with\nOkay the Patriot guard riders are we call ourselves ... for short was for a number of years ago um in response to protests which are taking place at funerals of veterans\nWho was um initially formed by and finding a large after in the mid west a separate from the AOL aren't as separate from the legion though\nTaking place at funerals of veterans\nWho was um initially formed by in fact finding a large after in the mid west a separate from the ale aren't as separate from the legion though [noise] the Patriot guard riders um we provide funeral escorts a flag lines for veterans\nI'm either veterans active duty or or veterans I'm Gilman action or just veterans um that are deceased also for first responders or police and fire\nUh the major difference between us and the protesters were showing up at funerals is we have to be invited by the family we don't show up on her own [noise]\nThe original purpose was to provide a ... a a line of defense or between the protesters and the families and the grieving families\nYeah and so we've seen in the news before and then actually during a a a recent television show that just had a season premier there was a big um there was a veterans funeral and a group of protesters and that was a featured aspect and and we know that\nThey didn't have PG are in a TV show they did not have you

there was a rumor that they got to the downtown area at the courthouse square but they never got past there they never got to this funerals\nYeah and I remember at the time there was a lot of discussion because they had posted on their social media and their website about coming here and\nUm that was a big concern of a lot of people that was and you know thankfully through the actions of groups like PG are are that never materialized into something that could have just been another a awful experience for a lot of folks\nIs correct and we we were close to the lawn\nLike PG are are that

four out at Bradshaw and it's all girls this year and next week they're going to be in the studio all of them and their two chaperone so you know how small the studio is we're gonna have twelve people in here next week\nWe're going to have to get one of those delicatessen taken numbers because we're not fit in more than three at a time and that little studio no no\nAnd and you know they're pretty thin but yeah it would be quite a stretch to get them on your it'd be like trying to stuff VW bus which\nMaybe might be good with them I don't know so that gives me a week to learn some German phrases that might be useful yeah yeah and you know the day before I'm taking them up to the Grand Canyon I always ah the school provides a bus and we take them in their host students and take them up to the ... show him that in\nNo matter what we do for them when we send our kids that way they always stop it and I don't know you know there is just the thing they they love treating the kids good either here or there so anyway next week we'll have the German kids in but this week I have Glen Martin with me again\nHow are you doing great great Chris thanks for having me when you are you getting ready for these signs to go down a there's a lot of signs out there if they don't get blown over yeah let's let's get him out of there yeah in ice or you're always welcome the part of the conversation five four one one zero one six you\nKnow we're in the middle of the campaign or the election season the ballots are out there a lot of people are filling them out early heavy soldiers out yet but then not only filled out but mailed in mailed it non now you have it in the mailbox or do you take it or I take it over a fair street yes what I mean to you I just felt a little more secure than I Do\nI I liked the idea dropping over there and doesn't have to be handled by all the mail personnel blah blah blah so I'm just seems to be easier for me to just drop him off\nAnd what do you think about the mail in ballots you like your fan or you're not a\nFan now I'm a fan of it I like it I think it is a incentivize more people to vote and uh it's right there in your house you're able to think about it and instead of standing that crazy little booth and\nWell doesn't it seem like a though if you got to go to the booth you got to get educated you got to go down there you can't you're still in\nAnd you've got to bring a piece of paper and go okay what which one was this vote on that one right so yeah I like to do it in the comfort of my own home and then um you know for me\nHot and you got to bring a piece of paper and go okay what which one was his only I I did vote on that one right so yeah I like to do it in the comfort of my own home and then um you know for me I used to see the see outline you know I had it right there in ... Idaho you know uh it was all good\nAnd because I was down at the county building unfair street the other day I was protesting my property taxes they're close but not good enough for me and I see a woman get out of a car with a stack of ballots and shove him in the ... I mean she must have been holding ten of them in a while\nAnd I just think with with the mail and it leaves it open for so much more fraud you know other people to fill that out and I know you've got to have the signature on there and and I know lesbian hurricane do a great job they do some checking all that stuff I Can't imagine doing that job with little personnel that she has\nI don't feel hungry all that I'm missing out\nThis is not a diet it is a lifestyle will come in today to get information on the body composition test and the weight management program but we also see you at the\nEnd Koch healthcare scientists on the Web at Hancock healthcare dot com like us on Facebook and Twitter listened to doctors live radio and it's very station or just call us at four four five six seven\nI grew up in rural America as the son of a Methodist minister\nMy parents worked hard raising four kids with dignity respect intolerance\nI grew up in a time when public education was wrong\nI benefited from hard work and study and taught high school history before I took ... Dr\nMy wife happy you know I have been married for thirty a fabulous years and it raised three wonderful children we moved to Arizona to take care of Abby's mom my professional background allowed me to become primary care manager of the northern Arizona veterans have been your issue and get back to those who have served our country\nListening and caring about people is at the heart of all I Do\nOur children have never seen a functioning government in Washington ... ... it's time for us to listen to care again that's why I'm running for Congress\nAnd Dr David real and I approve this\n... ... it's time for us to listen care and that's why I'm running for Congress\nI'm Dr David room and I approved this message he paid for by real for Congress [noise]\nYou know it's funny that you were playing I Am blue as a music then coming back in because it's just pretty red and the the big window what do you\nThink that's a red wave on the phone we got the you got something to say about mix Sally what's up\nPeople well if you're limber I'm a ... you know this isn't ... and so do you uh [laughter]\nUm hey do you remember when she signed my salary was running against a Kelly yeah and and this defend Arizona organization came out in just a just killed\nKelly Ward I'm with a quotes um and the same organization that's now\nHelping 'em mix Sally again against cinema my wife had done a little bit of checking on the sheet whenever she hears these things she gets the name of the\nLoop and she starts going on the Internet and she found out that these guys aren't even from Arizona and that it's kind of a middle of the road Republican establishment organization mhm [noise]\nAnd and yet they play very very hard ball and show a that they're the reason why we have a mix Sally because Kelly Ward\nWas a phenomenal candidate she had some of the most unbelievable endorsements Sean Hannity or mark Levin Ed Rollins um ran a Rand Paul\nAnd yet she couldn't get past it because I just don't think she was funded as well so so we've got like Sally um the the jury is going to be out with me because Paul ghosts are endorsed Kelly Ward he did not endorse make Sally and he works with her in the in the house\nSo what are you going to do Peter you're going to vote for cinema then yeah you know\nI've got I've got hundreds of people waiting for my ballot and and believe me that makes Sally is she's in our you know at\nThis point you get down to what's ... what's behind the name that are already because everything for four hours after that and what we're all of your committee heads ear got your Supreme Court everything so so I'm just saying though that\nUh that we've got some we still got a battle against conservatives have a battle against the establishment and we got we lost on this one\nSo I'm just saying that uh that we've got so we still got to battle against a conservatives have a battle against the establishment and we got we lost on this was\nWhen you know when you talk about ah with ward and mix Sally going at each other they were both trying to prove who is more Trump like\nAnd the guy who could have been ... Trump's grandpa Joe Arpaio was in the race I I Wish he would have got in there I didn't care how old he was the guy was throwing in he's already has some good ideas he's not afraid to make chances or take a chance you know you don't\nYeah I just didn't want I didn't want to go six six years I didn't want to have to go through this again I was hoping for somebody young and vibrant and and and and you know a Martha is that there's no question about it but she's more of a cheerleader\nThan she is a um a check Kelly I mean Kelly could speak extent for initially on any topic\nAnd ah so what we've got what we got food and and like I said if it's big salad presently I'm I'm no fool\nYou think you think that a German piled laid off some of the votes for a Kelly\nAbsolutely absolutely and I am Joe everybody loves Joe average\nThink about it now Trump did not get in on the endorsements that he couldn't because a German citizen buddy Joe was out there right from the start but yet I don't want to do I think he wanted I think he wanted I'm Kelly Ward but\nI I and but yet Martha put up these ads that made it sound like I had I had smart people say well well she's got Trump's indoors but I said that wasn't an endorsement now\nIn fact I just laid out as well\nAbsolutely a lot of people fell for it never once ... any of those things to say I I endorsed months to make salad you know it was just something that they'd found so anyway yup\nWay things for the call the\nChairman of the guys that was a time I listen to you you better than you know what he's\nTalking about these things but it really is water under the bridge now I mean you got what you got to pick there's\nTwo lines of thought to choose from and you gotta well actually three but I have no idea about Andrew agree I have the Green Party on with Chris I don't know anything about her except Jews the Green Party and you know it just kind of shows the influence of money in politics than it because\nYou don't know anything about her she's probably got no money to get it out these other two candidates have money just flowing in like rivers both sides yeah and you know you listen to the radio the TV all this them these guys must just\nPaying their numbers of of sales numbers with all these dollars coming in from these campaigns and and it is consistent\nTV all this stuff these guys must just paying their numbers of sales numbers with all these dollars coming in from these campaigns\nAnd and it is consistent I'm In constant or if you turn on TV it's you know cinema this much Sally that you know British rich that while I'm twenty seven it's a constant flow of of at commercials for political commercial you know we\nGot to look forward to after the elections are over everything's quiet Christmas music yeah there you go you know in the stores in the ... and everywhere so you know that'll be pretty good All right the next race down you know we got those sarin Brill and uh\nYou know we had David real on this show with my with me as well and and listen to him and the thing that got me about real mostly is that he has a real campaign and it's the first time you've seen a Democrat in recent memory at least for me have a real campaign against the incumbent yeah\nI agree last time around that was uh what was that guy's name he was ... or something like that and he was out there I live way out there he was way out there in fact I think one of our meetings we had them all there and I thought there was going to be a riot\nNo I'll tell you about it so we have the CDC for and we invite them both up and I'm Glad they both showed up I was moderate and there are a fair\nAnd here we are shows up smelling like marijuana already right out of that and I guess he's an advocate down at the state yeah yeah ... yeah but anyway he comes in and you know whatever he he gets up there and it was going really nice they're answering the question going back and forth\nThen all of a sudden something kicked in with him he stands up\nStarts telling the whole audience how all of the hour by county as racist and ... and it starts a shouting match the podium trying to moderate this thing this became a referee yeah yeah and eventually he kind of walked out but you know what I think it was planned because after that\nNo one was talking about ghosts are there were all talking about what he did yeah I mean it seemed like it was almost plant 'cause he knew he didn't have a prayer and he still lost yeah but and you know what we're talking about dirty campaigns um it wasn't really dirty but how about with the ad campaign that real ran with go SARS family yeah you cringe when you saw that\nWay way out of bounds my opinion\nAnd I don't even though they volunteer to do it obviously but ... and uh go sari said many occasions how his family disagrees ... and they fight at the Thanksgiving table or whatever\nYeah exactly yeah it was interesting even at the oath keepers a pause there and he did a speech and even brought up his family but um yeah a family member is definitely out of bounds in my opinion are both good and bad uh\nPapers a Paul was there and he did a speech even brought up as family but um\nYeah family members definitely out of bounds in my opinion are both good and bad uh I mean we had a a camp I saw a real commercial\nWhere his son admirably as a navy guy yeah he was going to Florida and helping doing diving yeah and and God what father wouldn't be proud of that ... what does grill do he puts out on his campaign pitch\nSo he's using his son as a campaign prop\nYeah and I think that it's pretty common on when you have the the kids in the military I was I just think it\nShould be back I mean let's talk about the issues and again\nProud as heck of a son and a thinking for service but again I think family members need to go back in ... the deal is with the with goes our family\nIs um yeah they're against Paul and they don't like them and they sit on the other side of the aisle but I think that really exploited that yeah exploited the family feud and it's just ground that shouldn't be on a I disagree with it\nBut you know every cloud has a silver lining think how much money goes serves going to be able to save on Christmas presents and you hear those six aren't getting nothing I just think how quiet Thanksgiving is going to be oh man I mean come on\nWell and then mom came out in favor of Paul right so that like Trump's everybody doesn't it mom loves Paul more I think he said something about that hey you know we're talking about just about anything and if you want to be part of the conversation\nFive four one one zero one six it's the ... see eight PM show with ... you and good Martin\nWe'll be right back after the heartbreak at the bottom of the hour and who knows what will talk about next [noise]\nOn ... and sometimes you don't want to hear him speak you know while I'm On the news you know if they're interviewing them after some you know the thing going on down in DC ... you know it's just not the most eloquent speaker\nYeah and uh\nKnow brutal seems like he's got to you know pretty much the silver tongue and sometimes the storytelling scares\nThe most eloquent speaker yeah and uh\nYou know brutal seems like he's got a you know pretty much the silver tongue and sometimes the storytelling scares me [laughter]\nYeah and that's true and I think uh I think real though I had 'em in here on the show one day in and he really does believe in what he's saying\nI'm you know he thinks it's the right path for the country and you know one of the blue side we see that they're very much a feeling like you know Medicaid should be for everybody that's ... that's the latest thing they're pushing now and they really have stuff in in I disagree but yeah\nWe'll just just to the second amendment stance a real out for me I mean he's you know he's a a gun control advocates so who booze yeah we're sorry sorry Dr\nArizona just doesn't need to give up any seats the Congress\nWill because we already gave away too in the Senate or how long yeah but you know what I was up you know we all talk about how a flake was was bad news for Arizona\nHe had a fourth highest conservative rating in the conservative index on the new American which is the John birth society the fourth highest so I don't know if if the few that he was wrong on we are just so high profile but it seemed like mostly his voting record was intact and we've basically run him out on a real yeah\nWell you know I follow him on a sweater and uh well I sure don't like a lot of his tweets you don't you like a you know anti\nTrump yeah uh you know and I agree with everything that Trump's doing with a you know going after China going after the ... uh you know and trying to bring a manufacturing back to America\nDo you mean he's trying to make America great again no\nYeah I Am ... and uh\nYou know it just seems like a uh like the global you know and he just
