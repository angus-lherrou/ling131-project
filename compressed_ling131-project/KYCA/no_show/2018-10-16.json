[laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny but Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before it took off for Florida let's listen to\nAnd\n\nI don't know if he no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me yeah I Hope so\nOn and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House blonde but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now the aggressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it\nBecause Democrats keeps saying free health care free this free everything and they're not saying this world quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nA Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like\nIn this midterm election cycle was the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like the ... he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game and place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did\nWhen twenty sixteen to turn out our boat to educate voters to talk about the results are there's a lot of house races in the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think that every counts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is breaking our way uh in North Dakota and Missouri\nI was in Indiana this weekend with Mike Braun I mean the energy and the Senate sides great we could definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in her mid term of a first term president so I feel good about where we are Kavanaugh\nHas definitely energized our base and I'm seeing that in our mail I'm seeing it in our fundraising all across the board it has put a good choice in front of our voters do we really want with the Democrats are offering obstruct resist the smear campaign\nThe search and destroy it all costs or do we really want a party that's putting forward results that are helping average American

wall and now we have more people just flooding into the country\nWhile the president has let on tests and you've you've heard signals from the Senate and house it they're going to look at funding for the wall\nDuring a the race or during the time between this election in January they should I mean I think about what these kids are going through these poor children are being dragged across Mexico to our border they're being put in very dangerous situations oftentimes when they come into the United states there last\nWeek they have human trafficking problem this is something that Democrats should be working with the president to solve they don't um and it's going to take Republican leadership to step up and solve this immigration problem we have a serious problem at our borders and we have to resolve it\nYou know we have to resolve it and of course everyone's heart breaks for the children who are as you said put in danger by taking this long track a\nBut the American children the

know but will ah will throw it out there to our listeners and see what they think thanks al\nAppreciated and kids are like [noise] I Kurt you still there okay good I'd I'd love to talk to you about route sixty nine I mean in ...\nWell yeah I Am a diamond valley and back a quite a few years ago there was a an association of a almost\nA whole ah pleaded cost LA would aid to lower the speed limit and they never did do that now regard to the meeting and um there was some um vocal people not part of the association\nWho lobby to not to the Jersey barrier is they call it that you see in Phoenix right right yeah yeah real stuff all barriers they claim that there would be more of a glaring yadda yadda and as I Know and it also ah no we are growing out of the cracks\nThey claim that they're on the more debris and it would look ugly or and yada yada\nAnd and I know what it also a though we are growing out of the cracks and that thing and the trash is piling up the walls all cinder than everything trash\nYou know and it's running right along the road instead of a little bit further back you know making a little bit safer so I find that a argument they use it was quite pointless and he just was a off I just wanted to point out that a reason we got this um giant median which I've never seen anywhere else in the country\nOr with because a Congress now given name 'cause he was a you know kind of embarrassed out of office\nUm ain't got federal grant money in order to pay for that and as you well know I'm the speed limit is has been lowered after that was built and the state is still quite high and I see a patrol car now you're quite often and they do not sit still very long and tell you that\nWay I Know there's lots of people uh going a lot faster you know what what happened was that a eight miles or six miles or whatever it is between Prescott valley in Prescott\nWas re designated as an urban collector rather than they still highway sixty nine but that's that little section there was a\nRe designated as an urban collector so that allowed for the speed limit to go from fifty five to forty five of course nobody goes forty five you get run over if you went forty five\nWell yeah exactly so anyway I think that's one of my two cents worth and I appreciate the call at\nYeah You're welcome thanks Kurt appreciate it okay by by you know it a highway sixty nine is is uh uh when we first moved here was just absolutely treacherous there was people people would almost plan\nTo drive from Prescott the Prescott valley they would not do it if it snowed\nA because it was you were just it was just risky uh to go over black or hill where the where the mall is now and that's another issue folks if you are you got any ideas of what we can put in the mall up there uh we were walking around in there a couple of days ago and and uh it's kinda sad um um\nTo see what's going on in the mall so if you got any really good ideas\nOn or what to put it in the mall or

it's still a great location but uh in the old days a highway sixty nine when you go over ... would\nYou would lose the ah this this radio station K why ca would disappear sometimes on a on bad weather day she couldn't you couldn't pick up the the radio station how far away is that from the from here maybe\nMaybe two miles maybe three miles maybe and and now there's no problem at all because of the re configuration of the of the ... because of the mall but ah it used to be quite quite the adventure um\nTo get over ... if it's not at all you you'd want to put chains on to get over that thing

texting or if they're eating\nOr what they're doing a department of motor vehicles is\nEssentially given up on a a testing people ah that get a driver's license seems to me because uh\nDid you do that today if you went and you're sixteen years old and you got a driver's license the date of expiration would be on your sixty fifth birthday so essentially they don't want to see you again until you
