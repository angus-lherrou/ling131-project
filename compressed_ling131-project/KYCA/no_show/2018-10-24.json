All right so came forward too busy day to day and it's gonna be a busy one it seems like you folks just put everything on all of the world so we tend to do that there's a lot to decide\nSo first of course is there's too many things to do one at one o'clock one at three the study session at one o'clock [noise] first of all use ah the first item is discussion of possible amendment to sign regulations addressing temporary signs on public property doesn't seem like a big thing on the surface but ... is an important thing that has been discussed in the past\nOur city attorney John ... is

are\nThat are out there um signs can become you know they are necessary but they can also become a lot of clutter so there's a fine line there is a very fine line you know so what do you draw that until we're actually going to be addressing temporary signs on private property\nSo even private property like if I give permission for someone to put a sign on my property out right now I have several political signs up in my front yard and um there there are\nUm some boundaries that are around those the size how long they can be there as as there are things that we need to talk about one of the things I'm excited that we cannot maybe just sold so out there right now as today there are a lot of science that are in the right away\nAnd actually those signs at I've actually called on a few of them because they're obstructing view\nAnd you can't if you're coming out of blooming blooming hails it's hard to stay down either side of Ross are and so that they should not actually be in

that they can to about that\nI have or is there are some things that we're going to talk about the state\nPassed the regulation just pretty much open the gate for food trucks to go wherever they want to go they can they can literally park in front of a brick and mortar\nRestaurant if there's a space available and sell their food and says so there's not a lot we can do about it and and we welcome that in some ways because if you want to grab a quick bite to eat and you're downtown walking around you you don't have an hour and a half to go into a restaurant sit down\nTo the new way of looking at\nGrabbing go I guess for food chase and as I I think there are some really positive things are going to come with it but there are some things that we need to be aware of or one of them is when they park in a parking spot they will not be able to part for more than\nThe two hours than they have to move they also need to make sure that they do not go beyond the boundaries of that parking spot because they can ask be asked to leave and um they need to make sure that they're opening for the vending purposes that that's on an end spot so that people can walk up to their track\nSo I think it's

had a mom\nHad a dad had it so you're going to get it it's not true necessarily even with cancer cancer has what's called the Higgs theory which is kinda like to lie is which is you ever seen two little light switches on a wall next to each other you turn one on\nIt's not going to totally give you cancer it's turned both on you will\nSo one typically they're saying is genetic the other one\nIs more based around our environment or lifestyle choices so you have to have both of those to be hit or turned on for you to get cancer and also takes ten years to develop cancer as well\nBut it's it's amazing to think that we can really based on the choices we make every single day make a huge impact in our overall health and that's that gives us hope that gives me hope\nAnd I know when I'm Talking

you sounds like you're making better choices for sure\nUm but you know is a pain ... adamant does it come and go\nAnd the vegetables and all I mean I ... sounds like you're making better choices for

ever is\nAnd um you know real real my abdomen drill or just ended a I have to prop up with a couple of below us or I feel like I'm basically drowning can't breathe\nRight so\nThis and the doctors at this point and then they guide you nutritionally at all at any level\nThere was no offer of any kind of diet uh basically I mean I don't blame the doctors because they need to be paid to know every body than a holding pattern waiting on to see if their social program through the county right right right will pay for anything so uh the main way here you are right right\nRight and the biggest thing you can do I mean\nI Know you're just in a holding pattern in in in its tough because you do need medical care in in the midst of all this obviously and I and I just\nWant that need to go

uh any a PET scan anything like that\nThat nobody can do right now they don't have their farms and they're trying to spread 'em out over so many people that they can't go into this specialized treatment which you probably know I Need yeah yeah because of their funds are limited so it you know within your litigation happy society\nAnd still trying to do what you can do for people that's why I was saying earlier you know when you when you could fall through that crack\nYou often tend to be isolated yeah and if it wasn't for somebody like you out there that I can flip on and listen and

economically self sufficient bringing no uh you know bringing no problems with\nDiseases not be a burden at all in our schools our health care I guess we could just hope for the best\n[noise] see that's what the Democrats want they want to hope for the best that's why they're all for the most part they're either silent on what to do with this caravan they don't want to talk about it they know this is a radioactive issue for them they know speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for them they know speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America\nIncluding women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do\nWell who do you think should pay for their health care\nDo you believe that a free schooling is what and what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foothold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\nBut when is enough enough when when one is the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this heroine him part to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session audibly challenged ... not to not comprehensive reform let's say ten dumbest things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage or more than half\nAs usual Newt Gingrich is one hundred percent correct do not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities lower oil for for border enforcement or does that mean\nYou can't enforce the border that's being crushed by fourteen thousand people at one time you can't do it so what do do they mean when they say they're for border enforcement do they think the asylum laws as as they exist they shouldn't be changed so anyone who lives in fear of crime and their home country should be able to come here\nOr anyone who just wants a better life should be able to come here\nNo matter what\nThat's what the standards going to be so we better get ready to double and triple our population really quickly and all that entails environmentally with infrastructure with new schools that need to be built a\nWith a massive changes demographic changes to our country we better be ready\nAll that entails\nDon't think America wants to any part of that we want our country to be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by a people\nTo be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by people who are informed about our history and our founding\nWho don't

going to agree to move forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border I Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them back\nSome of the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send it back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rules\nYou claim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare\nAnd on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come here to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government ... and this is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emit into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nI'm Talking to Rand Paul here on the lower anger shows Senator Paul what can you think are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll or those two issues our ... our math and plus it's for the Republican than in a tough mid term cycle cycle normally\nSo what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming it often obscured by the media you know all the all being carried away with all the Trump drainage meant center of the good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pace over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows\nThe main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant manager says\nThey say we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are on welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because\nThis is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling at tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rifle owners leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what\nReform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rifle owners leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin all the inside of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats than Republicans are are in a big upsurge with oh you're voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom\nSteyer and sorrows and others have really\nFunneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or a Senator Paul why should Americans care about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ...\nWho was living in the United states he was a it was he he was previously a kind of a sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood and he\nYou know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize spent media have been tied up on this story for you\nKnow a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that to the killing of his show the by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that are not good for America they spent over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the ... around the world that teach hatred of Christianity and Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand ... says in Pakistan supported by them the ... network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to him that draws funded by Saudi Arabians Saudi Arabians madrassas in Indonesia that used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam as a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of of those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind I'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis I'm not so sure that the Saudis are lesser evil than the Iranians to tell you the truth\nThe war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east\nThousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of a journalist I Would say is just one\nKnow to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east thousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of a journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al news for an al ...\nThey they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war so no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be hopping mad about this\nBut what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assisted American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously when Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] yeah but I Would\nCall the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacks on nine eleven ... Iranians over Saudi's if you really look at worldwide terrorism it's the Saudis and therefore the hobbit is something that is being sent an export around the world so uh as far as arms\nThey by sort of are I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nAre armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer the F. sixteen is not something that\nWe could get jobs by selling F. sixteen to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it was about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis\nActually puts a a set a greater risk\nIt increases or risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that chaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nAnd Jim ... who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your view on the show the dam and he said this\nI find it very surprising that somebody doesn't Mosley miles away no access to information and intelligence holding the phone [noise] this is not only the oceans in the nation\nI take a swing at that\nI'm not too excited to be lectured by some autocrats\nJust the sins of the nation\nTo take a swing at that\nAllowed to excited to be lectured by some autocrat from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial\nSo he says oh we should presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven or like a three thousand people in your country that you locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too so I think it's pretty galling for him to take western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence\nAnd say oh we need to presume the crown prince to be innocent\nIt's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince begins all the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist\nApparently many of them are hench band that travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment now has been being fired\nTo chop up see or to the chopping up in the December him and other journalists and you get fired my guess is they're uh they're banished met will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talked to anyone because\nThey would probably implicate the crown prince and this so no I'm not too excited it'd be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here in the ...

states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan they're doing this\nGroups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did down in the last caravan they're doing in this in this other woman and others as you pointed out on their way\nOr if something is done to stop this will be well they're not Sarah a group of thousands every week coming into our into our borders ...\n... absolutely Laura this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a big dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there uh you brought up such a great point\nThat the women and children that were a part of these caravans of big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines of basically for the media\nAre in danger are in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups a according to Guatemala and officials apparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to\nTo try to gather information to find out what's going on here who's coordinating this they talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground a the baby was buried apparently asked by some of those leadership within the group to take the baby away and buried the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOr one of the reasons uh the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people\nThat were coordinating this group with either ... or murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward and for the United states and our us southern border this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups\nAre not just regular farm workers are people for villages that are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used\nAnd they're being used by these coordinators but there are some as Thirteen gay members there were some pretty bad guys in these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use\nBy these organizers by these government\nAnd I am telling you there are people within the ha I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more waves that people\nReady to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah rolling there's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will just all of Eric ... going to let us into a their country and they coached them my coach them on credible fear credible here this is what you need to say when you get to the border that says how you say in America\nNow and it's just a it's just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then you released to the piece of paper and a judge shows your eye on hold women and children separately you can't keep it keep them one of the twenty days and then\nThey're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional status they get\n... feel like a done of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there is a demographic shift in the country that his ear retrieval both for Republicans in irreversible\nBecause of the sheer numbers\nA great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of the reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegals have voted right\nUh and and there's a shift and there's a ship it and if they become citizens of course there is another shift a one of the interesting things I spoke with a uh somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing it\nAs that for example men will take young girls you know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know it's all as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother\nSo that they just release them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release it still ongoing\nOh we have men who have little girls they know they can't\nThat they just released them into the U.S with a return to court date so we're seeing the catch and release it still ongoing\nA we have men who have little girls they know they can't put\nThem in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they can't separate them so they released them so we're still seeing the same problems that we've seen for years happening right now and the president you know President Trump is is very adamant about\nThe fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun to till I think the most important thing we can do for\nThe United states for the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the hundred and government that is working against some of the socialist a\nA aspects of their of their country a political apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any with money from us aid going to find\nThese groups that are coordinating the separate than we really need to start pulling funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people\nMix as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom USAID a groups that are that are actually assist in this a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along this track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with a with children are being uh exposed to this type of a friend who is caravan this walk be put on the back of cars so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not\nI'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose who's doing this and what's going on\nOut well again ... follow the money\nSomeone's paying a fuel for these trucks someone's paying for the\nUh the food the accommodations not everybody's sleeping on the floor every night you don't you can't move this ... this number of people without an organization

and the Trump Administration good evening to\nGood evening John well I think we're going to look at a number on friday when this comes out\nClose to four percent I think it's I think Steve is right the Atlanta\nFed tracker has a three point nine percent um that seems about consistent with the level of consumer optimism and other indicators that are out there so far uh you know turn your eyes away from the stock market because so far that domestic economy\nIs just roaring ahead and there really has been almost no sign of a softness or in any sector except perhaps housing and that's where they related to interest rates going up so all the concerns about the U.S growth US Economy are really on the common there and\nIt you know I think we can talk about what that means for next year but\nOne of the best indicators of course is the leading indicators index and that the most reading a recent read on still showed acceleration it was up over seven percent typically a recession does not start for an average of sixteen months after\nThe leading indicator goes down it hasn't happened yet I think the range of something like eleven months to Twenty one months so we really have I

in fact they beat their numbers are the numbers were extraordinarily good for caterpillar but what they did say was that costs were going up because of the terrorists because of higher steel prices and I think that is sort of I'm\nViewed as a red flag that other companies may begin to uh experience a little bit of cost pressure but on the flip side of that caterpillar said hey we're sending out a notice toward dealers that we're going to raise prices and that is the kind that is where we are right now we're going to be\nYou know I remember other times in the past when price increases cost increases and also wage increases by the way begin to kind of squeeze margins and there's a very distinct difference between the companies that are in a position\nYou come home to rally steady stream

took the Republican Party by storm and overwhelmed his rivals his response was a strong border and wall the caravan\nIs a puzzle to me why it's there where it's coming the men look very healthy very

marching toward the border Donald Trump doesn't have any have to do anything more than stand there and they witness I Will stop this\nYeah honestly I think that's true because I think every American should be offended by the goal of these people who are marching towards the United states who know filled well ah that they are breaking all kinds of laws that they try to come into the United states but just assuming that we are\nIn effect on able to stop the flow we have no policies in place to really prevent them from coming into the country and I have to\nSay if there is one issue where Congress has utterly failed the American people this is it and for Donald Trump to of latched onto this in two thousand sixteen was a master stroke not because\nHe wants it to be a problem but because it is a problem and it needs to be fixed and by the way this is a very good time for Republicans to remind people\nThat Trump made a proposal as you remember he had several steps proposal on the table or to take care of the dreamers to redo our diversity lottery program\nVarious other things increasing border security et cetera which most Americans agreed with almost every segment of it\nIn a in terms of polling response showed that people\nYes I think that people should be allowed to come into the country if they can provide for themselves so that we shouldn't be a ... you know careless if you will with opening our borders so this is something where he really is on the high ground up the Democrats if you recall wouldn't even talk about it in fact they just\nDidn't show with a meeting that was supposed to address immigration reform they don't want immigration reform and I think\nHispanics are beginning to get the picture that this is something where they are being used as a political football or it has nothing to do with the morality of the situation Democrats simply like having this issue because they think\nRepublicans get hung out to dry on it but guess what this caravan as you well point out has really thrown that calculation overboard or it has been stirred up an organized by left wing agitator Z in Central America\nAs you well point out has really thrown that calculation overboard a it has been stirred up an organized by left wing agitator Z in Central America it's being funded by those\nPoliticians and activists and it is it has a very single sole purpose which is to embarrass the United states\nYou know what it is embarrassing to the United states but not in the way they had hoped it's really embarrassing to Congress and a lack of laws and the Democrats who basically blinked and pretend nothing bad it's happening this should not be allowed and by the way it's not the first time when an American president\nWas busted\nBy one of these assaults on our border we all remember\nA ... in a two thousand twelve I think it was when you had that surge across the border during Obama's presidency and Americans were horrified\nAnd all of us on all the polling on immigration reform when very hard nosed and sort of back fired for President Obama because people held him accountable for not fixing it uh I think this is as as you say a godsend for Republicans although it really is not a godsend to anyone 'cause it's shameful\nUh it it sort of you know evidence of the fact that we pretend to be a rule of law nation but in this one instance we are not\nTaken the breath out of the Democratic tactic locally to talk healthcare healthcare healthcare the battleground poll for the sixty six districts I'm told that this Wall Street journal NBC

someday F. and then to the arguments before the court Richard a very good evening you can refresh already the ... the field\nThat the fish and Wildlife Service one of the part of the debate here believe that there is land in Louisiana that might to\nThe ... the ... go for a frog their ... only ever been in one sided there some decades ago so how did the reasoning go before the court good evening to\nFirst of all I think one has to sort of back up and figure out what's going on a one of the great difficulties in trying to figure out whether a species\nAs an endangered has to be able to count the number of species that exist and in this particular case uh this particular desk the frog lives in one particular location which is thought to be a fragile habitats nobody can say whether or not they may be other places in which it does or does not live the\nBetting is against that because it turns out you need a fairly precise set of conditions for its cycle to work it has to have a tree canopy during part of the cycle then when it breeds it has to go into small ponds where are they do it and then after the\nLittle animals a boy and they go back into the woods again so you need to have open space covered space and all the rest of that and they know how it works in that particular location and\nThe food and Wildlife Service has a huge number of environmental scientists\nAnd they look around and there is no ready to made habitat that you could put this frog in what you do is you have places which have the pools but it turns out they're covered by heavy canopy so in order for this thing to work you're gonna have to change those particular forests are there are a couple of complications want it takes a long time to do this\nI'm too it takes a lot of money to do this and three you never know when you try to create the habitat for one species you might be wrecking the habitat for another species because you don't know all the things that are going to be there are so at the government does is it's exhausting study coming up with the notion that this is the best\nPossible habitat that we can find them then what it does it says we don't want to buy this land which would make the problem go away in terms of the legal issues what it says is we want to designate this as a habitat and you have to understand what this peculiar designation means\nIt does not mean that the government has the right to enter the particular land\nWant to designate this is a habitat and you have to understand what this peculiar designation means\nIt does not mean that the government has the right to enter the particular land um it doesn't exclude the owner from entering the land himself\nBut what it does do in effect\nIs to make it very clear that the owner can no longer changed the configuration of the land the trees the coverage or anything else\nUnless they get the approval of the fish and wild sort of wildlife services which is necessary given the fact that this is supposedly a habitat for endangered species as you do is you are mobilized essentially this large number of trees the\n\nBeyond that sort of the John ... professor Richard Epstein teaches law at NYU and\nTo go for ... we're talking about living creature that doesn't have a happy\nHabitat in Mississippi where it's named and what has been\nProfiting for many hundreds of thousands of years but right now the fish and Wildlife Service that fat found Fifteen hundred and forty four privately held out ... acres in Louisiana which is kind of next door and they've designated those acres so there are privately held\nHabitat what does that mean what is the power of habitat and Richard I go to the all the arguments\nYou preview this by saying Justice Kagan introduced the hypothetical of landowners and the designation of critical habitat\nAnd she asked whether a job making a slight improvement that's the quote you give\nA would be adequate Justice Roberts on the other hand um it I read this mocking asks the question can you build a giant greenhouse in plant long leaf pine in Alaska and called out of habitat now both seem to be making fun of fish and Wildlife Service Sarah\nHave I have I misunderstood the sobriety at the court\nWell I mean they're all trying to do is to figure out how something relates to the key statutory term that is the Supreme Court when it took this case\nThe sobriety of the court\nI mean what they were all trying to do is to figure out how something relates to the keys statutory term that if the Supreme Court when it took this case was not interested in for his principles there is a statute which says that the fish and Wildlife Service\nCan designate essential critical habitat for conservation purposes and the actual dispute in the court was a semantic one is what does it mean to be essential\nAnd what justice Kagan's hypothetical was designed to establish is that you can have an essential habitat which is not currently occupy by any members of the species\nThat is in some sense we're done because the statute actually anticipate fat and does have procedures for an occupied habitat the chief justice counted this from the other end says this term\nAre essential may come in some cases but it's not infinitely elastic and certainly would not say that I habitat is going to be essential if you pick some random part of the forest up there in Alaska decide to cover it up with some kind of a dome and then put some pine trees and it and do it you could not designate\nThat land and the answer that Justice Kagan would give his\nWee ones found a frog of this particular ... in this area so we are closer to the situation of not being an arbitrary selection which is true I don't think you could say this was all betray and capricious but what it is is it's highly remote and so the question becomes\nHow essential is essential is the question they're debating and he would never have to debate this question\nIf the issue was put to the fish and Wildlife Service if you want to designate this land is habitat\nCondemn at which point you can do whatever you want with a nickel in some of it off\nBut the sweet home case that you referred to was bad but said essentially when the government does engaging in habitat designation\nIs prevent the animals from being harmed by the destruction of habitats and that is something which they can do as of right under the statute which says you're not allowed to take endangered species and the terms of listed there you're not allowed to capture not allowed to\nProduce you're not allowed the hundred not allowed to slaughter one form or another and then the issue is whether or not the word home which is kind of defuse coming habitat destruction as opposed to something that's not going to sit on that list like\nPoisoning an animal and there was a\nBig argument about it and Justice Stevens said look as far as I'm concerned the government may think it's more efficient to designate a habitat than it is to buy it and who am I to tell them given the deference that we give to administrative agencies that there's wrong so habitat or preservation is now essentially\nThan it is to buy it and who am I to tell them given the deficit we give to administrative agencies that there's wrong so habitat or preservation is now essentially a regarded as an anti harm measure rather than as a provision\nThat but at that mean you know when we had the bond that means the government doesn't even have to deal with the controversy of taking any more you can just dancing or something like Central Park a habitat and nothing will ever happen to it you don't have a ... and\nWell the question is do you meet the essential test and if you read essential narrowly then they can't succeed because it's not critical because it's not as central to centrally broadly you can do it the takings problem just eliminates that problem because you know you want to take it to take it whether it's essential or not and you figure it out\nDo you have to do you have to compensate if you ... as opposed to that yes yes you do so because the fish and Wildlife Service money if they said take money at\nToday for gains tomorrow what they do and governments typically condemn property for sites they sell part of it off in order to recoup ... right\nNow because what happened to the Supreme Court works is once a president is decided I'm In the course of oral arguments you're not allowed to reopen that particular point\nSo the only thing they could do is to look in the dictionary and similar sources most of them and they use the word essential talking about indispensable viable without which something can't worry going to the core of the essence of things and I would think as a straight linguistic matter a future use of property which is going to require future payments\nWhich are not yet made which may never happen could hardly be regarded as essential\nBut Justice Kagan is trying to say look I get these guys deference to them I get these guys deference\nThey know more about the environment than we do we know they did this extremely careful study which they didn't do\nIt was exactly the study you would want to do if you're going to condemn the land the differences if you can buy if a zero as you can with designation you'll take it but if you have to pay thirty four million dollars is not a very likely chance that they would put their money up for that so the takings clause is designed to do is to establish a market as against the government\nUh which will reduce its appetite and as I keep stressing when you teach this or you talk about it\nIs the greatest importance of the takings clause is not that it gives compensation when property is taken\nWhich is nice the really important thing is you put a price up there\nAnd all of a sudden some hair brain scans of some dubious games are not worth the price that you have to have so you don't do it there was a famous case called Lucas and which the government designated certain land hum as being essential to keep it empty\nWorth the price that you have to have so you don't do it there was a famous case called Lucas and which the government designated certain land\nHum as being essential to keep it empty even though it was worth five hundred thousand dollars and Justice Scalia wrote an opinion saying if you designate this so it can't be used for anything it's\nTaking what the government was required to do was to buy land pay Mr Lucas five hundred thousand dollars now and it's titled little lamb which cost at five hundred thousand dollars and what do you think they promptly did\nThey sold it because it wasn't worth five hundred thousand dollars to a neighbor offered them to pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars I said where am I going to get the rest of the money for this so essentially what they did is they put it up to auction and that's what it is if you actually have to take possession of the property you don't want that\nWhen you do as you say it might be better off selling off this thing and taking the money and using it for real habitat preservation what do the preservation what do I want to keep the Susannah Richard\nYou introduce the possibility of wiggle room here when the court decides this it turns on the word essential how can they fish and Wildlife Service make a rational argument that inventing something in Louisiana that might in fifty years satisfy the ducks could go for Prague is essential habitat how do they make that\nArgument they make is there money multiple reasons to return and a sense all as far as that concern means appropriate for conducive\nTo edited minutes straight it has the first right to interpret the statute so this gets back to the famous Chevron doctorate and if you regard the tournaments ambiguous you give a nod to the agency I Do not regard this term is ambiguous about what essentially happens\nIs the liberal wing of the court is much more willing to regard terms is ambiguous and the conservative turned\nJustice Kavanaugh was not present on the bench when this case was argued so it's quite possible to go for for which point that would be argued and I think one of the things that's likely to happen as you get a consistent I'm intellectually conservative majority\nIs that they're going to be less willing to sort of find ambiguities which allow administrators the discretion I think this is a pretty good case I have never seen the word essentially used in the way in which it was used by the court below it says\nIt doesn't matter when it doesn't matter how it doesn't matter how much it costs it's essential that the government thinks that it's essential\nAnd so the statutory constrained does read out and I don't think that this particular\nCourt will tolerate this how it is that the four liberal judges will go I don't know nobody quite knows the basic opinion after the ... the oral argument to places\nWe'll tolerate this how it is that the four liberal judges will go I don't know nobody quite knows the basic opinion laughter that yes we are all argument to places that it can go

I'm looking at figuring out how to better utilize my phone without having to touch it\nWell that's true that's true I'm fortunate that my car has the uh the Bluetooth link between the phone and the car so I have hands on her hands off rather yeah and that's but that's been a great thing for me because I used to drive round the phone plugged into my ear and holding it in front while I'm driving not anymore\nWell I saw supervisor jak Smith a commercial that he's put together and there's a few other ones coming from the county ...\nOn the phone plugged into my ear and holding it in front while I'm driving not anymore\nWell I saw a supervisor jak Smith a commercial that he's put together and there was a few other ones coming from the county educating people about the new ordinance and what's happening there so that'll be interesting but hey we've got a great show today\nUm I've got a good friend of mine who we were able to get in on his schedule and haven't joined us here today and That's Dr John Bundy we're going to be talking about his history where he came from\nUm what got him into becoming an eye doctor and some of the things that he is doing here not only in our community but across the world in helping people see better so good morning doctor Monday how are you a Charlie things so much for having me really excited that you're here\nUm we've known each other for a few years now and I'm ever since I started doing more radio shows uh I've been talking to you saying we've got to get on the air we got to get on the air and we finally were able to make the calendars meat and I'm super excited that you're here yeah ... ... an hour so tell us a little bit about yourself uh where are you from and um where'd you grow up\nYeah you bet so I grew up in South western Wyoming and when patients here that I'm from Wyoming there's two answers one is I Love Wyoming it's beautiful place and that means they have been to Yellowstone in July and the other answer is yeah I grew up in Wyoming too and that's why I now live in northern Arizona [laughter]\nI don't know how many hundreds of patients have been seen in the far reaches yeah by county through that program but it's quite a few\nWell and that's one of those things in pike county is gigantic and often\nUm you know and I'm even guilty of this I really focus on the quad city area a lot because that's you know what I Know best but we do have lots of fellow citizens out there you know in ... canyon city\nYou know you get way way out into the stick sometimes and as you mentioned those are folks that are often in need of some assistance as well yeah and it's really hard for them to\nTake an entire day\nTo get off of work to somehow get into town to get the care\nTo get it taken care of so you know I think it's about a month ago I was a doctor who provided the exams in the care on a Saturday in quarters like so we saw twenty six patients\nTo get it taken care of so you know I think it's about a month ago I was a doctor who provided the exams and that care on a Saturday in course lakes and so we saw twenty six patients\nAnd those folks can just drive down the street to come see us versus having to drive you know get forty five minutes almost an hour into town to come to Prescott so it's been a great program\nAbsolutely now you will also do the eyeglasses recycling\nProgram yes and so I always tell patients pleased donate your old eyeglasses most any eye doctor's office will take those and work with alliance to get them sorted processed and put back er into use\nAwesome know another big thing that's coming up and this is a really great collaborative effort and that is the school screenings\nYes and so this was another program where you know multiple people start talking and working together and and the outcome is is terrific so Carol Chamberlain at Arizona community foundation\nSent me an email probably a year ago now said hey we want to help with kids vision in yeah by counting how much money as it's going to take and I said well let me think about it I'll get back to you so I wrote back and I said you know lions and yell by county we work hard we recycle newspapers there's fundraisers we have donors\nI'm not so sure once again that it's a money problem\nAnd so long story short there was I said you know\nOur club has worked with school nurses for last\nUm however many years doing proper vision screenings screenings that are not referring a bunch of kids who don't need to go to the doctor to the doctor screenings that are missing kids so we work with them to do more efficient screenings it's easier on the school nurses the outcomes are better and so that program is just now up and running\nGetting kids who need to be seen by the eye doctor to the doctor\nAbsolutely and again it's a great collaboration between the Arizona community foundation of you have a pi county and the lions and our schools and really giving assistance again to those kids that are in need of being able to see [noise] yeah there's so many people in nearby county who want\nTo help their neighbor and so what I Love about this program with the lions mobile clinic is is folks working together to get those good outcomes 'cause I think having a good intention is wonderful but then we need to take that next step further to do it properly and do it well and that's what's being done\nAbsolutely no when you're dealing with school screenings what are the types of things\nBut then we need to take that next step further to do it properly and do it well and that's what's being done absolutely no when you're dealing with school screenings what are the types of things we were looking for\nSo the biggest thing is um kids who are not going to complain because it's normal for them all they know is that you was that they look out every day they don't know that maybe it's not as good as it could be\nOr kids who can read the chart well but they're having to work super hard to make it clear and so they're not advancing their reading their schoolwork as difficult they're misbehaving in class because they can't see properly\nAnd so with that program um once you guys do the screenings what happens to a student that is identified that needs to either follow up or to get our glasses yet so this is where that collaboration comes in so well\nSo our lions club for the longest time has worked with a school nurses so the kid gets a form sent home and says hey your kid failed the ice screening they need to be seen by an eye doctor\nIf you need help paying for that access covers kids I care for if you don't qualify for access the practice on our lions qualify here's their application\nOr the Affordable CARE Act mandated pediatric surgeon so that's covered\nAnd and then our lives is also worked with um some national vision plans that provide vouchers for exams and glasses for kids so\nNo kid should go without any of counting now let's talk about the mill clock fund so male clock was noon lion um unfortunately never had the privilege of meeting him he uh\nHe lost his vision later in life and had a real passion to help folks who are are going through that who are legally blind who are low vision who have trouble and so\nI might mess up the history here a little bit um so he held out what the blind center in Prescott that closed years ago\nThe money now is used towards frankly I care for those in need any of the county so Mel ... dot com in the L. C. L. A. C. K. has the information has the application so adults who have difficulty paying for I care including glasses\nThey can go on line felt that application and go see most in the eye doctor in the county to get the care that they need\nAnd just looking at the website again it's M. E. L. C. L. A. C. K. dot com or\nAny I Dr ... by county to get the care that they need\nAnd just looking at that website again it's M. E. L. C. L. A. C. K. dot com or it states who qualifies residents of yeah but by county with limited income who are in need of assistance to help pay for an eye exam eye surgery or glasses\nTo see if you qualify all you have to do is print out the application form completed and mail it to the fund administrator\nOr there's even an option to fill out the application online even better so anyone who qualifies for access almost automatically qualifies for the milk ... program\nAnd since two thousand and twelve over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and I care has been provided by this fun and I would say that number is a lot higher now yeah [noise]\nYeah uh based on the technology of the website it looks like it may just slightly be old so [laughter] um but a lot of information is available here and um it talks about how the funds are managing and all the information you might want to need to know about the Mel ... fun\nI'm definitely an interesting program that's out there and it's doing a lot of good in the community\nYou know the the lions just like the ... just like the ... you know all of these different groups really step up and different ways and the community\nAnd you know again the lions are extremely well known for the I care side of it I'm just the other day I saw him in front of a grocery store doing some of their fundraising and uh you know knowing that it's all going towards an extremely good\nCause yet lines have been around for a long time it's the world's largest service organization I think with over one and a half million members worldwide\nThat's tremendous and through some of that we're going to talk here after the bottom of the hour break about some of your international work that you do and also there's a\nA programmer project that you have a lot of interest in it's kind of your personal thing and I can't pronounce it it it's the lens program it's this uh [noise]\nI just I cannot pronounce the first word so we will discuss that after the bottom of the hour break let's talk for the last moment or to hear about your practice you all have some tremendous employees that work there and tell us a little bit about that\nSo that's a that's the secret I suppose is ah when we get a new play employee we say what is our product and no answer I care um you know quality glasses those kinds of things and we tell them that our product is caring and that's our culture is\nAnswer I care um you know quality glasses those kind of things and we tell them that are productive caring and that's our culture is no matter what that patients coming in for we're going to care for them\nWhen one of the unique things that you will offer and I have benefited from this is the bluff ex treatment\nI was wondering if you bring that up Charlie yeah yeah so you know if you wake up with those really ... all the time yeah if you feel like your garbage in your eyes when you wake up or give me a call we can do some deep cleaning and\nSee how tough we are yeah it

Dr money let's go back to some of your experiences internationally tell some of the stories of some of your trips\nSure so about four years ago I'm walking through fries up on willow creek road and my phone started ringing I looked down at it and this is before you know everybody's calling each other from all parts of the globe super easily like Scott called David Joanna ... answer and I said David\nWas hey John my eyes are killing me so David Was in a Chiang Mai Thailand at the time he's a ... a really neat guy he grew up in Prescott valley home school kid he's been a missionary over in southwestern China for twenty plus years met his wife a\nLorna and now they live in Chiang Mai Thailand raising their daughter there as they're as they're considering their work so David as care to go into the Cornell disease that we had mentioned briefly before\nAnd so it reached a point where he couldn't do as Web design business anymore he couldn't write he's an author he's written a book a couple of books actually and and so it's bringing him out and so I said you know what David I've been feeding these lenses\nI'll fly out here you know you get on a plane I Know it's a twenty two hour short hop over here but ah we'll get you taking care of\nSo he gets he gets in Nebraska and he he looks terrible sorry David but you've been traveling for twenty two twenty four hours drove up the hill from ... from Phoenix sand or he's at my office and so we're we're putting these big lenses on him\nAnd long story short is he's one of my very few patients who did not work well for and it absolutely tour me apart\nBecause if anybody deserved the help it was him and I wanted to help him so bad so fast forward to\nLast July and David as having a procedure done over in California with a doctor that I work with for care to ... to a halt his care to ... to improve his vision and to make things even better\nSo the way that worked was stay the night and a couple of friends here in Prescott we joined David last January over in Chiang Mai Thailand we went over to the Myanmar formerly known as Burma border and we're working in some refugee camps over there and so\nAs we're driving down seven hours of horribly windy roads to the middle of nowhere\nI'm watching David work on his laptop and I can tell you ...\nAnd so as we're driving down seven hours of horribly windy roads to the middle of nowhere I'm watching David work on his laptop\nAnd I can tell us when he got his horrible headaches in his eyes are killing him and he's telling me about it I said All right well let me make a call so I contacted a doctor in California that I work with and said All right\nI Know people who can help what would it cost you know to to get David this a destabilizing procedure for his care to ... and long story short there was they said you find a way to get them here and we'll get it taken care of\nAnd so it's another one of those collaboration stories where\nIf there were so many people working together so many pieces to fall into place it wouldn't have happened and so this uh this procedure that we're talking about\nIs a it stabilizes the care to go and if it's not supposed to make things better\nNations off instantly glasses are especially lenses the squirrel lenses but for David he actually sees better now and he no longer gets double vision was driving at night he told me multiple times they'll pull over because he gets teared up and his wife says hey what's wrong and he's like I can see and uh\nAnd I love that story because I ...
