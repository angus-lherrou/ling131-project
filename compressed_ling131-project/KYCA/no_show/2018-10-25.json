three [noise] so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting and can talk and to\nHave a big debate the other nights are only statewide televised debate and my opponent I chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have made some fairly significant headway in in\nBoth the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and\nThe Democrats have made some fairly significant headway in in ah both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and\nA sense a you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm and has been for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against them now\n[noise] or early doubt out we had a or Minnesota is turning Brad across the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina let's didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLeft and so extreme and and part of that resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground\nA and then she's also a for\nOpen borders and she wants Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being as hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on called for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cattle when we go vote and they do their research and and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith didn't want to debate may or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of democratic fundraising and a visit to drum up support for some of the house candidates mired Paulson and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of the

great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen\nOr all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody is fighting for\nOur farmers including their issues at the forefront of a campaign so\nAll the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm\nNot feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota\nThere is a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get

live through Amos and Andy survey out where he had white people in black said he's playing to black characters and it was just magnifying the worst area attacks about black people\nSo he ain't accepting the apology\nYeah well look if I can understand how people were offended by that um those were largely shows very traumatized by white audiences and and you know I get it they they thought the African American and I think it stereotypes and that's what people laughing at rather than with yeah people\nI'm so look [noise]\nAh it it really is a question here of contexts\nAnd that's what people laughing at rather than with yeah people I'm so look [noise] ah it it really is a question here of context but I think society has moved to a place where you can't put my face on or white face

Wilder racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is now it's so disgusting on so many levels and insulting to Holocaust survivors and you know all people everywhere but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no real solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nIn the Michigan Senate race clearly has no idea she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insults a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is a basic this is absolutely base you know we we learned the amount of the first days of English class and the logical fallacies ad hominem attacks\nOn what you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a it for her part has been a career politician for forty three years as collecting four million dollars and the taxpayers only gotten the five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... buildings she writes bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but\nShe's a salad a as a New York senator loaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five Ninety ... some of the time respectively\nShe writes to bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but\nShe's a solid a

costs around the taking care of education and around the funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed and in our veterans who were coming back home she's broken palms and so I said her all the time\nAnd I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask is why should we believe you this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected they will engage in this politics to drive us apart and what I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we in all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this a lot of stamina now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nA majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie stamina standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\n'em in a better trade policies against now China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants or forty four year career in politics to continue suddenly she is Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\n[noise] uh she she is a selective uh ... and her positions she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her I'm centers to have it on and you can\nSee our debate on John James for Senate dot com and follow around 'em but senators will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she supports sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure our borders she's been up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is something we need to get done right now all we need in illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who is going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing because this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if Debbie Stabenow gets re elected on national security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nJohn what is the reaction among African Americans in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran are you a West Point graduate are you um you're a Republican which is is you know\nState uh Europe proud combat veteran are you a West Point graduate are you um you're a Republican which is is you know it's it's not something that a lot of people in Michigan you know are are used to because the Democrats still have a\nYou know still had a monopoly on the black vote but are you finding you're getting more\nBlack support in your state is or or does the Republican label's still scare people off\nWell I'll tell you what if people get to know me for me as people begin to disassociate a me from the are by my name or the color of my skin or they begin to realize that hey guys um this uh this guy made\n'em want a Republican primary in a in the state and uh I'm going to be the only African American at the top of the ballot ... and people are starting to realize that everything that I'm saying a rings true I mean you take a look at with senator stabbing now has failed to do\nAh with with uh with what concerns African

Mikhail Gorbachev than the leader of the Soviet Union a country that still existed and Ronald Reagan president of the United states it was the abolish men of a complete class of missiles\nNever done before these were missiles that were intermediate range from a few hundred kilometers to several thousand kilometers\nThe concern was based in New York based in Russia that there was no warning\nWhen they were fired maybe six minutes maybe four minutes to target unlike the ballistic missiles of\nIn Russia that there was no warning that\nWhen they were fired maybe six minutes maybe four minutes to target unlike the ballistic missiles of\nThe u._s. than Russia in silos that have a big ballistic dark and you have some warning time there is none with the INS do that what that means is when the missiles were fired miscalculation or not you must respond instead of late don't check shoot launch on warning\nThat is what started the end of the Soviet us Cold War in Nineteen eighty seven when the two scientists in these last hour as the president of the United states the knowledge that the U.S will leave the IMF treaty\nBetween us and Russia\nIn six months' time unless\nThere is satisfaction that the Russians formerly the Soviets are not violating the INS treaty by building a new class of missiles intermediate range missiles\nTo replace the Soviet era ss twenties these are ... on a great big truck that you can haul into the forest the tiger shoot from anywhere\nAnd again there's no warning they just come there like cruise missiles they fly\nRight through and destroy either operations or leadership or other missiles to before they can shoot back we welcome Rick Fisher of the international assessment of strategy center riding most recently the epoch times about the IMF treaty and China\nRick I'm very good evening to you does China at the pie LA\nDoes did have intermediate missiles that are comparable to the S. S. twenty of the twentieth century good evening to wreck\nFiguring John indeed China does have intermediate range ballistic missiles and two thousand fourteen it revealed its dong facing the F twenty six a four thousand kilometer range\nOr intermediate range ballistic missile comparable\nTo the old Soviet ss twenty five or be um that was the subject and was destroyed because of the IMF treaty\nChina does have this missile in both are armed with nuclear warheads and with the new verbal anti ship ballistic missile warheads Gordon\nRick there a couple of problems with the IMF treaty right now I'm principal among them is that the Russians have been violating it since at least two thousand\nIt's gotten Rick there are a couple\nOf problems with the IMF treaty right now I'm principal among them is that the Russians have been violating it since at least two thousand eight\nAnd the United states despite what has been doing has not been able to bring the Russians into compliance that would seem to me to be a good reason to get out of the treaty because we just have a one sided agreement right now but the other reason is what you've just been talking about and that the Chinese are not a part of the treaty that question is\nDo you think it's possible that Beijing could be persuaded to join a real new ins treaty which should include Russia and the United states\nGordon uh it's my opinion that both the Russians and the Americans at various times have tried have implored the Chinese to consider some kind of relationship with the IMF treaty the problem with China\nAh since we started a outreach since really since the Nineteen eighties\nWhen we began to try to have these conversations with the Chinese as it is that they have refused entirely to be constrained in any way by an international arms control treaty or they\nTheir goal is dominance and if your goal is to dominate well then you conceal you hide you refuse any kind of transparency so that your enemy or can prepare to defend themselves against the Chinese understand us and so they reject arms control as we have practice it even with\nOur dire enemy the former Soviet Union\nGuy does Russia have a dialogue with China about intermediate range missiles the in the same concern could be a magic in Russia had with Europe Russia and China there is no morning here\nJohn ... it's my opinion a it based on conversations that\nThere is a wide swath of the Russian national security elite that has long been concerned with China's military buildup especially their build up of ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles unfortunately for them however a lot of them are potent has decided that he\nNeeds China's economic support in order for his regime has dictatorship to survive so he is going to downplay and ignore the strategic challenge from China for now but I also believe that ... and and\nAll right so he is going to downplay and ignore the strategic challenge from China for now but\nI also believe that potent and his national security advisers understand that after this period of time with China that the Chinese are going to come after them and so they ... they're buying time to prepare\nFor an eventual Chinese tilt against the Russians Gordon\nSo Rick with these short and intermediate range missiles or the Chinese have them all of them are appear to be mobile even the ones that are supposedly hidden underground\nThe U.S doesn't have road mobile a ballistic missiles we've got ones that are in silos they're really vulnerable um because they can be taken out on a first strike\nUm do you think that the United states will actually go to what the Russians and the Chinese have which are these ... missiles sitting on big trucks that can just go wherever they want or are we going to stay with a silos in the future\n... Gordon the army has a program to build a modern short range ballistic missiles and there have been suggestions from army officials that they would like medium range ballistic missiles as well\nUh uh the Chinese have been building medium range ballistic missile solid fuel mobile medium range ballistic missiles ah since the early Nineteen nineties\nUh the twenty seconds right the American military wants them as well and as we do build\nThem and we should we should also consider offering this technology to our allies in Asia\nRed fish are the international that's been a strategy to enter the INS treaty at this point\nIn six months Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John bachelor\n\nSean Hannity she'll\nJustice Department has now pro being told me these memos over classified materials just so the horses those memos that he leads to is Columbia professor friends for the purposes\nPro being told me his memos over classified materials to stores to parse those are the memos that these leaks do is Columbia professor friends for the purpose of launching this special counsel with those other buddy Robert Mueller I mean in other words it could have been predicated just on a\nOn a criminal act itself which is unbelievable when you when you look at this on the surface Sean Hannity they want and are asking\nThe attorney general and the department of justice to the United states do launch a full blown investigation into the possible crimes that were committed by the former disgrace FBI Director Andrew McCabe Loretta Lynch Peter Straub Lisa Page Hillary Clinton they're all being referred to today for criminal investigation when there's\nOf steel tariffs much less time with China's Pacific tariffs\nBut several months with steel and aluminum tariffs\nAnd it's clear Isabel from every major data series at the American government puts out that not only are those industries that use steel and the and that he was a looming him not being harmed by these towers yet they're actually out performing the rest of manufacturing in most respects\nGordon Allen I'm you know we've had a number of discussions about whether manufacturing has come back to the U.S I'm a bit more optimistic than you are but what does the data say about companies relocating manufacturing coming back here is going someplace else\nWe have a minute and you can take your time\nOkay here we only have anecdotes in terms of companies coming back but certainly you can look at us manufacturing output\nIt's growing quite nicely and you can look at you as a manufacturing employment um which is actually growing faster than overall us employment it's been decades since that's happened the only week aspect of us manufacturing's performance lately has\nBeen on the wage front real wages in manufacturing now falling\nWhereas in the few years before Mr Trump's inauguration they were rising albeit\nVery slowly Allen tunnel then he blocked\nWages manufacturing a nail falling whereas in a few years before Mr Trump's inauguration but they were rising albeit very slowly\nAllen tunnel then he blogs at reality check as an independent observer of manufacturing the United states and around the world Gordon Chang the Daily Beast\nAnd message to the four seasons hotel Shanghai do not expect us delegation and hangers on in early December to the Chinese show of being an export culture\nDo not expect us we're not coming I'm John bachelor [noise]\n\nWorld Series about pitching these days pitching is so specialized in the first game of the world series when the three run Homer over the\nWall had\nThree different runners scored credited the three different pitchers specialized you can specialized with balance of nature fruits and veggies\nBounds of nature provides real nutrition of over ten servings of thirty one different fruits and vegetables per day\n... fruits and veggies help boost the immune system over seven hundred and twenty percent dollars of nature as one hundred percent all natural whole fruits and vegetables no synthetic extracts or fillers dumped him nature provides a health coach no charge to you to guide you with any question to ask if you want more proof you can check out all of their testimonials that\nBalance of nature dot com take steps to give yourself better overall health is I Do call them now eight under two four six eight seven fifty one\nThat eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one or go to balance of nature dot com make sure to let them know you heard it here by using discount code John J.

Decatur was challenged with a dangerous maneuver by the Chinese warship some weeks past there was no challenge and the Taiwan Strait good evening to you Steve\nAre good evening John well in recent days we have had some rather provocative statements made by the mayor of Taipei who is seeking reelection that has sort of question\nLose Sean Hannity ... want to keep going you want that success or do you want to tune in put on your television and here Nancy Pelosi speaker Chuck Schumer the Senate majority leader they have NO PLAN to make your life better nothing\nThey are proposing nothing to make the lives of Americans better they're running on hate Trump\nThey're running on pay capital if they're running on hate hate hate and all they wanted you to vote\nFor Trump out [noise] we got to deal with what his now become national disgusting\nPersonal blood shooting disgraced they have\nThis man's reputation in Eighteen days with the euro corroborate aid to a national disgrace that people rushed to judgment Sean Hannity weekdays at one on the news fourteen Ninety eight one oh three point five of them came why CIA [noise] [noise]\nI'm sort of a jelly beans were living in China China is in conflict\nWith the Trump Administration with our European allies the conflict has to do with the Chinese business plan which is piracy and China has not at this point acknowledged that it has another way piracy or else the Chinese position well you cannot lie to your own data\nAnd I'm looking at an article published recently by just\nThat it has another way piracy or else the Chinese position well you can not lie to your own data\nAnd I'm looking at an article published recently by Jeffrey Snyder all camera investment partners and every child I'm looking at China GDP China dollar correlations China China nominal GDP China industrial production\nChina or retail sales China fixed asked that investment\nIt that it's that charted only goes down\nDown now either this is the recession or China doesn't have recessions it has retreat I don't know what the polite word as we go to Charles or tell of Sunday's with our tell he's also an investment counselor Charles the question Gordon and I have for you and your crystal ball\nWhere is China in six to nine months because that projection our markets like that's what the stock market reflects does China have and flag to these declines good evening to you\nBecause you need to you both ah thanks so much I think not unfortunately I think if you look in excellent data that's produced by un C. P. H. D. that divides all economies into their consumption their investment et cetera China has been inflated the largest investment bubble ever created in history\nAnd then on top of which there is a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the ... worth of support all this debt so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is that the structure garden\nCharles or you know the number of countries are trying to manage their way out of crises tried to outgrow um problems in China is certainly falls into that category and it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment\nEssentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best\nA straight line flat line gross from ... ... it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nWell I I don't think that China really has the long a period of experimentation in history that we have in the west they just haven't lived through that many booms and busts and we can trace our modern economy back to the mid Eighteen hundreds\nWe've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of them there's just too much productive capacity in China\nYou can trace our modern economy back to the mid Eighteen hundreds we've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of them\nThere's just too much productive capacity in China as soon as they can sell their products and services\nAnd dumped them around the world and places like the U. S. where that's not going to happen anymore so there's a simple way through this you have to cut your fascinates you have to encourage people to consume more inside your country and you gotta you gotta be forthcoming with how much debt you truly have and if it's too much to go to the guy off the mark downs and\nThere has to be a redo the Chinese financial structure\nUh Gordon reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense are they are they telling domestically\nI don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are so for instance they're saying the official national barrel suggests that says that retail sales increased nine point two percent in September\nThe same month a sales of automobiles sell a Levin point six percent\nUm vehicle sales were down the three months of all three months of the quarter and yet they're saying that a consumption is increase\nThat just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sales of other items which were also slapped or down so I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think it got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth\nThere wouldn't be panic there'd be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch I don't think they can do it this time um and then we'll just have to say\nAll right they're buying the Brooklyn Bridge every thirty five minutes a child or what what is what's in it for us does this indication of failure I mean it's a it's a big two thousand eighty or we're looking at this come our way we got defenses for how their equity collapse\nI well I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing is the chairman Jay Powell the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent on the tenure\nWhich means that in a China collapsed or China\nDowndraft we have room to lower interest rates and cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all in much better position than any other large economy it'll hurt and trying to go through this painful\nProcess economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the ...\nTrying to go through this painful process economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population that mess to pose as an order is\nCertainly a very dangerous set of months here um but in the end I think the United states even if the Republicans do not maintain control the Senate will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other major country and\nAnd Gordon I'm checking with you because of this question before the Chinese Communist party capable of taking the recession because that cures is there they they they they've missed price their economy can they take a hit\nI think that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have their and flooding the economy were too much cash you know as you talked about just a few seconds ago China did not go through it's two thousand that everybody else did\nAnd eventually they got to go through that and right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out by interest rates have gone up we have room to move them down again and we're very icing robust Korea and so um you know whether China goes up or down and you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very well\nEarlier today Charles Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times had businesses have borrowed up to one hundred percent against their stock\nOr that they they borrowed it they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market collapsed their assets of collapsed and the\nCentral government is looking to subsidize that collapsed as long as they can ... I Believe that that is not a sustainable model that Fannie Mae times a million correct that more that does not work\nIt certainly does not work and we really do unfortunately throughout China and the Asian in parts of Asia\nPeople do like the gambling levers and do it with ... money is very dangerous um I Hope that our European banks which are also highly leveraged are not overly exposed to the China tried to best were the American banks or think are pretty good shape\nBut in China collapse I think things like that what your bank and other European banks to lend heavily into emerging markets and things in China [noise] wow are they in trouble\nAnd Gordon have you heard talk about bad banks putting in defense is here so that we don't go through a weight as sad as the wave washes are way\nI Wish they did um but I don't think that they really are thinking in that direction John but you know clearly there is going to be some sort of adjustment in China probably will be severe I think it will be fairly soon though I could be wrong on that\nAnd John but you know clearly there is going to be some sort of adjustment in China probably will be severe I think I'll be fairly soon though I could be wrong on that but it will come because China has just done too much to balance its economy since two thousand I\nCharles hotel a Sunday slip Charles Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John

it more or\nOr who are more likely for a family off to profit here are less likely\nI think even more likely because look it's it's it's it's the truth in their face is what happened right you had the

or excited to come out to the ever since\nThe Kavanaugh hearings uh I I Will give you the best way to describe why this has invigorated Republicans and independents who are on the fence for Republicans\nIs that voters or able to see and watch the hearings\nOn my television uh so they felt that the testimony abducted Ford and a Brett Kavanaugh as true or without the prism of a media and they were able to form their own opinions and then when the media\nAnd when the Democrats are always on what was happening they stepped back and say well well that's not what I saw\nOr that's not how

critical\nFor the Democrats to do well in in order to pick up the twenty three twenty four seats do you see any change in these last weeks to interrupt the presumption that the Democrats will do between twenty free and thirty six pickup good evening to our\n\nI'm John ... this is the John ... the eleventh congressional district of New Jersey bill garden he writes for the wall Street Journal who's a member of the editorial board and he's taking us into the eleventh district and showing us how the Democratic party is making a case that the tax cuts\nAnd jobs to active twenty Seventeen which was a product get along with the regulation for the boom and the economy these last month in court or is it was actually a tax hike I think that's right it's not quite logical but I built kind of helped me bill\nHow does the Democratic candidate Mikey Cheryl how does she maintain a straight face when she\nSays that the tax cut was the tax hike how does it work good evening to you about well it works is John\nCheryl how does she maintain a straight face when she says the tax cut with a tax hike how does it work good evening to you about\nWell it works this way John or as you know that one of the more controversial aspects of the tax cuts was to a cap\nDeductions for state and local taxes and mortgages right\nAnd I am a long suffering taxpayer of New Jersey Stan I'm but I was willing to give up these things for an overall cleaner system which they've done so by focusing on this I mean it's true that some taxpayers\nBecause they're deductions on this will be kept 'em we'll have to pay more but there's also you know the empty has been pared back and so forth and others standard induction has been raised so most people are getting a tax cut and even the people who fear\nThat they're not I mean we'll have to see in April but I think more it's going to a more is going to be a wash\nBut it's it's a crazy argument I mean she's essentially arguing the tax bill\nUm was it was a tax hike\nAnd you know the ways and means you can argue the figures all the time but they have figure saying that for the average Morris county or congressional district member Lebanon New Jersey the average family of four is going to give a six thousand dollar tax break\nThis is a problem the Democrats look to solve these last month since the tax cutting jobs at a to explain away the booming economy even to take credit for it I guess and uh build the general conventional wisdom is that they have been successful is that accurate in New Jersey\nI think I think someone in New Jersey look on the Republican running Jay Webber is is the real thing he's a principled a Republican and one of the few with the guts to embrace the tax cut you know he says a lot but he he would like to roll back some of the salt caps as well\nBut uh overall it's been a big benefit the reason the Democrats get away with it in New Jersey and particularly in the eleventh is that Mike ...\nIs a very attractive candidate and by that I mean also has a um an attractive backstory she's a Naval Academy graduate I Believe a former helicopter pilot in the navy and worked for a federal prosecutor she also doesn't have a voting record right\nAnd it's just absurd to complain about the capping of the salt tax as for tax rates\nFor a federal prosecutor she also doesn't have a voting record right\nAnd it's just absurd to complain about the capping the salt tax\nAs for tax relief when you say nothing about the high New Jersey taxes the Democrats given us I mean since June June they've raised taxes in what's already one of the most\nOver tax say the raise taxes on corporate income on personal income and gas taxes just since June and it's going to get worse so um\nYou know it's not a coincidence that I'm Michelle says nothing\nAbout the tax hikes and her fellow Democrats love to impose on um the poor residents of New Jersey state unlike me\nFor those who did not live in the east coast New Jersey is part of the trifecta of blue states with an enormously high tax demand\nAnd that is why the salt that is the state and local tax non deduction in the tax cutting JOBS Act is such an argument here because one one hand you have all Democrats on the other hand the well to do Democrats\nNow have can no longer to duck their ... their\nProperty taxes as they could before and that limits the ability of the Democratic governors to raise taxes that's what that's that's a Frank Murphy in New Jersey Andrew Cuomo in New York certainly no bill that that salt deduction going away means that they have a harder time just routinely raising taxes\nYeah and it's actually it's going to force them to pay a price for it it's just so so we don't have a press that asked a lot of questions so again Mike you Cheryl running on a very attractive resume suburban mom good\nGood background in the military it's harder for her image she runs very good ads I think her image is just hard to associate with polo the style Democrats and she says she wouldn't vote for ... see\nAs speaker but really do you believe that if she's elected that she's going to be a voice for a tax reform and lower taxes in Washington I mean she's going to be voting with the rest of her\nParty is she in the party of miss it flows he says that our first priority and she's going to be the speaker if the Democrat I get the house right\nFirst priorities rolling back the tax bill I mean um it's just crazy we we are without doubt New Jersey the dumb as voters I mean we've all these professionals who who um are supposedly so smart and so educated and um and yet we allow ourselves to be so badly run\nWho who um are supposedly so smart and so educated and um and yet we allow ourselves to be so badly run so monstrous Lee over taxed and this is one reason why I'm\nRolling back the tax bill before rolling back Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump yes there is a priority\nNow I don't think that if Kavanaugh is in her belly where but I think she'd like to do is try to\nDo I ... them and then does raise the fact the Weber shall race in any fashion cars I see an end as is struggling to make a case here\n[noise] yeah I'm not sure in the debate um uh Jay Webber\nYou know I asked her whether she would vote for him in the end is and she said she would and called him a fighter for New Jersey I'm not sure that helps her but I I think the truth is in New Jersey eleventh just no one wants to ask tough questions like what it really means for the state\nUm what it really means for our economy and uh whether um where they were going to get lower taxes as as a\nSort of imply if we vote for him Mikey Cheryl I it's it's just preposterous\nThe conventional wisdom says that the Democrats have between twenty and thirty feet to win here at dry and forty eight to win in order to take the majority and the Charlie Cook report says that thirty a good number\nIs is the shell district critical to that Thirty years is what's it's always going to be a democratic when\nI'm not sure it was always going to be a democratic win but it it fits the profile to swing suburban district it's been represented by Rodney freely house and a moderate\nRepublican oversized banner for free right who retired\nSo it fits the profile that way um there's been a freelancer housing in Congress almost since there's been a Congress um so it

cynical about the observation of the construction anyway\nI'm [laughter] speaking of the traffic light of at girly and a monitor Zuma\nUm there were some really devastating news here in this past week or two and that's the fact that al Charo or as closed its doors in a downtown Prescott location of all of that is\nIt the memories there just go on and on and on and on and on and I don't care how many generations you go back and press get all the all families have memories of going to lunch or dinner at al Charles how well they ... they live in that location for what fifty nine years now\nI remember actually going there for a nickel cheese Chris\nWhen I was going to Washington School of Nineteen sixty five\nIt was all of this tradition in our family to take the kids on the Christmas lighting mhm and go to al ... and they look forward to the lighting and and dinner and at ... way when they were little types\nWell that the the good news is is there is a second el ... location out that Gary daddy opened doubt in Chino valley\nUsed to be called ... street bar and it was yeah imagine that [noise] and I believe it's a wrote three and a half north east all the way back by the ... Christmas tree farm\nAnd now it's called el ... north\nAnd it is a much bigger location which much better parking and from what I understand they've they've created quite a following back there but it's a brand new following for you know those of us who live in ... we just don't go out there that often\nBut I it's a shame that uh the he really couldn't keep the doors open there it was just a rising rents and and couldn't raise the prices in the business fast enough to keep up with the operating expenses so anyway and ah um they're not open for lunch pail char north\nThe prices in the business fast enough to keep up with the operating expenses so anyway and uh um they're not open for lunch pail char nor the that's an interesting thing is dinner only\nSo that they're you know great restaurant um they're still doing well where they're doing well at ... char north day they're not doing well at el ... downtown because their clothes and a lot of people live or at least when I'm Talking to him up asked me what happened dealt Charo what happened dealt Charo and I\nYou know I was sad to see it go they ah [noise] ah there was a pretty big article in the local paper about they're closing and picture a Gary Danny there and he didn't have a happy look on his face but\nYou know we wish Gary the best he's a been a long time member of this community his family's been here forever born and raised and we just hope he does great at the ah ah Chino valley location and we're sorry to see him go\nIt's one of those traditions that it's just you know it's it's a passing of a of of an era\nIt is it sure is ... you know Johnny Keane valley what do you remember that far out there that spin they're out there forever\nThe wishing well there was the wishing Whelan ... know this this this was in Chino the log cabin log cabin right on the left say yes I did you ever think they kind of had a weird location for that bar\nWell I don't know because I remember that we did some of our courting when we had a little bit of money we drive out to the long cabinet and sit and have a beer there and now it's the way back in the late ... early fifties\nWhere you could look across the street and watch the high school physics right across the street and I don't think\nI don't think the high school I was there then and it may not be allowed to do not Nineteen Ninety I think this was Nineteen fifty one that cat that we'd go out to to the ... like you say it called a log cabin on cabin yeah\nSo obviously it pre dated the construction of the high school because\nThere was no Chino Valley High schooler Bradshaw mountain high level or a mayor high school there was much not much Chino valley rarely AOL have it all the students from spring valley corridors junction all the way north through ash for all the way south through your now\nUm they all went to Prescott high school mhm perhaps it was ... school year\nJosh for all the way south through your now um we all went to Prescott high school mhm perhaps it was only ... school year\nAnd that's where would we before we started having talks are\nReferring to the areas the tri city area mhm it was all Prescott ...

used to be the seven me really\nEven went to a one room schoolhouse no inside and plumbing or electricity or anything\nAnd the one where I think two years in a row they took a fair for\nOur field trip and we got to see what it was like to have a city and we saw a movie and we had lunch and the lunch room and it was so exciting [laughter] but it it's always been there that was in grade school [noise]\nWeb Jerry I think you had some issues about el Charo is well\nYes [noise] Sophie and [laughter] I Can't remember his name but when they opened at the wrong it is right they ask 'em my uncle Arthur and his wife of course she had kids to take care of okay\nWait a minute hang on hang on with that is coming to the bottom of the heartbreak please hang on we'll talk to you when we come

either sixty or Ninety Days before the election Mm don't Jewish oh man you cannot campaign until that six period before the election now here\nIn our country you can't put campaign signs up until sixty days before the election but wouldn't it be nice if you could not do any campaign advertising\nFor a fix period before the election it'll never get passed in Colorado and call it Ninety Days have that and just think about what it would do on our people in Washington where they're actually in Washington doing their jobs instead of coming back home to campaign for the next\nAnd just think about what it would do on our people in Washington where they're actually in Washington doing their jobs instead of coming back home to campaign for the next election cycle\nAnd never happened well we

they are an down as you were to to to the Boston Red Sox and they have moved and they're moving and they will be playing tomorrow night in\nLos Angeles so\nWhat do you think Scotty\nWell Boston Red Sox are a very very good team I think gee we're going to see a very happy John rushed around the studio for the next few weeks\nIt's been a good year for him he ah be one of football or the one in uh he's going to win probably in baseball also hold out hope for my Dodgers [noise]\nEither interrupting dollars ...\nDodgers are tough I mean they they are doing well and I'm Glad to know that um at least there in the ...\nOh you're speaking it's always nice to know that I'm so there's a lot of things going on they have a night off tonight there'll be playing tomorrow and I believe tomorrow is friday and Saturday do they have a Sunday game as well in a way\nI Believe Sunday will be traveled date back to Boston okay so they're just here they'll just be out to LA for two games you can catch 'em tomorrow night while listening to Prescott badger football and John Ross I Know he'll keep us updated on the Boston LA score oh you\nThink he'll bring that up a cab Miami once once or twice there's no doubt about it so I'm anyhow and is that time of year for the world series that time of year for Halloween and all kinds of things happening to start up the holiday season a lot of things going on in Prescott, Arizona and\nAs I mentioned and the city council meeting\nOn Tuesday you had the council voting unanimously seven to zero to support\nAs I mentioned and the city council meeting on Tuesday you had the council voting unanimously seven zero to support a brand new\nUm law that's going to go into effect in thirty days it will be warnings up until the first of January it is a first offense or what they call it something different but a primary offense so it's not secondary so if a police officers driving down the road and you're on your cell phone\nUm they will pull you over right she took it if you are driving down the road and you do not have your seat belt buckle that is a secondary offense they can't pull you over for that but if they see on the cell phone they can pull you over for that if you don't have your seatbelt go but but then that\nCan be a ticket as well to the same time so it can get pretty costly uh we did change a few things one thing we did change\nBy unanimous vote is the fact that the castle supported a hundred dollars per se defense and two fifty not to exceed two fifty for a fence is after the first time so um that will be taking place let everybody know out there we're going to do some pretty heavy signage and\nA community awareness through\nUh the hotels out there let folks know that are coming into the hotels and as staying in Prescott that we don't want them to get a ticket and that they'll know right up front that is a hands free\nA community and county and therefore you can't not be on your cell phone now you can have your cell phone on the dashboard\nAnd you can talk on a hands free situation if you pull over to the side of the road and you want to answer a call or take a call and the city of Prescott that would be legal but you cannot have your car your vehicle moving period\nAnd be on the cell phone or it will be a primary offense so I appreciate yet by county a kick in this thing up in raising it up the flagpole to say than here and yet by county\nOr if the state can't do their job in enforcing a no talk so throughout the state of Arizona as far as cell phones that we're going to take this thing and do it herself\nAnd therefore yeah pike county stepped up they were the first ones to move this thing up the flagpole\nArizona as far as cell phones that we're going to take this thing and doing herself\nAnd therefore yeah pike county stepped up they were the first ones to move this thing up the flagpole so to speak and city of Prescott as well as Chino valley\nUh have supported that I think ... valley tonight at the council meeting is going to be reviewing the same thing and hopefully do we ... we'll be right behind that so the whole\nSide of the mountain over here in West yeah by county uh is going to be having a no fly zone zone while you're driving a motor vehicle what do you think about that study you're okay with that\nYeah you know since it's been discussed I've kind of looked
