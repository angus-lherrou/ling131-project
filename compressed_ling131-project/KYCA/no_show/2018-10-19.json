Sox\nCode on yeah that is not yet but by county John go home\nAnd they put so anyways shut up throw my friends here in of course I feel very fortunate to be have an opportunity to be up here today on a friday huge him still down in the valley all week and I leave you know sometimes Sunday nights mostly Monday Mornings get home late friday and\nThen in a downer Phoenix or some place there around the state or you know in my function as corporation commissioner and the and I work for Arizona State university as well and\nI Do a program called the Arizona legislative academy I drafted in in unison with the uh the Martian Institute and Dr Michael grow and we're on our third year go figure at sponges going great and\nArizona states all over the place and they're coming up to press get here and I think I've got a I think we have Bailey on the phone so I Want to say I want to say Hi so good\nMorning Bailey how are you learning how are you in I'm\nDoing great this focuses Bailey bore me she's going to a uh bring a group from Arizona State university appear to our guard deer town in Prescott this weekend and but this isn't something new I mean you've had this uh this group coming up here for a quite a while can you give us an idea of what the what it's all about Bailey\nSure how I work for the white collar I work in communities solution I mean I hear and\nYou ever sit idea what the what it's all about ...\nSure so um I work for the white college a public service and community solutions I'm at ASU and this is actually our second year coming up to sky why in Prescott um but we've had kept co op which is a leadership Kamkar freshman\nUm for the past three years right so uh we we love Prescott how's the weather has\nAnxiously ... I Am so happy you are all coming so and I get ... to the audience\nI get to actually go in teaching leadership program with a with the students tomorrow so I'm really excited about it and the weather was beautiful and you know it's it's Prescott anyway you know there's going to have a great time and\nSo give us a sense I mean here we are in a new watch college just as the College of public service and community solutions are very proud of the work that you're doing why what's the function of having new leadership program come on up here and ... what are we trying to sit with what's the message we're trying to send\nSure will um something important to know about our College of public service is that our undergraduate graduate online students everyone is immediately and burst and sort of this idea of solution based their hands on learning experiences\nSo there's nothing really going on in the news today so I guess I can just leave now\nNo elections coming up the propositions and anybody been talking about propositions right up and down the valley I'm guessing it to the latest one is which is well I guess one twenty sevens probably on the getting the most attention right now\nWe're we're hoping that we could get someone from the corporation commission to to really give us the inside scoop now you know anyone like that well that\nLet me get let me start giving you the story so I'm In my ... my issue I came out with that with an energy plan after working on it for over two and a half years\nIn early January before the ... one twenty seven came out so uh it's not being used as a comparison to prop one twenty seven but I think it's what people in rural America and certainly rural Arizona would expect us to do to\nTo make good business decisions and not close things prematurely so um my my concern at the Arizona\nAnd certainly rural Arizona would expect us to do to\nTo make good business decisions and not close things prematurely so um my my concern at the Arizona corporation commission it always been you know first off energy is very complex is getting more complex and the good news is that the technologies are now becoming more and more important to us [noise]\nSo but throwing the baby out with the bathwater the same time you're advancing your technologies as work and what I mean by that you may recall the\nA couple of years ago uh in fact was February of sixteen a suburb or project a PSA all announced the closing of oh generating station and uh you know of course uh you know the idea is is because natural gas is so cheap there's there's at the time that was in there still is some value that\nHowever you know we still have Fifteen to Thirty years that's available and Abu generating station uh\nUh but you know we we've got these climate issues for sure we you know and and what have you on the markets are changing so we're moving more towards renewable energies and things which are going to be cheaper in the long run the question is how do you really get there so in November of twenty Fifteen\nSilver project is on TV telling everybody in Abu generating station is part of the long term fleet of us are paying a PS\nNinety Days later we're taking a a sharp turn to the right and we're in they announced they're going to close so that's a big deal because you're talking twenty two hundred a ... megawatts of power a new facility has been around a long time a base load power system\nSo of course I didn't think number one uh I I understand markets I think that if we're going to do that let's do this on a on a ... have you on a sustainable basis\nBut it's not or be closed by this time next year if not sooner so that creates a lot of market problems of course up and page and in in ... in a county in Apache County Coconino county and uh it's a it's a rural job problem to say the least however\nThe other part of the equation is a they had been dollar set aside\nTo actually tear it down so you may not be able to suggest that there's resources that are needed to do that but\nUtilities can claim for a band in assets that means they can go ahead and say okay this assets banned in you know ah here's here's the dollar amount that we think that we need to charge the taxpayers back for this asset that we own that net net now were abandoning so the consumer\nAmount that we think that we need to charge the taxpayers back for this asset that we on the net net now were abandoning so the consumer pays for all this stuff and I'm like okay so we're thinking that that number is going to be in the three hundred and fifty million dollar range across the board with ... across the board where everybody [noise]\nSo then you have to say okay well what's it costs are bringing in the natural gas so we don't really have those numbers you remember the natural gas and nobody has that and their backyard here in Prescott or anywhere else in the state of Arizona we do not have\nA resources and are under our underground to have natural gas but we haven't been in the San Juan and the Permian Basin which are in other states which we'd have to import which we do now\nBut there'll be more of it necessary and when you start taking down a base load power systems like an Abu generating station\nAnd having to pay for that closure now you're gonna have to pay for something else you're gonna have to pay to store gas and we do not have storage in Arizona for gas in fact there's less than Seventy minutes in our gas pipelines if both of those basins were somehow freeze at the same time which is a ... a long shot but not inconceivable\nOr we would have a power problem here if we didn't have a if we went all in on on gas\nThat is a that is extremely concerning is to me and I think that it was an extremely concerning to a lot of other people so at the end of the day a contacted a kitten from Oregon said hey can you give us a sense of what that's going to cost a Arizona or to have a storage system and they'd put on our of pie in the\nUh one gas company uh participate in it but now the utilities but we're looking at another three hundred and fifty million dollars now remember this is three fifty for Navajo three hundred and fifty first storage facility this doesn't include pipeline in a gas pipeline increases is doesn't include were other\nOh a power um transmission lines would have to be doesn't include with burners should be\nBut let's say all in all at the end of the day it's it's still cheaper I'm I'm All right with moving systemically ahead with closures that make a mathematical sense in in this particular case I saw that a a process that they took made no mathematical sense especially when you consider\nThat we are now are producing um power\nIn a in ... mostly a utility solar fields ah it like one fifth of the ... it's like a ... I think they're under to censor what our two cents a kilowatt whatever\nOne fifth of the ... it's like a ... I think they're under to censor what our two cents a kilowatt whatever and so that is huge that is a drop from about twelve or Thirteen cents a kilowatt two to\nFour solar in over in just a five year period\nSo I designed to energy modernization plan that took us about two years of hearings and research and\nAnd we actually have it on line it's at the age of the CDC Arizona the corporation commission dot Gov Web site and you can go there and you can pull it up so [noise] so it starts with a bunch of standards and we're trying to probably trying to solve too many things at the same time and I'm not sure if I'm going to lose or or bio mass beast or not\nBut it began with the ah a concept that we could ... truly get to a renewable energy standard by twenty fifty that is actually better than I think better than this dire initiative [noise] I think they move way too quick in the closures would be significant [noise]\nAnd uh one of our issues is being careful not to over generate at times that we don't need our power which is what's going on in California\nFor those of either don't know we receive a lot of power from California mostly in the months of the fall like around now in the spring of a large solar and I'm a renewable generation that they send to us free ... and sometimes they send a check to take it [noise]\nSo ah that that comes on or semi grandpa always told me that what John is nothing free in the world then that's true\nAnd if you look at California's a great system over there they pay extremely more ah for ah for their um energy systems and their their electric bills and we do\nIn part of that problem is is they've they've not generated correctly so they're generating all this renewable energy and they're sending it out but the folks and California are actually paying to send that power over here and I don't want to see that happen in Arizona so we thought\nWe need to find a better way and we need to take advantage of all these technologies that are coming our way and ah so we created a goal setting for Syria of eighty percent of clean energy by twenty fifty\nIts purpose its base purposes to to ask the question when does our coal fleet retire or not there and whatnot is when does it ah prematurely retire but when they retire so we don't have that are banned in asset cost and things\nSo the idea being is that a a let's build into the fleets that we have an as the as we are retiring those would start bringing these new technologies\nSomething so the idea being is that a a let's build into the fleets that we have an as the as were retiring those would start bringing these new technologies and so\nThe the idea that Arizona could be eighty percent clean energy by twenty fifty came to light and I think ah you know I Know we're going to take a break and mental will come back on the on the half hour\nBut at the ... the big difference between our goals and the one that you know Mike the goal that I have on this energy plant in the current initiative is that the current issue doesn't take into account uh Palo Verde nuclear station\nUh my my plan does my plans says that a that\nA nuclear power is clean energy it's clean energy because it is not putting carbon into the air so we're able to maintain a nuclear um a energy system at the same time we're able to uh uh slowly watcher fleet alter into a hope what will become\nA a solar in battery system so there's a there's an energy storage component in it\nThere's a a a clean peak standard that we put in it we've got a we we do have some uh bio mass uh percentages in there too and that was designed for forest but I'm getting nervous that that's going to be too expensive for us but we've got some more of these going out there and we actually have an emphasis on electric vehicles as well so\nAnyway I Know we're going to take a break at the half hour so in a feel for you to give us a call or after the half hour if you want to talk about this a little bit of go into some more details and uh but that this energy plan is not in comparison is not meant to be in comparison to one twenty seven but it would just give me a sense\nOf what that looks like and it may be this is the direction Arizona should have gone so remember numbers by four one one zero one six in ... in [noise]\nAnd I think that that's part of the science to make sure everything's on the table they're yelling at I did take a break you want to hold over ... ah\nI was just going to say and all school board member do you need another speaker for your leadership group oh ...\nThey're yelling at I did take a break you want to hold over Tommy or a\n... I was just going to say the school board member do you need another speaker for your leadership group let me know\nOh ... oh I'll tell I'll tell I'll tell Bailey yeah she's probably Louis and I will that's great I think as far\nAs you know I have kind of an alternative banks\nYeah but nearby it's so the I ...

one one zero one six if you've got a question for Steve he's the head of the pie sign a witness here in Prescott in Prescott area and uh [noise]\nI'd love for you to give them a call and ask him a question if you have a questions about how the program works or [noise] or why why we even have the program or anything you might be interested in five four one one zero one six now ah\nI guess it was just recently there are some some cart that's weird this is not directly involved with Yup I saw a witness but it's an interesting circumstance in in Wednesday tells you the story you can see how\nHow fees sometimes we'll coordinate what they're doing and and um it's just an interesting story a about some concepts that we're going out of Prescott valley just recently so\nLet's just give the folks to an idea about how sometimes thieves work together and how they coordinate things\nI don't have all of the facts Bob but I did I did read them locally uh when I got a public service announcement from an officer from the ... valley police department there really laid it all out and just a few days ago\nA van full of car thieves and car burglar showed up in the Prescott valley area I Believe it was in Granville when I say showed up they came up from the Phoenix area\nThey arrived probably around two ... two thirty in the morning and they pull that man into the neighborhoods and several individuals jumped out and they ran from house to house and car car they're checking car doors to see if they're unlocked\nAnd and I don't know how many vehicles were ... and I don't know\nHow many of those vehicles were on blocked but there were several victims\nAlso victimized were a couple of car owners and and their cars were stolen one of the cars after being chased into the city of Prescott by Prescott valley officers ended up being a band in but then two or three other vehicles that were stolen and the Granville area\nEnded up down in the Phoenix area\nI understand that the sheriff's office got him to chase a once they got in on the ice Seventeen D PS got involved in the van I understand was used as a um\nGot in on the ice Seventeen D PS got involved in the van I understand was used as a\nI'm not a D coy but ... but an interference vehicle that was running between the stolen vehicles in the pursuing law enforcement agencies\nThe the vehicles when all the way to Phoenix uh were chased all the way to Phoenix I Believe there was a helicopter in there once they got down into the Phoenix area\nThat I heard about the um the van ... taking off and going in a different direction and caused a serious motorcycle accident\nAnd it bit by by an innocent bystander a but then one of the vehicles ran out of gas and and the thieves jumped out and ran they were caught later and one of the other vehicles ended up\nBeing abandoned in in that ah that car loader guys for were arrested as well I think they were for individuals arrested I Believe they have warrants for others but it it just a real good example\nOf what can happen you know here in in Prescott Prescott valley area we don't think about things like that happening 'cause they don't happen too often around here\nI might add though that if if you are a car owner and you park your vehicle on the street please don't leave valuables in it where these guys can see 'em 'cause it it's just\nOne more reason why they're going to break out a window in and grab it\nDon't leave your keys in your car and and probably a lot of people out there right now are saying well\nNobody does that well yes they do a lot of people in Prescott think now that they don't live in a in a big city or or maybe they moved here from somewhere else and\nAnd they think we have a low crime rate well we do but it also takes a lot of common sense flock to your car do only valuables in plain sight in a\nBy all means take the keys out of them understand also a couple of these cars that were broken into at firearms in them and those firearms or stolen so if if you want to do more to keep it lock it up and hide those valuables and and um be safe\nYou know I Know somebody who uh left their car running and went into it AM PM to get a cup of coffee and came out in the car was gone was was that locally matter of fact I was [laughter] it can happen just that fast up anything good\nI'm Out in the car was gone when was that local matter of fact I was [laughter] it can happen just that fast up beat thank goodness you don't have any valuables into your car so it doesn't really make any difference to you so we're people who steal stuff out of your car [laughter]\nI live like a homeless person you know we were talking earlier and you mentioned\nAbout people calling in and and read reporting crime to solve the witness and and I get calls from people lot or maybe approached on the street and people say isn't it sad that you have to have a program like this and I agree I agree a hundred percent I think it's\nIt's really sad when you have to encourage people to to do their their\nUm to do the right thing by riling a law enforcement agency and then and then offering money to that person to to give you some information which should be information that\nThat should be a given freely and right and it's everybody's responsibility to get involved in this kind of stuff but that's not the way it is and it hasn't been that way for a long long time\nSilent witnesses here because it works because we're fair because we're honest and because\nPeople can can trust us when they call in that we're not going to do everything we can to find out their phone number or their address or or try to coerce them into giving us a name or something like that right on the program works what what's the number\nI don't want to get people confused about what calling in here what's assigned a witness number that you would call if you're in a call\nOne eight hundred nine three two three two three two\nIf you want to call in and talk to

little bit about to give the folks that idea about a a big program is and and those kinds of issues and talk a little bit about statistics and um\nWhere we are in general speaking with statistics and the data that you collect through the program\nThe program has twenty volunteer members and we meet on a monthly basis to decide how much of their cash reward we're gonna pay each successful taller we also discuss marketing and fund raising the um the rewards that we\nCash reward we're going to pay each successful taller we also discuss marketing and fund raising\nThe um the rewards that we decided upon like I said before a come from a separate account other than our guard marketing and we try to pay those rewards as they come in and out I recently had a meeting\nAnd those rewards that we decided on on at that meeting have already been claimed\nAnd and the way we do it and I I think I meant maybe mentioned earlier would send you to a local bank and they and their extremely helpful in in getting this program along but I wanted to tell you a little bit about the stats and in since we'd we'd just\nA past July and and have our um fiscal year she and her fiscal numbers and I've got some total for you this program started in July of Nineteen eighty two\nThe the first three years there were no arrests made nor were there any rewards paid so and about Nineteen eighty five we really got the program rolling and since then we have arrested three thousand six hundred Twenty one felons\nAnd those tips have led to the recovery of one million\nNine hundred twenty six thousand dollars worth of stolen property and we have seized Fifteen million forty one dollars worth of illegal drugs and the successful callers have received over a half a million dollars in cash rewards\nThe catch twenty two program that is hosted by Tyler with us and it's exactly the same thing same phone number and everything [noise] catch twenty two has to do with um they're programmed everyone ... we run twice a year\nIn the uh the spring and also in December where we advertise the twenty two most wanted felons and you have a bike county and each one of them are worth at least five hundred dollar reward and since we started this program we arrested\nEighty six of those high profile felons and we've paid the eighty six temperatures a total of forty three thousand dollars in cash rewards\nWow that's that's a lot more than I thought it's it's I don't know I\nDollars in cash rewards\nWow that's that's a lot more than I thought it's it's I don't know I I had that tells you a lot about uh what what's going on with more when we're not looking\nI guess [laughter] ... well I you know I could add to that and and just say that we are and and I apologize for I keep saying we but side of the witness has received tips over the years that has led to every kind\nOf crime imaginable whim arrested bank robbers murders rapists child molesters a card sleeves would we even had a one a press kits first um drive by shootings we took the call that led to the rest of that individual\nUm illegal um\nDrug activity burglaries and the list goes on and on and on and just recently at one of our last meetings we pay their reward to the tips to report into two individuals over in the ... area that beat\nUp the little calf ah I I'm I'm not sure how much we want to talk about this but I just can't imagine how low uh you got to go to assault a calf\nAnd they put the pictures of themselves kicking there's calf and and getting an inchoate colds and and slamming into the ground\nOn the um\nOn the Internet and somebody saw 'em and recognized and men immediately called sounded when the sheriff's office went out and found these guys and arrested them so that the uh there's no limit to what kind of goals we get my gosh I Can't\n[noise] you're talking about a ... a baby\nA calf yeah and and it was a very young ... from what I understand I don't get it and\nI'm a general question over the years you've been in law enforcement do you see any\nBig changes uh changes because of population or changes because of lifestyle or\nA ... what do you see in the big picture sense as far as I'm to pick the Prescott area for example um that that might be affecting what's going on in our communities\nAnd my first thought when you brought that up I I think about uh\nGood area for example um that might be affecting what's going on in our communities\nAnd my first thought when you you brought that up by I think about the the lack of respect people laugh for police officers nowadays\nI I Know when I first got him involved into business like I said earlier Nineteen Seventy two which is about forty five years ago uh that people actually respect us\nAnd um you know it really helped when when you had that kind of respect because you would go out to\nA out to a home and and knock on the door looking for maybe a juvenile and the parent would come to the door and they would already have the kid by the ear and say here's the take him and lock him up for a while we need to teach them a lesson you know nowadays they meet you at the door and hand you the\nPhone number of their attorney uh it it just seems to have have really really gotten out of hand um but in in the press gallery of course crime has gone up but so as the population and and I I think it just it just runs together\nAll all all and all that will be in in Prescott is still a good place as far as uh overall crime goes\nOh absolutely absolutely I I wouldn't I wouldn't tell anybody they needed to move out of our area because of the high crime rate that that just not the not the problem but we do have a ... every kind of crime they did that any larger city has with just on the smaller\nBasis right okay well we've got to
