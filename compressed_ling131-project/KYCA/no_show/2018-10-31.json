morning report is brought to you by the city of Prescott\nIt's time once again for the news fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's ... with my guest on cable I see this morning Ben Hooper who is the uh economic development coordinator for the town of Prescott ballet been good morning\nOr good morning Jason thanks for having me on how you doing today I'm doing wonderful and getting better how 'bout yourself\nDoing All right so here we go in and it's ... it's ... it's the end of October coming into November and\nThings have been picking up in Prescott valley we wanted to kind of review a few things as to what's happening out in Prescott belly economics wise and\nBusiness wise and I we talk to you occasionally through the years and uh this is no exception so today's update let's start with a Dunkin' Donuts which we've been hearing quite a bit about over the past year and we've been watching eagerly the corner on glass railroad and one of them were we out on that on that project\nAnd I don't get I I spoke to them or in the past week and they're hoping to break ground and the next two weeks but let me qualify that always has just\nPlans changed things change their coming that will not change they will be coming or they some money into this they vie had permits issued for it so it's not a question of if but when their hope as I just said is within the next two weeks\nAnd they've said that before and and you know unforeseen circumstances that in there and have arisen that has pushed back that timeline\nOr so again it's just a question of when but I'm hoping that there'll be able to stick to that to the their most recent a commitment and and within the next two weeks will the um but uh in the end uh we work on the timeframe of our our business community so whenever they're ready we are happy to have them joined [noise]\nOkay so ah been we've seen some dirt moving or out on ... east highway that is on the business side of a highway sixty nine a quite a bit of dirt moving in front of antelope lanes over there so tell us what's happening over there that's\nRight that is going to be a car wash I Believe it is the name of the yellow sea and I believe in I Believe the name of the car washes called scrub by car wash and what they did is they purchased a parcel out there that was it about know about two or three acres\nI mean the yellow sea and I believe in I Believe the name of the car washes called scrub by car wash\nAnd what they did is they purchased a parcel out there that was it about know about two or three acres I don't have the info in front of me but\nThey're looking to develop half of this site leaving an additional wander one and a half acre on the corner so it'd be hard corner at Prescott he's highly in sixty nine open for a another type of business or development that they are actively marketing so\nIt really is an opportunity for two new businesses but the one that we see a they're moving the dirt and getting the site graded that we know is coming as described by car wash\nI'm very surprised over the years that corner has not developed so it's a it's welcome to see that are starting to move in that area agreed All right so a Ben first of all let's touch over on uh the crossroads area over where\nA chick fillet isn't a Home Depot and all of that area or things are bustling over there seems like a ... to wear hearing a little bit here about a possibly some changes I Believe the native is there has been there for just a little while or are they all the way out\nThey actually closed as Ovide Tobar twenty second ah so we no longer have a native grill wings here in Prescott valley\nUnfortunately that was an issue with the the franchisee\nSo we're ... we're sad to lose them but what that does leave it at great opportunity of a of a restaurant ... gel already vertical knew that a a new user can move into and and make their own uh we we certainly have a huge gap or when it comes to restaurants\nAnd so I don't really uh for see any issue in getting that building Rene populated with a with a new restaurant\nOkay no speaking of re population also we're seeing that ah the old Sam's Club and still empty on the gas station has now gone and they're wondering if there's been any movement in that area\nBut nothing that I Am aware of per se um now let me qualify that by also saying that Wal Mart would not as a private entity would not share\nOutside of their their corporation who they are looking to sell that property to now if they needed to come to the town to talk about a potential zoning change or\nA you know if there was some issue that the end user needed to know that I may be made aware of that or at least vaguely aware of what they're looking to do\nUm I Do know from a conversation and this is going back about four\nThey needed to know that I may be made aware of that or at least vaguely aware of what they're looking to do\nUm I Do know from a conversation and this is going back about four months with the broker who represents that property that they have had multiple offers on the building so it's really just a matter of Walmart and they're a real estate team including the broker at CB Richard outlets that they've retained\nTo sit down and evaluate those offers that have come in and find out what best aligns with our market area um it was Wal Mart that removed the gas station they do that just as kind of a liability issue when you keep the underground storage tanks and\nI've viewed it that it could have kind of been an asset but obviously a a corporation of Walmart is going to view that as a potential future liability and so they just removed that and return to that area to a fresh pad\nSo you know it as well as whoever buys that building there'll be able to re purpose that building they'll also have a an an an out parcel that will be looking to you know to market for a new a new restaurant new gas station new car wash or whatever it is that might fit on a site um of that size\nOK been where we're going to pause briefly for an important message when we come back more on Prescott valleys economic health right now let's pause we'll be right back\nHello this is ... really the new commercial airline for Prescott municipal airport will feature a commercial jet service for the first time in our aviation history now\nWith new United Express flights

com\nFor back here on the news fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's owns a lot of my guest has been Hooper who's the ... the economic development coordinator for the town of Prescott valley quickly been just a few moments left\nUh the apartments are going up around the old albertson's and Haagen sites over a on the Central Valley a more towards the east or any movement in that area or the Kmart area\nI can say that there is is movement hum the the local owner of the former Albert since they have a strong offered that they are working to a potentially except\nI'm into things just just take time with the Kmart that was under escrow with a a developer based out of California um they ended up\nExcept ... things just just take time with the Kmart that was under escrow with a a developer based out of California um they ended up being dropped out of escrow and they just turned out to not be the right outfit to be able to assemble the the tenant mix\nBut what they did do is generate a lot of interest in the market and so once again I Know I Am aware that there are a multiple offers on that former Kmart building and so the current owners will evaluate those offers and and determine how to move forward\nWell hopefully we're going to see something in that area with the apartments there it's the perfect rocking area\nIt is and you know the apartments honestly will make both of those properties are more attractive to to a potential retailer so I I have no a worry in my mind that they won't be repurposed unfortunately things don't move as fast as I Want them to [laughter]\nAnd very quickly last but not least over on the east side uh believe there's some movement on the Prescott valley motel and that's where the circle caves can we now\nCorrect who's going to

[noise]\nI think again the media and really miss apprehend where the American people are on this I think most Americans are probably shocked to hear that illegal aliens living in the United states\nHave a child and that child becomes an automatic said I think most people they don't focus on these issues are off doing other things [noise]\nTrump all of a sudden brings it up a little while\nAnd then you go to U. K. doesn't allow it Spain doesn't allow it France doesn't allow it Canada does allow it\nIt other than the United states the only really advanced economy that allows his bingo\nAutomatic citizenship and Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I could just as a matter of commonsense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the left claims that requires\nA it's it's open to debate it's a fascinating subject are joining us now mark\nKrikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up high yesterday and\nThe media that their ... response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle once again\nWell enough to expect and quite frankly but uh the president is a I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nA clause within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists or\nFalling students to really lately is that phrase a it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means\nGet on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation what's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue it's going to end up before the Supreme Court\nAnd then we'll have a role in one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists um our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something that I have a constitutional amendment or something but it but the only way to get this process even started\nIt's for the president to do this to issue an executive order and what it'll mean is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue ACLU will find one of them they'll sue and then there'll be a lawsuit that's this is\nUm you know whenever you think about this issue or whatever you think the policy should be\nThis is the smart way to ski up the issue so we can move it along\nIn the process of you know public debate because all we're doing now to saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight men acts and somebody says no this other senator in Eighteen sixty eight men why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that stuck it in a setting where this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the present\nI completely agree and we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels\nA Florida birth mother tells the Chinese and Russians Mexican south Americans\nIt is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone or and Dan around on the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian um investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid who has a passport and your golden and gold and a\nKid as a kid has a passport he can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at a lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea\nAnd turkey who do this\nA way of helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have as all it's a retirement plan for some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job\nStates and then they don't have ... ... it's a retirement plan for some people 'cause you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working\nIf ah you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nNow it's it's fascinating we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a

children would be unlucky if I were to win and uh it was you know disturbing a law enforcement's been fantastic uh they're on the case that are making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at each other so what do we do about it but we're going to make sure the kids are safe and then a way to push back which is not going to be intimidated by some creep who um you know drop things in the mail and then a heights so we're going to keep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back in stand up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nAnd then the district you know what you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent\nOr the media and the left the resistance are geared up their jacked up to try to run the tables and congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of this economy are incredibly strong\nA and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district be wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up so early and you know who's jacked up the taxpayers are getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they know it and they understand it and the state has gotten more and more on affordable\nWith every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here Jack it up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or much let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax is just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction withdrawn and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nHike taxes around here and then the blame somebody else in Washington it's not going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and that support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think are both uh lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just graduated back in two thousand\nThat support the president's agenda which is working for the

and and all that stuff and and it's it's real good it's a good life\nBut cars ... and retired uh were announced his retirement in January and the seat is just too important\nTo not get involved a joy ahead and I decided that uh we we're not going to sit on the sidelines\nA in a year as critical as this and come November six come next Tuesday we're not going to watch the returns come in and not know that we didn't do everything we possibly could for our country to expand opportunity and continue to grow this economy keep us safe\nAbroad and reform those immigration policies you've been talking about so uh we were we went all in because the country's worth it in ... people have been asked to make bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and that's what we're going to do\nWhen you look at the national debate\nAnd a and the Democrats have funneled millions and millions of dollars into voter outreach registration getting people to the polls\nHave you gotten the assistance that you need a from Republicans and they are in sea and others to do the same for the Republican side\nThey are and

north Jersey district that as winnable\nAnd we plan on delivering a major upset to one of the Democrat's hand picked\nCandidates this year uh that don't put a lot of money and against us but uh it's a good district in good people around here who know which way they want to take the country that is lower taxes and\nAs well that yeah this is your people hear about New Jersey and and and it's it's always about the jokes in in New Jersey a beautiful state\nAnd there is so much natural beauty in the state of New Jersey I live just for one year in New Jersey you after after college I I Lived in a

place but it has been badly served by corrupt leaders corrupt leadership on in mostly in the Democratic side of the equation and the fact that ... mind to Menendez I mean come on and everything in between you got to have some level headed people in the U.S Congress\n[noise] yeah that's the plan we want we want to go down there and serve and help help uh what is a beautiful state you're right um

scenes a who's who put the word out that it's as long as you get into this group Katie you'll be protected because there's strength and numbers\nBeing a part of a caravan does not give these special rights\nI'm but our message is simple and our message is clear we will not allow a large group an authorized migrants to enter the U.S and an unsafe for unlawful manner we've already seen these groups for say break immigration laws and Mexico and Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics as you mentioned\nAgainst both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week that we will ensure that our men and women on the front lines to protect and defend it and the president has done so in calling up\nThe military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to secure the border but defend our men and women on the front lines\nHave you um are prepared already and homeland security with the\nChance that the president was referencing yesterday that there you're going to now started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does as they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravans size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens\nThroughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit the words out Laura I mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase and family unit apprehensions and the last five years\nWhere I record number of family that apprehensions this year alone what that says if you have a child with you we have to release you into the interior there's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before\nWe're not able to detain them and immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way of deterrence to immediately apple\nWe return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way of deterrent to immediately apprehend and repatriate which which is border security\nWhere if there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a it's a pretty decent percentage well record\nLow of mail um of\nApprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one is the last time we were at this low\nIn terms of adult apprehension so that's the only and you're able to deliver a consequence know migration pattern change when we're able to say that we're going to refer you for prosecution you broke US law we're going to send you to a judge and have a penalty you\nKnow illegal aliens they they know they know are you a lot better than members of Congress to\nAh this was Terry McAuliffe course a good friend of the Clintons former governor of Virginia speaking about the ah the use I mean current governor again Virginia speaking about the use of the military let's do some\nGood or a thousand miles away their goal and three miles an hour and several weeks and by the time and get her in their support he did as the show today to deploy the army do there what a disgrace\nThis man has no politicized the military and his use or military for political purposes it's wall love salt in the Marines today I can tell you is ... children who are wearing the cost of our country to protect our country prison should not politicize it\nA former governor of Virginia obviously this is called sleeping for three hours and I get Katie [laughter] uh you you you heard what he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border that that is politicizing the military\nYou know all I just say is this president didn't create this caravan this caravan you know took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America but I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States\nAs a large group just because you were in that group is president had every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended and that's what he's done\nThe homeland security department people you know think about in a border control and immigration and Customs Enforcement ice is part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct\nYou know think about in a border control and immigration and Customs Enforcement ice as part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct\nAbsolutely so we got the left wants to abolish ice or despite all the great work ice does with human trafficking drug interdiction uh and obviously important work and deporting a dangerous people from the United states um\nBut I think people don't really quite comprehend that this is not a victimless crime illegal immigration their their victims or economic victims\nThere the effect on public schools affecting our health care system how closely is homeland security working with other agencies on the effects and American society of mass illegal immigration\nThe secretaries just in Yuma, Arizona last week with both Ron Vitale acting ice director and Kevin ... had US Customs and border protection to meet with local sheriffs local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to handle the influx of family units\nThat they see at the border you know we're meeting with these NGOs and these communities to ensure that we aren't just releasing into communities because of the sheer number we're seeing every day at the border I mean but someone has to pick up the tab when we transfer aliens to hospitals\nAnd that is the American taxpayer\nAnd I think people forget that every time you see the illegal immigrants dropped off at bus depots or even flown around you know the the when the kids are the kids are coming unaccompanied they're placed with a quote sponsor sponsors sometimes themselves are illegal immigrants that costs money\nIt doesn't come out of thin air as my mother used to say someone has to pay the tab\nNow we have Thirteen thousand children unaccompanied children in a church has custody right now they cost us taxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually wow\nJust that just that people have to chew over that figure thirty three thousand dollars each illegal immigrant the United states annually to the American taxpayer\nThat's more than it costs for me to go to college\nOh my gosh this is Brock Obama just a few days ago on the uh mid term trail referencing this issue of the caravan and the president's concern about it once was\nTrying to convince her to be afraid\nMalnourished Xi's ...\nYou\nFear mongering Katie\nLast year we apprehended seven chink in criminal aliens at the border three thousand special interest aliens we know that there are criminals and flowers and the caravan heading north border security and clearly the ability to move as we apprehend and get it at the right to defend our borders it's acceptable\nKatie Waldman spokesperson for U.S Department of

from food energy to a knowledge economy\nThe Republicans ... and the Caspian Sea bass in is a region well worth exploring we go immediately to a region that at this moment is on determined that is Florida the state of Florida without the column up\nAbout the contest between Rhonda dentist\nThe Republican Andrew Andrew Gillum the Democrat\nAsking from some very good questions about who is Andrew Gillum and is the state of Florida that voted happily for Donald Trump is about to move towards the Obama part\nOf the Democratic party are they going for the Bernie Sanders even more radical in that part of the Democratic party leaders can we read Florida is it just going to be a different state every time there's an election\n[laughter] that's a really good question Andrew Gillum that Democrat\nWas a surprise winner in the primaries that were held I don't know when that was six weeks ago or so that no one really thought ... hits on merit Tallahassee and\nI really had a lot a whole lot was known about and he is an attractive African America and a good Baker he is kind of a nearby la channel I guess you'd say or or\nThere not a whole lot was known about him he's an attractive African American a good speaker he is kind of in the Obama channel I guess you'd say\nOr or mold a but really no one knew a huge amount of Baptists guy a at including the fact that there was a corruption scandal swirling around Tallahassee where he is mayor ah for the last year or so and it's a pretty serious one and one of his former campaign workers\nA has been subpoenaed to a a pure\nA ... they had a he was um [noise] caught up Gillum to an FBI\nAh investigation kind of where they the ... and it and it's it's complicated but basically Gillum was has not been named in any indictment or subpoena\nBut he's pretty darn close to a lot of seeming bad stuff that went on having to do naturally with real estate development and pay off a ... and honestly I I have no idea what the outcome of that will be as I say he is not personally been mentioned but it's very close to his office which I think is\nTainted his um his run but more importantly I think for the voters of Florida I I have to say I sort of shake my head about this Florida is a booming state one of the fastest growing states in the country one of the lowest unemployment rates\nAre under Governor Scott they've created an enormous number of jobs more than the country average\nUh and it just unimaginable of course from New York and I don't need to tell you there is a steady exodus heading to Florida because of the low tax rates there and the fact that it's a great place to die forgive me but the low inheritance rate and all the rest of that stuff\nUh you know a lot of wealthy New Yorkers make it their business to move to Florida and when they retire so why Florida would want to change all that and that is what Gillum is promising higher taxes higher taxes particularly on corporations\nAh but higher taxes nonetheless this is a fellow who is funded heavily by George Soros and by organizations funded by George Soros she is not at all and the bottom of political mold and in fact he's way left of Obama honestly it is astounding to me that he has gotten so much traction in this race\nWhat to look at the big picture of the Democratic party being astonishing successful in other races where the laundry scrapes me for example we're we're a new jobs because of the economy will [noise]\nParty being astonishing leave successful in other races where the logic escapes me for example were were needed it does because of the economy will affect the frustration here for me to figure this out with political science the Republican Party has delivered three point five percent following four point two percent of\nGDP that that is supposed to to to dominate the conversation but it's not in dead the conversation is turning obsessively about the conduct of Donald Trump is that the Democratic message is that is that the closing arguments Donald Trump that's it\nWell yes and I I mean that's exactly right if you can come up with any kind of coherent democratic platform that they're running on I'd really love to hear it because I don't think it exists\nA instead what you have is anti Trump fever and and the problem is because the president is out there\nA ... you know presiding over these enormous boisterous rallies day after day after day weighing in on all these contests\nIn a sense that Democrats are responding to his presence in these races now I think he's doing the right thing I think he does those turned out I think he's out there reminding voters that voted for him you know already work is not done\nOn Obama did that in twenty ten do you recall those rallies in Philadelphia and Chicago he was always on the campaign trail with feverish attention talking about I remember particularly one don't give him the keys back they ran the car into the ditch don't give him the cat act\nAnd he wouldn't ... he was extremely popular and the kids came back okay fine do so and so but I don't remember making Obama the centerpiece of twenty ten that was entirely about Nancy Pelosi and health care about what they might ... ten\nAnd twenty fourteen where the Republicans held up quite firmly it was about jobs jobs jobs jobs I was the last midterm it wasn't about Obama although it was his administration the puzzle here is one of the Democrats promised to do\nIn the closing argument against all they've promised to do is remove Donald Trump that's ... that's the campaign promise\nWell actually as you know times dire a wealthy Democrats backer has put a lot of money and it's this race for candidates who promise to pursue impeachment the minute there in Congress I think there will be an effort to engage the president a Maxine Waters that's going to be head of the financial services committee and as a committee\nImpeachment the minute there in Congress I think there will be an effort to engage the president a Maxine Waters that's going to be head of the financial services committee and as a committee chair she will have the\nOpportunity to subpoena records and financial transactions all kinds of stuff\nFrom the president so she has promised to move to out on impeachment hearing process as quickly as possible and I'm sure they'll do that I think that that ... thing a little bit John in you and I agree\nThat Republicans should be out there talking about the growth of the economy right tax cuts that deregulation but the Republicans are doing it they are so cowed\nBy the damage ... Democrats particularly about the tax cuts how it was all going to the corporations and wealthy people that they're really intimidated and they and and maybe can't connect the dots I don't know but it's very disheartening that they have this weapon of the economy and\nThey're not using it live pay a columnist at Fox News a columnist up the hill I'm John bachelor this segment of the global business report brought to you by the Republican ... from food energy to our knowledge economy the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in the region well worth exploring\nThis is the John bachelor show\nRussian studio meals on wheels already ... what do you call it then just irritated liberal people to the right to to loans or it would just do it just ... it's a little bit more than I Do a lot of things to irritate the webs can buy one\nI guess that's one of the reasons they call you a little rough learned woman\nRadio John right the most intimate level meeting rush it was only white minute microphone you\nWhen you hear it on the radio and it makes an impact you try to tell somebody else is what you heard and you forget roads every one of ...

to add to that about blue collar Larry because I Do small business reporting all the time and what I'm told repeatedly these last weeks is a small business confidence has never been higher\nThese were the first people to endorse or embrace wrong a Donald Trump early in the campaign cycling I puzzle about it what did they know that everybody all the smart guys don't know\nThey're still very confident about the economy and they're the ones who do the majority of hiring and all the jobs in America and the job creation\nWell I think you know going back to the campaign\nA candidate Trump argued again and again\nThat the war against businesses over\nAnd the war against success is over and if you keep more of what you earn or risk or invest or you will be rewarded rather than penalized that's the beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nSteve you I have a question about business investment please\n... wanted to ask Larry about this because I was just a conference today and it's on a comprehensive recording out a lot of the good news that lower was talking about some of the skeptics Larry and I love your kind of response to this\nWere saying well gee you know there there were some really bad news in this latest GDP report and the things that the same people that we could never get the job without ... basically four percent growth now\nThat they were saying they were very disappointed with the business investment numbers that and that shows that the corporate tax cut his working and so on and I don't know if I had all that question very well but I Wonder you know what you'd say that\nWell you know I think there were some glitches and that number I'm which will probably show up in a much stronger number in the fourth quarter in my show up in subsequent revisions um for example uh in the core cap acts core business investment spending\nShipments and cute three were up seven point seven percent and orders were up eight point five percent both at annual rates now that doesn't really jive with\nThree were up seven point seven percent and orders were up eight point five percent boat that ad rates\nNow that doesn't really jive with uh the slow down and business equipment which was only as euro coin four percent and I think that glitch will be straightened out a in a in cue for if not sooner but a key point here the national association that business economists nay\nThey are reporting a new record highs in profits and profit margins\nAnd I'm profits are are the lifeblood of the economy and so I reckon as long as profits hold up and they are they may be having another show up life here that's going to really pro pal\nInvestments spending business investment spending which also the prophet increases are are they to function of the reduction in marginal tax\nRates Larry our our consumers are driving this that's the way it should be right we're ... the tumor at all\nNo no I don't think so only in this quarter only in this quarter John I'm In the prior quarter\nAs it was business investment in fact most of this expansion ah the Trump expansion is coming from the business side although it was sloppy in this quarter and you're right a consumer spending was stronger but actually when you look at\nThe statistics um [noise] did his investments sticks investment up six point four percent over the past year a consumer spending a three percent so this really is a business investment driven and that's how the U.S because we have not seen this\nSince the mid to late Nineteen nineties and you can have\nA true strong economic recovery such as we are experiencing if it's just consumer spending after all supply creates its own demand business investment creates more capital per worker

telescope that was launched into space about nine years ago\nWith the idea that he would look at one spot area in the sky a lot not a small area so making than several moons across and look at that area steadily for three years that was the original mission\nAnd during that time they would look for changes because ... telescope in all of it as I point out it in the universe and the mere about Hubble\nYou put an optical telescope in all that you can learn a lot of things it's extremely valuable you getting it above the atmosphere the fuzzy atmosphere it certainly last you do lots of things in this was not big optical telescope was small was small and the third the size of Hubble mirror\nAnd so they put it in all of it and it looks at these this area of the sky for nine years in at the ... it's basically looking for changes in the light come in from the stars its primary mission\nIs to see if those changes in lines can be identified as\nExoplanet transits across the face of the

hundred ... exoplanet candidates\nA large and within a lot standards have been confirmed a large percentage have not yet but\nPeople expect so and there's probably more a exoplanet candidates in the data archives because it didn't go just three years it ended up blasting nine years it has gyroscope issues that made the last few years of the mission restricted in what it could look at but it managed to still gather data\nAnd they finally now the this week NASA officially retired ... it was running out of fuel and so without with a gyroscope sale you they have to use more fuel to keep it pointed\nAnd so that you were using up their fuel and so finally they made the decision to retire at this week because it completely ran out of fuel they could not stabilize it\nAnd they wanted to make sure it was stable and a good all of it\nAnd so finally they made the decision to retire at this week because it completely ran out of fuel they could not stabilize it\nAnd they wanted to make

the launch almost once a week if not more than that\nAnd the third launch its tentatively scheduled for November eleventh and they're they're touting that launch as their first commercial operational launch than they already had a bunch of a cube SATs satellites payloads signed up for that launch while the news here is they signed up\nAnother company to put two satellites payloads on that law so

a shuttle this using shuttle concepts\nAs it comes back in the atmosphere and uses its body like the subtlety to shed speed so that can slow down enough to land but I'm like the shuttle it's not going

place on holidays cool place anyhow but uh even Halloween\nAbsolutely well I remember many many many years as a kid\nUh Mount Vernon was to go to place it still is\nUm I have slightly outgrown some of it mostly the crowd for me personally yeah [laughter] but it is truly a great event or that it just goes to show how much support that community gives to things like this\nYou know safe in St Halloween is really important it is absolutely about some of the Halloween safety issues you know there's lots of safe world that we grew up in no and your generation different for me so things have really changed for me\nAbsolutely so you know Mount Vernon one of the big misconceptions there is that the city buys all the candy at the residents give out\nAnd that is not the case um in fact the city does provide the traffic control and the additional police resources to help make sure everybody is safe out there and that Mount Vernon is a safe streets\nFor the kids to be on and that does not

price tag but it certainly is something that uh the city steps up to do because Mount Vernon is such a tradition in the community\nBut it really falls on the shoulders of the homeowners who are the ones that really carry forward this tradition every year uh if you've gone out and you walk to Mount Vernon there are some elaborate elaborate Halloween decorated decorations on these houses um some people really put the time and effort in\nUh my neighbors tend to know that I Am the court Griswold of Christmas\nWhen we lived out at the airport and several of my neighbors um commented to me that I had to put up enough lights for everyone and so they didn't need to bother with it and we were the first house as he came into the neighborhood and uh between the inflatable isn't the reindeer and the

going to be coming up today a related to Halloween is the Halloween oh treats in costumes parade this is going to be taking place at the press get public library from four pm to five PM and this is an opportunity for kids to show off\nTheir Halloween costume in a library parade and spend the wheel for a special treat no registration is required children of all ages are invited and this is presented by the with funding from the friends of the ... library\nSo again that's going to be at the library today from four to five you know if you want to find out more about some of these events on discussing now your best bet is to go to the local chambers of commerce websites\nAre they tend to have the most information about community wide events that are taking place uh there's contact information and you can follow up on many of the ones I've just discussed in fact you can find on the Prescott chamber of commerce\nAnd the ... valley event is front and center when you\nContact information and you can follow up on many of the ones I've just discussed in fact you can find on the Prescott chamber of commerce and the ... valley event is front and center when you visit their chamber of commerce website as well All right so let's talk for a minute about safety\nOr for those that are going to be out trick or treating and for those of us that might be crazy enough to be driving around at that time there are safety tips and tricks for everybody as it relates to having a safe night\nWe heard on the news earlier a here that kids are ... two times more likely to be struck by a car on Halloween right\nAnd certainly that's not something that we should take lightly\nI'm as people are getting out there and I'm enjoying what should really be a truly fun night\nOne of the really great ideas that was I found on the line and this is not one I'd heard about before was adding reflective tape or stickers 'em to costumes and\nBags him you know it's just a great way especially if you're a kid is wanting to be Darth Vader this year and is wearing a black Cape ... with a black helmet and black shoes and black pants\nAnd a dark time of the year ... I'm putting on some stickers that will make that costume glow when a headlight hits it is not a bad idea\nAt all great idea I heard that about two or three years ago now and that's something I've seen a lot when we're living in the other neighborhood we I'd watch or reflective kids around there\nAnd one of the reasons that kids get hurt in a more chances of the get hurt is because they're wearing a mask and they can't see absolutely and they can't see cars coming so it's up to the drivers to be a little bit more aware than they normally would be\nSo one of the interesting situations there is when you actually go and look around on the line and as an example if you go to save kids dot org or the national safety council\nThey all recommend a losing the masks and going with face paint instead because the mask ... Ted tend to limit visibility\nEspecially if you're going to be in an area where there is not traffic control right now I Know that out in ... valley Granville is a really popular place for treating ... if you have a a large number of homes close together and it makes a lot of sense\nTo go door to door out there but the streets don't get shut down right and you know it doesn't take\nIf you have a a large number of homes close together and it makes a lot of sense\nTo go door to door out there but the streets don't get shut down right and you know it doesn't take much for a kid who is hopped up on sugar who would like to get some more to not think twice and dark out between two cars right without looking both ways yeah\nUm and that's certainly something that we all should be aware of\nAnd then there are the folks who come in from other areas and car pool their kids to different neighborhoods absolutely that increases the traffic and risks\nAnother option um and if you're wondering where to get glow in the dark tape there are several places that sell it but there's also um do you go to a true value they actually have reflective tape right there by the mailbox is yeah and the addresses and\nIt's super inexpensive you can pick it up and it'll attach real easily to costumes and bags and I think that's just a simple\nQuick fix to help improve visibility mhm another one if you don't have time for that and maybe you've got some glow sticks hanging out in one of your drawers up political sick and use that it helps to light up the child and again\nMakes them a little bit easier for everyone to see and of course if you're going to be in a neighborhood where there is no traffic control a flashlight never hurts flashlights yes absolutely\nSo again some of the recommendations that are out their children are twelve should not be able to go out a loan without adult supervision mhm um\nThere are some adults that should be allowed to go home without adult supervision\nWell to Marilyn's earlier point sometimes you might have to do a little extra supervising their eyes exactly certainly um you know obviously if your kids are a little bit older it's still a situation where you should discuss with them the route they are going to take where they're going to be and when I'm One of the things that occurs and\nThere was a when I was a kid on Mount Vernon there was a house where the individual is not a legally allowed to participate in Halloween because of some legal issues that that individual had 'em and so they had all their lights off at the house\nUm which happens to also be a very standard practice if you don't want to have trick or treaters coming to your door maybe you turn in early and you want to be in bed by seven and\nA or you get up super early for work and you have to be in bed by seven\nTurning off all of your front lights and closing the blinds isn't kind of international signal of don't ring my doorbell right I Am not participating in Halloween this year or you can always leave a bucket of candy out front but I have found in the past\nKind of international signal of don't ring my doorbell right I Am not participating in Halloween this year or you can always leave a bucket of candy out front but I have found in the past that that bucket of candy might end up in one or two bags yeah and see that in the end of it and then people will ring or doorbell because your bucket is empty mhm [noise]\nSo certainly if you make your kids where they see a house that is completely blacked out in the front there is no lights the blinds are closed that's not a house to go ring the doorbell lot now they don't want to participate in it another thing\nThat on the cloud going going back to that for a for a moment in some areas in Granville they have automatic lighting on the front of the houses ... ... so if the porch light is not on a and if the if the porch light is on go ahead and ring the bell if the porch light is not then don't even though the lights in the driveway or on because they have security lighting\nYep that makes that's a really good point as well as more and more people have that those motion lights that are out there um\nPopular trick or treating hours tend to run for about five thirty two nine thirty ten o'clock you know it is still a school night uh I'm sure that the elementary teachers love the day after Halloween 'cause their kid that'll show back up as\nKids are wired for sound on sugar\nOh yes for sure [noise] another one is making sure that the costume you've selected or that your child selected isn't a tripping hazard um for making sure that you modify it so that it isn't a tripping hazard as well\nSome of those things we just discussed you can visit safe kids dot org under Halloween and they've got more items listed there\nI'm In addition to that I Want to take a look at the national safety council which also recommends a few different things as well if you do in fact use make up make sure your kids watch that off before they go to bed\nI'm so it doesn't ... allow for higher education or skin irritation um those are not long term keep them on the face for hours upon hours upon hours type makeup build actually the sparkly stuff yes\nYeah plus if you're not careful you're going to end up with a couple of pillow cases and blankets covered and glitter and believe me that does not always wash out on the first load in the washing machine that you'll find that stuff for months that's right especially on your clothes as time progressed as on\nThe other thing and and this is one that I think it's pretty standard but again it's one of those safety items is make sure that the costumer wigs or fire resistant right or fire retardant especially the wigs and things\nAnd and this is one that I think it's pretty standard but again it's one of those safety items is make sure that the costumer wigs or fire resistant right or fire retardant especially the wigs and things of that nature um some of them have been dipped in chemicals and different things or they might be home made and that may not be a consideration but something you definitely want\nAnd there are some allergies too that um to that fire retardant to\nAbsolutely the other thing too is if it's your child's first Halloween\nOr it's the first time using that a costume makeup\nTested in a small area first genetic sure that they don't break out in hives and have a allergic reaction because certainly it's easier to fix if it's a little dime sized on the side of the face compared to their entire face swollen and that will totally ruin Halloween for them now not or wind out of the sales for sure absolutely\nAbsolutely again with older kids just make sure that they have a route set at a time to be back home kids of course should never go into a house on Halloween of a stranger's house or a car\nAnd um if they are out with their friends and you're not going to be with them\nJust make sure they know the best thing they can do is\nHave a Halloween buddy stay in a group and a follow the buddy rule just like the boy scouts have for hiking and camping never go alone I take advantage of having somebody there have cell phone and if your kids are super independent and they don't want mom and dad right around them but it's okay to trail back a house or to\nYou know it's good exercise for the parents to go out for a walk we experienced that a few years in a row where come on you guys don't have to go with me\nAnd so certainly just walking a little further back made sense give us a

I'm a keeper and you know we get briefed on ah in our meetings about what's happening\nOn the border and institutions within the United states\nAnd uh you know I don't know exactly where all the news comes from but I understand there's ultrasound being will be set up at entry points or infrared heat systems that you know they're not going to\nBurn anybody but it will definitely be uncomfortable as they are closer to the border so the non lethal using on the Somali pirates right right it's all non lethal you know I also understand that you know the un observers are already setting up their tents on the south side of the border you know so they can report all the American atrocities but\nYou know it's not atrocity to to uh to to prevent caravans and invasions of the United states and I see different uh liberals commenting about you know the wrong use of the ... the the military and I'm thinking wait a minute\nYeah they are here to defend the United states and an invasion is definitely something that we need to be if we don't know who these people are\nOr how long it'll garden the border or Korea yeah how long we've been guarding the border of uh Iraq\nAll different countries and ... and you know it's not that new countries with borders guard their own borders and we certainly should have that ability to do that so in our sovereign country\nAnd we really need to change our immigration laws we need to get down and hopefully you know that second term of Trump yeah that second term yeah we'll see some movement on that let's get the house let's get the Senate and er let's move the country former let's not go backwards\nAnd I'm Glad to hear this the whole non lethal thing but I mean you're talking to the crowd of Seattle I don't we don't know where they're coming in right right they're not\nThey'll find out they'll statistically they'll see where they're going to come in and that's what it was set up but you know I'm not in for that and I'm fifty Calvert mushy nose or not not at all that that's not what we do that's that's not our country but you can best bet Chris the cameras will be focused on all the the ladies\nFor mushy nose or not and not all that that's not what we do that's that's not our country but you can best bet Chris the cameras will be focused on all the the ladies carrying their babies coming across the border you know they'll put the ... the side because that's the media that's the media that we live with today\nAnd I saw a story on a lady that actually left her whole family she turned around and she missed her family she left her kids and her husband back you know Salvador I got to be pretty scared to leave their\nThough you'd think I've seen stories also of people who've been I'm been deported before and they're coming back there was one guy that was actually in in for a a felonies that word was eventually deported back to Mexico the heath care of and kind of back so man who are these people you know well I think\nOne of the best ideas I heard was that you know anybody that busted through a a not a not a port of call but he'll bus do that you arrest them you hold them you know what am I think that's right and then if you line up at the borders you can go through the same process that everybody else has to go through you know so I think that's probably about\nThe most humane thing you can do you can't just have\n'cause then I I think you're going to get this rush and how do you control that\nYou can't have chaos that you know our country of laws we either way they're enforce our laws that we don't enforce our laws and and I'm Out in foreign force in it\nAnd I think back to when my grandparents came over from hungry you know there wasn't the safety net sort of safety nets set up either now you know uh they either had to come with the skill was the tree and you know ... we could talk we're ... we're in a shorter time but you know they always say well that no one's going to pick the tomatoes but you know what if you paid enough you would find workers for that\nYou would you pick tomatoes for a hundred dollar an hour early I'd be out here picking them up like Clinton the Democrats say the same thing is that if we freed the slaves or wouldn't be anybody to pick our garden yeah there is like I mean you know about it yeah\nAll right we've got to take a heartbreak at the bottom of the hour and we got a call coming back and we'll hit him out when we come back on the ... pm show [noise]\nCosting you report or going to find out at the work you're not you know\nWait thank you for the call our economy out great calling\nAnd we got to take a break really quick county I Know you're hanging on the phone we'll be right back with you on the K Y.

that marijuana can help opioid addicts comes from the pot industry\nAnd it's not true research shows marijuana makes opioids harder with opioid addicts who use marijuana do worse not better the

representative\n[noise]\nBack on the ... pm showing county thinks we're hanging in there you want to talk about the cost of immigration\nCrass high county good thank you for calling happened to catch you guys say love you together\nOh that's nice Batman and Robin huh well there's one of the world yeah we we have a fair and Chris if\nYou don't want to say that\nThis topic it's a great topic I think it's a topic a lot of people are talking about today because the thing I've heard over and over again it's all it's going to pay for this I mean\nAs a person who am I working days looking at thirty seven percent bracket for taxes and then you see the misappropriation of all of our hard earned dollars it's a little frustrating to things that we can allow that many more people at one time in this country and who is going to pay for this that's my question\nI I think that you ... yeah well you got here [laughter]\nYeah it's called fixed income but now it's not a fun thing but\nYou know you just think about just flooding our system with more and more of this and you know I've seen a lot of the church's start to sponsor these people in but the problem is it doesn't last very long and then there was no accountability after that you know after\nOr a bath and uh you know I've seen a lot of the church is starting to find that these people in but the problem is it doesn't last very long and then there was no accountability\nAfter that you know after the six or seven months out of being support it through the churches say\nPretty much a cut them out you know cut them up and send them out into the streets so I'm all for changing the immigration laws in fact I'm all for changing them so much so that the people that should be allowed into the country to have a skill or or have a job or have somebody sponsor them coming into the country so there's some accountability\nYou know I think the sponsorship is a really good idea and that they're too because then you know that there they got a house or taking care of 'em you know just coming here and we have these social safety nets set up to take care of you when you're in a hard time and you know I can you even\nCan you come here at sixty and retire at sixty five and get Social Security I don't I don't know how to interpret stuff works well yeah\nToday you can I and I I mean is and then you can compound that with all the other ways that Social Security is being spent a which is why it's predicted to not exist in a few years so you know I I think I think the immigration policies in the country just got to be changed I it's just such a drain on our communities\nWill do and we try to change 'em and the Democrats blocked it yeah yeah you're right you know we were the of the Senate was going on for immigration reform and Chuck Schumer and his group locked all the all everything that was coming down the pike so you know until we will super majority\nA Republican side I think that's the only time we're really going to be able to get anything move through Congress to get to the president's desk\nLess oil and we had this mass amnesty that was Ronald Reagan's no none of that and you know\nMy thought is they really don't want to solve this because water I talk about when they come back and campaign 'cause right now you can say oh I'm for open borders and the other guy can say we need to build a wall for a few fix that problem what the heck are these guys going to talk about well isn't\nJust one of the biggest flip flops around when you can literally pickup recorded images of some of the\nTop Democrats just saying as little as five years ago the same things that the Republicans are saying today somewhere along the way that that rhetoric changed and how can a change so drastically it just makes one start to not believe in it you know either side\n... one word resist that\nIs right it doesn't matter what it is it could be you know so it was a cure for a ...\nSo ... where\nOne word resist where's that that was right it doesn't matter what it is going to be the cure for a ... and we're going to read it so\nWell all I Hope a lot of the Democrats are paying attention to our markets and and uh you know the stock market trending up word and that the jobs down because the proof is in the pudding as I always say you can say whatever you want but until you get real results like we're seeing today it's just all talk\nWhat do you think about the Trump saying he's going to end birthright citizenship is a good or bad\nI think it's a START I wouldn't be all for it you know having grown up in foreign countries that were\nA heavily socialistic it's such an oppression to the people and anybody today\nThat thinks that socialism is the answer there they're dumb deaf and blind they obviously aren't reading or not well read they don't understand how it's failed\nIn all the other countries that have been living under that oppression for years so there again the proof is in the pudding and it's not reinventing the wheel we've already tried that other places I've tried it and failed so\nYou know even though our system isn't perfect it's better than you know Ninety nine percent of the rest of the world and as as evidenced by the fact that we have throws in droves of people wanting to come in and have the American life\nAnd I'm I'm open to having them come but they've got to contribute to talk to our society and not drain us over and over again and we need to get people in office that know how to manage our hard earned dollars you know that's the other problem\nWe haven't had that for a long time coming you know that the Republicans right now are saying we really need to keep control of the uh the other thing would you think about it the last two years we've given them the Supreme Court we've given them the Senate we've given them the house we give them the president's we the Supreme Court\nWould have they done there not hitting these problems in one big one out there\nIs insurance and I think they need to take baby steps and pass them so breakdown lines make it affordable but I think the bottom line is these pharmaceutical companies insurance companies are paying them as well way too much to take any action\nYou know what there would be two things I think that would go a long way to handling that one of them it's term limits every one of those people need to\nTerm out out of four years and take away the professional politicians we need hard working people they're out there and you know the value of a dollar and know the value of what it takes to make a dollar to be spending\n... politicians we need hard working people they're out there and know the value of a dollar and know the value of what it takes to make a dollar to be spending our dollars I don't think that a year's and twenty thirty forty years and the political life of having that opens um pocket book which was our money\nIs lost a graph on what it takes to make that for the American person so you know than the professional file a tissue and get more hardworking people that understand all of those I'd be completely in favor of that\nYou're used to be against term limits to I thought you know if if we vote for these people keep putting them back again and again and again you know it's a shame on us but you know it really you get these people that are in there for Thirty years already
