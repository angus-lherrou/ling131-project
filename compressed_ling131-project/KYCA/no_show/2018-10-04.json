o'clock they're going to be meeting here in Prescott\nCorrect that's right okay and I was going to be fair street yes or the the three story building unfair straight\nAll right great so getting to the agenda and seeing what's going on today a let's skip all the way to the very end of a thing everyone's talking about there's going to be hearing\nConcerning the final the final hearing for adoption of an ordinance concerning texting while driving or operating a motor vehicle so tell us the basics of that what's that going to mean and I'm assuming that this is going to pass at some point in the in the near future\nWe believe so obviously the board has to vote on it tomorrow or about three weeks ago at the bar supervisors meeting at ... one we did a courtesy hearing where we had several people come up or or over to ... and and just voice their support for it\nWe took a email letters people or something about thirty letters and support and about three in opposition to this ordinance and so the the boar has taken all that information\n[noise] and ah I'm tomorrow or today this morning they will vote on that and if it goes into effect um what this means is that a anybody any of our county um you can't be basically what we're trying to do as a at a reduced distractions and so we don't want anybody\nOn their phone tax thing I think we've all seen it you know you see a car swearing and he pulled next to them and what are they doing\nProtecting a but that doesn't involve just cell phones you know some people have their laptops out or an electronic game you know I haven't forbid there playing that game while they're driving but it's basically just trying to eliminate that a distraction which causes several accidents um\nForbid there playing that game while they're driving but\nIt's basically just trying to eliminate that a distraction which causes several accidents um and including deaths across the country every year or is it just seems like a no brainer\nAnd really what the board is trying to do is get the state on board and so we believe that if we join other counties\nThat have already instituted these laws are the rest of the Fifteen counties in the state of Arizona will come on board and then the state will pick it up and then it it sort of becomes a much bigger deal in as more validity of you will\nOkay now if I'm driving down the road and I take a phone call and put the phone up to my ear is that covered under the ...\n[noise] yeah um [noise] uh trying to find a portable communication so me and the falling portable devices with mobile phones personal PDAs um\nAnd and really a a person shall not drive and motor vehicle while holding in his or her hand typing or otherwise manually operating a portable communication device\nSo if you can talk to your phone and say hey go we'll call mom and it and it works that way and you don't have to pick up a phone in order to look away from the street\nKnock yourself out but if you pick up your phone on lock it you know a punch in the number heaven forbid tech somebody um that where this is stepping in and saying no that's that's just too dangerous\nOkay so this is it has to be a hands free device if there's any operation at all and really what's going on is like you say we're just trying to get rid of distractions exactly right exactly at All right when you're trying to keep\nPeople safe I mean ultimately that's what this is all about is keeping people say\nWell that's a big thing so it is okay and so the the hearing is is today and uh you you you figure that the board of supervisors is going to vote yes or no on this to implement it\nI I Believe so but I Would never want to speak for them personally but um I just think from the general overwhelming response that we've gone from the public um I I Believe that this will\nPass okay if it does pass when would it go into effect\n[noise] uh I Believe it's effective immediately I'm a yeah I Love reading through here or does it affect the thirty days after adoption by the county board so thirty days after\nSo just a just prior to election day it it will go into effect first part of November exactly okay well right now David we're in a pause briefly on the morning report for an important message when we come back\nSo just a just prior to election day it it will go into effect first part in November exactly okay well right now David we're in a pause briefly on the morning report for an important message when we come back we'll take a quick look at a few of the things that are happening on today's board of supervisors meeting the right now let's pause we'll be right back\n... city councilman Steve ... good help is celebrating a true hometown hero\nWorld War ... younger more\nStarting at five thirty PM holiday court

fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's ends a lot of my guest is David ... talking about today's board of supervisors meeting\nOr the board has the usual big agenda in talking about the consent agenda which uh may all be approved by one vote so that's a possibility but there's several items that are important\nA number of Eighteen on the consent agenda David and that is a consideration of a professional services contract\nTo identify neighborhoods that are cut off during the storm events and develop flood response plans so tell us more about that\nYeah I think with all the rain that we've had in the last couple of days I think this is especially a proposal um we hire companies that are experts in this field every once in a while to come out and just kind of analyze the the current situation to look at the roads and say\nYou know if we have a flood because there's only one road in and out of this community this could be cut off and become a real risk and so we look at it from that perspective of we need you know to weigh that at all possible to come in and out so they want to get cut off\nPeople don't get stranded in a flood and we don't have floods that we do in the back back he is because we have all these mountains and stuff but\nThe roads do get washed out and that becomes a real ... and we always tell people turn around don't drown is not worth you know the risk of crossing that water because you don't know what's underneath it and so that's what this is all about is that just sort of identify areas that are in danger so that we can assess them and evaluate and deal with the situation\nOkay and then uh item twenty is another possible emergency situation with Eighteen thousand dollars for the county wide automated external defender later programs or what's that entail\nSo a couple of years ago the eighties\nEighteen thousand dollars for the county wide automated external defender later programs or what's that entail\nSo a couple of years ago the eighties we had a contract to have those manage they have to be kind of a checked every once in a while\nAnd that contract expire them and it wasn't renewed and so this is basically just keeping those outdated and and really this is important because if you come to a county building\nYou need to know that if there was some sort of situation where you needed those eighties ... that they're they're they're prepared and it also involves training employees so that we knew how to use them\nSo it's not just making sure the equipment is up to up to snuff but also that the employees know how to use them so that if someone had a heart attack or ... or whatever that situation is where you need an eighty um we have the people in place to take care of that\nOkay no going back down to items Seventeen on the consent agenda nearly a hundred thousand dollars for phase two of the removal of replacement of concrete and curbing at the courthouse plaza in downtown Prescott now and I'm assuming this is a project that's going to be a fairly large project\nHere it is um again we we look at everything through the the eyes of safety and we have just identified several curb the sidewalk that are\nAre in need of summer up here and we don't want people tripping and falling obviously\nI'm I recently spoke to can't even here in our facilities director and he said you know we all love this court house courthouse plaza but we're loving it to death and we're using it so much that it's you know showing some wear and tear and so this is Jeff them looking at this from a perspective of safety\nHow do we keep the safe and all of the events that go on down there throughout the year and all the hundreds of thousands of people that that traverse the sidewalks how to keep them safe so that's what we're doing\nOkay and uh this project once they approve it I suppose there are a little ... um is this taking place this year next year do we know at this point\nSo this will be budgeted probably over the next twelve month a Elvis stuff that's going on you know ... years as well as the next school year\nUm with us coming into the winter season it probably will not begin until a February March of next year I'm Glad that will get it on the books and get a contract signed and get people assessing and making plans on so that we're ready to hit it full steam next year\nPlus a

because they come and go and I don't know you have any suggestion or you have any ideas what could cause\nSo you're having a hard time concentrating yeah concentrating and particularly\nReading and if you know like I said if it comes and goes [noise]\nNow when you have a hard time reading meaning you lose your attention span and you'll drift so soon as you start reading three or four sentences you'll start thinking about what you got to do tomorrow and you won't be able to focus on the actual content is that right\nYeah that that some of it and that's a you know it's just concentrating just concentrating on anything um you know it just seems like it would come and go when I Do think that it's lifestyle or diet related because of the way to families and go [noise]\nYeah it is but there's there's several things that could be or what do you eat on a regular basis I mean what is your life give me a day in the life of run like give me breakfast lunch and dinner today what it looked like\nA ... for the ... you know as much a breakfast bar or something like that I'm here for like five or with a coffee in the morning I'm lying usually just a sandwich or a banana\nUm for like five or with coffee in the morning I'm lie like if the family or\nA banana for um you know a day to enter a tonight we had a spaghetti and um yeah so that ... and I I you know I I Try to get in between three and five or vegetables\nOr fruit and vegetables are\nSo high they only other thing I can think of as my activity level as far as the act of exercise has the increase over the past year and I'm kind of wondering if that isn't a part of it\nIt can be I mean all your lifestyle factors make a big difference\nWith with you know with everything that you're doing so the symptoms that you're seeing is not just one key factor I think it's several things but you know what you're dealing with is you're actually if you're almost dealing with a little bit of attention deficit types symptoms and that's why you're having a hard time concentrating one of the big reasons\nThat we struggle with that whether you're an adult or a kid it doesn't matter because the mechanism to the same in the body you're not having two things are happening you you've got too much information in your digestive tract you're not giving your body the right kind of nutrition\nAnd that's an easy fix that that is easy to correct was all you got to do is change what you're doing every single day and you'll see good results but you're also having\nA low level of omega three fatty acids a new mega three fatty acids are what are so important for stimulating the frontal lobe of the brain and the frontal lobe of the brain is important for overall concentration so it's a big kind of catch twenty two it's a circle and so once you start working on one thing you'll begin helping me other\nSo the first thing I mean you're doing a a a breakfast bar and coffee in the morning for breakfast and lunch is a sandwich and dinner spaghetti and you're eating a lot of processed food you're getting zero nutrition\nYou really are it's not it's near the food you're eating or not bringing health to your body and you gotta make sure that the things you are eating do that\nPretty simple what you'll do get on the anti inflammatory diet to my book comparing your health real ... it's basically this equal amounts of lean protein sources so every meal so breakfast you'll do two to three organic eggs there's your your lean protein sources you're low glycemic carbohydrates and former fruits and vegetables\nHave a bowl of

plenty of fat in them so there's your fat content for breakfast\nAnd that's a great breakfast you have plenty of brain power plenty of fat healthy fast to make your body to help your brain\nConcentrate and focus and also your hormones systems will function better what's moving the lunch lunch you can do a big salad with maybe a ... big piece of salmon on it full dressing you say you know maybe an olive oil and vinegar addressing something like that you got your fast you got your carbohydrates and vegetables\nAnd the good lean protein source plus she'll get plenty of omega threes out of that piece of salmon\nAnd then dinner same thing piece of fish maybe a steak you have some asparagus and maybe half a novel Cato\nBecause being a guy you need to be taken out of the Cato everyday anyway it's healthy for your prostate gives you all healthy fascinate plenty of your low glycemic carbohydrates and high quality protein you eat like that which is all listed in my book plenty of different food choices if you follow that\nYou will be like a new man and thirty days I'm not kidding your brain will work twice twice of what it's doing now\nYour first year ... you'll be sharper you won't have any brain fog you build a focus should be able to concentrate and your body just function better you can't put junk in your body and expect your body to function well it just can't so\nYou have to be in a place where you're willing to change and make make some make some tough choices because you know the bar and the coffee coffee right now stimulate your brain is too much suffering all over the brain and it'll work for a short period of time but then in the aftermath\nOf that meeting after the effects of the caffeine wear off it's going to go the opposite way then you really can't concentrate and just put yourself into a big cycle\nAnd rather than your body be able to function the way it was designed to so therefore you want to start a mega three fat she get that

D OJ and FBI in a row with beach Delaware apparently both of them are there at the same time that she wrote her a letter to Dianne Feinstein\nA Ford and ms McLean her best friend or the best friend she actually coached on lie detector testing were together for the four days leading up to the actual writing of the letter from the twenty sixth of the thirtieth\nIt would appear this is a conservative a tree house it would appear that Ford was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office spokesperson at the time she wrote a letter to Feinstein\nThat would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling ms Ford and how there wouldn't be unintentional effort from a subject matter expert on how to best position the attack against Kavanaugh\nWho better to scrub the Internet history and know what process he is and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who were deeply inside the FBI a lot of people are saying deep state was involved in all this not only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills to assist system is forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of de OJ an FBI resources to assist in this endeavor\nA former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph a network of politically motivated allies\nDoes the appearance of FBI insider and deputy FBI Director\nUh to

bother me because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background\nBut this FBI connection with the woman she was now reportedly within ... beach it's fascinating\nSo again if you want to examine whether she misled the committee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages\nAnd if you want to examine whether she misled the committee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages\nAll of those that have been deleted which are recoverable and that is for Powell McLean anyone who is ... it was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office all of that needs to be out\nAll of it do you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away from the get away with us excuse me\nThe same thing with Julie sweat neck if you're\n'cause submitting statements to the Senate Judiciary committee that are false knowingly false you should be prosecuted for that I don't care how long it takes I Would

subpoena that therapist they look there is no patient a doctor privilege here apparently she was releasing notes and showing them to at least showing to the Washington Post she references I met her testimony gone no privilege\nBut a lot to uncover here so they want to go through other Brett Kavanaugh to use the word drunk in a handwritten note to friends or whether he threw ice and Nineteen

about how to scrub Internet history and other people in the FBI who would know how to do that Dr Ford knew how to do that on her own someone helped turn this process\nEight five five forty Laura stay

thank you Gordon thank you John for this a global zero is an organization devoted to the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide by ...\nGood evening good evening and thank you Gordon and thank you uh John for this a global zero as an organization devoted to the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide by twenty forty\nWhich will be primarily done by unilateral productions by the United states because other countries as well as they say in this new report will have to follow suit because of our wonderfully a moral example\nPeter that's not going to happen it seems to me that if every you're going to get to a global zero it will be because everybody realizes they can't outspend the United states\nI don't understand the logic of our unilaterally reducing our arsenal to the point where it may not be usable and essentially having everybody else say yeah we'll we'll we'll do the same thing they're recommending three hundred warheads go ahead Peter\nWell let's go back to twenty twelve and they issued a report buried like this uh this was last report it called for a thousand warheads and the United states arsenal and now they're under three hundred so they reduced it by Seventy five percent\nThey said at that time in twenty twelve Russia was not a threat\nAnd they did a survey of people who are members the council on Foreign Relations in said twenty drop is Russia threat and a number of them said no and therefore they concluded Russia was not a threat that day they issued the report was the day the foreign minister of Russia issued a ... a threat to use nuclear weapons against NATO missile defense ice\nAnd as my friend mark Snyder has done since twenty twelve\nThe Russian military or civilian including Mr Clinton hadn't you issued thirty\nThreats to the United states and our allies to use nuclear weapons either not been implicitly diminish splits in threats so what they basically done in this twenty eight team report is instead of having Fifteen hundred and fifty more heads under the new start treaty we would have\nThey think around to succeed we'd have to ... submarine to see that would be it the other three would be a import and when you look at what the loading into our we'd probably have as low as a hundred and thirty warheads\nWhat would happen is instead of having five hundred and nine targets meaning land base missiles bombers and submarines spread all over the country we will be down to five to seven seat to set up bases on bomber base bombers would not be usable warheads would be put elsewhere\nAnd then they have this crazy idea that warheads\nTwo ... bases on bomber base bombers would not be usable warheads would be put elsewhere and then they have this crazy idea that warheads and missiles would be separated\nAnd where would we store these hundreds of warheads well they're empty silos in Montana that used to be minimum silos\nWhich gentle Cartwright negotiated with the Russians that we would not put missiles in them so we put all our warheads there and then we put a bull's eye on it painted bright red so the Chinese could no they just took out all our warheads didn't matter whether we had a submarine bombers are ICBMs left which we wouldn't\nUh we wouldn't have any warheads\nSo in their twenties twelve report they said it is reasonable to believe that the Russians and the Chinese the Syrian at the north Koreans and Iran have targets equally in about a thousand that we could rationally save needed to be hit and retaliated against and taken out\nThose numbers have all of a sudden crashed to less than a couple of hundred and what they've decided to do is no military targets would be\nIn any country you know conventional military targets would be hit in a rut tell a toy strike we did their banking their communications and their cities\nAnd that would be it and we wouldn't have to retaliate quickly because cities banking communications don't move they're all sitting there so we would take at least know rule less than Seventy two hours\nTo respond if we wanted to and if we bought warheads out in the minimum silos Montana or give me an example for a minute man based to put warheads back on missiles you can do three missiles per month or wing and their three wings\nShe knew nine missiles a month you could put one more head back on minute man if you want to but they want to get rid of a ... player on the global zero wants to eliminate all minute man so we would go down from all over five hundred and targets to as I said five\nIs with me and we do this unilaterally\nYes unilateral surrender work\nIf a unilateral surrender include the fall I Want to know how I can joined the international monitoring program I Hope they have really cool uniforms because well because their job will be exhausting to guarantee that unilateral surrender has been sustained by the fall\nBut what's interesting that the ... and his hundred and something page report\nGee that unilateral surrender has been sustained by the fall\nBut what's interesting that the ... and this hundred and something page report\nThey're they they don't talk about verification because you can verify for example there might be alert and that's their favorite thing it's like turning off a missile well with a keystroke on the computer I can turn back on\nAnd I can targeted wherever I Want to target it nobody will know so there's no verification of course but then they say and this is toward the end they say\nEverybody has to now not to use weapons first they have to vow not to deploy attack submarines in certain areas the oceans in order to make the submarine safe and this is what they say in which everyone and I'm quoting sincerely vows\nTo do this quote unquote so sincerely vows is like a marriage\nA wedding they sincerely about too you know on her and uh be true to your wife or your husband that now is that we we now have marriage and the nuclear policy instead of\nTrust but verify it if they sincerely vow to do it then it's okay and that's literally that is a quote from the end of the book is hundred and Seventy ... book so now we're gonna have unilaterally ten percent of the Russian force\nHaven't somewhere between twenty and forty percent of the Chinese force animal have about twenty percent of our current force that is allowed under a treaty for getting rid of everything that was one of the things that's really strange is\nAll the submarines have all the new suddenly sixteen missile\nMissile Bruce Blair says put eight or heads on which is by the way the maximum you can put on it what happens if the Russians bus out of the global other new start treaty or the Chinese build up we will have no ... capability which Bill Clinton George Bush and Barack Obama all hauled the hedge\nAnd we would have no hedge we would be stuck at about two hundred and fifty survivable war heads of the\nUm that would be ... and the other guys to build what ever they wanted to build\nA garden we have about a minute So Peter I'm you mentioned something before about how potent has been a threatening to your sense of use of nuclear weapons\nHe's been doing that especially with regard to the Baltics we've just got about thirty seconds if you can run through how global zero would do with pollutants threats to use nukes\nTo start a war do they have a plan Peter thirty ... no no no\nIf you can run through how global zero would do with pollutants threats to use nukes to start a war do they have a plan Peter thirty ...\nNo no no no I'm not at all that's the whole point of building low yield weapons on a cruise missile or a deep fives that marine missile it gets there quickly within Neal twenty to thirty minutes which we don't have anything that can get there that quickly today that's why it's not quite some low yield weapons is the question can you get them to the battle\nPotent by the way announced this new strategy in April two thousand\nAnd two thousand six he said this is how we're going to do it and we're going to exercise this way and we're going to build these things and then twenty fourteen and announced everything's going to be built

some you know a indication or some I'm In a direction not to cover this issue so I Would say most people on Fox on are largely unaware of what's happening there\nUm but uh in in certain circles you know many Pakistanis\nOr move across the border have are are married to women who live in ... women um and there are some businessmen who traveled there and then people who are who see consumers of of local news so they're well aware of what's going on and I think um you know as long as the situation continues and faster as\nUm and you know there may be a response especially from a religious circles and even extreme of circles inside Pakistan and so I don't think it's an issue that can be swept under the rug\nAnd especially if you know the if the Chinese and the Chinese would like to have this kind of a a economic uh kind of activity and uh the free flow of people and goods across the border\nUm and you know they're spending billions of dollars on on developing the physical activity over the land border you know I I just don't see a future in which there can be um you know a great deal of economic activity and the infrastructure can caught you know pays held back\nA show there is a human rights angle which is you know it's a moral abomination you know and respect what's happening but then there's also the economics of it should John it's supposed to be this outpost connecting I Try not to um to the Eurasian land mass and a and I just don't see that happening\nReally what's happening in terms of Pakistan is that the government has been supporting China with regard to the situation\nAnd this is where China's debt trapped diplomacy as it's called is actually working\nBecause right now in Muslim abroad you're not going to get a senior government official on the record criticizing the Chinese but of course when you look at the mass of people in any a Muslim majority country\nI'm just does not sit well people may not say anything day to day largely because they feeling coerced or because you know sometimes I just don't know about the issue but this just doesn't work when you starting to look at for instance countries like Kazakhstan we're a long time you know the Kazakhstan government\nDidn't say anything about ... and now it's really being forced to I think you're going to see the same thing in Pakistan\nThe fact that it did in the news is that a tell that they're frightened of it\nYeah definitely because you know if another country was doing that let's say if the United states was doing that to its Muslim population it would certainly be in the news it would be on the cover of newspapers\nYeah definitely because you know if another country was doing that let's say the United states was doing that to its Muslim population would certainly be in the news it would be on the cover of newspapers and on and the headlines there\nSo uh I think clearly a there's a you know some sort of a reason there's an eight an obvious reason why I'm a private media in office and the state owned media is um is most likely suppressing the information I it is covered to some degree in the English language press\nUh but you know it's not something

colleague Andrew Collier managing director of Korean capital research in Hong Kong\nHe is the author um\nShadow banking and the rise of capitalism in China and do a good morning to you I report my conversation with the director of the national economic council Larry Kudlow within these last hours\nThat after the U.S embassy a deal put into place and pending approval by Congress\nThat the emu that includes UK at this moment and Mexico and Canada the U.S MCA alone with Japan are looking to speak with one voice to correct or to urge China to correct It's a incorrect trading practices\nOf these last year's violation the WTO does China anticipating one voice with it from its trading partners at this moment Andrew good morning to\nA good email from John I'm no I mean I think cut him I was dreaming or there's it's a very unlikely that the European with the United states and Mexico will be on the home page on this\nEuropeans are desperate for growth and um they don't want to offend China and uh because they have a lot of businesses that operate quite a bit of money in China\nSo I expect very little agreement between those three parties on this and the Chinese are are\nI think are banking on that because they know that the Europeans are kind of split with the Americans right now both politically and economically\nAndrew I'm what is the state of the Chinese economy today especially after the September numbers is it a better than people say or where do you see it going [noise]\nWelding number so far I haven't met that exports were up fairly helpfully and imports were of a I have the August numbers which are twenty percent which is pretty good showing 'em so there's a bit of weakness in the export powerhouse area of coral do profit from the south which accounts for twenty percent of exports\nAnd they're you're starting to see a bit of a recession so we may be seeing the beginnings tiles but so far the economy's been at the helm holding up surprisingly well\nAnd is that because of trade friction or is it does some other factor\nOh I'm pretty sure that they we can go out and going is because of trade friction the data's inconclusive at this point but given that they have a lot of small businesses export uh different kinds of cotton goods another thing for the United states I'm sure it's trade related\nAnd one other question on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw that China's going to borrow three billion dollars\nI'm sure it's trade related\nAnd and one other question on on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw that China's going to borrow three billion dollars why are they doing that\nWell because they basically investors in the west ... assume that a Chinese government debt is perfectly sell to us because they have a large a trade surplus\nThey have a three trillion dollars of overseas and foreign exchange and they have not defaulted on any national uh external debt I'm so it it's a good bet if they can get a decent interest rates are going to look for overseas capital\nBut why would the Chinese need the money\nWell because often or overseas are willing to pay a lot of extensive capital\nAnd domestically there's a huge amount of debt so they're looking to try to extend that into a new source of the capital overseas it's it's a reasonable strategy [noise]\nThe puzzle\nChina is looking for a negotiation with the United states or not the U.S is looking for a negotiation with China or not are they in a waiting game Andrew and how long the wait how long before things deteriorate\nI think the Chinese are more or less given up because of the Trump Administration is it's I don't think it's really interested in it settled there is actually asking the Chinese to change the entire basis of their economy\nWhich the Chinese are are unable to do it would be one thing if the Trump Administration said okay look you've got a you've stolen some of our technology in certain cases you're steel mills are being supported by the government\nEither an area that we think you should focus on instead the Trump they come home and the others make very broad brush statements and the Chinese are I think are starting to get to the point where they're washing the hands of the whole thing um ... it's a political football\nSo say wash their hands what is the timeline does anybody an advance a timeline does this go on until spring Nineteen spring twenty how long\nI think this is going to go on for a number of years because the Trump Administration as I said it's not going to alter its behavior so far we've not seen that\nAnd the Chinese themselves have figured that until they're going to try to deal with their own domestic economic problems in terms of slowing growth the only thing that I think it helped as if a lot of small businesses in America stop start going on or having large unemployment\nAnd putting pressure on Trump's base we haven't seen that yet though\nSo Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic\nI haven't seen that yet though so Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic but where do you see it\nThey are pretty optimistic because so far the crash that people have been predicting hasn't happened\nOr the economy has definitely slowing but we're not seeing massive defaults we are seeing an increase in default and corporations and small lenders but not not that the false\nAnd the leadership is titled script over the riskier banks and stuff so so far it's been a kind of a of a gradual decline but no collapse and then you got that booming tech sector with the huge\nA bite do ten cents I'm and other ... about the Amazon China that are doing very well and doing very well for western investors so that's a a an OK picture\nAnd I get I gather the central bank is basically decided to um ease up a little bit on the money supply basically make a little bit more cash available and that has been able to get the country's true right\nThat's exactly it they basically after tighten credit for awhile and shutting down some of the risky a fast\nThey now star are starting to open the tickets again and they're hoping to fuel gross in small businesses that have a lot of employees to keep employment off\nUnfortunately it looks like a lot of the credits just going to go to the state firms that are the most inefficient so this is really not good for China's long term structural growth but it's just the way the Chinese system operates\n[noise] ah we have about a minute Andrew I'm I'm most interested in the Chinese confidence believes that the country can grow without an accommodation with the United states is that correct [noise]\nWhile they're at they were not happy about it\nBut she didn't pay the president is dealing with you know huge debts he's dealing with um in attempt to cut down on pollution he's got a lot of domestic problems\nAnd he's looking at a Trump Administration that hardly knows what it does from day to day so his attitude is if I Can't control it I'm gonna have to deal with what I can control domestically so um they're kind of stuck and uh there's not much more they can do\n... ...

gutted the ruling but kept the outcome so I think what happens is that the the champions of for oh no how brutal that laws and they know that\nA serious jurist give it in a\nHard look I'm might find it very vulnerable so whenever they think there's a fifth vote that could affect row they thought that with Robert bark\nThey thought it with uh Clarence Thomas remember at the time they thought Kennedy might be an anti rowboat this was before Planned Parenthood versus Casey\nAnd they think with Brett Kavanaugh even though it's not clear to me you know how Brecht would vote since he's talked about it as a precedent that's been reaffirmed to suppress them so [noise] but that's they're worried about Mrs with Democrats do when we're always at stake for when they grow is at stake they they just go after people with everything we've got\nKnow that are dying Feinstein who begins this president unhappiness with her revelations in these last right she did not accept Brett Kavanaugh's remarks that\nAre dying Feinstein who begins this president unhappiness with her revelations in these last right she did not accept Brett Kavanaugh's remark that roe v Wade is fixed why not why does and she ... well\nHe said it was settled I don't think he said it was fixed and she doesn't and said I mean in some way she's right she knows that just seeing something settled there are a lot of precedents and there there have been other cases\nWith longer lasting precedence that have been overturned so she knows it's ... I think they know it's a terrible decision and it has\nYou know to find the right to abortion that's nowhere mentioned in the constitution a constitutional right and they knew how brittle it is so what they need her outcome oriented justice who just say\nAnd the Senate or a gun at midterms especially in states led to take to for example Texas where Senator Cruz is in a very strong red state but being challenged by a congressman Beto O'Rourke\nAnd in Missouri where a sitting Senator McCaskill is being challenged also by a very fresh Republican face and\nI'll throw in Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is well a good evening to you both so we begin with you and Texas do you see this affecting the cruise vote or the cruise turnout for or against good evening to\nGood evening thanks for having me on so I think one of the most fascinating things is how completely different uh the the the prospects are for the Republicans in just one week\nSo last week I Would have told me that the Senate was essentially going to be a wash and then at the end of the day that problem the Republicans were probably have a small majority in the Senate as they do right now uh this this completely changed within a week\nUm I think that uh the Kavanaugh stick to ration has changed things dramatically in terms of the ... for the Republican\nA week um I think that uh that the Kavanaugh situation has changed things dramatically in terms of their fortunes for the Republican it has energized a the coalition for new populist coalition that brought the two together um for Trump\nOr this is now I I I often remind people\nThat they they ... this this coalition was already building Trump was not the cause of that he was the result of it\nBut they were not they didn't have anything to coalesce around uh in in ... and his in his mid ... they do now and it's not around Trump which I think is a very important distinction they're coming together and they're energized\nOver what they believe is and I I like the tale this and the great revolt\nIs is um is that that culture meaning the big political parties the big political system along with the media and along with pop culture popular culture\nUm are sort of against them and don't understand them and with 'em and and that is the case with Kavanaugh they believe that has been heavy handed against him and they projected that onto themself\nDoes that mean turnout your models are are are going to change for foreign against you the the exciting turnout in Texas or Missouri in North Dakota as well for both sides Selena\nWill ... were ... Democrats are already or just to show our over already AT T right what we were looking\nTo see was what is the this populist coalition was going to do it to be energized to come out I'm\nAt and um for the new turns ... this has done it um you know now ... independents are always sort of\nWhere we're not sure where they are but you're both parties are at equal levels and because so many Democrats that are up for reelection in red states that puts\nAt the end the disadvantage so not only will um is Texas and and as your a ripe for Republican either hold and or pick up but I've seen movement in Florida\nAnd Indiana and uh I uh I I think North Dakota is gone and and I keep an eye on Montana so ... this is a\nGame changing moment I mean I you know\nDakota is gone and and I keep an eye on money and\nSo ... this is a\nBlamed changing moment I mean I you know I feel bad for the cavern our family has gone through but it has been the best things for the Republicans a ... in the in the final weeks of the ...\nLaura good evening to political science here I Am I'm On aware helped me teach me is there a political science version of what we've spoken about above the house these last years months that following a close election the advantages to the party out of power does that work in the Senate as well Laura good evening sheer\nEvening John thanks for having me on yes it does work but not as consistently so what we do see is that oftentimes the party out of power does pick up seats in the Senate\nBut as I said it's not as consistent and there are times when in fact the president's party does\nDo better and much of that has to do with some of what we're dealing with this time around and that is\nThe class of senators who are up and which party is sort of more on the defensive to begin with as we know in this election the Democrats are incumbents and a number of states that the\nRepublicans won handily in twenty sixteen and so they're already was a sort of Senate lean toward the Republicans wave elections\nAll seats both in the house and Senate tend to fall in one direction and that's where you saw what Celine I was just talking about that you know a few weeks ago people were saying well you know maybe the Senate could in fact um do a little bit better than the Democrats than\nPeople are thinking maybe Beto O'Rourke is really in a good place um because those sort of wave numbers were starting to be their\nSalinas absolutely right that the Kavanaugh hearings have energize the Republican base but the one I'm cautionary note I Would say is that I'm not certain that\nIn our world today that energy and enthusiasm will stay there for another five weeks in other words it is very possible to me\nThat um Kavanaugh and ...\nWe'll stay there for another five weeks in other words it is very possible to me\nThat um Kavanaugh ended up getting confirmed at the end of this week and that by next week you see Republicans um and the enthusiasm that they have this week\nSomewhat more complacent about well we got it it's done the war spending one and you start to then see the Democrats even more upset and enraged by\nThe fact that Kavanaugh's nomination went through so I'm not sure where we're going to be a couple of weeks from now I also think it's important to realize that when we do look at the polling um there is essentially a reality that\nMore independence both men and women I Believe a Dr Ford than believe a judge Kavanaugh it is also true that um\nThat when you look at just women independence um the beliefs around Ford's testimony over Kavanaugh's was fifty six percent to twenty four percent so\nYou know there is going to be a very interesting shakeout of who are we talking about as the swing voters\nBecause white women college educated um Republicans may not stay with I'm sort of the Republicans and Kavanaugh and\nThey may in fact I'm uphold more of Ford's testimony\nOr detail here we just have the thirty seconds or so for both of you\nUh how is uh is or isn't a trajectory to go to the Democrats and in these next week is the term or going to affect the Leno just about Fifteen seconds you see the turmoil also bumping the house or is that on a glide path to laugh\nI still sing I see at the Republican or Democrat skating at least seven at this moment I'm overly up to thirty five I think at the end of the day were and where the truth I by either side in the majority\nLaura ... the turmoil here that you just noted you know next week will be a new new scandal you see out is the house settling into concrete what are these metaphors you you like in Washington ... ... is a cake baked I think that's what I like best or is this\nAnd all is the how is the house settling into concrete what are these metaphors you you like in Washington that ... is a cake bake I think that's what I like best or is it still in play\nI don't know that the cake is yet baked but I Do believe that just as ... saying it's kept hearing I'm kind of woke up a lot of President Trump's base especially those um blue collar workers I think it is also true that ...\nIt has distanced more college educated suburban women and that will matter in the house races\nLara Brown of George Washington university to lean at the top of the Washington Examiner I'm John ...\n\nWhat black lists and conservatives that they consider to be ...\nAll

instance when it's phenomenal careers started to middle school science fair\nYou're looking at this situation and you know courts is supposed to decide questions of law and executive branches are not supposed to do that and so we think that this offends the basic principle of separation of powers\nThe point is sufficiently strong that even if they decided to change the texture the administrative procedure act which has been constant since Nineteen forty six they would say you could not do it until the stakes are very high on this particular question and I think that the Gorsuch cabinet position\nForty six they would say you could not do it so the stakes are very high on this particular question and I think that the Gorsuch cabinet position\nIs correct about long held that particular view but it used to be a voice crying in the wilderness and now it turns out that we're getting closer to the point where this doctrine may be toppled\n... Richard I want I Want to use an example here and see if I understand this I'll let you clean Air Act which allowed the EPA to interpret the law claiming this was ambiguous and therefore the here's our ruling\nYou said that it permitted the EPA to say that if you have a piece of equipment and you want to upgrade it that is permitted if the amount of pollution doesn't change that's what that's what the ruling is in this in some however\nThe question then is what's a piece of equipment rice and you know there's a bit of a philosophical puzzle here it's this half the heat the heap as a part of a piece of equipment a piece of equipment\nAnd his factory something you can upgrade without having to ask for new permits and go through the ... under the\nDemocratic rule no the moment you decided to shift the amount of emissions from one smokestack to another you have to start over this could be years\nAnd and that is that partisanship of the of the ... and it would change from administration do ... that's exactly what we're feared and it's and it happens\nIt happens in this particular case and my view about it is that the stability of expectations that you want out of law means that you should have judges decide these things and if they're going to build a rule that's going to be an act of Congress or in some cases where the agency may do so they could change the administrative\nRule in one form or another but it is generally understood when you start to change these rules on an ad hoc basis retroactive application is suspect\nPolitically there's a lot of resistance and at least before the recent Chevron doctrine um it was generally thought that um are there would be legal problems I should put Chevron in context because at the same time that the courts would dealing with Chevron what we did is we had a number of cases involving a question\nOf whether or not when the government made a deal with people you joined this particular pension fund and if you don't think that we're doing things correctly you can pull out without recrimination\nThe argument was that you know\nThat when a government agency says something it is perfectly foreseeable that they will not can keep their word so when you make you\nArgument was that you know\nThat when a government agency says something it is perfectly foreseeable that they will not can keep their work\nSo and you make your decision you have to assume that these guys may well be acting in bad faith and so long as it's the the ... are you are bound by the change in decision now the whole principle of the rule of law as we know that government officials can act in bad faith and so the reason we\nProtect ourselves against retroactive changes with massive wealth consequences is to make sure that they don't the fact that it's for the bullet this thing will happen if you let them go is the strongest reasons for saying he will never let them go so this is in the middle of the Reagan Administration\nAnd what happens if it turns out that there is a remarkably low threshold for the protection of vested rights that don't protect them at all and this whole situation creates all sorts of uncertainty in the way in which government or to run\nAnd the Republicans have been as much to blame for months of this is the defendants\nAnd there's a story for example and you know ... there's a case called outweigh you we are and what it did is it involved the question of how we define certain kinds of police officers and uh the department of labor under Clinton came up with the obviously absurd position or that they are Sargent or lieutenants\nWas not ending at administrator and executive or a professional\nUnder the fair labor standards act and therefore is titled the overtime and you just go spend three minutes looking at the definition of their duties and of course they're all over the patrolman at one level or another and Justice Scalia wrote an opinion which says well you know\nThis is the way things on the big city it looks to me like it's perfectly sensible I'm not going to strike down they know more about this subject than I Do\nThis was across the street political move by a democratic department

known as Malcolm in the morning and joining me this first\nA Thursday of the month my normal first of the month guest host Jonah Begley good morning Joe good morning or are you calling me normal normal Joan abnormal John we need to handle for you when you're careful jolly Joan\nJumping around no no no no ... no no come on now come into going to be with us and we got to come up with something like that well we can we can send in suggestions okay what what are your suggestions for Joe we need we need a nickname for Joan\nOh you're kind of jelly jovial\nI'm not so sure there are days oh boy well at least we weren't preempted this week as we were last week by the Supreme\nSheriff there are days oh boy [laughter] well at least we weren't preempted this week as we were all last week\nBy the Supreme Court confirmation hearing oh have you ever ever seen anything like this and and there aren't many people on this earth that have gone through his many a just a Supreme Court confirmation hearings as you have well probably true\nAlthough there's a lot older than I I don't know I'm On the Ninety three in their own okay\nWell here's a trivia question for you Jim ... how many Supreme Court justices have been nominated and confirmed since you've been an adult in Eighteen forty seven\nOh I can answer that twenty seven [laughter]\n[laughter] well with that that's that is one that's three that's amazing but there's that's a turnover of three full course well thank you if you've been voting adult thank you for your cheat cheat [laughter]\nOkay here's another one [laughter] how many Supreme Court justices have served since the beginning well\nTied George Washington for seven appointments but ah\nWell and I stand corrected on the number of apartments by George Washington to too I just review death but okay we'll get into that I don't know about that well how are you doing can doing great doing great what is your call on the propositions coming up\nUh yes yes no yes yes yes yes no no yeah okay [laughter] All right no I um I Would have to have a paper in front of I'm driving right now I'm Sorry but\nThat's okay I Hope your hands free I Know your hands free but anyway um let's let's talk about to one twenty six and as I'm past legislator and secretary of state it's a ... a proposed amendment\nAbout to one twenty six and as a pass legislator and secretary of state it's a ... a proposed amendment to a prohibiting any taxation of services by the legislature in the future that's kind of odd I\nYeah I'm a I'm against that one because uh I I think\nThe reason we have a Democratic Republic where we elect representatives and so that they can look at all the details have all the options on the table mhm and make a choice as to how to set up our our tax system I actually believe that\nUm sales taxes or consumption base taxes are the best way right but I'd like to see a lower rate and more transactions included in debate correct do that the\nMoney that the steak collects kind of flows with the economy right now when you only tax\nProducts now I'm not for increasing the total amount of taxes right but if we lower the rate broaden the base or did some things and I think you would create a tax system that works better uh right now we have a high pretty high sales tax on good\nOn new homes new cars or electronics you know\nAny of them are ... recession\nWhen the recession hit and those um you know fall off very significantly usually the state really struggle for money so I I'm against one twenty six I think it was pushed by the realtors I Know they don't want\nTheir services or commission correct fails to be taxable and I respect that but I'm I'm a no on that\nWell and I I agree with you because of the legislature and has had the power to do that since Nineteen twelve and having done it yet and it requires a two thirds you know by both houses\nOf the legislature and it doesn't necessarily mean all services are going to be tacked rice you know they have the ability to do that\nSo right and yes the only ones who are organized opposition to this are the realtors both the state what five million dollars in national with another million\nWell they're they're advertisements I think are a little bit uh pushing the envelope because they make it sound like you're the legislature or somebody is poised to raise taxes on all services right and I know of no such a effort in Arizona right now right\nLegislature or somebody is poised to raise taxes on all services right and I know of no such a effort in Arizona right now right because as you say the voters of Arizona\nIn a previous vote or amended the Arizona constitution that if the legislature wants to raise taxes by voted the legislature right can only do so with a two thirds vote ... is rarely ever ever a accomplished\nI I Would be surprised to see a two thirds vote on anything by any legislature that's that's very unusual yeah so yes I agree with you on that one how about a um the one twenty seven uh about the\nInitiative relating to renewable energy in mandating that by the year twenty thirty fifty percent of all the electricity generated in the state of Arizona should be from renewable sources\nAre again I'm against that ah that's Tom's dire very liberal billionaire from California this trying to spread that idea or not worked well in California we already have um one of the highest percentages\nOf of our energy usage in consumption or in the state of Arizona coming from our new ... compared to most other states right I think we're third in the country and\nAnd the use of solar I'd like to see is number one but um whenever you throw in these artificial uh percentages by artificial dates\nYou create havoc in the marketplace and end up with unintended consequences\nWell that's exactly what they're seeing in California now and we're actually benefiting from it because they're dumping all their access nuclear generated power on the Arizona market\nIn Atlanta is rates for all Arizona's and right now half of our energy is generated by nuclear Palo Verde in nuclear does not count as renewable source\nRight yes [noise] no I'm against that as well well that's good how about a a three or five which is the expansion of um education credits tax credits for schooling right now we're captain thirty thousand students through five would expand\nIt would expand it but there's all already a statutory limit that I think limited to thirty thousand students ... uh um again I I have to trust that the legislature\nThat I think limited to thirty thousand students cram\n'em again I I have to trust that the legislature makes decisions\nTaken all of those kinds of things into account and uh I did not support 'em\nThe expansion eliminating\nThe ...\nThe cap and and the parental ... you know I think the parents should have a choice of where to send their children to school and\nUh I\nI support parental choice a ... and I think that the laws that the legislature have adopted have recognized you know they started out with a choice for parents for children that had special needs or write a ... and they gradually expanded it from there but\nOverall I think parents should have the right to choose where their children go to school and whether that's charter schools which are public schools or\nOr whatever I I think there's other things to focus on fixing okay I don't know that\nYou would be a yes on three or five in 'cause thrill five would expand that expand on allies right now they're limited to thirty thousand and there are restrictions on who can can get the credits\nWhile then I Need to read that and maybe we both need to read that real carefully because I bought the initiative was gotten on the ballot by the school\nUm groups that oppose parental choice no it's\nA matter of how they worded the things that are yes as a yes or is it yeah\nWell I Am and who is looking who's opposing in who's for on the ballot arguments and the teachers are unanimously a opposing okay so that she'd probably tell you what the Web and you know she didn't really realize that\nYeah it tells you know I I support teachers but right you know uh I don't support the groups that usually align themselves with teachers that are trying to limit parental choice\nOkay well then we go to three or six which is a lot of the restriction on using campaign funds from um\nOh what's the term for the ... the public ... public funding of cleaning ... clean elections funding there are some candidates who have run in qualified in really ran a weak campaign and didn't really spend a lot and they don't\nThere are some candidates who have\nRun in qualified and really ran a weak campaign and didn't really spend a lot and they're donating the balance of their campaign funds after the primary to either a political party or a political cause in this would prohibit that and in an intimate\nSupport I support the prohibition of that because if you're going to run as part of the clean election and I have before nine run traditionally run and clean election but if you're going to pick up a funding from clean elections to run your\n\nThey are not spending and ... are all of your money and then stockpiling it and then given away and looking for favors for whoever you gave it to\nSo yeah what do you think should happen to the money if they have a balance at the end of the campaign just return it to the clean Alexei\n... I have absolutely I agree a hundred percent you shouldn't be able to give it to other parties or or groups a and give it back it goes back to give up that\nElection every two years so you know there are other people that that might be using now are wanting to use those funds or two years later so if you haven't used your bones you give it back to the fund and they put that in the ... for the next group\nI agree it couldn't agree more Ken Ken thank you for listening in and weighing in and there are few people in this state in my opinion that are really have a better background in history in talking about some of these initiatives in issues\nThank you very much or I can I feel the same view [laughter] right well\nI feel the same of Joan and we haven't even ask Joan about her opinion okay\nThen I'll hang up and listen to Jones I did not even mine all it's all straight down All right thanks scan All right thank you at one whole day both of you by by All right\nWell you know what we're coming to the bottom of the hour for our heartbreak if you have any opinions or questions give us a call for one one zero one sex and we'll be right back after these words\nTo do what\nWell I think is really missing the boat thinking that he can get elected in Arizona than anything is a Democrat he's really missed reading this situation because Democrats will never smoke for him period\nWill be another Romney let's move to Utah and you know or or Clinton the loop in New York or something but I think he's got some kind of clan or wallet Democrat Gail somewhere in there because the whole power thing in Washington ... some have had the power and they got embarrassed because there's all states\nMhm poll the wife of the fourth of July more embarrassed game right he was upset with what flight a with a Trump quality ... D taken personal I'm\nStaying against Trump supporter of voters right now and that was due to first of all the just like my ... who was also ripped off yeah well you know McCain didn't do what he said he was going to do with the new health care situations voted against it\nI think I agree with you Alan we are woefully underrepresented in the Senate right now but we're All right well\nWe'll get to play in your work and that it needs to be a cost of the arrest outlays eating or something I think you need bigger first with bullet proof for its future Democrat or Republican to go out for public protests\nOkay well we got to get to our next break thank you for your comments and I agree with you if not all but for the most part okay thanks for calling out and we'll be right back after these

come up with something Ga holy cow now I just uh was um pass on the word that the full vote on Kavanaugh will be on Saturday\nUh-huh so we'll see what happens there and that's from the Washington Examiner so\nStand by at least we know we're not going to get preempted then if we do get preemptive it's only the last Fifteen minutes anyway\nOkay those are view regular listeners who tuned in last week knew that uh the whole show while we were preempted the whole morning by the uh originally hearings on judge Kavanaugh\nAnyway going back to the voters guide you received two voters guides one was a a thicker publication that looks like a regular magazine a time or Newsweek when they were still in business\nAnd it was a big deal and that contained all the referendum Zinn propositions it also contained all the arguments for and all the arguments against now if you want to participate arguing for or against any issue you can do so\nBy writing it and the signing your name to it and\nNow if you want to participate arguing for or against any issue you can do so\nBy writing it and signing your name to it and pain of the I Believe it's a hundred dollars so you can put your name and em for me on a voter's guide for or against anything by paying the fee and sending it to the secretary of state\nOr in what I Do notice on some of these propositions that all of the people all the arguments are paid for by a particular group\nAnd in particular it was a\nA proposition three or five\nWhere the educators and teachers are all against it in every one of the arguments was paid for not by the individual but by an organization so if an organization pays that publication the\nYou've got to a published that in the same thing about the solar issue in the solar issue um [noise]\nUm was proposition one twenty seven and of course all the uh I'm a PS is paying for most of the arguments against it in the solar people are paying for most of the arguments\nFor it and it just goes on and on and on and basically it's it's financed by outside money by several tens of millions of dollars by name you've heard before Tom Steyer through also are\nPulled it across in California of course he's a major investor in solar equipment and primarily batteries imagined that anyway so Jones real quick proposition one twenty five\nThe ah um ability the legislature to change the public retirement system what's your position there whenever I said yes yes it is okay then proposition one twenty six uh\nThe prohibition of taxation of services and I can better talked about that a little bit and not you are in favor of that and it can be\nUm I'm On the other side of that but I trust our legislature and a two thirds vote I don't want to tie their hands on that and I'm leery of any constitutional amendments and all I don't know how many ...\nI think that was one of the ones that was written that that it confused ... because he didn't know if you voted yes you know\n... that was one of the ones that was\nWritten it that it confused because he didn't know if you voted yes you know a million ... yes yes yes as a known and or the yes and that's another thing that she's\nA lot of people talk about there ought to be there how to be a law saying hey if you want to mean yes on something that should be a yes vote and if you want knowing something they should be a no vote a lot of people are confused about this\nAnd of course what's the natural um reaction to anybody if they don't know anything about an issue that's automatically know it's automatically know if I don't understand this I think somebody's trying to pull the wool over my eyes tack without voting now and that's\nThat's a um I Am voting on that one so proposition one twenty seven the renewable or the solar initiative and of course you you vote no on that no yeah and I do too I Am a strong on that\nThen we got a proposition thrill five\nAh the expansion of school vouchers\nThat I don't even understand what they're trying to say so if you don't understand what do you do no ... no vote no that's right and I think Ken Bennett was even a little bit of confused about that\n[laughter] if only they are as a group of people to make the laws are height [laughter] guess what folks we are the people that make laws I mean we can do it by citizen initiative or legislatures can do it by referendum so ah you know when
