R. J. two hundred that United expresses flying so\nAs I've said before this is a real airplane it's a regional jet and there's a bathroom on there and people can kinda see what that experience would be like and so it's a great opportunity for the public to really uh you know get a feel for what this jet looks like and then\nYou know a hundred a hundred years since the passing of Ernest a love our hometown World War one hero he was one of many\nWho served and sacrificed a during World War one there's several others that are listed down on the courthouse plaza on that a memorial there but you know he's really our hometown hero in that uh\nYou know he was a you know in the army or\nA reserve there and he he um died in action he was actually captured but this is commemorating or what he did in World War one which really in my mind commemorates all of our World War one that's what they sacrificed right\nSo we're looking forward to that so very quickly uh the air show particularly that's on Saturday when as a writer right so Saturday again the air show I Would get out there at nine o'clock Jason is when the gates open I think that way you get some good parking and get in there and\nAnd uh lots of different food vendors lots of cool air planes and helicopters that will be on display the live air show starts at ten AM so you really want to be there by ten o'clock there's going to be a really cool reenactment\nOf this dog fight with a Ernest they love and the enemy there in the in in that will be kinda fun to see what they do with that\nUh but lots for the whole family definitely want to get out there about nine o'clock and and once you get off the airport there'll be signs directing you where to park and and helping you out\nAll right we're going to pause briefly

the news fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's a lot of my guest is mayor Greg ... really from the city of Prescott\nAnd feeding into this uh air show and celebration going on this week Greg uh it seems like a business in tourism certainly picked up in Prescott during the summer ah during twenty Eighteen what's your impression and what have you heard from the city so\nFar yeah lots of good things going on you know we were just talking about commercial air service let me start there\nThose load factors right now Jason are somewhere in the sixty five Seventy percent so we're seeing way more than we had anticipated way more than the the parent company sky west that anticipated they were expecting kind of forty percent\nA load factor in so many times I've talked to my friends and the the plane has been absolutely fall which is great news and where you will push for\nA trying to get more flights in whether it's to the same locations or elsewhere I think we're really going to start pushing hard to see that expanded and I think we have a case because of these uh airplanes means so full\nThat really is an indicator of people particularly coming from LA the plane is full several times we're seeing people from LA come to our region\nAnd and spend the weekend and so that's a great indicator of an increase tourism\nAre not seeing that as much from Denver coming in but a lot of people going out to Denver ah so that's all good news from the airport in the commercial or service to see those load factors up\nTourism has been up I don't have specific numbers yet at this point Jason but I Am hearing good things about uh the sales tax revenues which is an indicator of course that there's more people in town spending money\nAnd uh every then I go to I Know they're hearing record record crowd numbers that those events which we've had as you know lots of events are here in September every weekend I think there's three or four different things going on hope fest last weekend was a big success so a lots of good things happen\nThe vents are here in September every weekend I think there's three or four different things going on hold fast last weekend was a big success so a lots of good things happening around town we should have some numbers\nHere in the coming weeks and months OK and of course we're moving into the Christmas season that's a big thing for Arizona's Christmas city the courthouse lighting the Christmas parade a Akron night and uh so we're anticipating I guess and you are too that this is gonna continue we've got a good upswing\nI think so you know I think the only thing hurting is a is Seventeen honestly and you hear it and I hear it that uh people have been running into some additional traffic on I Seventeen or there might be an occasional a accident there on I Seventeen and so\nWe are very interested in working with the state and and the governor to try to figure out how to get that fixed because that is probably for us right now the biggest downside we don't want people in the valley think you know gosh it's going to be a headache to get up to Prescott or there's going to be an accident or whatever so\nAll good things from our side up here it's it's great that we had the commercial our service to get more people in here without having to rely on I Seventeen but I think that's a choke point right now\nOkay and very quickly here at the end just a reminder no uh no a council meeting tomorrow next one's next week or haven't really looked at the agenda you said your well it's not set yet we still have a week to go so but I'm moving into the fall there's quite a bit of business still coming yeah\nQuite a bit coming to the council real soon uh you know with Arizona ego development that's going to be coming to the planning and zoning commission or here in November\nAnd so uh you know everything's moving along that that particular application I Know people are anxious to kind of started hearing about that just a lot for the staff to cover on that size of development and so they're making sure they cross ... to get everything\nCovered on that before we come to the plane zoning commission okay

two Seventy to Tripoli to eight three Seventy two Seventy two most go now to Jeffrey Jeffrey\nI'm off here I'll light off and I have kept up with ... a lot of the parent is diabetic I'm I'm a lot I don't know why\nI don't have a boy or a hereditary that are shut out without they hit a mom and dad brother and sister not on the phone all of them have it um I was diagnosed with it about five years ago with a fan of about four to five years and\nSo the question is are they they uh\nThey got a diabetic and uh some of the stuff they love that along with that that that's not good either medication that I don't really want to take a whiff may\nEnd up my retirement years if if I could faded out a little\n... well I get that I mean\nThe reality is diabetes type too and that's good that you don't have any family history of it but it just means that your lifestyle choices over a long period of time it's kind of lead your body into this position but see that's good news I mean as tragic as it is to hear that you have diabetes and you kind of puts a little chat down inside of your stomach gives you\nA feeling of oh man I've got diabetes well it's okay because diabetes one of the number one health challenges that you can come out enough that you don't have to be stuck with\nSo as much as you kind of lifestyle your way into it the good news is you can lifestyle your way out very possible so it's about coming up with a strategy coming up with a good game plan and not feeling like you're stuck but there is hope there's light at the end of the tunnel and you can really see your way out of it\nBut you just have to come up with a game plan and follow it so here's some keys\nOf what you can do to be there really get yourself out of the situation of diabetes right first thing you got to look at your diet diet is the key what you eat we are what we eat very true grandma set it and it's true [noise] so the things that we put it inside of our body become our body right so the following the anti inflammatory diet that's [noise]\nWhat you eat we are what we eat very true grandma set it and it's true [noise] so the thing is that we put inside of our body become our body right so the following the anti inflammatory diet that's what you find in my book and power and your health\nAnd some things that are really beneficial and that is it your proteins in the fat to help balance out your blood sugar and basically three meals a day a couple of snacks in between but the meals consist of equal amounts of lean protein sources like chicken fish before eggs\nLow glycemic carbohydrates in the former fruits and vegetables and the good healthy fats almonds walnut cashiers avocados\nWhen you eat a protein and a fat together\nThat balance and stabilize blood sugar and so then when you're you're carbohydrate it really doesn't allow the body despite the sugar levels and the insulin levels as much so it allows your body to be a healthier state\nThat is one option and really your core foundation in my opinion the other is supplements you were talking about supplements that's fine but just remember they are not the one item that is going to correct\nDiabetes they're really just ancillary there a supplement is what it is it an addition to an already healthy diet so understanding that realizing that\nLike if you go out and walk ride a bike treadmill go to the gym and work out I recommend hiring a personal trainer for about a month about two to three days a week so you can start learning what you do to work out because exercise in the gym lifting weights and all is very important because you can maintain good lean body mass\nYou maintain that lean muscle tissue which is so beneficial for all of your house\nAnd coming up and learning how to do that if you don't have no clue about it is something that really will benefit you in the long run so I encourage you to look into that as well so it's all about game plan it's all about coming up with\nA an overall game plan that will take even where you are to where you need to be and if you do that\nThen you'll excel you'll see your body especially losing weight I mean dropping weight with diabetes is a big key so drop in that way it getting to a new place that's going to help you more than anything hope that helps triple eight to eight three Seventy two Seventy two Nancy writes from Facebook she says\nI'd like

gap it as a cross what's called the blood brain barrier Nancy and so it really doesn't benefit your brain chemists\nIt made supplement out of\nAbout what they found is that gathered doesn't cross what's called the blood brain barrier Nancy and so it really doesn't benefit your brain chemistry at all\nAnd it's been it's been out for a long time but it really doesn't benefit you gather in the

S. MCAA\nUnited States and Mexico Canada agreement us MCA and big announcement huge promise a maid and a huge problem is delivered by Donald Trump got very little coverage frankly that not the coverage and deserves to us trade representative was the man behind that is a deal a Bob Lighthizer will join us here on the lower ...\n[noise]\nMm Mm Mm are you a responsible person to find yourself going

seven nine\nI yell at UT off on a couple of those\nWell I mean I don't want to specifically focus on the wall Street Journal they've been sort of against the idea of changing after from the beginning you have to start with the with\nThe position was NAFTA in this current state good or bad well we have large deficits\nEvery everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgraded as crazy and then in addition to change and the economy we are very large deficits and we were witnessing literally\nIn fact and people would suggest don't up great it is a crazy and then in addition to change and the economy we had very large deficits and we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies\nAre to Mexico and other places so the people who say we shouldn't have to have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just an engaging in self deception I might I might know that both the secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nPromised they would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned done so what the president did which I which I think was terrific is we have\nWe have by far the biggest trading bloc in in history at one point two trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America give us who have to pay my bills and do I care about and better in a whole variety of ways\nIt's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America [noise]\nThe there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis\nWe call it a review provision their labor rights we should never been like this ever in an agreement before there's access on agriculture there is there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital pray middle actual property protection in financial services all these\nThese ah twenty first century economy kinds of things there were no adequate rules and now we have um there's even very good rules are on the environment with your beyond anything we've negotiated before which I'm I'm proud of there's there's very\nStrong enforceable rules on currency which we've never had an a trade agreement before there there are limitations on data local is Asian which is an important thing for the digital trade people we have limitations on how state owned enterprises\nWhich is you think China Ken subsidize so there's there's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important agreement [noise] better than than anything in the states as having to go she ate it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country\nNow some businesses and some Wall Street guys left to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be\nThis is the that the president\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is the the the President Trump trade a um type and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nWe're talking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement a Bob one of the things that were wondering is how this works any still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing where there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly that there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats a little ... in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or they think it doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticism you have to sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should uh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan\nFor working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being purely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she added that I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and is not what we did\nThis is what I'm\nJohn Harwood from CNBC said specifically regarding autos let's listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they won't be worth it for auto ...\nIf those provisions work means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough\nThat they will be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nI guess my I mean if I had to say one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that there there are so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all the ... the major auto companies\nGeneral Motors Ford F. ca which used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all set is going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing\nYeah that's a good thing they've also that's workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take him to sit down and blue sitting there belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just reading something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they do that what they're talking about this was going to be really very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or Canada either it'll it'll help them to the biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content\nOf cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is it increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest off we're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that bad things under under the ... the person who is going to lose out on this is China and places like that under the TPP that these people all indoors half the car can be made in China and sold in American duty free it's completely lunacy the people don't talk about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America now it could be Canada also but in America for the most part that's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the ...\nThat's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those car should be made in America by American labor\nWell I think what President Trump promised honest on the campaign trail he promised he delivered five Lighthizer us TR ah what's next I mean are you guys gonna get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland and some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they and the Swiss they're anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\n[noise] yeah and that we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise] we have a lot of things that we're doing a small deal dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go\nThrough 'em but there's a bunch of other countries do it and then of course the big the big elephant in the room just China\nAnd one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the\nWall Street journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things just sort of say oh look at this was bad for the S. and P. what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like\nOne of these what are the things you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to prove the opposite it and then the other ones that you should look\nAt it and I ask any of your your list or to look at the thing if they happen to have the hopefully\nI'm looking I'm actually looking at it now and January

Christine fair at Georgetown said\nWould that would that slightly Republican professor survive\nProfessor wouldn't be run off campus not that there are many Republican professors anyway would be run

some interesting reviews of this particular professors teaching style come up\nA namely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that unbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this in a conservative it wouldn't it would never happen\nIs no discussion questioning or did they in her class simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed

on Kavanaugh grilling how about you know do you remember blacking out do you remember getting drunk and how you behave in college and just always the presumption of guilt going forward and in every

sophomore year we were\nPartying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture and my point in bringing it up is not to blame her\nFor her you know if she were if she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way you deserve to get raped but my point is if you only have he said she said\nIf you don't have any corroborating evidence\nThen you need to look at the character of both people you need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing it in college and you know we should be

forget that weight\nShe also mentioned college she mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual assault she said she didn't do well in college

no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of crop rating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nWell that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because I didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest\nI'm and she didn't she didn't vote like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing but so Trump traumatized her\nFor four years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and re decorating and you know we had no emotion that corresponded\nWhat she was saying creepy TST and trauma and horrors of it all was there would have been more anger there were more fear and passion and more directed a she was attached she her anytime she ever talked about the assault\nShe was very attached and her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can disassociate dissociate when they're raped and stuff but she wasn't right\nAnd this is thirty six years later and she said she has ... the which means that you're a heightened awareness of what happened and so she just did not she was not ... to me on feelings or fact uh but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts and the fact that measure up she lives in the ... and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college I think she got off campus after that and and things calm down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with a context to this right before the Supreme Court nomination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that you know we've got to really we need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this this isn't just about Ford or or ...\nIt's about our liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward what are the principles that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible right where\nOur democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principles that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior of\nYou know attacking people in public restaurants or elevators or you know these the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers are the ones who are are the first to get in your face first ones\nBecause they are driven by\nIrrationality they've banned in fact\nThey've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level so all they have their subjective feeling and power\nAnd if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of a ... objective truth in order to have dialogue then the most powerful the biggest bully in the room that's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of rolling\nTheir bullying everyone in order to to advance their power and it and part of that student ... there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over those who are\nTrying to use you and you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on and different kinds of ferrets now what's going on and and the tight relationship scare and women and ripping our country apart\nAnd if we if this means that we have to let little rapist go free because we can't prove that it's better to stay presumption of innocence just said the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty\nOh I'm actually the Mac went that's just real life that that's what it's about being a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake\nWho lived up to his last name I mean the the perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from it that's a good kid like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorist it's a type of political and emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel they have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist\nAnd it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel they have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist and I say this in a\nIn a in a way meaningless journalists don't like to demonize it's fake news and so forth would imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their face screaming at them and it I think that would be the first ones to say wait a second you're intimidating the press but what about intimidating a a a a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station as as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them and it does that count at all parents do not\nKnow and and but we like he said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are\nA and that is one of my reasons for challenging a Christian for about\nYou know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing for anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she within and again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecute him than we need to ask her the same kind of questions\nAnd you know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nYou know when you're bringing these accusations up in the political sphere then why should we believe me we are not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to power team just because you're allowed and bowling and yelling at us and and the restaurants\nYou know we're we're not you know we're not going to have to take it from you\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election was all about don't you\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of bad policies bad economic policies bed foreign policy and twisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called BS and all of it\nAnd he said look out over and I've done all these things but uh this is just ridiculous and ... and ... what before we let you go real quick do you do you think that this could actually boomerang against the Democrats in the midterms\nAnd I hope so and we need to get the word out the Democrats are very good about organizing on the ground base and then turns and we need to know that we can't sit back because the economy is going really well and be fat and happy we need to be activated and we see what's going on in this kangaroo hearing\nAbout what the right of the left is when

the United states is spectacular because at the last moment the Trump Administration concluded to deal with the Trudeau government in Canada\nFor just guarding the NAFTA was unacceptable to the Trump Administration and embracing a new creature called us MCA which I guess we pick up\nThe hill and Fox News and I both agree we can't pronounce so we just spell it out us the MTA Lizz very good evening

as I mentioned to the audience you have just Baird please get candidate done we can't do this without Canada where's Canada will candidates here are you satisfied with what we know so far if you ask them to be a good evening fuel is\nEvening John I Am satisfied I'm actually cheered by what they accomplished and the reason it wasn't getting done is\nPartly political and partly because there were certain issues and in particular dairy terrorists\nOr that Canada was really unwilling to budge on the political reality is that Justin Trudeau didn't want to seem like a week laying in ... you know facing off against Donald Trump if you remember back at the G seven meetings a they had a bit of a contract tall and\nA true does polling went through the roof for the first time in months because it was considered that he had sort of face down Donald Trump\nWell he didn't want to sort of ... on that but at the same time his liberal party was getting killed in one election after another and not doing well and here's the thing Canada it's a very export dependent economy they needed NAFTA they needed to get\nA treaty in place so that\nTheir major export market was still in place a and so they had to come to the table I really just thought it was a matter of time but I also thought it was incredibly important to have a when if you want to look at it that way and I do before the midterm

done around the tariffs and Canada which are on average about two hundred and Seventy percent\nBut then Canada block that access and so this now is on blocked and our dairy farmers will be able to export more to Canada I'm also poultry and eggs are those are\nThe products also we're going to be more freely flowing north uh and then the other big thing of course as automobiles and the supply

show my colleagues ... peak of Fox News as well as a blogging at the hill here to comment on the domestic economy we've dealt with the overseas the economy the trade negotiations but now\nThe market responded very well to the U.S embassy a news lives and here we are in the fourth quarter there's a lot of consumption going on in the United states\nI have not heard anything about is flowing momentum if anything I've seen house prices maintain their heights maybe there's a shortage and supply at the starting and have you heard any interruption in the shopping or in the consumer confidence list\nNo I I think you're looking at a spending being very strong in the third quarter and what everything I raised suggests it's going to be very strong as well and the fourth quarter we're talking about growth\nThree and a half percent kind of\nTerritory a look when you have the\nFederal Reserve chair a Jeremy pal talking about the U.S economy being almost too good to be true and talking about how they're not going to be any recession until twenty twenty uh you know that's a that's a pretty good indicator and I don't think he is someone who is political I don't think he's saying it\nExcept that is what he sees a and that's in spite of the fat that\nA that's a pretty good indicator and I don't think he is someone whose political I don't think he's saying it except that is what he sees a and that's in spite of the fact that the fed is going to be a increasing interest rates pretty steadily throughout the next year so\nRight now um I don't see in the marketplace any excesses that are particularly worrisome there is a lot of dead around but gosh guess white folks when you have one percent interest rates forever people borrow instead of issuing equity or whatever\nUh and that has had some impact probably on stock prices but and it also has meant that interest or that the debt levels have gone up but it's not at all that kind of situation we had in two thousand seven two thousand eight when we all knew something was profoundly wrong there is no sense of that today whatsoever\nAnd the market is high and Main street in being a strong dollar so we're looking at a good Christmas season I've not seen a negative report on that in fact what I have seen is shortage of workers to stuff up the retail\nWell that's right in fact all the retail\nUh companies are out there raising Amazon today announced that they were going to be going wrong Fifteen dollars an hour\nFor all their employees others have raised wages to make sure that they have enough seasonal workers and the numbers but the increase year over year target I think was twenty percent they're not alone in that that that suggests that they're looking at incredibly good indicators\nAre for the cause of upcoming holiday season and don't forget for many companies that's like two thirds of the year so it's hugely important I think we are going to have a gang busters fourth quarter\nAnd you know the question is then does all of that translate right well for the Republicans in the mid term elections it's hard to imagine that it won't it's hard to imagine that Americans are going to be\nI'm completely indifferent to the idea that Democrats could raise their taxes or at least roll back the tax cuts that came through early in this administration\nUh people are saying there are other big concern is health care and I would say they're\nA Donald Trump talked about that today in his meeting with the electric or his speech to the electrical workers group a ... and talking about how the Republicans have done such a great job on health care rates aren't going to go up next year they really need it if if that is true they need to really broadcast that because boy that's not the perception\nYeah this last minute blew it is we're going to watch the\nThey need to really broadcast that because boy that's not the perception\nYeah this last minute who lived it is it is we're going to watch the the reporting on Capitol weary\nIt's horrifying and the only good here's one thing that I think is good news today I read an article I think it was up on ... real clear politics have thirty seconds go ahead\nYeah just challenging a Christine Blasey Ford's explanation of the so called second door I recommend it to people not because I don't know if it's right or wrong\nBut it's time that someone began looking at her\nReally no one is asked her any hard questions are looked into her background and I'm not saying that this to be mean to her you know I think we all give her the benefit of the doubt but maybe we should be a little bit more careful about our assumption is regarding Christine Blasey Ford\nList peak of Fox News and she blocks of the hill on the roaring economy when the chairman of the Federal Reserve says the economy was good I don't have a comeback I'm John bachelor\nThis is the John bachelor show\n\nNo Rush Limbaugh show I think it's safe to say that a majority of the anti Trump knew that we've all seen since the election I shutter to how much of it is genuinely thing and all of this year's report it as though when you remove the because\nOf this day and we're still affected by this they get away with manufacturing massive displays wrote gets blown out of proportion actually\nRush Limbaugh none of the Manafort new\nI can tell you none of the

China they are not permitted ownership\nChina and says I'm these so called joint ventures which are in most cases provides them with fifty one hundred and fifty three or fifty five percent ownership us as a minority stake color white there is a huge problem\nBut the simple reason that the Chinese owners can command the American business people to literally lay down their little print on the desk\nAnd from there the technology opens up and that's how they do the stealing and that says the force\nA turnover of technology that is in and said the essence now they had some very tiny fall starts with it give some small financial companies ownership but guess what they will not grant a license they will not look I had a wonderful conversation with the president at Google\nLate last week right because there been some issues you know are you being fair to conservatives and so forth and we talked about the world situation Google would love to open up and try and again you know they walked out years ago because censorship but he's running up against same problem\nThere's no ownership uh uh they can't get a license for this and they're nowhere near a deal that Google and just multiply that by whatever six folder tenfold or twenty or\nSo the ownership issue is in some sense the very core of it and after all John think of this you know in communist societies the state wants to own everything right that's the problem that's a barrier and that's not acceptable or to western entrepreneurs and western commercial interests\nSorry you're not conversations with the trade and economic leadership of all these countries I don't ask for names but in any event and said your measure than in Europe in Japan Canada and Mexico everybody understands that China is a threat to peace

D printing 'em and so all three of these companies have established offices in Luxembourg and why have they done that because ...\nHas this wonderful a method of using the tax\nDollars treating its tax dollars as investment capital and they have offered investment capital to companies that have tablets offices last summer that they denounced the specifics of what these companies getting for being there but there's no doubt that they're getting some benefit for establishing his officers in looks and broke from the looks and\nBroken and good luck Bert Bob I remember you reported that some years ago I or maybe a year ago that they were starting space program and they're looking to encourage investors to come to lock them Bergen do exactly what we're witnessing now and I mentioned that this can be done in any country\nYou don't need a rocket to be part of the commercial space we go to U. A. E. which has another approach to draft an astronaut corps how they're doing Bob\nWhere you see this it's an interesting way to compare to to look similar where he doesn't have a space program they just simply are trying to encourage investment dollars and let companies come and compete with everybody and invent new things in space\nWell what you eat the United Arab Emirates is doing is they're copying and the Soviet Union and the United states\nWith space program and so they're trying to think they're trying to diversity the vices that diversify their cut the economy and bring in space the development but rather than doing it the ... the greatest space program that that they're going to try to fly up government\nBuilt a probe to Mars and they announced that they're going to fly a citizen to space and they made a deal with the Russians the Russians are going to fly amount of soy use craft\nAnd that astronaut is now going they've now set a tentative schedule is going to fly April fifth of next year and come back eleven days later to go to I assessed ... a fly on a cell\nThey've now set a tentative schedule is going to fly April fifth of next year and come back eleven days later to go to I assessed ...\nA fly on a so I use 'em or they have not announced they have to find a list right now about who are that they've picked out of the applications that came from that citizenship they've announced who is going to have not said who is going to do it\nEither way this is an Arab by copying the space program Soviet style system that pretty much every country in the world has been following for years and the U.S has finally transitioning away from a ... or so we'll see how this works for them it is a sad thing from my mind I went to Russia and Iran\nTo fly this guy had the NASA and the bureaucrats in the United states slowed not slowed\nSpace ... down they could have possibly offered this flight to them and to them instead and important money to the U.S\nRussia and China the once upon a time wannabes I'm dominating big space have now signed an agreement Bob this was part of the conversation we've had these last year's Ross costs most\nIs the very famous very tablets and will be in the history books forever but it's not a money China and the other hand had trouble\nRecently and we'll talk about some of those ... and in doing something bold or making moves that given an opportunity to be fresh do you believe that this combination Russia and China will be successful\nWhile I let me put it another way of the reason that Russia and China this week signed an agreement to establish some greater cooperation that space projects and specifically has to do with the manufacturers space vehicles and rocket engines and I'm quoting exploring the moon and deep space\nThis is one of the main things that focused at well gosh China is building its own space station\nRussia wants to stay in space somehow and the choice that had up to now is to to team up with masses boondoggle gateway Luna a lunar space station\nAnd they've been complaints by regardless and the guy in charge of Ross cause mostly doesn't want to really deal with America the way that he's being dealt with as a as a as a as like a junior partner and so they're going to he's going to be meeting with a NASA Administrator Jim Britain and Stein on October tenth\nAnd I think these negotiations a part of the Russians very skillful negotiation tactics they're telling the United states and Nassar essentially that if they don't get a good day\nTill the tendons and I think these negotiations are part of the Russians very skillful negotiation tactics they're telling the United states and Nassar essentially that if they don't get a good deal and working with gateway they'll switch to the Chinese and the truth of the matter is\nHe's probably looking at gateway from a technical perspective and thinking you know this really isn't going to serve us very while while the Chinese are building a space station maybe we can team up with them and put new modules on that station\nIt'd be easier and less of a a costly and\nPossibly more practical so this is a perfect example of that what I Will tell you here is that um the NASA has trouble building anything they can do that costs just takes too much money and time and so they get far income countries to come in here and build parts for them\nI'm much of the INS was built by Russia and Europe and Japan um when it comes to get with the same kind of thing or Ryan they couldn't build a service module for that capsule Orion they had to get your to do it\nAnd so that desperate to get partners in the gateway Luna orbiting station and if for Russia's gonna threatened to pull out I expect ... management to actually back stab to us in any negotiations with Russia\nThat rather than to send U.S interests I expect them to be focusing on trying to guarantee Marshall participation even if the deal might cripple American ...

dates I'm sure but I Know one of them is November ... for sure\nFantastic well that'll be a good thing for people to get their flu shots taking care of and move on so let's talk about other events that are coming up this month\nOkay so we have a an outreach event that we do at Prescott valley library once a month is always a second Tuesday the month so that's on the night it starts at five PM we had them later in the day to accommodate our veterans who work and go to class and have different things going on during the day and uh the\nOn the night it starts at five PM we had them later in the day to accommodate our veterans who work and go to class and have different things going on during the day and other topics for this month's of that are home base primary care and medical foster home\nHome base primary care is care that that's our veterans can receive in their homes so they don't have to come to the VA for their appointments or to get labs has drawn or anything like that we have a a nurse who comes to the veterans home to take care of them\nIn a medical foster home with the program at the VA has it a lot of people aren't aware of and we'd love to try to get the word out more often it's a program because a lot of our veterans they don't have family members to live with\nBut they can't live on their own either it's unsafe for them for medical reasons or maybe they're a full risk or maybe they just had certain health issues\nAnd so they don't want to come and live at the hospital communal living center and maybe they don't qualify for cause of care is not that dire need but they need somebody and they have no family so medical foster home\nIs where somebody here in the community can say oh well I have an extra space I have an extra room in my house I bet you know three bedroom house and I have an extra room\nAnd they'll let the better and lived there with them and they'll help take care of them and they get a stipend from the VA to do so\nFantastic um there's another event coming up and this was a series of workshops the or doing on COPD yes and there's a lot of information on the Facebook page about the different workshops that are going on and the things that people can do a related uh COPD let's talk a little bit about that\nYes it is so anybody who suffers from COPD knows that they they're they're trying they're trying every day you know they don't want to go see their doctor for every little thing but they also want to know how to really handle it how to do with that day to day so that that these workshops are there to help\nThe veterans cope with it to live with a meat other veterans that had the same problem so they know they're not alone\nAnd and provide any kind of resources that we can so that they ah can get through this and and you know it's not life altering and and and they can uh you know continue with with their day to day\nAbsolutely any other events coming up with the city of ... in the next few months besides the parade\nThat separates huge with the city of Prescott and not necessarily the city Prescott but we do have a movie night at the VA it's in our theater building Fifteen it's going to be on the twenty fourth of October it's free we have free movie nights are biting everybody you know bring\nBut we do have a movie night at the VA it's in our theater building Fifteen it's going to be on the twenty fourth of October it's free we have free movie nights are biting everybody you know bring bring your wife's cousin brother kids whoever you want to come in and start six PM twenty four at the movie is a nightmare before Christmas\nAnd we had these monthly and we're trying to get more and more people to come to these these movie nights the theater if you've been in there it's huge to very accommodating and we're hoping that we can get people that want to come out and watch the movies but I also do want to put out\nFor anybody maybe that didn't listen to the news or pay attention that today there's going to be\nAn emergency broadcast to people's phones and I put that on our Facebook as well um it starts eastern standard time so here's going to be like eleven Nineteen I Am so I I really want to make sure our veterans notice because it's going to be very loud and their phones and I don't want anybody to be startled or scared when it goes off\nBut this is a it's an emergency broadcast that's coming through on your phone eleven Nineteen I Am today\nAnd if you happen to be at the movies today and you are hearing phones going off it is a not anything someone can prevent from happening except for their phone being turned off and we'll see what happens I'm I'm interested to see if everybody's cell phone goes off in this process it's supposed to\nAnd I think that's why they're doing it this way to find out if people really are getting a notifications they are supposed to be getting\nUm so that if there is a state of emergency or or anything like that going on you are aware so I just want to let our veterans know who maybe I don't normally get those this one might go through so I don't want them to jump or get scared when when they hear that loud noise coming from their phone\nAbsolutely well again it'll be interesting to see if everybody's phone goes off and in what succession or order that occurs um as we test out the presidential alert system here across the country\nYes I have some friends that I Would classify as a aluminum foil where earth\nAnd um some of that as I should say um they will probably not have their telephone on and they ... or will be staying far far away from you know mass communication from the government as they would put it\nSo we'll see [laughter] sorry moving on other events coming up at the VA or how are things with the greenhouse going\nOn but we had another barbecue we were going to continue to have barbecues\nAri moving on other events coming up at the VA or how are things with the greenhouse going\nI mean we had another barbecue we were going to continue that had barbecues at the green house in ... anybody maybe you didn't hear my other uh [noise]\nOther times that I've mentioned that we have a greenhouse at the VA that is ruined solely by volunteers volunteers that have a green thumb or maybe they actually didn't and now they do but\nIt's a green house that we set up to help our patients it started out as a way of helping veterans who might have the TST\nOr who had anxiety or stress\nTaking them out to the greenhouse letting them take care of plants to relieve stress they're feeling and it's going over very well with our patients and they love coming out there to the greenhouse\nWatching their plants grow we could always use more volunteers to help take care of it but we also want more veterans to know that this is here it's free we have an adopt a plant program where they can come and get a plant and\nAnd it stays right there in the greenhouse and they just come by and water and take care of it\nAnd uh it's a lot of camaraderie as well because other veterans or they're doing the same thing\nAbsolutely what's been the last few minutes before the break you just posted a few days ago I should just about a month ago now I'm On the website about the uh let's get moving class and restore to care for veterans so\nThis is one of those programs that a lot of people aren't aware of what we wanted to put something out to everybody know that we have a lot of patience and are so you'll see what you're commuting learning center and our patients there are wonderful they they love the care they receive [noise]\nAnd we want them to stay there and be happy but at the same time a lot of the veterans that are there are there because maybe they had surgery or maybe they had an injury of some sort so they're only supposed to be their temporarily get whenever a you know you know recreation therapy or physical therapy\nAnd that they need and get on their way so this restored of care program is what we used to help get our veterans back on their feet or a back up to the level they were before before the surgery or some of the veterans we get they come to us and they just\nThey they lost focus they lost the will and this restored of care program has truly helped veterans all want to get better I Want to do better want to [noise] to be able to walk in and do a lot

interesting there about the Roosevelt of course a lot of history here in Prescott rough riders and in all of that aspect so getting to spend some time on that ship you would have been what one of let's see how many\nAre that's the Theodore yep so Franklin was a the a lot smaller\nLike a lot lot smaller whoa yes All right we're going to check it out here we go so that was a midway class aircraft carrier and uh one of the names or nicknames that she was known by was the swanky Frankie\nI never her down we were at the point I was on record of the Rushdie Rosie\nRusty rosy fantastic well it looks just a jumping in here and taking a peak about forty five thousand tons just under a thousand feet and links\nEight ... cruising speed was thirty eight miles per hour and it held a complement of forty one hundred officers and men are much different to its sister or the Theodore Roosevelt which is significantly larger or as you had just mentioned and total links\nMuch different to its sister or the Theodore Roosevelt which is significantly larger\nOr as you had just mentioned and total length of that ship here are just over a thousand feet but it has a crew lets see thirty two hundred of the crew and twenty five hundred or from the aviation air wing songwriter\nSo during your time or you are working on the ship or were you actually in the plane [noise] no I I work I'm On the flight deck are supporting the plane\nSo if ah they were getting ready to go out and the radio malfunctioned or something that affects it was my job to replace it there you go\nAnd uh I can say oh why not Roosevelt I was down below Jackson a shop repairing the parts of the radar system\nNow did you ever get to launch off the catapult actually I did I got a\nOne launch off the or a risk any er into Hawaii when we're going in for a beach detachment for a while\nAnd I actually did a launch and recovery off the Roosevelt tell us a little bit about that experience it's a it was fun I mean it's like a ... second rollercoaster ride when it launches a the interesting thing with the the one be being a twin engine prop\nThe cat appalled actually was faster than the airplane could fly [laughter] so when you hit the end of the cat the plane would actually stop 'til the props caught up in\nAnd take off that had to have been a very strange sensation it is it uh in in recovery part is\nYou're looking down waiting for the ship to show up and by the time you see it just stopped [laughter]\n[noise] well a little bit of information about the easy one be it was forty five feet in length ah sixteen feet tall and had a Seventy two foot wingspan are based on some of the things I'm looking at of course it being carrier base the wings would fold up\nIts crews speed a hundred and sixty miles an hour maximum speed to twenty eight had a range of a thousand miles and um that big radar apparatus on top is quite the flying saucer looking\nThing well they eat one there was actually a\nA parabolic radar antenna that circulated inside that don't they eat too is that took over the base\nRight our antenna that circulated inside that don't they eat choose it took over the basically replaced it with a flat dish that is the radar encounter now\nFantastic so pretty exciting a time lots of activity going on I'm I'm sure life on a carrier is quite the interesting experience\n[noise] yeah it is it's like anything else a part of what you get out of it is what you put into it uh being involved in and getting using it as a learning experience things like that or help a lot um\nYou gotta keep your head on his will as they say on the on the flight deck because you never know what's a\nAre going to come up unfortunately recently a a a sailor is lost on the flight deck because he

before I left today you know it was weird yesterday I was driving around and it was like a Brazilian rain forest it was just ... and just doing all kinds of weird stuff wow how many is a Brazilian\n[laughter] somebody but you know the the hurricane was kind of a bust didn't you think\nI mean it was like we're in a constant Mr for a while yeah I guess it's better to be over prepared than under prepared though right but I thought it was a nice good soak into the ground and we'll take any kind of water we get\nAnd you know what there's all kinds of water flowing through the granted bills and we're talking about saving adults today I have the chairman of the saved the does a committee are you a committee Jo that's right committee joke Trudeau and um you're taken on this giant project who the heck\nAre you guys were trying to figure that out because a lawyer working ourselves into the ground and really you know it's a lot of work doing something like this you are and who who's involved in doing this kind of thing is it is it are you getting paid for this is it an organizing who's throwing in on it\nOr nobody is getting paid other than a couple of people we've hired for help like a website designer here and a guy who's helping us make video but\nThis is the all volunteer committee\nUm that's about twenty people right now active on it it's all folks from Prescott Prescott valley and the\nUm you know the the greater Prescott community you're dragging them people from all over the place\nI Am trying to drag into as many people as I can with this broad of backgrounds and perspectives and ... and you had a a a little presentation of the out by college and you're drew Fifteen hundred people yeah that's our estimate um we filled the auditorium which was eleven hundred and eighty seats and they opened up the cafeteria for another couple of hundred people\nAnd there was cars constantly streaming through the parking lot couldn't get\nA find a place to park so figure about Fifteen hundred and how long ago was this and I was on June twenty fifth June twenty fifth cause you guys went kinda far back you got an interesting story of how your group started yeah so I mean really this group represents the latest uh iteration of a long\nLegacy of open space advocates in Prescott and uh several years ago there was a this this\nScrew represents the latest uh iteration of a long\nLegacy of open space advocates in Prescott and uh several years ago there was a this this deal in the works to protect a an eighty acre parcel which is of the old granted does resort\nAnd that fell apart at the last minute due to variety of factors and a lot of people open space advocates kind of went into hiding because they are really depressed about the turn out there and\nI'm so a couple of years ago I I gotta convened a few people together at ... coffee shop and to kind of talk about what's going on with the ... and we saw that I'm On the\nOn the horizon was a this Arizona echo development project and said well this is this is a pretty serious thing for the granite Dell's pretty big development and so we decided to I re initiate some sort of act as open space committee and uh that two years later is led to say that they'll\nKnow where you are bringing in any of the people from the last attempt with the with the granted those resort there\nYeah yeah there is a I think two or three of those folks that were active in that are active and say that ...\nI think one of the problems with that pitch I think whenever you go forward with something like this you gotta make sure that it's the real deal I mean they were trying to pitch it's gonna be like it was before and it it seemed like there was really no chance of it ever being like it was before you know with the\nFour eighty or find online at Prescott landscape professionals dot com\nHey we'll come back from this lovely when they were talking and save the bill's I'm your host\nPreschool you I'm with Joe Trudeau we use the chairman of the saved the dos committee and you know there's there's things you're trying to accomplish I mean what was what was your initial objective\nWell our and our initial objective is to\nUh work with the city and uh the Arizona echo development to protect as much of the granite Dell's portion of their land as possible I'm not trying to stop their development or um for really trying to prevent them from being profitable we just want to kind of\nMove things around in the landscape so we can protect that landscape out in the granite Dell's for the public know have you met with all those Persian yeah oh yeah I've met with everybody in the city council\nMove things around in the landscape so we can protect that landscape out in the granite dolls for the public now have you met with all those parties yet yeah oh yeah I've met with everybody in the city council\nUm I've met with the city manager a number of times I've met with a with Jason D.C from Arizona echo just wants yeah um we've had a couple of email exchanges um he seems like a straight shooter I\nMean I've dealt with them before and there's not going to be anything sneaky on his party's gonna he's gonna tell you what do you want and you know I think the negotiations will probably be good faith I've done in my experience with them before\nWell then that that's good to hear is that what you're feeling you went away from that are yeah I feel like we had a great a great meeting where we just spoke to each other like unite today like just you know mano a mano like no no no\nHidden agenda is you know it's one of the biggest things to notice knowing if someone's lying to you're pulling your leg is is if they don't tell you what you don't want to hear if they're telling you what you don't want to hear their probably telling you the truth\nOh for sure and J Jason DC is uh is this is a very successful businessman and yeah he's just a skilled negotiator doing what he does is a large developer and I'm In in many cases he is more apt or at the stuff than I Am I'm not I'm not a businessman or much of a negotiator myself but I'm giving it a shot\n[laughter] no it sounds like you're doing really good I mean one of the keys to that as being passionate about what you're doing right\nOh yeah yeah and I believe in it you know I I Believe that um this is a decision that this community the city council can make that is really going to benefit Prescott for a long time\nAnd you know there are some places that are really are part of what you're talking about and one of it is the iconic point of rocks and doesn't this tiny and some of the trails to oh\nSure yeah so point of rocks is is a is a really beautiful spot out there and the ... a lot of folks don't necessarily know what it is because the modern generation doesn't really equate that name point of rocks with anything but it's deep historical significance in terms of Prescott settlement and their railroad coming through and\nAh even um the ... nation they ... they have a name for that spot and so this is a spot this really been historically important for a long time\n... you know I think about all this stuff going on now as I drive through the granted they'll seeing where all the rocks are blasted out and you know the railroad grade\nDo you think they just had so much of it back then they didn't care I mean did they just have ... where they surrounded by so much beauty and so few people that it's like well the road should go here because you think granted does isn't that big they could've went around and ...\nA lot of people I asked that same questions why the heck did they blow a poll through these rocks when they ...\nIt's like well the road should go here because you think granted does isn't that big they could've went around and it ... yeah a lot of people ask that same questions why the heck did they blow a whole through these rocks when they could have gone around them [laughter] but you know and you know a few bringing up you're talking with a ADD and you're\nTalking with the city of Prescott this isn't even in the city of Prescott where's the county when it comes to the ... valley where's the state\nRight oh so you're very good point this this entire negotiation or deliberation or this decision is is about bringing this land into the city that's that's what ... ... yeah so this land is in the county right now\nAnd um where is the county you know you have a pi county doesn't have a strong parks and recreation department which uh I Believe you have a pi counties behind the eight ball compared to a lot of other counties in the state um who do you think about providing those experiences to taxpayers um [noise]\nSo I've met with a couple of our county supervisors and they're certainly supportive of this idea but I'm a\nShow me the money to you know that you know show me the money right and I'm kinda glad that they're not 'cause I live in the county I Love for the oppressed get to pay for the entire thing that'd be just awesome you know and ultimately um the city is in more of a position to to to find open space acquisitions and ... ... yeah yeah exactly\nAnd but to answer the question about where's the state um glass for hill is predominantly state trust land and so they're the state owns most of class for till about four thousand acres up there yeah and so um that that that state trust land is within my\nProposed regional park concept because a state trust land can be nominated for auctioning off to development at any time so any of that land up on glass or hill could be nominated for someone to\nYou know turned into a development or put a dream home or something up there and and I think that if\nFifty years from now we see houses all over a glass or it hell we will have lost something in our identity of what this means to be in this community\nYeah well 'cause that's that's what state trust land is therefore it's there to provide for education and Arizona yeah and when they sell it off it's there for development but you know when you look at the state I was looking at your map and I got to pull it up here yeah you know the development their estate trust land checkerboard it all through yes\nEqual developments land\nWhy not make a swap why can't we get that done\nSo I'm looking into the future one of the things I have in mind with how to how do we ensure that the open space values and glass fertility\nSwap why can't we get that done yeah so I'm looking into the future one of the things I have in mind with how how do we ensure that the open space values in glass retailer protected or a land swap is is a viable option\nI'm so let's look at pioneer park as an example pioneer park is a city park\nThere's a mountain bike races there's trails you know there's ball fields yeah um that is actually federal land that's bureau of land management land that the city has something like a Ninety nine year lease on so it's it's an entirely possible I'm a mechanism for us to consider a land swap where\nWe can identify some parcels of bureau of land management land down in the deserts\nThat we can swap for the state's trust parcels on glass for hill in a glass ... can become bureau of land management public lands the city could then get a a management lease to effectively become the manager it's pure of land management in name only but\nLike pioneer park it really becomes a city park and so that's a that's a pretty viable low cost legal fairly simple transaction and it's something that they've done a lot in Maricopa County I'm Down by wiccan bird right now there's a similar example vulture peak where that is\nFederal Bureau of land management land America accounting now has a management least to have a new regional part so this is something that there is already precedent\nFor and you know we see where growth is going in both Prescott valium yeah get its north\nYou know that's the only place they really got to do is go north ... and that places checkerboard it out there\nYou know you keep talking about B L inland but really it's state trust when do they swap out land because really wouldn't it be more valuable for them to have nice flat ... north of Prescott valley and then a bunch of lumpy rocks that you'd have to blow up and ... and ... sure you\nKnow um it it it could be possible to for Arizona echo to consider trading some of their land for state trust land that has more build them all that it's a higher return on investment\nUm where we haven't really given that much thought because the overall portion of their land that is the ... is so small it's only three percent of their entire property and so to go through it exchange like that for a small portion of the land might be kind of an onerous task\nYou know we pay people to access to do that I mean when you look at a if you got the city on board the county on board\nIt's like that for a small portion of the land might be kind of an onerous task\nBut you know we pay people to access to do that I mean we you look at a if you got the city on board the county on board and you know even the state to some degree on board anything is possible yeah\nYeah any anyway has specially if it makes financial sense for it to the schools and moving forward and future like that because really have you ever just looked at one of those checkered maps of of where we live I mean they just\nThey just said okay this one not this one this will not this one right and it just moved all over the place anywhere there's a railroad you have that checkerboard right yeah yeah because those those pride what's private lands now are granted to the railroads under the railroad act\nWhen you're talking about the space that they they own you're looking to\nTo lock up five hundred acres in eighty owns over Fifteen thousand is that true\nWell in this um ah ah I'll I'll I'll I'll debate some some of your terminology they're okay they do own Fifteen thousand acres we're actually looking to open up five hundred acres I see you know because right now the five hundred acres that we're talking about their privately owned\nThere is no public use of them other than the ... finding the iron king trails which run about three miles through them\nAnd so we're we're hoping to turn this into\nPart of press gets park system and effectively open them up rather not rather than lock them up so really you're you're looking\nAt not the state to because I Would think this will be prime for a state park [noise]\nThey they have a lot worse state parks and you could I mean then they have this dead horse they park yeah just kind of nothing with a river runs ... schools is not quite as cool as is\nWell anyways All right we've got to go to our heartbreak at the bottom of the hour I'm having a good talk with Joe Trudeau he's chairman of the saved the Dell's committee here in Prescott if

frequently asked questions like one of those is what lands are included in the proposed regional park\nYeah so this is a concept and I I drew a big\nA big box and the landscape but just as a starting point and basically I looked at the the county tax maps and\nPretty much all the land that was continuous to the ... it was undeveloped I included in as a starting point and nothing is set in stone to this and actually some of the parcels that we included in the original park has since been recently annexed with development plans on 'em so it's obviously not going to happen\nYeah yeah so you got kind of a moving target the movers are getting a little you know who is go to the phone company you want to be the devil's advocate we'll\nGo get an idea [laughter] Hi Chris how are you know hello hey I'm\nJoe I just got to I wanted to talk to you about looking at things from a different perspective um so I Lived in Phoenix for many many years I\nDid you ever live in the next show no I never have\nOkay well like I just wanted to use two examples so I'm proposing and just look at this this way if you really really want to\nYou know to save the delve I think you need to leave it in private hands and let me tell you why we have two examples of Latin Phoenix so just at the end of carefree highway is a rock beautiful beautiful rock formation and it became a development that was very tastefully done called true in\nThe ... the developer develop that he he kept all those rock formations they became part of a very exclusive and high end development\nThose rock formations now will be preserved forever now let me flip to the other thing we have another Parker regional park that was a beautiful area before it became a regional park and it's called the ... Parker now they call it pasture with peak up\nOr down there in Glendale and having lived just a few blocks at one time from that park\nIt's destroyed now there's garbage everywhere and there's hundreds of people coming in and out with their dogs cars all day long and as a devil's advocate do you want that for the Dell because if you you know decide to use his or let's say you're successful and trading land and this becomes a regional part\nThat is the way to destroy that the rocks and pay us to a peak has been faced with graffiti um you know again there's constant garbage all the time and all the cars coming out it changed the whole area so you know I'm proposing that possibly you guys look at this from a different angle that may not be the best way to save the doubt\nYeah well sure county that's that's a great question and a couple of good anecdotes there and uh\nYou guys look at this from a different angle that may not be the best way to say that out\nYeah well sure county that's that's a great question and a couple of good anecdotes there and uh I Am not a personally opposed to private conservation land like I said at the beginning of the show that sort of the background I come from with\nWhat we call conservation ease Mansour other land trusts or there's entities that can that can effectively do what you're talking about with your with your first example\nUm but ultimately uh our our hope is that this land can be available to the entire community and to visitors\nOr to use for recreational or educational purposes um because it's an incredible public value in terms of bringing tourism to the community and providing a places for for kids to explore and run around in the rocks and\nAnd you know get all caught up in ... and and learn things about being a kid you know and\nThat's all true but you did have to remember um you know the flip side of that what happens yeah about ... increased traffic\nYou know what you're going to be like if that holds is opened up on the on the weekends hundreds of people coming up uh from the valley and pretty much you know I'm not trying to destroy it it just fighting it gets to strike I mean I've seen it sure you're\nAware of that I mean I I don't know Jason very well but I've seen some of the other developments and you know if that were to be kept in a very private development and\nTaking care of I think that that's a very easy to that area so just playing devil's advocate weighing in on it um I Do a lot of the area I was there a lot and I think it's worth it I just don't think opening it up to the world is the way to go to actually preserve it\nThanks for the call ... ... yeah mom by by\nAnd you know she brings up a good point because there is a lot of private land that's in this area already there's already homes built you know in this area already you know sometimes people get well what would we want would would private lands is in the plan to be condemned are taken to eminent domain or something for this regional work\nAbsolutely absolutely not definitely not and it's it's something that I think concerns a lot of people but I'm ... ... ... we are fully intentional about\nThis being a fair deal not only for the city and the taxpayer and the public who lives are granted tells but for the developer too and so it's got to be a fair deal or else it's going to leave a bitter taste and someone's mouth and yeah and we and we won't be able to achieve the big vision of a regional park you know if if this one deal Arizona echo development go sour\nOr else it's going to leave a bitter taste and someone's mouth and yeah and and we won't be able to achieve the big vision of a regional park you know if if this one deal Arizona echo development go sour then that kind of sets us off in a bad trajectory for the future\nWill because there still is I mean how many different property owners are in the park right now have you counted them\nWell if you count all of the residential there's a lot of already subdivided house lots out there that are just there within the broader\nShape of the park but they wouldn't really be part of it because their neighborhoods I mean you're talking a couple hundred pieces of property but there is really about a dozen large undeveloped lots that we're talking about wanting to conserve through a variety of means whether it's\nUm future ... stations open space protection orders fundraising or you know we might even up people donate land that happens to\nHave you driven through that a development that is already on the west side of the highway oh yeah well I've I've written a bike through it you know some of these homes are filled with giant balanced rocks yeah right above them would that scare you I I have nightmares about that um earthquakes happen [laughter] yes income and blast in through like that\nUm how would you pay for this the soccer you know is there a you talk about in your paper that it won't be hard to secure government grants Robert foundational support that stuff is hard to get ... get that kinda money\nNo it it's not but I I think that the uh what we have here is an opportunity is really like a um\n[noise] if not world class it's at least you know nationally it would be a high priority for something like\nUh there's something called the land and water conservation find which\nAre the Senate just passed out of a committee to bipartisan a fond of it's been around since the sixties and that takes oil and gas revenues from the Gulf of Mexico and provides that money for a community conservation projects like this and this is a sort of project that really attracts land and water conservation fund investment\nOr Arizona heritage fondest through game and fish department um there there's so many incredible aspects of the ... that uh if we can all come together as a community and say hey let's do this then I don't think it will be that hard for us to put the pieces together\nAll right well hey Victor we see that you're on the phone we're going to take a break and we'll be right back with you on the K ... pm show\nUltra water by how star in Prescott valley or one
