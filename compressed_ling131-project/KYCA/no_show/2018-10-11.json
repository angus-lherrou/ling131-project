of America and soon to be scouts BSA Doug good morning I'm On an hour you to\nDoing well yourself for a great well dug we wanted to talk to you a little bit about what's going to be coming for Boy Scouts of America as a their name is going to be changing or their membership ranks are going to be changing and what's been going on with that so\nBasically uh can you give us kind of a rundown of what's going to happen over the next few months with Boy Scouts of America\nOr in terms of a moving forward with the family program we've actually been having girls join our younger scout Cub Scouts now for a couple of months\nSo first through fifth grade girls have been able to joined Cub Scout pack with their families are already coming next spring or February first to be specific\nThen a girls who are eleven years new Eighteen years old can join scout troops so moving away in that program from calling it boy scout troops to the use of a scout the essay\nOkay now we've been hearing about these changes over the past few years and this is a pretty radical change for Boy Scouts of course so but\nThe basics of the program or as I understand in terms of merit badges the eagle scout and all of that none of that really changes ah in terms of what the kids who joined can hurt is that correct\nCorrect and that the Cub Scout program was very you know it was a nothing has changed in terms of of what they do in their adventures and and and things like that there's no difference in their rank advancements\nIs a nothing has changed in terms of of what they do in their adventures and and and things like that there's no difference in their rank advancements\nAnd actually in a A N troops will have the same scout tender for that second class first class star live eagle progression and to do that uh everyone will be required to complete the requirements that we've had before\nOkay so none of that changes it's just that now they're going to be allowing girls and two scouts BSA as well as boys everybody's as long as there are as I understand they they have to be at least eleven years old or what are the other requirements\nIn in terms of the program with scouts\nIn the troops new they've just be eleven to Eighteen but they will join either a boy scout troop a scout troop with all boys or all girls so there'll be a troop of boys or group of girls so there'll be no coed troops the older ones\nCub Scouts works a little differently they\nCan either be a separate\nCub Scout pack we call them\nOr they can be in the same pack but there then and different Dan's which are the small groups they're broken up upon broken up into\nOkay income the Cub Scout dams coed or are they typically are a one gender male or female\nThey ... they should be one gender male or female so if you have\nA second you know a group of second graders you'd have a second grade boy Dan in a second grade girl dead and they work together when there's common activities you know what I mean but when it comes down to you know what I mean to do in\nA work within their individual groups\nThey stay in their dens okay\nAnd like you said there are some packs and and and we have chart organizations which are little different than other youth groups that the idea is is that we have different community organizations who sponsor these attacks so\nThey may want to sponsor a girl pack and a boy pack wealthier and a girl back while then they all do things together and there may be joint activities uh and and just like when we do district gr area wide stuff\nOkay All right we'll talk right now

and I said what do you drink some pick the dust on the president what he's suddenly your best friends what what what is the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I still do the facts are facts and then you have to give it McCain memos that we subpoenaed\nHe's suddenly your best friend's wedding what's a theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I still know the facts are facts and then you have to give us McKay memos that we subpoenaed there are all these stories out earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire\nOr tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording wherever they want to do\nUm and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers is I'm not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure if it were starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI made me think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what he said this to a uh is that the stories that said he said it's been a tape and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker so a book will or will\nHopefully he'll hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we can asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the uh the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why his involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page McCabe call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being recorded that uh he was he taught to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein now and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein I never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former director at ... deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted then left and of course Peter Struck\nCounterintelligence demoted than fired top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein\nNamed Mr Mahler to take that investigation over so that's why this is important and that's why Mr Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can ask me questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to show there's no way I don't think he had in mind for him now\nAnd that's when I wrote it needs to be in front of us so we can ask you questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to show up there's no way I don't think you know I had mine for either no no he's he's not he's not going to come I I just\nI I guess I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and I maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself or get wired going tape the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment go I I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance mean that is that this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventy may ninth as a date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire calling me may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe on that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel obstruction of justice and all those issues\nThat all the whole reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\n... ... again the the main question that is on the table I think as a mother is gonna do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve ale an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of Donald Trump and if that's the standard now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and\nSaid hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and but you know Carter Page I mean where does he go to get you know his reputation back and where does he go to get here legal fees paid I mean he's just twisted when for years\nNo I'm uh that's that's good you brought that up because we sometimes it's important is that go back to the basics the Clinton campaign the DNC pay Perkins carried off or who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally cooperated in that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other parties can pay [noise]\nBritain and that document became the basis for going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other parties can paint\nThat is what happened here and ... and they used the press to get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is a ... works for them\nShe get information to her husband who then finals it to the FBI so she gets information your purse or top Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility I always say the more people talking about the live easier the lies to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie and they use that to go to spy on the other camp it's\nWhat are your line of the um what's your what's your sense about um the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democratic gains that there are still predicting in the house I'm well how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so and I was I was in or out and about across our district and live in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that our Senate how tough and a ... a good man who was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the left has gone completely crazy we did a tweak the other day I had more people comment on this we we said today's left\nA plot capital Nick destroy Kavanaugh\nAnd that's today's left that they they embraced the radical you know ... when he disrespected the flag embrace Cuomo when he says America was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who\nSupport the president or an old by the way we're going to destroy cabin on the positive I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it is to stand over the next twenty six days and that we cannot keep the majority now\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you have to uh I I don't know if I started as a fuel but my ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters did it or first rant and we got what I what I call the treatment from a lady were\nOut and she started we're in a line of people getting moving into the theater and um she just started\n... you know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so yeah I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that to people who are on the left but they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kind of just watch a little bit more but [noise]\nYou know um look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate let's just fight about and argue about the idea is let's not let's not make it personal let's not run people at a restaurant\nOr you know look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but just by about ... about the idea let's not let's not make it personal what's not run people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do that they found to do it and it's safe yeah it's it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing that you forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um to see us attorney southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up are removing him as deputy AG let's listen\nI think president realizes that if he were to get rid of\nA Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it wouldn't give more reason to extend the investigation why what do you want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down they transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about over\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean I I it seems like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report credit\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that's that's probably a ... that can be right and uh obviously respect a copy 'em and all the things he's written about always done so I look at all is going to be any changes made the Justice Department till after the election until after about ... I think that that's obvious but it's obvious that\nI'm the president wants that a new attorney general and I think that that will happen at some point too but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election it until after the special counsel's work is finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to you congressman Barry set of Ohio congressman thanks so much will take a break close out this hour a lot more to get to Michael Savage is also going to join us stay there the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYou have been listening to the highlights of the central highlands when the news fourteen Ninety eight one oh three point five FM K why ca\nWe're the news at them one oh three point five and fourteen Ninety am why ca Prescott ...\n[noise]\nLike also tropical storm a month John Callahan Fox News downgraded as it moves north east or to the cross Georgia\nBiggest impacts will be certainly over Georgia throughout the overnight hours a\nTropical storm force winds very heavy rains occurring in that state and then there'll be spreading into South Carolina up by Thursday morning by more or less sunrise\nJohn ... at the national Hurricane Center who says the storm well then don't more rain all the Carolinas drenched last month when Hurricane Florence bought the storm should move offshore by early friday the storm came ashore east of Panama City Florida midday Wednesday as a strong category for hurricane\nMade landfall two miles an hour short and they kept five hurricane and this will go down in the record books for many reasons one of which fourth strongest storm as far as wins go ever to make landfall in the U.S at least since recorded history and as far as pressure and that's kind of one indication\nOf how strong the storm is it's the third strongest that we've ever seen in time\nFox meteorologist Rick Rock music extensive damages reported in Panama City Florida broken and operated trees roofs peeled off homes split open but fallen trees twisted streets odds on the ground and power lines nearly every where governor Rick Scott ordering people to remain sheltered until those hazards can be cleared you knock it out of the roads\nUntil you're told to just say we need the roads to be open for first responders and search and rescue to do their jobs and save lives one\nDeath who's reported from the storm in the U.S a man was killed near Tallahassee, Florida by a tree fell on his home\nAfter a tough day on Wall street Wednesday signs there could be another on Thursday Dow futures are down sharply off more than two hundred Seventy points Asian stocks or will down as well on Wednesday of the doubt drop the eight hundred thirty\nOn Thursday Dow futures are down sharply off more than two hundred Seventy points Asian stocks or will down as well on Wednesday the Dow dropped the eight hundred thirty one points the nest egg last more than our last nearly three hundred sixteen points the U.S and the five hundred closed about\nNinety five points lower [noise]\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nThis is ... and Britain cannery\nCited in part because now more than ever really powerful voices different from anything you've heard before I can be done right by making dot com and sign up now\nFox News rundown dives deep into the major and controversial stories of the day to buy the anchors of Fox News radio subscribing now the euro perspective of news you won't find anywhere else it's going to ... get a job\nBecause there's so much parking and noise and yelling at our role is to take three steps back\nAnd just Sean what really matters Sean Hannity the most important thing that we do we are looking out for the forgotten men and women in this country luring them they're going to get a straight shooter no holds barred I'm not going to catch people black boxes the\nOne place for the last we had voices we won't be\nControls my voice [noise] nobody on the news channel\nReal news real honest opinion [noise] but at a rest in\nSaturday is one of those in crash that killed ... people in New York state twenty eight year old ...

he's traveled here to New York to sit with us\nAs well as the hundred cameras a master's candidate in the program for higher education at the University of Rochester but also as an observer of influence by the Chinese authorities and their Kendrick of Cain Gordon\nSo you're a graduate student University of Rochester in March you are organizing\nChinese authorities and their Kendrick of Cain Gordon\nSay who you're a graduate student University of Rochester in March you we're organizing an event on campus who was the event for\nThe event was pretty much for everybody and the university was an open event where everyone can come without paying a fee and it was meant to sort of um spread this idea of dialogue on campus\nAnd dialogue with whom I mean who who who were the people are going to be at the event\nSo I'm as I said before it it it although was open for everybody I wanted to use I wanted to purposely use the Tibetan issue as an example because of the fact that the Tibetan issue mainly focuses on on having dialogue with those that you tend to disagree with\nAnd so I'm by by ... by setting that issue and talking about it on campus we want to give everybody a chance to participate to get to know about the issue and of course being on a college campus we do have a lot of an international Chinese students\nThat want to give them a choice I'd give them an opportunity also too\nYou know I could get to know the Tibetan issue I'm\n... and then find out something issue to bet I'm Beijing believes is a part of the People's Republic of China it sits in the south western portion\nVery strategic because many of the world's a river start their high ground 'em and Tibetans they don't necessarily agree that they are part of the People's Republic some of them do but some of them want independence\nHacks at least since two thousand and they the Chinese authorities have used brutality against the people of Tibet we have reports of internal migration forced internal migration ethnic cleansing that can be called\nNot only in Tibet but in large cities at the edges of the Tibetan Plateau that's what you were introducing people to the fact that we have about uh the persecution\nHis holiness the Dalai Lama the spiritual leader of the Tibetans um has taken the position that he doesn't want independence that Tibet should be autonomous\nAndy's complained of what he's called and what many people agree is cultural genocide the purposeful attempt by Beijing to eliminate Tibetan Buddhism to eliminate Tibetan a density 'em to take over the lands of Tibet so this is controversial with regard to both drugs\nTo eliminate Tibetan Buddhism to eliminate Tibetan the density 'em to take over the lands of Tibet so this is controversial with regard to both tried to Iran and American campus what happened well\nYou know it's it's not a I I think it's more it's bigger than being an American campus at this point because you know my primary goal was to live out this whole principle that you know we can talk about any issues as a student and we can\nCome come to come to the mutual ground and and just simply and simply sit down and agree to disagree or or to agree to agree\nAnd et cetera et cetera um I purposely used a Tibetan issue in order to give a an opportunity for every student to observe it and make an opinion of their own and then have a dialogue amongst themselves\nThere by living out the principles of what it needs to being at a at a college campus especially in the United states of America\nAnd in March you would actually organized this event it was advertised it was actually the University of Florida's new about it because of course it was taking place on the campus of the University of Rochester and you had a very good central location on campus who did what happened immediately before there are\nStill um up until I guess a day before the event I'm even a even a little bit before that everything was uh going as planned um I was told that the hosting student organization\nI'm even had a meeting about the event and they've even decided not only to host event for me but to help me register for the event I I I went through every every guideline that their advice or had told me to follow and\nSuddenly um my vet and still my event was that on the thirty first of march and undone night or the twenty ninth\nMy a friend of mine actually sent me a screen shot of an email that they receive from the Chinese student association saying that um you know apparently the Chinese student association has had received ... concerns from uh some of the members of the Chinese a international student community\nAnd that are about my event going on on campus and they will and it said on the email that they will lead they ... at both the university and the student administration or know about this\nNow a few friends of mine actually called me that night and asked me you know ah we're actually fearful that your event might be canceled or something where it's\nI Know about this now a few friends of mine actually called me that night and asked me you know ah we're actually fearful that your event might be canceled or something worse might happen and I told them you know what you know this is the United states what could happen you know it I I'm entitled to my free speech as a scholar\nI'm ... I just as they are they're free to they're free to go and complain and I don't see anything wrong with it so what happened to come that morning I get an email from the advice or the advice of the same advice or who helped me all throughout that month to register and to reserve or that event\nOn campus um sends me an email saying that the hosting sooner organization all of a sudden with drew their support for just about what drew the sponsorship for this event and henceforth\nUm this event was cancelled and on at the end of the emails she even noted that um she suggested that I I I moved to advance from to an off campus location\nSo basically the University of Rochester decides to um cancel your event and Turks you off campus well\nI I don't know exactly what happened I don't know why I don't know why she decided to um you know take that step but uh to to the eyes of many people it might look that way but I found it has a lot of smoke around are terrified [laughter]\nRight but all I can say is that you know um I it was a big disappointment and also at the same time I was not only disgusted by what had happened but you know I I just I it it it's I was so\nUpset not because of the fact that my event was cancelled but because of the fact that we I personally felt that we were somehow compromising our values as Americans as as as people who are living on this land um to have to practice this idea that this this right of free speech\nWho think that what was thought it was so hard voted according to who made the phone call I'm certain who made the phone the phone call a ... I mean who do you think who made the phone call somebody made a phone call who watch it\nI I can only I can only guess at this point I'm up maybe maybe it was maybe it was some very upset student on campus maybe it was a ... the Chinese government maybe it was a some donor who who might have not been happy that this kind of\nLine and let's go let's go to mark Clifford for the answer would come to well we were talking\nIt was a dumb donor who might have not been happy that this kind of a ...\nAnd let's go let's go to mark Clifford for the answer would come to\nWell we were talking before about um the the scholar Perry links 'em a suggestion that the Chinese government is a bit like an anaconda in a chandelier at a party everybody's enjoying nice party in the ballroom\nDrinking champagne eating canopies whatever the snake doesn't have to do very much everybody knows it's there you'd reaches out every once in awhile often quite randomly you can't figure out why the snake does what it does but he keeps everybody in mine\nJohn there's another part to this story um we don't have time in this segment but we've got to get back to it because this was an issue of what at a campus administration is doing and what a tried to do to cover its tracks\nGordon Chang of the day the ... the former editor of the south China Morning post and we thank you very careful very careful scholar say who can you tell the story of the University of Rochester yes there are other explanations about I think everybody just hard to not only in the United states but around the world\nThe anaconda I'm John Bash [noise]\n\nLittle Rush Limbaugh show and I think it's safe to say that a majority of the anti Trump knew that we've all seen since the election I shudder to think how much of it is genuinely thing and all of this gets reported as though when you ... and\nHe goes to this day and we're still affected by this they get away with manufacturing displays it's blown outta proportion\nRush Limbaugh none of the Manafort new\nReally new\nI can tell you none of the men of indictment and we sit here today in a single\nIt I say oh no I've seen too many Alfred Hitchcock movies so I have to follow this course have you heard talk is there any noise about Chinese bias among the student population reporting back to Beijing\nWell I'm over the years uh in in in the University of Rochester I'm I have heard bits and pieces yeah my Chinese student colleagues that um\nThey ... they always have to watch what they have to say on even on campus um even in our private conversations do them used that well there are certain things I I personally cannot mentioned so I don't feel comfortable talking about that specific topic like Tibet or or even or even the Christian or even the first Christians in China\nAnd market that would be an example of how the anaconda doesn't have to do anything\nThat's right but the anaconda in this case is doing something I Know for a fact in in Hong Kong it one of the university is professor friend of mine is teaching would get no questions from mainland students until she install the software that allows them to ask questions anonymously to her and she gets a ton of questions\nShe knows for a fact that they're spying on each other and then one of them said oh but we have to report back on you as well this is a person who is not appear at the national so you know the the anaconda does does make some moves down\nGarden what they are not allowed to discuss we we should mention this list is to just a surprisingly simple they're not allowed to

India\nRussia together again not since the Soviet days do you understand how this goes what is the what is the intention of Mr Modi showing friendliness towards the aggressor in in Ukraine and Syria good evening to you\nGood evening Hi well the question who is going to be used against and really there's only one country that has them is likely to be the game tonight to China\nWhich is why I think it's perhaps not as concerning for Washington and last month um the sector ... and had Secretary Mattis we're in Delhi signing a much more important agreement\nWhich is a contact that which is a communication\nAgreement with Delhi which will dramatically increased and proper ability between the Indian and the Americans and I'm sure that the sale with Scott ... meaning and\nIf he had had very serious concern they would have been addressed at that time so there there's the little pocket believe for sanctions but given the politics I I Would hope that there wouldn't be any\nYou have to put a little context as the United states sanction China for by the same as four hundred a\nDuty aircrafts system from the I'm from the Russians and clearly I don't I Can't see the U.S sanctioning India and that must be as you point out a sign of enduring partnership between do you in Washington\nThose these two countries started to work much more closely um but you know Modi seems to be playing a very interesting game of outreach not only to boot and not only to the United states but also to China what's going on there ...\nThey they try to focus hit it always or\nGame of outreach not only to ... to the United states but also to China what's going on there clue\nSo the the China focus has always or or you know been overtly economic in India needs investments um it was hoping to get quite a bit of an investment from Japan it and it's gotten some investment from Japan\nBut Modi in order to be reelected and you know there are elections coming up in the spring of twenty Nineteen really needs to deliver on things like jobs if that sounds familiar I'm so he needs investment and\nThe goal with the Chinese engagement was to try to get the financial engagement with the political or security compromise that sometimes goes with dealing with China\nAnd ... has ... and the investment he's expecting from the United states\nIt hasn't been as a as easy as it could have been um but I think there have been um problems on both sides there are a lot of\nUm vested interest in Delhi or that have been slowing things down as well um a lot of people made a lot of money from a lot of different sorts of relationships so\nI'm One weapon sales are involved um you're looking at relationships that may be going back decades including back to the Cold War times and um people in systems who um have vested interests and other alliances or other purchases\nSo clearing away all of that brush in order to get things that are good for the strategic core of a nation can sometimes take a bit more time than expected\nThe puzzle about blood I'm reporting does he have a neutral image in ... he regarded as somebody we can work with is there a general opinion\nThere's been a very long during the kind of so called non aligned period India's not aligned period um they did get a lot of weaponry from the Soviet Union and then from the Russians at a time when the U.S really wouldn't touch India at all\nSo um there is you know it it it's not considered a problem and um I think there was during during the time when um the west was backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan\nUm the Indian knew that this ... hottest problem would flow back to India\nAnd were I'm not averse to working with the Soviets during that time either to try to contain it so a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with how to some one side and the problem with\nSure not time either to try to contain it so a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with how to one side and the problem with China on the other and that's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nAnd clear what is the state of flu between Islam about um do today\nOh it's that terrible uh and in fact what China did I'm immediately after ah India bought the ... the missile defense system was it announced it was going to sell some very high tech drones to Pakistan\nSo essentially opening up a second front for that missile system to try to defend from\nThe puzzle also about India playing the Russia card if that's what they're playing this can be a dangerous game the Russians are not easy to work with used\nThat forgotten the Soviet days does that regard it is that was all that was then that is now is that the fresh thinking\nNot really because they're because if you look at the age of the people in both administrations they there are people who would have been engaging with each other perhaps his juniors\nOr during the Soviet period so they know each other um you know there there was there was all sorts of stories about Soviet infiltration into the Indian system during the during that period as well\nA lot of compromises material all that sort of stuff\nThat ... way of putting it yes [laughter]\nSo um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read that up but also you know they ... the Soviets were there for India at a time when sometimes others weren't but there is that the more serious problem is that a lot of the stuff that Russia sold to India has not been great\nThat quality hasn't been particularly good and the price tends to keep going up and up and up with a very slow delivery\nSo the actual quality of what's been sold in the past has it been a real problem\nYes I Wonder if they're going to send all those all broken soup ... and ... back to Moscow say their money back I'm not sure that make the flight ... by the garden of the top Condon it

nine zero zero seven [noise]\nWelcome back to the YMCA with Malcolm in the morning and at the end of the break we talked about\nUm registrations if you're not register to vote already is too late to register and the ballots are be mailed out the early ballots or be mailed out as we speak\nAnd if you want to vote early you can actually go into the polling place or the pike county ah\nUm what is that you have a pi county complex on ... street\nCan actually go into the polling place or the pike county uh um what is that you have a pi catty complex on fair street yeah uh ...\nThe county to county building a fair street right yeah and you can do it in a row storage or the or yeah recorders office on the second floor and you can actually vote early right then in there if you're not on the early voter list\nThey used to call it absentee voting and it was a service for people who may have been out of town mhm yeah and it works so well they said well why don't we let everybody absentee vote and now we call it early voting\nRight hyped absentee voted uh even though I was still at home because it was much more convenient yeah I Lived in the north west\nWell and in here I don't know the last time I went to a poll must have been\nGosh Twenty years ago but as a working person you never know how long it's going to take you to vote that's true could show up and show right through or you could show up and have to wait for twenty or thirty minutes in line\nAnd that's why I started voting early in the first place uh I'd go down to county headquarters and cast my ballot right there but it certainly is easier than just getting the ballot in the mail\nFilling it out signing that feeling that and dropping it back in the mailbox side you have to remember to sign yes see outside of the envelope and what a lot of a lot of people think that's kind of jokes right who's going to check my signatures like\nHow do you check your credit card signature and think about it now nobody ever check your credit cards they figure out some do\nBut if you sign your ballot\nTo record his office checks every single signature that's right they've got a digital image\nOf your signature when you first registered to vote and they compare that to the signature on your ballot and that can be a problem sometimes just in ... as I have\nBecause as you age in your fingers get stiff in your hands get stiff sometimes your signature gets\nVery very altered in my case it does I Can't even recognize my handwriting now I Can't even read it\nWhich is kind of difficult when I'm taking notes in my [laughter] in my job responsibility it's really kinda bad if I'm taking notes and I can't can't read a name or a phone number or what we're talking about that [noise] um\n[laughter] it might jump responsibility is really kinda bad if I'm taking notes and I can't can't read it a name or a phone number or what we're talking about that ah somebody in the county recorders office the elections department checks every single signatures female and\nFind out how they do that they listed I Will is a visual or do they do and least want to compare notes visual visually look\nThey've been trained in in handwriting recognition and they look at the ballot\nAnd they look at the electronic image on the computer strain and they go okay that's good or ... maybe not ... that needs further review and they might pass it up the chain to somebody who's a little more experience that handwriting recognition they check each and every one\nAnd I mentioned that because\nI'm a secretary when a Ken Bennett was running for governor\nOf one of his signatures ... was rejected is not being authentic in that signature was for current city councilman Steve Blair [laughter] and it was just hilarious and and it's the ... you know Steve registered probably back in the I imagine\nA forties now met just now admits seventies outlay\nAnd I registered here in Prescott Nineteen eighty to a gym so he probably registered a long time ago and you know your handwriting changes a lot in forty years that does how does your handwriting look forty years later\nWell now it looks like I signed things with my foot yes yeah exactly I could\nProbably get a more legible signature with my toes ... hands so they they actually checked the signatures\nAnd that they can even call on the ballot now that was that that was a um\nA signature petition and they don't call they just reject ... but on a ballot they will actually call you and say hey did you really vote now and is this year really signature could you come in and verify this is now your actual signature because we want to change it in our files yeah to what your signature looks like\nA lot of work but these people jump right in and they take care of it they do yeah they do\nSo I Will I registered here thirty six years ago and I there's no resemblance between my my signature thirty six years ago and today\nIs that we're checking those is not doing their job than right well there's probably half a dozen people down there checking that yeah it's not just one person right they got how big guys and if they they want to review one they'll they'll pass it up the chain so\nUm\nYou know we do have for David string you're also the incumbent and then the two Democratic challengers ed go back and Jim my nose right gay so those are local people we can vote for the others are state what\nMen we have this but the Senate race in the house race\nWho's running as anybody running perhaps for state this time there are no federal elections is this round yeah we just got state Senate in state house yeah OK there is no um well actually never mind you know do we do yeah we have two leaders running neck and neck thought those are yeah logos\nAre and I forgot about the federal embargoes are and I'm David real challenger real David Brill on his yeah they're both from Prescott by the way right and then first and we got Martha McSally\nA and curious in cinema right rank or two ladies running neck and neck that's a high rate of hot race fitness gracious\nNow here locally uh in district going for the state and also our federal district as is district for the Republican majority is so overwhelming\nIt would really be a long shot framing Democrat to win in our local state um races both federal and state why because the Republican registration exceeds two to one\nOver the Democrats both ... I'm In the local district and in the federal district including Mojave county so\nIt'd be a long shot but you know stranger things have happened to that is true you know we'll talk more about that

[noise]\n\nWelcome back to care why's he talks with Malcolm in the morning we been talking about the ... ... ... ...\nWelcome back to care why's he talks with Malcolm in the morning we been talking about the impending a general election coming up November sex and the fact that\nA registration is closed if you haven't registered for the general election by now you are too late however if you've been registered at any time in the past\nIn this voting district guess what you're still registered\nYou don't have to register every election a lot of people ask me that no once you register and if you don't move your registered you don't have to do it again only of change your address Ryan and well\nAnd even if you change your address that affects your local precinct right but it wouldn't affect your voting in statewide county wide or\nA national election through because of the way you have a pike county votes you can vote it any votes center ... you don't have to go to your particular precinct to vote\nAnd I don't know who came up with that idea but it was brilliant I don't even know why we voted by precinct and the first place [laughter] 'cause some precincts there's nobody in line and other precincts of lines down the block I think the paper ballot had something to do with that and counting and that sort of well and I know a lot of people still like doing that but I\nYeah the mailing is good enough for me and guess what\nMailing is a paper ballot well it is yeah it is it is an ballot you get if you vote in person\nIt's just you're dropping it in the mail\nAnd you sign it and as we talked about before\nThe county checks every single signature right they do anyway so when every time we have either initiatives or referendum or propositions people say what's the difference and why do they have the one hundred series the two hundred series and the three hundred series\nYeah why is that what is that why I have not a burning question in my mind but you know I've I've wondered about that\nState law requires that ballot measures be numbered according to four criteria\nMetal in your voter education guide from the secretary of state shows you what I've been reading ... well and I'm the same way you know [laughter] it's in the first portion of the book and it's in the column on the left yeah say what's the difference\nOne hundred series are constitutional amendments either initiated by the people are referred by the legislature are numbered in the one hundreds so that's a constitutional amendments\nOur constitutional amendments either initiated by the people are referred by the legislature are numbered in the one hundreds so that's a constitutional amendment right your proposal to amend the constitution stands to change the constitution now how many how many constitutional amendments if we hadn't Arizona\nI don't I don't know it measures in the hundreds yeah well you know how many constitutional amendments have we had in our federal government\nWhat twenty three fifty seven twenty seven twenty seven [laughter] that go that that ... place on that and it doesn't it yeah is it does it mean your constitution was flawed\nOr it's just too easy to change state state constitutions versus our federal constitution yes I Would I Would agree with a letter [laughter] it's a one hundred series or constitutional amendments to hundreds series are citizen initiatives to create new laws or a man current laws\nThey're numbered in the two hundred for example medical marijuana uh-huh that's where I had to hundreds yeah OK\nThree hundred series in ... by the way we have a one hundred series and three hundred series on the ballot now we have one twenty seven is one twenty ... Twenty one twenty seven and then we've got three or five in three oh six right\nGave no to hundreds okay what are the three hundred three hundred Z our legislative referrals to create new laws were meant current laws\nSo that's the difference between two hundred and three hundred or two hundred or by the citizens ... three hundred by the legislative right now the two hundred series we've choir you get a boatload of signatures to do it right\nThe three hundred serves only requires a majority vote by the legislature okay so then it goes on the ballot yeah yeah and then we got four hundred series those are local ballot measures\nThat would be county or city ballot measures when the city does ballot measures they're always in the for hundreds right when the last time he had a ballot measure here in the city oh gosh\nFor for three uh-huh yeah that's right when was that Eric last elections elections ... tax to governor I ... yeah that's right and how short our memories are you are correct we are for forty three\nAnd okay so that was a local so now we talk about an issue ... referendum and initiated and this initiative is the method by which voters may propose new laws or amend existing laws by gathering signatures mhm\nAnd then they should and this initiative is the method by which voters may propose new laws or amend existing laws by gathering signatures mhm okay a referendum is\nA method by which voters may Vito ... a law or part of a law by gathering enough signatures place the issues on the ballot so the initiative is a new law referendum is to change an old law ...\nOkay so I miss I miss when we've got proposition one twenty five twenty six and one twenty seven they're all constitutional amendments right\nSo the mystery of solved that we know how we're the numbering system I do not like constitutional amendments period yeah I don't and so even though you can study them in a valid method at least for me to determine whether I support or oppose um read the ballot arguments ...\nIn the going who supports them see who supports them see who opposes them overall personal opinion I mean you vote the way you want I mean no means trying to influence than\nI Do not like constitutional amendments right well you can be an informed voter just by watching the TV commercials correct oh God no no TV commercials are so misleading gay\nAnd yes means no and no means the Aspen anyway [laughter] we'll talk a little bit more about a law we really need about yes versus no on proposition they will know rather than yes yes I felt that we'll be right back after these words\n\nDid you know an average size roof can harvest about six hundred gallons of water from\nJust one inch of rain and that rain contains nitrogen and important fertilizer for grass plants and trees plus it's free hello friends this is Travis steadman with Arizona seamless gutters inviting you to stop by our show room on six straight to see how rain harvesting works best of all we'll give you a free sixty gallon rain barrel for every hundred feet of got her we install\nGet into Arizona seamless gutters today for quality products people and service you can count on\nMission is your transmission high Desmond chairs the owner an operator of Prescott valley transmissions [laughter] we have a simple mission and that's to take care of your transmission\nWe strive to offer the very best service and equipment in the industry quite simply it's all we do Prescott valley transmissions has over forty years combine transmission repair experience [noise] keep your transmission shifting smoothly and come\nQuite simply it's all we do Prescott valley transmissions has over forty years combine transmission repair experience keep her transmission shifting smoothly and come see us at Prescott valley transmission Seventy four twenty east second street impressed valley\nIn this is the news fourteen Ninety and one oh three point five FM cable I see a Prescott and K. to seven eight see empress get it's four o'clock\n[noise]\nTowns devastated I leave ...

appreciated and God Bless you all\nAnd we can move on to white or you know one of the big things going on right now and gosh I've been hearing all kinds of things on it is this new county ordinance\n[noise] distracted driving\nRelating to communication devices communication device right and it goes into effect November second or did a morning report with a\nWith Jason here about a week and a half ago the cayenne clarify some questions but ah [noise]\nIt seems like the communities in support I think one of the concerns is that ah some areas have the ordinance some areas don't and we know or some of the towns and cities are looking at it currently but\nI'm the bottom line is it's really for the protection of both the driver and and the innocent motorists on the roadway yeah\nIt absolutely is and you know\nI don't know the exact numbers but I Do know we we do respond to many accidents are involving distracted drivers primarily with some kind of electronic device you know this day and age this new generation ah that's just what they do\nAnd we all see it out on the roads I saw it this morning coming in and it's not always a teens but but younger drivers seem to have the urge to text while they're driving and that's that's a dangerous combination the\nYounger generation you know you go to kindergarten now you send your young child five six years old to kindergarten what's the first thing they do is give you a laptop\nI Know it's a it's a different world it is [laughter] [noise]\nIt's crazy and you know I I totally understand we can't be driving around texting and doing those sort of things and it does create a lot of issues some of the questions I get it how we can enforce it what are we how we going to handle these things\nYou know we're we're put some policy together on it now um I I think overall we truly need some state wide I think as having an ordinary right\nYou know and you have a pi county is is you know it's a start yeah but ah it's definitely something that needs to to carry on and to and to the rest of the state I had one person comment to me yesterday or today well gee so I can go from Chino to do and be in and out of of this\nOf the state I had one person comment to me yesterday or today well gee I can go from Chino to do and be in and out of\nThis alliance write for different ... yeah because I can go into this you know municipality ... illegal I drive out and it's illegal I go to the next one it's\nLike well you know the ... that's how the ordinances right\nNow yeah send you avoid it by just not using your cell phone\nRang and I think that you know so far as you know a enforcement wise I think it's going to be deputy discretion you know we're not going to have some kind of a\nTaskforce or someone out looking out for people who are\nTexting and driving and doing whatever it is you know while they're driving you know we are going to continue to prioritize on major crimes and we're gonna continue to prioritize and aggravated felonies are crimes that hurt people crimes that victimize our new\nEyes as in that I Know in\nOur area is a driving issue that you know still takes way more precedent over a you know as a cell phone we really way more fatalities and things are driving\nAnd so um yeah it's something\nStarting in one of the questions I had today from a reporter was that well if you're looking down at your lap\nAnd the deputy sees that will they stop you and I said you know the idea behind the ordinance is\nThat if you're holding the communication device while you're driving that's the violation and the deputy needs to see that so I don't ah it it there's there won't be overreached there'll be but do we will be discretion if the violation is observed\nWell yeah and I don't think you know one of the person said well I may have it in my hand but I'm not talking on it and the only thing the ordinance is having\nIt in there it is it's very specific its its specific to just don't\nHave it in your hand and whether it's on or not\nUm that's that's what\nThe hands free it solves most of these problems if you need to talk on your phone while you're driving\nWell exactly and there's little holders and things like that and you know it's just like someone mentioned to me earlier just before we came in here that well you know I've got my radio I turned it on I turn it off and channels I'm doing\nThis yeah there's a lot of things that can happen in a car now there's there's all kinds of distraction\nYou know you can come out to McDonald's or the bag of French fries and go down the road you know and and\nThings that can happen in a car now there's there's all kinds of distraction\nYou know you can come out to McDonald's or the bag of French fries and go down the road you know and and that can cause issues but the driving with the texting is an issue and it's something that is really picking up yes all across the state all across the country\nIt is it is and uh so it is something that is going to be what'd you say the second in November no second in November to\nWill be a on the books and can be enforcing it will be an active or ... and uh so that's something to be aware of out there if you have questions or concerns on it please feel free to give us a call at five four one\nOne zero one six I Know that we're going to be going to a break here\nShortly I've just had assigned held up ... we still got a little more time\nThan right well then you know the whole thing about the phone and unfortunately I Know someone who was hit by an oncoming car and when we investigated the case or you\nGet a search for either one of the phone you do this they were actively text yes that that's the way to prove that to a well yeah and we don't want to get to that I think that but now I'm going to use their own discretion they're gonna be\nAs a result of an accident that was the case that Oh absolutely it's not just for a a a single violation no it's a but a lot of\nConcern a lot of questions and I don't think we're going to see the slowdown no no but fortunately the technology I just pour she got a new a fairly new vehicle and it's got hands free built into the car so\nThose things or make it easier to deal with [noise]\nYes it does and I think we're going to over I [noise]\nBlock away how how\nAll right I think we have another line we have the detail\nDale are you there yeah\nHow [noise] All right I think we have another line we have Dale\n\nDale are you there yes I Am how do I do share a show good say I had a couple of quick questions one\nMan says littering you can turn somebody andme for literal\nUh-huh on are you talking about just driving down the street are you talking about like we get calls a lot on folks driving out here on the dirt roads and dumping mattresses and televisions is that what you're talking about or is it what what type of literary\n\nDeal we only have Dale yes I Know you're here okay we got did did you hear what I had asked about the ... no I didn't\nOkay what it is is a yes you can turn folks in for for criminal activity uh we get a lot of calls on people who go out and dumped mattresses MTV's out on these dirt roads or even so far is throwing things out the window over their car [noise]\nSo what kind of littering are you talking about\nWell no I was wondering if the cell phone or situation would be under the same idea\nThat oh I see what you know because\nThere's a lotta times are going down the road you see somebody or even or sitting in a light not we're not leaving and things because of their own and then I just wonder if this was something that you know a\nVery courteous a letter to all Merkel cause but hey you know you've been reported in my own\nYeah and it's affecting your driving if this would be a consideration in the future\nOh I think so I think what initially I'm going to tell our employees at the sheriff's office says I Want you to use your own discretion\nAnd you know traffic stops are normally are most negative contacts with the community and it's just somebody trying to get to work or somebody taking the kids to school or somebody\nSo what I told our debt but he's a lotta times number one there is no requirement of you have to pull people and ride them tickets I don't have a group out there doing that when I tell them as we just want to get compliance on the traffic laws voluntary compliance\nWith the law so if they're going to pull somebody over I tell them a lot you know warnings can go just as far as a ...\nIn getting people to to learn not to do that and many times it's case by case\nI tell them a lot you know warnings can go just as far as the ticket\nIn getting people to to learn not to do that and many times it's case by case but I think what we're going to see is in some of the direction all give to our deputies is use your own discretion but we just want to voluntary compliance and I don't have problems gone out morning people and telling them hey look here's what's going on and here's why we're doing this\nAnd you need to to be careful and not do it so I think that's kinda how I'm going to start out with it\nYou know there's nothing set up right now to allow us to us and folks letters there is a situation where you can do that reporting someone who's littering but uh I don't think that's a we have the capability right now\nRight but just the idea that somebody let them know that you're creating a hazard you are a hazard sure to yourself and uh you know so many people are your people working and using their phone while they're working and things like this you can understand that but\nYou know and honestly we need white spots in the road or they literally pull over the news or do\nRight and and I think that's what folks need to do is quit driving pull over and just get off the road and I got to exactly what we're hoping will happen I really do and we've got to take a break so we will be back and
