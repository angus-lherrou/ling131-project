is the capstone of my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to speak to you right now so what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republicans how to fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think it's true we are seeing the results of that all over the place right now\nThink Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham during the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kevin I was I think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWhen the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what's what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in

because he said he he sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nHe's not going to dwell over mistakes we all need to do that any look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really

she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed to the late and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful but America has been watching and I don't the actor he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but\nUm if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as adjusted to the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's still be shouting at men they've never met for things he's men have never done to

president came out of that press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible and you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught\nA really needed lost some much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight\nFor what you believe in a fight for a principal fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... county and I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a ... centimeter of their skin but I think Trump taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's not\nWay how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us\nHe's a bully it's exactly who they used to come\nHe's not that way how they're all coming out these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own ... to produce vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics\nAnd you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down

respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitutional

written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need it posted\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as illogical and beyond commonsense I respect them more if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary with constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're gonna later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about\nWhat these currents feminists are doing to poison the

they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to the world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her

mind what's happened here in Port\nAnd only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh my my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the into roar um effect that it creates for conservatives and and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nI'm told a line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you\nThat if you try to crash or party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that is to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that uh have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean it's not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president and the campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a long time to serve it like myself I really believe Trump bought the Republicans how to fight\nI mean it's not going to simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all like in an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination it well I think\nHe's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes ... the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means is going to be accessed from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by a mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYeah [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff and turn it into an issue particularly one\nFor aid to go to restaurants\nYeah [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to tear it up because\nI I've seen you say this what are you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these uh Lenski I direct action tactics and they say you know there are some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody want to sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein who look she's a liberal but

again I'm Sorry anti held that thought Joe mansion just voted yes for cloture then I think Joe Manchin he's he's he's in Santa Cruz over unless he boats yes go ahead sorry go ahead any\nYou know I I Would just have to ask the smart political people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not that I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say you\nKnow if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a a majority in the Senate or then we're going to nominate cat and a cabin all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the politics of it well enough\nTo let ... giving you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking\nYou're going to say anti ... is a legal yeah but you know he's a legal eagle he's always law you know constitutional law\nBut you you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want to do and actually be a good one handy because that's exactly it just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced the Obamacare is a law passed\nIn twenty twelve Romney kind of just drop dead after he did a soap box a thing on the at the hardware store like one of his art Psaki they just drive shouldn't take it out across the country and said it's going to destroy your health care and that would've been a great issue for him and end up this is a this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah well I'm going to go from the who the Clinton used to it and say I managed to notice limitations [noise] um [laughter] I don't know that on the political guy earlier\nThat's all right so a mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it was like Murkowski isn't no let's just say I do about ... this is why the whole family dynasty of senators has got the ... the idea that just because your father or your husband or your breath\nLet's see if I can tell you about mccaskey [laughter] that's why the whole family dynasty if senators has got to the

and the house of representatives I I remember her father I mean and then she's mine she becomes a big liberal\nSo I don't get that at all I never I never understood that but now I probably the

articles and places like the Washington Post where's the Georgetown Prep\nIn suburban Washington in Maryland suburbs was a breeding ground in the Nineteen eighties\nFor a abusers of women I thought it

in fact uh give young men are extraordinarily strong education rooted in Catholic ideas and uh just what principles\nAnd Neil Gorsuch for instance among the alumni\nOf Georgetown Prep and um I think it was related as well to something that a Senator Dianne Feinstein brought up in the confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett when she was being nominated to the appeals court\nAnd judge Feinstein asked a beret whether her Catholicism was dogmatic on issues such as a roe v Wade and the idea that it's one son frequently hears that a a Catholic and public life is going to be a have their\nWho

Department reported in these last days lots of news that all looks positive to me but I'm a consumer of news and you are a newsman so\nThe jobless rate fell to three point seven percent according to the Labor Department which is the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine I think that's Richard Nixon I was a young person in Nineteen sixty nine I had no idea we had it so good employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs to payrolls\nI'm following Eric morass inherit tore and the wall Street Journal\nWhich is a Ninety six straight months gained wages rose to point eight percent from a year old earlier solid if a if still on the calculator rise the quote from the chief economist at glass door\nEight percent from a year all earlier solid if a if still unpacked tacked killer rise the quote from the chief economist at glass door this is the best job market in a generation or more\nMr Mick K. U. R. cautious to the point of being a bear is this good news for main street good evening to\nHi John yeah it's terrific news for main street it's not great news for Wall Street and I'll explain that\nBut in terms of main street uh we saw job gains in all the good sectors we sold job gains and the high paying energy sector we saw job gains and the high paying construction sector we saw on job gains in the high paying manufacturing sector\nOr where we did not where we purportedly saw losses wasn't in retail and they are phantom losses are caused by Hurricane Florence a year over year\nRetail has actually added twenty five thousand jobs and there are a this is a positive sign a that are close to eight hundred and fifty thousand job openings in retail which is a record and the reason that's positive that is a retail jobs is a next step up\nFrom slavery except if you you're now at Amazon and getting Fifteen dollars an hour but at the end most retail outlets or you're working at slave wages and people are just turning their nose up at their jobs because those jobs because they can that's a great a sign for the economy we\nHave some numbers here a gym that I Want to help you help me interpret I was always told that four percent was the lowest we can go but they're not projecting that we're going to get to a three point five percent next year and and I mean this is hard to believe\nThat we'll have this uh at at remain below ... percent through twenty Twenty one are we out of people I it's just some robots what's doing this I didn't think this was possible ever and when we got it for two years\nAh you know what it turns out the birth control pill wasn't such a great idea yeah we are short of people uh immigration reform or Israeli\nA front it should be a front burner issue and it isn't a you know you're here in my community I live in Alexandria, Virginia or the public and buses and not only do they flash the destination on their signs they have a one at a at a desperate 'til you need bus drivers man\nOfficers are not only do they flash the destination on their signs they have a one ad or are they desperately need bus drivers man you know your listeners see it everywhere\nHelp wanted signs everywhere there is a shortage of manpower in the U.S and a lot of it is to turn the crackdown on illegal immigrants\nAnd stricter border control now I'm not saying that's a bad thing but we need reform so that we can get a workers in another country ASAP\nWorkers for all levels of jobs but let's pay attention now to the part of the job and a part of the jobs that Dr ... the high paying jobs\nWhere the wages go up is that what explains the two point eight percent remember we complained for years\nThat the wages were not moving they are moving now although we were not according to the wall Street Journal to associate the word spectacular with the movement but they're still moving it just because people are bidding higher for their employees that what's doing this\n... yes as throughout the economy I mean you can see the stories in the paper about the fast\nFood franchise owners who were offering a four year college tuition and pay hikes are offering all kinds of perks to\nA a common plane plane to play but I hear from people is a yeah I'm working I've got a job but I what I really need are benefits so I think you're seeing more companies offer some benefits to attract workers in many cases benefits outweigh the pay increase so\nSo that you know that two percent might seem low but but\nThere's something else going on and it's a I think it's a a an employee's market right now\nIn other words the uh the employer has the employee has the upper hand\nThat would explain the Amazon although that I thought that was very short on their part because it forces the competition to match them it's a it's a good headline I Want to look at why it is the Federal Reserve thinks the economy's going to continue so well off aren't they in charge of the money supply\nThe Federal Reserve is a saying that there is no recession insight and one could show up we could have a step back with a catastrophe like an asteroid and they are going to continue to raising rates and yet the market is ignoring it so let's go from Maine straight to Wall Street Wall Street's delighted with this gym\n[noise] it is but it's not necessarily good for the ...\nIgnoring it so let's go from Maine straight to Wall Street Wall Street's delighted with this gym\n[noise] it is but it's not necessarily good for the stock market it could be good for investors because what's happening is you know we talked about this in the past or the stock market was up in large part because it was being subsidized by the Federal Reserve\nThe Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates so low that the only game in town if you were looking for a positive return was stocks which which is really outside the risk profile of a lot of older Americans but our interest rates are\nOn the increase so you're going to see money coming out of the stock market and going into bonds and certificates of deposits\nWhich are offering a good returns so the stock market\nWill pull back or\nYou know a we'll have some sort of a correction maybe it'll last six months or so or I'm not saying we're having this correction now but we will money comes out\nAnd goes elsewhere but as the money goes in the CDs it gives the uh uh it's it increases our rate of saving so in the long run it means that banks will be able to offer\nCredit at a lower rate to industry so we'll have this transitional period where\nThey'll be all of our audience stocks but for the long run it's it's a very good for the economy\nThe trade story when we are at odds with China they're not talking about the deal is in place for\nWhat used to be called NAFTA now us M. C. A. the Europeans are looking for Congress patients bilateral deals our economy's doing extremely well four percent plus the last quarter and protections that same for this quarter\nEuropeans not so much Chinese negative Japan is even a little sluggish so is the trade story hurting us or is this why is this why we're booming and they're not\nWhat are the ... story will hurt us going forward because really you know we're at China is has been waging a and underhanded war against the U.S economy we are just waking up to that fact Bloomberg kind of wonderful report this week with on how Chinese computer companies were putting ... chips in or\nYeah I saw that with a dog that just just blatant piracy on their part caught yes\nYes so I mean I think this trade war with China is a long term if they are because it involves our national security and I think our manufacturers will be shifting to other countries\nI mean I I think this trade war with China is a long term is they are because of them off our national security and I think our manufacturers will be shifting to other countries are like Cambodia believe it or not and Vietnam a\nGoing to be hurt in the long run because of the middle of the country or the United states at some point we're all going to be playing and paying more money for things we take for granted for being cheap like sneakers and T shirts and that kind of stuff\nUh but I think Americans or whether they love crave a current or hate him boy will rally around the flag on this issue because again it's national security or the Chinese are trying to

a is not just an anti ship weapon but a hyper ... an anti ship weapon anti has a pizza shop that indicates China right now is testing a hyper sonic glide vehicles\nAre tied do the Chinese wanted to know this is that while we have the photograph\nExactly the Chinese don't let us they don't just stuff out there in the gutter\nEdison's posting willy nilly on the Internet about their military

hundred thousand feet by a balloon a like a ...\nAnd in a in a terrier that can drop them and if you think about it there that's really a low cost effective way to get aid data on how these vehicles perform in the atmosphere um\nOperationally they would be launched by the list a missile\nTo weigh up you know at the edge of the atmosphere and then once they get high speed they would be released and then they lived back a hyper sonic speed to their target um allows or just your basic climate treaty understanding how the body works outside when all\nBut like I point out the peace John\nThis very well could have taken place in probably it take place ... years ago um we know that they're testing these weapons actively beyond just like testing you know with the Lou from every indication

see that now ... do we are we preparing to defeat what the Chinese can offer from their bastion sees\nRight so when it comes to ... percent of weapons actually these types the goose idea called that can maneuver they're not like a ballistic missile that is pretty much out of ballistic trajectory and we can track at\nA potentially engage with another missile um these are very hard to defend against and DARPA has launched and you should get just a couple of weeks ago we reported on it\nCalled the glide breaker program\nAnd that is a good a built an ecosystem or at least examining and understand what ecosystem is needed to create good defensive measures against hyper side weapons so we have missile ... that's a huge multibillion dollar a year deal\nNow we're gonna have to be that hyper ... defense which all share some of those assets but rarely if its own thing and yeah when it comes to anti access the whole idea is that they need to push us out you know a couple of thousand miles I'm On the shores\nAnd barrage our bases that are existing in that area that are within that bubble ... missiles meaning that we cannot strike and in a lot of time\nMaking access inroads toward the mainland China needed towards like you say the the first silent shame so their strategy is multi full but it's also very clear it's a very clear\nAnd we're finally once again coming to terms with

ourselves\nBut in defense of getting\nDefenses against the hypocenter glide vehicles yes ... and right now just died of twenty Eighteen we have less than a minute time your opinion is the U.S navy a capable of striking China before these missiles can fire\nNo even how is now it's super high threat scenario just with their anti ship was the missiles\nSo and and and other ways submarine warfare and

the budgeting DIA ... thinks that one more and in addition the controversy over remark that he makes and I agree with him immigration how does it work for and what does he want\nRight now and this is also a something that right now you see a big a sort of pitch battle happening within the executive branch and and really across government where you have a\nYou know within the executive branch voices like Stephen Miller that are looking to curb a not not only to deport undocumented immigrants by the hundreds of thousands but also to curb the amount of legal immigration that can take place and browns point as a you know if this economy or works great\nAnd it it serves the national security purpose when it becomes a magnet for a smart scholars and students from around the world to come

most generation that means we're still stuck in entry level job shaping the stable mid level jobs\nAnd most are willing to move that that's what it takes\nAnd that means buying a home may not make them a financial class interesting\nFinally one of my friends said that there is no way he can afford to buy a house that night is the apartment he's currently living in luxury apartments with granite counters and Bob bathrooms and said he our gym than that one with dog ... the other day [noise]\nThey've become the norm in most cities and we've gotten spoiled some people look at the cost of buying

C. H. P. M. weekdays at four on the news FM one oh three point five and fourteen Ninety am\nWe can you\nWith our special show going global\nAll about the international real estate market and what it means to you\nWe're going to continue our index conversation now with an international real estate expert\nLast hour she talked with us about bringing foreign buyers to your open house and now\nHow you can buy your dream home [noise] you know faraway land [noise] joining us now is Patricia ...\nReal for an international sales director with the\nYour global agents team at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida Patricia thanks for being back with us on real estate today absolutely so now let's\nTeam at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota Patricia thanks for being back with us on realistic absolutely\nSo now much changed the conversation to Americans who want to buy either across the sea or over the border where are we looking for\nA lot of Americans are buying in\nRetirement destinations now outside of our own country\nBut we think people going to Costa Rica to Panama odd to Mexico those are pretty big overseas mall 'cause\nUm we see them going to tax havens like the Bahamas than some of the Caribbean island for them but we have partners in those areas that we refer them to uh take good care of them\nSo much that process like Patricia once the first step\nIt really depends on the situation generally if someone is thinking fine you know they didn't know the area\nI'm not always but I Would say most people you know they worked in an area that friend is bad and it's been on hold on our vacation there so they know where they are looking\nAround I I talk to them about what what exactly are you looking for this and then ... how long were you going to be living that during the year do you want to rent it when you're not using it so you know a lot of people by federal vacation homes and want them to work for them while they're not using them\nAnd that helped me understand what they're trying to change but then technically I gave a picture that in some national to life partner in the right location and then finally time is\nIt could be more than one location I had a British gentleman recently who wants to buy something in Central America Easter you know like you want it to look at how long he gets a little bit Costa Rica but we tend to into partners in both countries and he thought this particular jumping undecided on hound them all\nBut he felt confident with the introductions we give him so apartments in most countries didn't\nDon't really have to prove themselves as much as they would have done if you just called up from the Internet that\nMost Americans who buy in foreign countries do they also go all cash by either taking equity out of their properties here or cashing out stock or something along those lines\nYes they do because it's very hard for Americans to qualify for a mortgage and the other country usually day off cash by a sudden you right then that'd be leveraging whole Michael J. line here\nFor an American to qualify for mortgage in other countries so usually day off cash by a sudden you right then that'd be leveraging home equity line here or selling them we'll hear all that stuff folks won't be able to buy it but they would typically be cash buyers and the country\nBecause of the exchange rates and how they fluctuate if I put a contract to own a house for one million dollars in another country is it possible by the time I get to closing is going to be one million two hundred thousand\nIs ... the one million two hundred thousand it could be eight hundred dollar\n[laughter] my my advice or with who and who's involved when you when you buy in a foreign country or in a foreign and by the end there we cheer ...\nThat's the kind of actually all know sailing thought just over property but there's also the currency turns auction and that may be considered very carefully you need to understand what's happening in your father's currency and planning ahead\nUnbearable special companies right now that you can work with to help here with about farming situation so they all are finding it to the left someone who will educated you are about things that\nInfluenced the currency extra insurance from other key indicators that are going to be published that might have an impact on the exchange and know how your corn how and when to change your money to that currency\nNo I understand there are companies that will walk in your ... ... to the changes you won't get stuck at the settlement table he's got real\nNo absolutely it's real and all I needed to located in the ... the ... for a period of time\nAll I Do is I I tend to spend a trade in my own\nAnd that looks and actually it looks in the exchange it for up to here so it's something for customers to think about not just when they're buying or selling but also when they're looking at cost of ownership you know when that thing that insurance premiums back home though fees that property taxes\nIf they can go into a year or whether they know that oh it's going to achieve their particular currency way back very reassuring for them in\nThe last question for Patricia yes one of our listeners wants to buy a house overseas with all your experience what's a number one piece of advice they must know before they go forward with it\nBuy a house overseas with all your experience what's the number one piece of advice they must know before they go forward with it\nRains here a local economy\nLove love love that it

you for a knockout let me know\nPatricia tan real chore and international sales director with the your global agents team at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida\nComing up on real estate today\nWhy an AR he's deeply involved in a global real estate so we're we're in the whole thing to raise the bar on real estate of an industry across the globe coming up on our special show going global\nBut first it's time for real knowledge\nOf special segment unrealistic today\nIn which we talk to in real estate professionals economist\nJournalist or industry expert and ask them about things you need to know about in right now we've all heard the economy of the United states is chugging along strongly I mean after all the GDP is up\nEmployment is up and we all know the stock market is way up\nAnd that's apparently causing the Federal Reserve to look closely at whether they should continue to raise interest rates if they do and you're in the market to buy a house how can that affect you look to ask a professional\nJoining us now is Lawrence June the chief economist of the national association of real tours Lawrence welcome to real estate today\nAt all the state and and as you alluded to a communist willing quite terrific guy in terms of GDP Growth uh in terms of job gains wages finally rising stock market is still way up there are so they're brought signed up the very positive economic picture\nA yet home sales because of a deal limiting inventory is being held back compared to what it could be and uh\nEconomic picture a yet home sales because of a deal limiting inventory uh it's being held back compared to what it could be\nAnd then of course Lawrence for all those positive reasons that the economy is so good the fed is raising interest rates do you think that's going to have any impact on buyers and the market in the months ahead\nWhen the Federal Reserve raises interest rates first we have to understand they are raising short term\nInterest rates and long term most consumers have thirty year fixed rate mortgage so or the mortgage rate may not move\nDirect relation with what the Federal Reserve maybe you're doing a less or some of the homeowners have the adjustable rate mortgages that it could change but fortunately over Ninety percent of recent homebuyers\nAre taking on those long term thirty year fixed rate mortgage so they would not feel the pain of any rising interest rates but\nTo consumers consumers who are looking to buy a maybe a mortgage rate will inch higher ed and overall forecast\nSays that I expect the mortgage rate to be trending higher maybe five percent average in the spring of next year from current four and a half and that is to not only to what the Federal Reserve is doing but the inflation is picking up and higher inflation generally are so means higher interest rate environment\nTo memorial I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about whether the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates and if they do what that might mean to our listeners thank you thank you Lawrence June the chief economist of the national association of realtors\nAbsolutely it's been my

currently fifty three degrees at you know Halle forty seven degrees in Prescott valley in Prescott right here in beautiful everybody's hometown it's forty seven degrees at\nThe news fourteen Ninety\nTo try to be forthright\nMe John ... [noise]\nWho wants a blowout and our rivalry game\nProbably the fans on either side of it because they want to win and they don't care by how much but for me as a selfish play by play a guy I Want to score a close eye on drama I Want that thrilling finish the Prescott Bradshaw melting delivered that last night\nYes last night was rivalry night on the gridiron a game heard white here on the news fourteen Ninety I Am one oh three point five FM ad on line and Kate why she ate out info\nIt looked like it was going to be a blow out early on as the badgers took a twenty seven lead over the bears and the first half\nBut then the red and black pat they came back a lot of it having to do with some great deception from quarterback Josh grand\n... I couldn't tell the number of times he fig giving the ball to Anthony ... only to keep it for himself and then run with it quite a few times for some good yard age including a touchdown so Bradshaw went into halftime up Twenty one twenty and during the broadcast my partner Cali quarters and I mentioned how\nThis was going to come down to the kicking game in Borneo board will we ever right about that Bryce Peter sent to bolster the up rights for field goals and the second half one of them from forty two yards out\nA the badger defense stood tall but on Bradshaw spinal drive they got inside the forty yard line in badger territory with modern making a run on forced into with little over a minute to go only to be stopped just before\nI was final drive they got inside the forty yard line in badger territory with modern making a run on fourth into with little over a minute to go only to be stopped just before he got that first down Austin Clark took a couple of nice by the way Austin Clark\nHad some turf toe issues\nBut there is a question of whether or not he might play in last night's game but the plate and he certainly did well so he was in their quarterback and are the two thousand Eighteen edition of Prescott versus Bradshaw melting concluded with a twenty six to Twenty one victory for the badgers they improved a five and to a more important we\nNow have a three you know record in the Grand Canyon region Bradshaw mounted meanwhile no longer on beat and they are now seven in one as they get set to face men get next week Prescott meanwhile got another long road trip better\nThan they are in Bullhead city next friday night they take on more hobbies a great game last night the kind of game that's fun to broadcast we're both teams are fighting tooth and nail for that when\nLike our biggest factors we can't beat ourselves I think especially in the Phoenix Games will be cells\nEspecially the last one I think we dominated the game except for two plays for five minutes I think if we can complete a whole Ninety game against them and not have those five minutes or ten minutes and where we slack off I don't think we lose that team I don't even think we should have lost his last two games then I think\nOut of the top four I think we still are the number one team in the conference it's just harder show with her record\nSo Tyler or one of the things we were talking about before we came on the air his you know we've been mentioning the top four teams you guys Pima, Arizona western uh Phoenix College but the ... it's not just those four teams because you were saying that you're on a lot of nights there ... teams out there that you really can't take a take for granted\nYeah there's um there's definitely a few teams in our comments like that um I think it just comes down to ourselves though and how we prepare for a match\nThere's um there's definitely a few teams in our comments like that\nUm I think it just comes down to ourselves though and how we prepare for a match or we can't come come into a game taking it lightly because\nThose are the games that you lose ... so it's good to have those teams in the conference because the challenges you to come in to every game mentally ready\nUm but at the end of the day if we show up and we play our game and we prepare mentally how we do for all the big games or we can take care of the other teams as well\nOkay so Andrew going back to last year you guys had I think Thirteen fourteen sophomores on the team is a really experience you have a bike college bunch that\nYou made it to the national tournament made it to the national semi finals this year I think there's only maybe five or six sophomores on the team including yourself so what what was it like you know having to you know kind of be the leaders for almost what was it a Fifteen or twenty a new freshmen players coming in\nYeah last year like you said we had Thirteen so it was a lot easier to transition because those practically just once off more than one freshmen\nAnd this year we only have six so a little bit more difficult but uh I think once we started playing together and we kind of started to much together and it wasn't that hard it was hard the first couple of days but once we just talked with them and talked\nAbout what we wanted to do during the season uh everyone really came together\nSo jail in one of those new freshmen in 'em and we were talking about this before he went on the air and uh I guess the the first few weeks for you were really eye opening weeks and maybe a bit of a culture shock or you're coming from high school I'm from the atmosphere you were in where you said you add a lot of really close friends around you to\nNow being completely on your own I guess trying to get used to the college life and a college in soccer\nYeah I'm ... from high school and college is very different experience especially if you have a strong support system back home are leaving that support system and trying to be on your own is a lot bigger challenge that I was going to be\nMentally more than is basically um so for anybody out there that wants to know I think that you should go to college thing and to make friends and\nHad as many people who you can have that support system and I have a lot of my teammates to thank for that now and my teammates or free minutes the ones who are keeping me not feeling alone all the time especially my closer ones I've come to know and care about\nSo I think that's the biggest culture shock to me\nIt's the ones who are keeping me not feeling alone all the time especially my closer ones I've come to know and care about so I think that's the biggest culture shock to me and especially I Hope I really hope that doesn't affect a lot of the energy many side effects me mhm okay\nSo so again Tyler uh what kind of progress have you seen a yellow by college make especially with so many freshmen on the team from uh they want to practice to where we are right now you know just what three weeks away from the end of the regular season\nYeah so the first thing that you can tell as the nervousness on the pitch\nAre coming in as a freshman you don't know exactly what to expect and I I experienced this myself I can speak rendered but I'm pretty sure it was the same for him um game after game you just get more experience you get acclimated to the college game you get comfortable with your teammates\nSo I think it just comes down to experience and being a comfortable in and these kinds of situations I guess so definitely there's been progress because there's not too many a sophomore starting\nSo the freshmen really had to take it upon themselves for us to win games they needed to\nGet acclimated to the team and the college game which I think they've done so\nOkay so Andrew are usually ... able to date or to play one or two preseason matches or this year guys run able to do that\nBecause you had a I think the alumni game you had that Dylan cancelled because of all lightning storms also you were supposed to play Irvine valley that was cancelled because of lightning storms\nStyle did that affect the way you guys are played at the start of the season because any of that so many new freshmen in there and they weren't able to at least get a couple of even exhibition games under their belts\nUh yeah so our whole preseason kind of went like that we we\nDon't even think had a pre season we probably had a couple of factors to the weather [laughter] but uh it definitely had an effect on our first couple of games uh like we said going up to Phoenix the first match when it's seen in the conference and just any team actually in this conference because it's probably one of his comments isn't a nation like you said\nSo that would that definitely at effect on us we just had to\nHonestly feel how we played in the first game and we have to go from there we didn't really have any practice time or anything to get ourselves ready for that [noise]\nWell in the studio with me today every one I ever got Andrew Rivera I've got jailing Atkinson and I've got\nWe didn't really have any practice time anything to get ourselves ready for that [noise] okay well in the studio with\nMe today every one I ever got Andrew Rivera I've got jailing Atkinson and I've got Tyler shrimp from the apple pie college soccer team\nAnd again just a few weeks away from the regular season ending and play offs beginning and you can bet you have a pie is going to be in the mix there and we should have another just absolute barn burner of and a double C. A. C. region won a playoff series here\nOr going to come up to a break here but before we do go to break it's time to see who's shined over the past seven days as we present the tragedy sports rounded up three stars of the week\nStarting with the ladies or number three star is Matty foster other Chino valley soccer team she recorded a hat trick in the lady cougars nine to one dumping of pasted on Thursday\nAnd number two stars Audrey Baldwin all the Embry riddle volleyball team she posted thirty eight assistant sixteen gigs and the lady eagles three to nothing sweep of antelope valley last Saturday and\nOur number one star of the week is Jordan Mose you're of the Bradshaw mountain volleyball team she was named the end V.

I didn't do provided baseball instead um and it wasn't my parents they know how to pick a sport it was just it got to the point where I was good at baseball is pretty good uh baseball and\nBasketball I was more like a ... I didn't shoot I could pass the [laughter] act passed in rent so I if I needed to make you laugh I could\nBut um when it came down things I got bored of baseball I thought I was too much standing around for me I didn't really enjoy it that much when it came down to thing so I quit when I was Thirteen and then I quit basketball after\nMiddle school and I just fell in love soccer I started club when I was ten and I've been playing ever since and I don't I have so much of thing for the sport\nSo Tyler what about you what got you interested in soccer\nUm [noise] my dad for sure he played keeper when he was little I ... it was kind of away from my dad and I to bond together in a way\nWhen I was little he you'd always ... he would he would come to feel me and he would shoot on me\nSo yeah I mean I guess it was my dad got me into it and then from there\nI had a really close friends he actually plays at Salt Lake community college we played them last year but when we were little ten eleven twelve we go out to this field and\nShoot back and forth on each other for hours so I just I fell in love with the game pretty early on in life and I played basketball a little bit but soccer's always been my thing\n[laughter]\nOkay so so Andrew if you had to pick maybe the most memorable game you've ever been a part of what\nThat be who I stumped 'em\nOkay so so Andrew if you had to pick maybe the most memorable game you've ever been a part of what would that\nBe who I stumped 'em I'll probably say it's how their junior college you'll say memorable and that might be shocking if you will but just the way that really summed up our season right there showed how we didn't quit\nUh we were down to zero it's a very good team queen do end up winning the championship but er it showed her law firm is a lot of character we're down to zero and we came back and fall for it to zero or to to tie\nWhen I'm going into overtime and\nWell that's another story but er yeah that one definitely you can say that one change my life ...\nOkay Jay how about your most memorable game you've ever been part of\nUm the most memorable game I've ever been part of was I think I was sixteen or Seventeen is one of my last club seasons before I went to the academy or we're playing a national cap\nAnd we play against a team in the group stage that haven't lost the game in two years that I've been tied the game and two years they won national temperature the national a championship for club the past few years and\nEven though it was a heartbreaking tie we're up one zero for Seventy nine minutes and twenty three seconds\nAnd they scored in the last thirty like thirty seven seconds of the game and it was it was so heartbreaking but it was probably the best game I've ever played and hardest game\n[laughter] so toilet how about you [laughter]\nWell the way we we uh we have a few was an antidote going on here or you know off like I guess it's a it's a dirty humor antics between this tree out [laughter]\n[laughter] it was a sophomore speaking on the freshmen here it's up where it was like oh yeah Tyler your most memorable game\nUm that's hard a jail in trying to give me back right now I think I think the most\nMemorable game I've ever played in was probably ... salt lake's training field or the Utah ... pie which is just like states away team we're playing ... salt lake's youth academy\nI'm I was probably Fifteen sixteen and I just remember playing one of the best games I've ever played ... academy scouting me from that game and I actually came down to ... ... they tried out for their team so it was just a good opportunity from that game had a really good\n... scouting me from that game and I actually came down to ... ... they tried out for their team so it was just a good opportunity from that game had a really good game it was cool to play in front of\nAll of these uh these\nFans wanting to see who's better that ... team or the best players in Utah so big crowd\nA lot of lot of high level\nCoaches so it was it was a fun to be a part of it [laughter]\nAnd by the way to jail and an injury are still trying to distract Tyler here as he was talking to a man
