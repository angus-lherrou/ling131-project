tips of what you can do to really keep your cravings at bay and do you stay in charge of your health way you can walk right by the break room and not get this extra calories in\nOn a regular basis so for for breakfast it's always good to get a protein and if you know that that's been kind of the\nThe new study that we've all been talking about in the health nutrition world so getting enough protein in at breakfast during his shaker smoothie I think is a great way to go so you get a good organic powder whey protein is really good uh organic protein is great too and it's more the vegetarian\nAnd you mix that with your berries you can do an almond milk or an sweet and coconut milk it puts a great breakfast together it's got a sweet and taste to it and you know to help you cut any kind of sweet cravings in the morning so when you get to work you won't really want to do that\nAnd don't forget a mid morning snack is great because it curbs off blood sugar level so you want to do some type of healthy fat almonds walnuts caches avocados whatever it might be\nAnd and make sure you get a\nYou know some type of maybe carbohydrate or lean protein couple of ... care something with you or another protein shake that's fine lunch and dinner though need to have a pretty big serving of vegetables we don't get enough vegetables everyday so eating enough of those can make a big difference\nIn your overall health so I don't encourage you to look at some of the dark leafy green spinach kale they all are great choices\nTo really help you get the right kind of nutrition that

there as well and keep something at work with you I mean only one great great tools everybody says well I forget or I get working or I don't have the food with me\nThose are all reasons why this happens well there's some great ways to actually do this so let me see what that is\nOne of the big keys and they want to look at keeps him nuts big bag of nuts almonds and mixed nuts whatever\nIn your desk just keep it right there at your desk leave them there don't take them back and forth ... higher chance of you not having something keeps them bottled water and probably have water machines and all that at work but make sure you keep nuts and fruit may be a big bag of apples\nSomething that you could Munch on and have a quick snack mid morning and afternoon that it won't disrupt your work pattern seeing kind of eat it within five minutes and get right back to work\nYou know there's just a great way to go and it cuts down and it manages your blood sugar a Mayo Clinic study showed

over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse\nThan um you expected and are we approaching perhaps a Nineteen sixty eight style a type of frenzy in the streets\nBut I think we bought or beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use\nThe most radical progressive movement\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country\nSo you have a guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money who basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh [noise] uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do [noise]\nUm you have now um bevy of organizations so you saw it and the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know to confront senators in elevators a with a CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't accidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it because this huge money behind it but they don't now instead they promote it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with that

looking at\nOf organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling\nOf this uh the star and the way he's addressed it has been health law has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on in the way I just laid it out to you and your listeners are just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have organizations that are in the shadows that people never\nHeard of I'll give you one color of change our it\nAnd you've got twenty of them and they take their orders from big money to radical left people All right\nThey say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted Senator Flake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nAnd so people think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's that's what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nAnd the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods\nAre there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a finger thing than a than a but we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause a George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editor to the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it um and I'll give you another\nFormulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it um and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was linked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they started that investigation which I Would order if I were president that\nScandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nNew one and we're all the windows are all lying by the way they were all lying\nTo mine a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them and\nWhatever it was ...

attorney general\nFor the ... the chief law enforcement officer advocate violence and it's it's ... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence a Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil with people who want to destroy your\nYour beliefs so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you hadn't Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she'll eat dinner for over\nYeah yeah yeah yeah from the let me giving in historical analogy if I may plays\nIs that in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges campuses world flame uh the radical up being funded by the KGB and the G R U which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more out of touch more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominee George McGovern who was a lunatic and who got creamed by Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two and it's so so the Democrats\nSwore that we're going to happen again so they they took ... re control of the party and and nominate a centrist Jimmy Carter that won the Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight\nVirtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left us a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time defeating in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because his mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was a Nineteen Seventy two\n... social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taken power this is part of the reason why the leftist so enraged

power and authority the Washington Post is a sad joke itself let's face it the New York times is set joke CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time\nI watched any programming on any of those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lowering them show and Fox News and to a news max and one American news and conservative talk radio and blogs and and so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite the repellent\nTheir marginal viewers Marshall readers merger listeners and sending them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more common class it at a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear common this storm don't you agree with that and\nDonald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change it or what he can but but one thing they do believe is is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than Brock a bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would've done he's got a chance to improve his standing\nAs as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can do to prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it is it pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go go back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer hum so many great books how Reagan dealt with the riots will play a bit of sound as if you miss the show last night let's listen\nTo those people who do four days in advance of the universities sought to head with that construction they were going to physically destroy the university\nHere in many of whom she what she said what is your season public institution that is right in the universe its own community in the community and Murphy the live around on\nThem and began the first time some of you know better and are old enough and\nThe two that are in the universe its own community and for the community and Murphy the live around on\nThem and began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they have the right to the law they say as long as they were doing in the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah ... what do you know construction he was talking about how\nThey were there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they laugh wanted to uh build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam you know the north Viet Cong soldier or something like that if it was completely\nOut of control it was just it was basically the left you know sticking with all the I's establishment is what it was all about but what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was\nHe said warmly ruthless than if you listen to ... and he says these professors somebody you're old enough and ought to know better you know the way he just dismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so you know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact that he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here ... which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions\nCan justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... ... it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of law is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up on ... tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... just a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political uh people but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the ... one of the Tea Party when they're dressed in period ... yeah and that's\nWhy the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left as that they\n... they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberals had a protest they must be one of the same no they're not want on the same motives has everything to do with it\nUsually they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberal side of protest they must be one of the same no they're not one of the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough\nRight as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well if you if you want to want to stand up for women in algae BT and all it then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nYeah but but that that may be upset this before the show I beg your pardon of a hat but the difference today between a moderate conservative leader Laurent concert a politician and a modern liberal politician is the liberal politician\nGoes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know\nBut it but moderate conservative and that's an emotional response because of you because liberals going to do with the good things for you a moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power so I may give it\nBack to you ... have to think about\nIt you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration that comes in is that it but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended it to be there in the first place\nAgain power to power to the people the ... tried to show up that slogan but they never really ... but\nThat's the that's the Latin basis for the republic\nPower to the people stays with them not submit some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a critic I Want to play one more thing

Eric Holder was talking about it my my fear is\nThat the that they knew mall what we saw on Saturday with the president Shockley righteously declaring dropped Kavanaugh's and us from the White House the my expectation was maybe the Democrats are looking at the mirror and say\nOkay we went to law but according to Eric Holder the worst is yet Rick I'm\nNow here's the puzzle tab that house look very favorable for the Democrats and that's what that's what you expect to pick up at the first midterm I'm a first Presidents Day as a first term of new president the Senate does not looked favorable for them that probably has to do with the cabinet story we've seen\nNumbers moving the Republican way in Nevada in\nIn Montana in Missouri in North Dakota in Arizona and we've seen numbers moved the intent of the ... the Republican way in the Senate but not in the house so\nI'm exasperated to understand why Eric Holder and also Mrs Clinton\nWould use language recommending not just the instability\nBut aggression aggression towards Republicans you win on election day you don't win intimidating people\nAnd this idea that you take it to the streets with paid or what looked to be a subsidized protesters that that's not the mark of somebody who has confidence that they're going to win at the back at the ballot box\nI it's just a function I I Believe and you're right or Hillary Clinton just said it alone but we don't we will behave ourselves off we win\nThat's not the American coal pack that's not any kind of social contract that I've ever heard of at least not in a representative democracy or republic so yes I I think it's very clear that this is just what happens when\nYou'll policies ... at the ballot box but you'd still be mom to be in power whether it's but it's much and innocent man so that you can maintain control of the Supreme Court to turn it into a law making body\nMom to be in power whether it's bits of merging innocent man so that you can maintain control of the Supreme Court to turn it into a law making body or whether it is doing the kinds of things we saw it on the streets of Washington D.C.'s\nI return to my Republicans\nTo say that violence is unacceptable\nViolent you win at the ballot box you don't win in the street you don't win by confronting people in the subway or at the coffee shop you win at the ballot box and anyone any Republican who thinks that violence is going to be successful is foolish I don't I don't want to I don't want to associate with them\nThat's a pretty simple thing to say and Mrs Clinton and Eric Holder could say\nYes but it's not our job you're absolutely right this has to come from the leaders of the Democratic party we have to hear this from the ... but they're not going to say it when you have the leading left wing media talking heads to saying\nWell it's not a mob really was being chased out of the restaurants are creating a situation where Iran at the polls wife mouse says she has to sleep with a loaded gun bio bedside and of course this is let's not forget whatever you think Rand Paul's politics\nThis is a man who was on the baseball field as James Hodgkinson a Bernie Saunders volunteer was firing his rifle and trying to kill all the Republicans Sharpie baseball game\nAnd almost succeeding in killing Representative Steve ... so you know there's only one side of the political landscape critters normalizing violence or allowing it\nTo be used as a tool without challenge and it happens to be the Democratic\nParty John finally have a little fun here at the end let's say positive Kanye West in the oval office today was what you can produce that that just got to happen that that was that was his turn right there at ...

appeared yesterday in response to a series of opinion pieces that had come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size of the army the air force in the navy\nAnd in fact these uh these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in investing in increased capabilities and the more high technology\nAnd my argument was that with strong civilian leadership we can do both and in fact we must\nSo the U.S military has a broader strategy of both attempting to preserve the peace that currently exist which requires that we have capacity to have presents and all the areas where we have interest while also increasing capabilities are so that we have a war winning capabilities when we need them\nAnd so the argument I make in here is it's possible to do both that's it's possible literally to walk and chew gum at the same time ah but I think that there's been sort of a series of false straw man that's been thrown out there\nThat attempt to say we either must do one or the other uh and I think there's some other political um you know arguments are in the background that money would be better spent in other areas or that the physical environment is getting to constrain with rising a debt and deficit but\nYou know we're in a great power competition and we either need to make

efforts was it was for Israeli civilians around Gaza Strip or say what\nAre you in Iraq Today Jonathan yeah today or according\nTo all assessments will be what we would call a regular friday of the violent riots they will be a participation in a thousand perhaps between a ten Fifteen thousand Palestinians that will come in to six regular locations\nThey will throw IDs resonates stones\nAt five bombs and the air rolled burning tires tools that sense that they will try with ever what ever they have in order to infiltrate into Israel\nOr ruin secure at the infrastructure and terrorize Israeli civilians that's what we've been dealing with every Friday and now it's friday number twenty six\nAnd ... and counting and uh so that's what's in store and the idea is ready and prepare than where I'm not going to let anyone in this time either and we are defending our communities which are just a few hundreds of meters away from the fence and for us it's very clear what what we have to do there\nAre the protestors the same each friday and are they compensated by the by the Hamas and others for for ... shown how this is an organized effort putting ... billion to ... trying to draw a

I'd say Hamas governments this\nThere was a daily schedule and daily locations uh of of riots we've for instance no without on Mondays there was always a naval riot or naval attempts to penetrate the injury as well in the same location every Monday and every Friday\nThere all the five permanent locations where they come we definitely see they even just now established Hamas established a website which comes in the riots claim that there are so called benefits\nAnd it's been report that even in a British media imagined that that the uh the parents are paid for participation and a double price if there was this a few hundred dollars\nAnd if they are killed during the riots and which Hamas actively seeks to happen if there are killed and their family is given the around a thousand five hundred dollars\nHave your response is that they were sponsored the IDF changed over time as well\n[noise] well the rules of engagement have not changed we the basics of the situation is that they're trying to get\nInto Israel onto a threat than he's writing civilians and communities and we are not going to let them and we of course have adapted we have tried different or less lethal means\nIn order to stop people without killing them and some of them have been successful some of them have the less successful so that was on evolution there as well but the basic some of the situation they unfortunately remain the same Hamas is sending\nForward what appears to be civilians award are made to look like\nThe ... you know to infiltrate the individual and we are stopping them and protecting

your understanding of the department of justice defying a the capital is this ... this is something to that justice can ... I can to itself explain indefinitely\nI think there's one person who can decide that John and that's the president and and let me explain\nWhy I think that so um you're quite right that if all that information were put out that is all this this written work product that whatever was a done contemporaneously to memorialize these conversations that wouldn't clear up\nThe mystery that we're discussing the problem of course is that not everybody has a motive to see that cleared up publicly there may be a number of people who do but I think there's a number of people don't and I fear that Mr Rosenstein maybe one of them and the reason that that is significant is that\nIf he's left to his own devices\nAre in terms of whether this ever gets disclose their not what I assume he would be saying is that because these are discussions between him\nHimself that is the deputy attorney general and chief counsel to the FBI and someone like Lisa Page was also an ... an attorney for the FBI\nThe only person that can break that log log jam or is the president because these these uh executive privileges belong to him\nOr to the extent as any attorney client privilege here ah I I I doubt there is but to the\nLong to him or to the extent as any attorney client privilege here ah I I I doubt there is but to the extent there is it belongs to the president if there's any executive privilege it belongs in President if there's any deliberative process\nPrivilege which is also a component of executive privilege it belongs to the president so I think until the president decides to waive all that and say put the information out I Would think that Rosenstein would it be taking the position that these are things that can be withheld and don't need to be disclosed Congress\nThaddeus [laughter] Andy mirror question whether these accusations\nAbout him are true or not an American you write out a ground requirement may be controlled and scar and why are they coming out now\n[noise] I think Thaddeus because Baker agreed to give a interview to the committee I you know in the Trump in the Trump or news cycle everything\nSo jumps together that I Can't remember now at this point if that was two weeks ago or one week ago but I Believe\nIt's probably a function of the fact that as we heard and we haven't seen transcripts or anything but as we've heard\nLisa Page testified some weeks back and according to people from the committee who talk and I should say we should underscore here they didn't leak her testimony but they did make an observation that she was very she seemed to be forthcoming in cooperative we\nStand there and all the questions that the quote Andy answered all the class is\nRight I ... now sometimes of course John answering all the questions doesn't necessarily mean that somebody's being cooperative but my understanding of the way that was a describes er of ms pages testimony\nOr is that that was the case that she answered all the questions in a good faith way that where she was trying to see if we ever get to see the interview notes the transcript and then Baker who I should underscore here\nUm that has a very fine\nReputation in terms of ah ah who is um integrity\nAnd his forthrightness um you can disagree with\nJudgment calls but uh\nYou know in terms of calling a spade a spade my understanding is that Baker has always been pretty upright or he gave a uh he gave an interview to the committee a week or two ago and I think that he is that that the the news coverage of vast coupled with this this uh\nTo the committee a week or two ago and I think that he is that that the the news coverage of that\nAre coupled with this is a big story this big article that came out in the New York times again a week or two ago that sort of a constellation of factors what has driven this into a public story\nWe're speaking with Andrew McCarthy of the national Review Online Thaddeus McCotter W.

we we've been meeting with Michel Martin and talking about what can we do in the city [noise]\nUm because we're no city you know where we're all of a hundred and fifty years oh we can't all of a sudden have all these you know multi pathways and everything but one of the things that we are as seriously thinking about as a city you mentioned somebody ... did you buy some before we need to teach people\nBoth sides of this and now this discussion but we're enemies lectures I drove the other day right by a whole group of people in tiny parkway bill every one of them had reflector sign some good minds linking line and it was a time when they were all blinking an ... was it was magnificent\nAnd but you know and and I notice most most cyclist or a ... bright colors\nSo we learned a lot about where we're actually think she'd have\nTo shovel days that's for sure absolutely and the helmets I you know I wouldn't dare go out there\nCyclist or or was aware and bright colors so we've learned a lot but we're we're actually think she is still sure absolutely and the helmets I you know I wouldn't dare go out there without a helmet I can remember\nThere was a couple of big things for cyclists wrote those two things to think about one you've got to be visible to ride predictable and so visible can be clothing it can be flashing lights\nIt's also where you're writing on the road if you hired ... hard way over to the right hand side of the road along the curb cars don't see because they're not looking for it and so for ... for ...\nPercent you're listening present you calling in to say you know and also I don't I don't know if people realize bill that when you pass a cyclist\n... you're supposed to be at least state law at least three feet from them that's exactly right and and so if you are with then are you brush next to them and they lose your your truly at fault\nSo that is true and and through the minimum really you know yeah it was actually one thing we learned and we didn't know the legal answer to it but some drivers don't seem like they want to necessarily across a double yellow line to go around a cyclist you're allowed to do that so you know in other words you don't need to get into that learned to be able to do that\nWell thank you for that mark shaking his head that no one is kind of funny because we we see that even on our committee you know cyclist and we have police a police officer there\nThat often and some of those areas gray\nAnd so a lot of it as common sense but I liked what you said about you have to be predictable people kind of need to know what they think you're you're only heard those words you're going to turn for you right and so you know we we just keep working at this I I Will tell the public and I and I'm pleased about this one of the things that we're going to do\nAs a committee is look at each and every incident each and every incident where is that what happened\nLet's talk to some people if we need to ah these meetings are

protests\nAnd they're at the courthouse and he said anybody you could not see you don't see someone you don't see the motorized scooters so\nEverybody and that's one of the issues we also talked about ears as we we do talk on this committee about\nThose folks that are on scooters and we're going to come back because we also had a call from Sherry Hannah and Sherry wanted us to talk about those\nMotorized bicycles poker yeah but you know up bicycle whether it's motorized or whatever it is it's a vehicle right it's considered a vehicle correct in state law so it it's like a car\nBut now you can utilize bike lanes though right under typically what the motor power is so you can utilize the bar grants or the roadway\nBut they have a right to take the lane as a car as a vehicle a bicycle

can take that gun and I'm going to tell you what with me behind that gun it may be a high risk gun when I'm behind it and from from my stem from my standpoint\nYou know it is what it is and then you and people and have mental illnesses and have things and they get a hold of a gun\nUnfortunately things happening and I and I pray for the people out there that doesn't happen to most folks but it's not the gun that kills the people it's the people behind the gun than are sick to kill the people\nAnd I couldn't agree with more on that topic I just took a little exception killer referring to an eight K. or an AR as being a high risk weapon because you know the ones that you can handle illegally\nI think I just took a little exception killer for an ... an eight K.
