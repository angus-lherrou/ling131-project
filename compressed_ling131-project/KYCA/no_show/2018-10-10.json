Steve\nBack to the city council meetings today we've got a lot going on and of course item be on the study session which is the discussion of a prohibition of using electronic devices while driving now this is an ordinance that was passed by the county board last week so what are you folks can discuss you know I think that that we're going to\nElectronic devices while driving now this is an ordinance that was passed by the county board last week so what are you folks going to discuss you know I think that that we're going to\nAsk the chief and the deputy chief just how hard this would be to enforce okay\nYou know I I don't want police every time they drive by somebody or somebody drives by them having to look over and see if they're using a handheld device\nWhat I Do want to do is I I Am totally in favor of getting rid of texting while driving the problem is is that I've also said I don't want to\nSupport an ordinance that and enforceable so that's what we're going to find out tomorrow whether this thing from a policing standpoint is enforceable and if if it is I'm totally in support of what the counties done\nOkay now if if for some reason I'm just saying this if it's not enforceable or if the chief believes that well maybe we need to do something different or it doesn't quite mirror what the county does or doesn't or you decide not to pass it at all\nHow hard is this going to be for some people because they pass in and out of county and city property all the time every day you do that yourself so I mean what ... what do you think of that do we have ordinances like that that happens you\nKnow I think that's when the county does something like that I think that it's it's it's\nIncumbent upon the city has to take a strong look at it because you don't want that situation where nobody knows what's going on where okay and what they have to what what what they have to do when they're in the county versus what they have to do in when they're in the city\nI just think that that it needs the conversation I think that the county was very passionate about their stand and I don't know where the other council members stand on this okay and uh I don't know where the city manager stands on this\nI Do know that we need to have all the facts and we need to talk to the professionals\nAnd you know I've actually talked to a couple of of officers about this situation well let's just say that that the jury's out in that situation okay they don't really know what they'll be able to do or\nWhat they will okay so the county ordinance goes into effect about November third or fourth somewhere in there and so the city has a little bit of time city has time and we're going to make sure that\nWhat we do is what we can enforce great okay so moving on to the uh regular agenda which the meeting starts at three o'clock and fortunately there's not\nWe do is what we can enforce great okay so moving on to the uh regular agenda which the meeting starts at three

agreement with you have a pi college on the northern Arizona regional training academy this is Arlen yeah ... isn't it important one\nThis is extremely important I think that our support him ... ... is going to allow them to continue to provide a higher level of of expertise to trainees\nAnd uh the way this came about was that there was a an officer from the from the county who was not able to fulfill the function at ...\nAnd so they asked if the city would step in and uh so uh the city is is more than happy to provide for you have a college I'm\nAn officer to uh help with the academy\nThat's great and all the help they can do for this academy and keep it going that's wonder if that's exactly right Okay Steve just a few moments left and I just wanted to touch on a

how you doing I'm living well what's up [noise] LA [laughter] haven't we [laughter] no matter what I have no matter what I Do [laughter] what about eight o'clock they had it\nAll right so no matter what you eat you always have asked reflux\nYeah what is your doctor said you put your own\nMind they will add on to a doctor\nWe've been taking power and hasn't been working for you now\nNot work it's not a kitten I have said Robyn me\nMe tell you the first things first a must share with used in natural things that can be very helpful okay\nBut I Do think you need to go see your primary care physician for at least one visit\nOkay it would be smart and just go and sit down and\nHave a little chat with them let them know what's going on let let them know the route that you've gone ahead and you know you can you blame the things we talk about and say I want to try this and then that way they can advise you and he'd probably going to say yeah no problem try that and if you need me I'll be here but at least you can get them\nTo hear everything you've been going they documented and it can go in your chart I think that's a smart thing to do if it was me that's what I Would do that\nSo let's talk about acid reflux talked about what it is and what causes it because a lot of people really struggle with I mean you're you're not the only ones for sure but then they feel like you are is just drives me crazy but the prospect supposedly would work however it's an antacid basically how it works\nSure but then they feel like you are because it's just drives me crazy\nBut the prospect supposedly wouldn't work however it's an antacid basically how it works it reduces the bus to reduced asked well here's the challenge and this is why doesn't work is because what we actually have found is that most people don't or most people don't have enough\nHide your core cast it in the stomach due to stress levels due to so many different factors that they don't have enough the acid in the stomach\nAnd so you take something like a ... you know a promise to act or proton pumping editor and it cuts down on the acid even more so now you eat a meal say you have a stake and some vegetables well we need to hide your core cast of going to break down or proteins but if you already don't have enough and then take a prosthetic\nThen it's going to make things worse and that's why you're taking it and you don't feel any better\nSo what needs to happen is actually need to do something to stimulate their drive up that hard to forecast said within the stomach and my drumming up and and raising the bar on that hard to forecast that that's what's going to help more than anything and one of the best way to do that you can use apple cider vinegar\nA little test I'll tell you a little home test with apple cider vinegar is is\nWith the meal wouldn't eat your meal and take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar if burning and your stomach goes away and it means you did not have enough acid in your stomach\nIf you take the ... the apple cider vinegar with your meal and it burns even worst then you're one of the few that actually did have too much as it but I don't think it's gonna be the case with you at all so a couple of things to look into as you're you're looking at this but it's it's interesting for sure and\nIt's something that many people struggle with an oath like are the only one but yeah the opposite of your worst now there are some supplements that you can look at your health food store and certain supplements that worked very well would be number one\nThe

put a twenty dollar bottles cod liver oil and may probably not because you you they\nAnd you didn't pay a little bit more for that it just is what it is\nNow what I put a twelve dollar bottle of cod liver oil and may probably not\nBecause you they there's no way to guarantee that it's mercury free that it doesn't have some form of mercury in there which most fish oils do\nAnd the right kind of vitamin D like you're talking about that kind of stuff matters because you want it to absorb properly you want to digest properly and you want to use I mean when I take a tablespoon cod liver oil for example and I do it every day\nI Want to make sure that I'm going to absorb at least Ninety percent of it I mean you're always going to waste out some guy but I I Would rather pay a little bit extra knowing owners or Ninety percent of what I'm going to take in versus\nGetting a cheaper version and you only use thirty percent of it because a lot has pillars in excess of mercury and\nAll those different things\nSo that's kinda my take on it I I always would spend a little bit extra to get the better quality and I would always stick with that in order to natural skip brand\nAnd when he named

I\nJust made up someone else's probably said that but I Swear I didn't hear anyone else and [noise] well Ted Cruz's Martin alpha guy\nBeta ... more of a beta man\nAre they doing beta max like all sorts of jokes with him and they like James or something Robert right and then we all ... it's cool it's like Obama but rock instead of Barry I mean you got it sounds cooler than you are\nOh it's an hour to DWI what was that he was in trouble for DWI or\nSome some minor minor ... I don't know what it was the other high jinx guys who can't hold people accountable for things they do in their\nTwenties I mean things they do in their Seventeen yes but things you do in your twenties and no no no no that does come on baby do is just he's made no you can't hold them to any other\nThe standard who can't do it his real first name is Robert Francis they'll get Robert Francis\nO'Rourke ... can't get more Irish\nSo but if they do\nKnow that he was called that as a baby or a little boy I guess and then it stuck\nLike called deem a demon dog but I'm when he when he was like for a promotion I'm not that he's not going to say well the dog is running like I when I see the matrix it has a dog doing is nicknamed the demon dog so we've come\nDog [laughter]\nLike I when I see the matrix it has a dog doing is nicknamed the demon dog so we've come dog\nThere he's not going to say OK calming dog 'cause that's what my mother called me write about what he's going to do\nYou're listening to the lower income show eight five five forty Laura but I'd say last night my\nI felt it at the White House with the the energy of the people the energy of the old establishment even like Mitch McConnell I've never seen Mitch McConnell more happy in my entire life ever never seen him smile like this I've never seen him better than he has been over the last three weeks never seen Lindsey Graham better and you know why\nThey're doing what the people want and they're United with the president that is a good thing\nThat's great keeping up at the time to praise people when they deserve it and they deserve it\nWhat I think this is going for us is ... drilling Shaw we've not been able to figure out how to achieve and it was\nWe were literally hunger ... old ... trying to get in our ... our homes over who ...\nWell that's it that's by the way that's Mitch sounding excited\nAbout him on a journalist ... and he's been yeah that's what he's on an adrenalin rush that's I always found maybe Nikki Haley just a guy had an allergic reaction to that little ear cup they put on her ear for the translation simultaneous translation they wouldn't provide her with a high bar allergenic or air cup so she has to just\nI really think it's time for someone else well here's a story I was talking about earlier Trump Administration disowned say Nikki Haley's plan for a un meeting on Iran\nThis was ... September seventeenth during the cabin are crush\nTrump Administration is disarming a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies civil\nLaw in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from in may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to do this to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward and contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran seems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay there\n\nDid you ever look at the stains and your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to your teeth power swamps is the five minutes solution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist this is John Green the c._e._o. of her swaps and if your teeth or Spain from coffee tea or smoking all it takes is five minutes with power swabs in\nFive minutes you'll see an average of two shades wider cheap and seven days six shapes its clinically proven to white natural to you as well as caps Anthony years the secret is it to the church and that was developed by\nDr Martin ... that live stains off of your teeth best of all there is no matter if you strip search trees that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just rub your teeth for five minutes and you're done to Dr parents rubs risk free call one eight hundred\nThat's a really interesting thought okay I don't know what she just said we played a shorter version of it on TV Now wishing we played the whole thing because it's funnier\nCan you can you can you using her phrase can we segment some of the James so I can listen to it again I mean I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept enough maybe I'm just a little tired last night was a big night\nNo it was a very I mean\nI'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night\nNo it was a very I mean\nI'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night and we were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped Brett was there all the justices were there everybody was there who you know who who really\nWas instrumental in helping the nomination this confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody but maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the brilliant and incisive logic of costs the court as well\nI think a lot of it happening to changing our strategy around with her hand you know there's a lot of high baseball and inside the beltway as you know you really say that term thrown around\n...\n... these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategy is inside baseball\nI'm a forgive me but she at least from what I've heard she seemed like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person\nShe got people to go out and vote vote for her she probably a nice person I don't understand what she's saying we need more organizers okay you'll be in government [laughter] you will be in there\nBut you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay on top of the u._s. understanding\nAs it has to be like\nAll abortion all gender fluidity higher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalize drugs pot all\nAll of it has to be fully sit on the American people [noise] so like Obama she never really will leave the organizing world\nThere are various ... organizers and Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy\nYeah they they they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things like the Supreme Court big brats door\nThat Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did so last night on the angle every time I ticked off a Trump agenda item winning agenda item Everytime I did that we put\nIn our history to understand why this is so important to preserve our country you really do have to understand why how it was so hard to found to this country the American founding against all odds we founded this great republic\nIn the term rent tremendous sacrifice\nOf our framers the original are signatories of our constitution great sacrifice they meant\nBut if you don't understand any of that then you kinda\nJust arrived here in America ... you can make money here boys is so great\nCan make money in China make money and you know Qatar who made\nMoney a lot of places and why is this place so great why is it why is it special so we can see what we saw over the weekend\nProtesters fine ... protest is is is ... welcome under our First Amendment I'm Talking about the way you protest but whether it's a dignified or undignified\nI mean we're not seeing a lot of Rosa Parks out there today we're not seeing the classic non violent classy way of protesting this is a ... approach to protest\nTo run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that this rule said there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated so what is going on is what happens yeah because ... and all that and this has come forth in our country\nShe went to the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez school of logic apparently or\nHer on her own went to hers are Alexandria went to her own knows I Can't tell which so in other words Mazie Hirono God help you in Hawaii Mazie Hirono wants more of this people people are upset\nThat I keep saying this but I'm going to say it again imagine if conservative activists\nCornered Kamala Harris James imagine what would happen Kamala Harris gets cornered in an elevator with conservatives pointing and screaming at her and she's she's backed up into the corner of an elevator imagined what they would say what's on the left what do\nThey say it was anti women it was intimidating it was harassment\nThey would claim that all Republicans who didn't denounce that type of\nThey would say it was anti women it was intimidating it was harassment\nThey want to claim that all Republicans who didn't announce that type of\nOf a a behavior and conduct that you were anti women and it would be a thousand percent Trump's fault it would be you know you think you'll be all Trump's fault in this case why don't we hold Democrat leaders are responsible for these type of protest they shouldn't be held responsible they're not condemning it\nAnd and they had their moment where they said well maybe Maxine Waters one a little too far that lasted for like five milliseconds but they hold Trump responsible for Charlottesville I say they are responsible the Democrat leadership are responsible for the less the is running the asylum\nIn these protests and teeth and all of it\nEight five five forty Laura will take a break a lot more to get to Nikki Haley resigns as

retire or something like that and she uh now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought\nYeah Bill Maher and everyone on late night and all the news outlets and MSNBC and CNN\nIt's it's weird that hey it's it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the news you and Hannity and Tucker in a handful of other people excluded or the exception but\nAlmost everyone on your side and you're claiming we have no voices on our side\nIt's interesting and then also here's how effective it is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young twenty five I mean you know thirty five and one one of the guys who worked with me who's an intelligent enough guy\nSays to me yesterday as it pertains to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't\nGet it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy and get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the past it just get a guy in there with you know a clean record and move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage\nAll the stuff that got hooked up in the eleventh hour ... all this stuff that wasn't substantiate it all and said allegations from high school they're going through in your book I said where do you think that would do to that but he literally thought well just get a new guy in there and then he'll get a fair shake it and will move forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh\nOther animals I think a lot of the guys who ran against Trump and the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary how many of them was stuck it out\nProbably drop Kavanaugh um\nAny other animals I think of other guys who ran against Trump in the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary\nHow many of them would have stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of Trump knew that this was something you could not backed down from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam though and we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen\nWho is a good guy who just watches CNN and MSNBC NBC and that's where he gets as information and he legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with capital mhm and that's\nTo me where the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches NBC and MSNBC and CNN and it gets old information and\nIt's all going through the filter\nAnd so ... what choice but draw these conclusions she could no it couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your

for a now associate justice Brett Kavanaugh was partisanship bare knuckle partisanship and it continues here Gregory we're waiting for you to come home and experience to\n[laughter] is what I've been watching it a a ... minute by minute\nA and look it's no different here where we're seeing a lot of um a constitutional monarchy is Canada Australia and the like are becoming more presidential in

think we're seeing a swing away from that which is positive\nOr an ... is the answer is shooting thing although Trump or was nominally Republican or he attempted to come in as someone who represented the historical interest of\nThe United states the which is the balance nation state\nWhich has been forgotten essentially since World War two mountain state to state uh became basically the urban

M A s two of those are are producing as we speak\nThat Nichols ranch I in Wyoming a ... white Mesa in Utah and also may say in Texas\nYes the only one that's on standby is all tomatoes in Texas\nAnd you have uranium mines around these production facility so how does it physically work I've never visited a uranium mine mine and new truck and where does it go\nWell we we we have um the the three production sitters or or or have ... different is that a couple of ways to\nMine and new truck and where does it go\nWell we we we have um the the three production centers are are are have are different is that a couple of ways that we have conventional facilities where you actually physically mine drilling blast the the the or\nI'm transported to the processing facility in this case is white Mason mail where it's conventionally processed um which is crushing grinding and chemical extracting uranium Orban ATM but than our project in Wyoming and in Texas are called is set to recovery and it's such a recovery is where you actually\nDissolve the uranium in place in the ground you actually don't physically mine is so so they're they're two different methodologies and about half the uranium the United states is in in in the world actually is mind by both methods so about fifty percent is either conventional or in situ recovery\nAnd your company's doing very well and people can participate but there's a lot but the\nBody as how much does the United states need in uranium and how much does the U.S produce and where do we get it\nYeah well the um United States the largest consumer uranium the world are between power generation which was about twenty percent of our electric power in the United states\nAnd then you have the nuclear navy hum my a\nCalculation we consume about one third of the total uranium consumed in in the world\nUm but but just for power generation alone because he actually use for the military has classified\nUm but for power generation alone we consume about fifty million pounds of uranium per year for power generation now currently a worldly mining a a ... percent of our requirements which is a shocking shortfall\nBecause arrested that's coming in from imports\nAre from both our allies but also from a number of a former or a communist countries you know like the ... or Russia or in Kazakhstan or its allies and um he was Pakistan and even China so um that is why we filed a section two thirty to petition to limit\nThe importance of uranium primarily from our allies with a former Soviet Union\nLet me restate that if I understand this doesn't sound commonsense ago we're importing the uranium we need for our nuclear plants and our nuclear fleet we're importing it from Russia and from China\nOr inlet changed that tells me our supply chain\nNuclear plants and our nuclear fleet we're importing it from Russia and from China\nOr inlet changed that tells me our supply chain is in the hands of our phone is correct\n[noise] well yeah I mean that's that's the point of our petition is is the United states the United states as the largest consumer of uranium in the world um is is are we ready to\nTurn over the reins to um you know to those countries you know I I don't\nKnow the answer is no mark we're not we're not ... you're not asking hard questions [laughter] okay fine\nBut before we we look into your a conversation with the Trump Administration and the department of commerce as to what we'd have to say as a missed pricing of uranium uh what is ... what do we use it for\n... is is primarily used as an hour away I'm for steel hardening\nBut it is also currently getting additional I'm a demands on it from a an idiom flow batteries for renewable energy storage\nAnd you mind ... at the white may ... and a white Mesa mail is that where you process in\n... well yeah we we process it there and we're starting to recover of an ATM uh we'll start in ... in November of this year to start a produce even ate him again we we last produced an ATM in two thousand Thirteen\nAh we actually mine the ore are in the surrounding mines and the district and we transport it by truck as I mentioned earlier but this initial campaign were actually recover even avium that is in solution or ... or ... facilities that are holding pond so we're very excited about this\nIs the demand for an ATM climbing\nOr the demand is climbing a quite substantially probably six seven percent per year\nAnd um the price of an ATM has increased from\nA brown four or five six dollars per pound to three years ago up to north at twenty dollars per pound so um it's you hear a lot of talk about the battery elements hum metals a you know like lithium graphite\nCobalt or will the navy I Am a is sort of the next to the queuing it comes from an energy renewable energy storage a type of metal\nOr but still at this they currently the largest consumption is for our voice and and there's currently a a\nA type of metal or but still at this they currently the largest consumption is for our voice and and ah there's currently a a news owning a in China this requiring the rebar uh to be a certain strength and it's very difficult to achieve\nThat without using that ATM so there's a new source of demand which is the rebar and the ... and flow batteries\nBack to your conversation with the Trump Administration about uranium we need much more uranium than the United states is now producing your the number one producer of uranium in the country so what can be done what is the department of commerce I'm looking into what is the investigation tell us\nWell we we we follow the petition and and we are asked for two things we asked for a quota another tariff but a quota\nThat the United states should produced at least twenty five percent of the requirements are from domestic sources to allow enough critical mass so that we actually have a uranium mining industry sustainable in the United states\nWe also asked for by American uranium and and you know the the administration has his you know by American\nOr in the first place so that fits in nicely with with our request so\nUh but it's such it's a quota and it's a buy America uranium and the key here is to maintain a healthy a front and the fuel cycle that does not put us dependent on\nA ... for a source of uranium primarily from these uh uh you know countries that are associated with former Soviet Union\nAnd mark or we just we have less than a minute here uh do do are follows China and Russia did they subsidize their uranium industry in order to out compete\n... yes I Do I mean the the Russia and China and they have national programs that support the nuclear fuel cycle\nAnd the United say she used to but it no longer has that so that's why it's so important right now because if if if we allow the nuclear fuel cycle to completely go away and the United states ah countries like Russia and China are not going to lead there's go way they're going to continue to dance for\nMark ... is the c._e._o. of energy fuels and traded publicly more to the point the Trump Administration has the conversation started about how it is that we're buying uranium from\nFeel the energy fuels it's traded publicly more to the point the Trump Administration has the conversation started about how it is that we're buying uranium from Russia and China\nI'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nI Do not know how\nThe president can decide this budget Rush Limbaugh this budget is designed to make Trump voters think the Trump presidency is irrelevant this budget is designed\nTo make Trump voters could include you know what there isn't going to be a wall and there isn't going to be getting serious and immigration and so having Trump the

picked\nA A R U is is a power game and they liked to control the names of every Boulder in the universe and they don't really have that right and eventually that's going to dissolve away people in space will use the names that he's astronaut picked without question\nMay texted Vandenberg why Bob what what do they need Benedict for\nWell they need to space Vandenberg state even more than one to space sports but they need Vandenberg right now is because you really cannot do solo synchronous all these orbits around the polls from Kennedy because you'd have to fly over\nPopulated territory and the west coast space sport has been used by ... literally for a half century by the military and private enterprise to get satellites into a polar orbit\nAnd so now SpaceX has been flying out of vending machine for years but this past weekend they had their first successful launch from Vandenberg\nBut when they landed the first stage on land at Vandenberg they built a land landing site literally right next to the launch pad literally within sight within fifty four hundred two hundred yards of it and they brought that uh that first stage back it was a block five first age which is the first\nThat their final iteration whoa this is that goal that they get it to land right next to launch pad they can turn it around and maybe launch within twenty four hours that's their goal and so they had that success it's part of the ... and you know the races SpaceX keeps moving forward job it's a it's a sign for the future\nNot a delay and they'll ask why do these things seem familiar\nIt's an endless story well there's a there's an Inside Story that is not confirmed yet that I Want to add to this a few last year Congress gave Nasser extra money to fly extra emissions of an interim upper stage\nFor sale essay would not produce as much a past powerful rocket but it would allow them to fly a few missions they needed to fly\n'em up before before they have the final iteration of the most powerful upper stage well it appears now they're slowing down development on that at upper stage that final upper stage and they're putting more money and do the scheduling low launches we the interim upper stage which isn't as powerful\nAnd it there is even hands that they are going to discontinue work on that more powerful upper stage this is only after maybe five years\nWe the interim upper stage which isn't as powerful and it there is even hands that they are going to discontinue work on that more powerful upper stage this is only after maybe five years of work on that more powerful upper stage spending lots and lots of money and they've just decided that can't afford to build it so they'll go with the cheap a small stage\nThere is so high on the road put this up on behind the black and they quote the vice president and program manager of space launch system for Boeing and he makes this statement\nI'm a there has been a slow down on the exploration upper stage work\nHe also said that uh we under estimated quote the timeframe involved somewhat and I call that probably the biggest understatement ever in the universe because SOS has been basically under construction since ... for in some iteration or another and it's not going to launch its first manned mission until\nTwenty twenty three and it won't even be with the most powerful rocket\nSo we have a commercial crew news as well Bob is this also disappointing\nDisappointing but it's not as a absurd\nAn ad for this week released an updated scheduled for the dragon install lying a test flights these are the cap privately built capsules to bring people to I assessed and that meant space X headed the way it's first\nManned test flight until June ... they didn't\nGet the ... the time between the two missions is the same show it was just because the schedule essentially at I assessed they had to delay it and a Boeing schedule pretty much stays the same so there's been a slight delay that won't be any commercial crew launches this year but with that right now it looks very clear that they're going to all be happening next year\nI'm a ... says we're now going to be giving updates on schedule on a much more frequent basis because we're really firming things up for example the Boeing flights\nThey'd give very rough uh proximate periods like mid twenties Nineteen denouncing clearly the first unmanned to in March twenty Nineteen and the first flight manned flight in August twenty Nineteen so they really from the schedules up we should look at the basics first unmanned in January Boeing's first unmanned in March\nA space sex first manned in June and then Boeing may end in August every other month is like the Gemini program back in the Nineteen sixties it'll be very exciting\nYear just to cost the base for had corner so we have two different directions Bob what how they're going to settle this tug of war team that's going to show up and then\nBasis for headquarter so we have two different directions Bob what how they're going to settle this is there a tug of war team that's going to show up and\nTurf war within the bureaucracy um you know Trump is pushing for a new space for us and so the military bureaucracy is putting forth all kinds of falls about what they should do [noise] um\n[noise] I'm not sure even plan is a good while on both of the one of them from the agency that from the military itself suggests creating an agency that they say a smaller\nAnd will be more lean Mike Griffin who is form and that sort of straight who's now been\nPut in a on our secretary of defense for research and engineering my ... yes and\nHe was basically fit into the space area hit the supposed to be there to deal with military space he's proposing a different idea which would create a new space agency for the military with the staff of a hundred and twelve people\nAnd I have to say when reading just the initial report it seemed like his was more bloated than the other I'm not sure which is right I'm the one thing that Griffin was doing that the military proposed\nHair foreigners that Harry Heather Wilson now as well to\nThat she's in charge so Griffin was pushing more the trip to trends transition the military to using private commercial assets rather than building that's all and uh\nBut his apparent loved to build his own empire here might work against that goal I'm not sure which works I I once again my real reservations about the space forces that I'm worried it's going to just turn into a a big bureaucracy that won't really accomplish very much they just simply need to consolidate the offs and\nBobby you're not thinking about we need our space uniforms we need patches we'd all the merchandise we need all the things you're trying to bypass Bob it's Washington they only build empires that's what they do\nI Know this is the tragedy that's why I have reservations about the whole idea I'm not sure they're going to the the people who work in Washington to my mind the bureaucrats they're all very little interested in the national interest nowadays the only thing they seem to be interested in it appears to me is their own agency interests\nAnd they read as a national interest can go to Bob Bob\nYou know I I have to get that uniform and the patch and so if they need to build an empire to get to it All right fine we go now to China because there's news on Chang eat for this is the next lunar is this the far side of the ...\nYes this is the land that's going to go on the far side of the moon in this

to actually a pretty firmly tentatively that that sounds weird uh sometime in December the key is that they've got three launches for the same space bought to do other things prior to it and if anything goes wrong in any of those launches that will delight Chang eat for but right now they're set\nTo land on the far side of the mood some launched sometime in December and that will and some

specifically district for which is where Prescott Prescott valley Chino valley\nPretty much everybody who's listening to us I'm On the radio is part of district for so good morning David how are you I'm great thanks for having me absolutely thank you for taking the time to join us and talk about some of the issues that are out there and tell us a little bit about yourself and what you are hoping to accomplish if you're elected\nA let's talk for a minute about district for its huge\n[noise] it's almost a quarter of Arizona I'm looking at the map you're reaching down into Yuma I mean there's some areas that are just tremendous\nThe whole Colorado River border with California and then it comes down through wiccan Bergen County and then it wraps to the west the north and the east to Phoenix down to a gold canyon and Florence\nWell a little bit later we're going to talk about how to continue to have outreach and be able to touch all of the different corners of such a large district both in a campaign but also um if you're elected how that would continue first of all tell us a little bit about yourself some of your background and what brought you to Prescott, Arizona [noise]\nAh I was in high school history teacher before I became a doctor and once I got on the path of becoming a doctor\nUm a couple of businesses came well I ... I found that three small businesses as a things came my way so the first one was hazardous chemicals data management the second one was health care and the third one was a diagnostic\nI found that three small businesses as a things came my way so the first one was hazardous chemicals data management the second one was health care and the third one was a diagnostic biotech where every seven million bucks to get that company going [noise] so yeah I'm a teacher a doctor and a businessman\nFantastic so what made you decide to run for Congress [noise]\nWell I've just been ... I've I was working at the gate for the last ten years serving veterans and by the way my son has a navy special forces so I I care a whole lot about how veterans transition out of a out of the military and civilian life and what kind of healthcare they're going to have for the rest of their lives [noise]\nBut uh I've been watching where the ... district in the country are going for the past years and at one point I just decided to get off the off the sidelines and into the fray\nWonderful so right now roughly in the district there's about seven hundred and fifty thousand residents I'm In the primaries we had roughly a hundred and forty thousand a hundred and thirty two hundred and forty thousand voters pretty small turnout for such high population count well\nAnother great idea he had was get the um visas out of the department of labor which you know just puts a lot of a lot of a red tape on them\nAnd move them over to the department of agriculture which for agricultural visas I think makes a lot of sense make it easier for the you know for the growers to get to their people across the border and get them home [noise]\nI think those are both good ideas do you support amnesty for those that are already here I support for the I don't want to I'm not sure I'd call amnesty but for DACA you know children who did not come across the border voluntarily\nI certainly support it for them their net contributors to our society big time and they are sending them to another country we'd be shooting ourselves in the foot because they are going to contribute billions of dollars dark\nThe contributors to our society big time and they are sending them to another country\nWe'd be shooting ourselves in the foot because they are going to contribute billions of dollars to our economy in their lives and you know they've served in the military that creative businesses they've gone to school we've invested in them let's uh let's stick with our investment I Am a businessman after all\nSome people have called for the dissolution of ice immigration and Customs Enforcement your thoughts no\nI'm not for that uh that said you know there are two parts of ice and I think one part really needs some big a reform and the other dozens but ah you know but I'm not for the dissolution of ice and yes I've worked at the VA for ten years and I know how hard it is to [noise]\nUm shall we say transform a federal agency it's um it's a lot of work it's challenging but no I don't I don't support or eliminating eyes\nLet's talk about dark money for a minute this is a topic that seems to be coming up more and more on both sides of the aisle are right now we're seeing it in\nSome of the ballot propositions we're seeing it in the Senate race a there's a lot of outside money coming in what are your thoughts about dark money\nI'd like to get all big money out of politics we are wasting our treasure on this and these ads that are you know all over the airwaves [noise]\nReally [noise] ah I think we're all tired of them I'd love to get money out of politics and I'm not just talking dark and dirty money I'm Talking\nLots of money I really want our politics to go back to the people not to corporations and billionaires who right now can give unlimited amounts and and you know have it pretty much laundered by you know taking it through ... organization after organization so nobody knows who gave the money and what's what the you know what they're doing with it [noise]\nSo the federal election commission requires you to report a income and expenditures for your campaign that information is available online however they lag behind just a little bit out of it when I was doing some research yesterday how they were talking about the August reporting period and so\nOdd to date you have not received any funding from the DNC\nWe've not ... is this is simple answer we haven't gotten any money from any ah corporate organization other than um let's see Democrats as the a red room rock\nAnd a another congressional um leadership fund Fifteen hundred dollars [noise] those are the only in donations that we've reached\nThe the a red room rock and a another congressional um leadership fund Fifteen hundred dollars [noise] those are the only and donations that we've received from any kind of a um it's not a corporate entity but any kind of organization the rest of all been individual donations period\nTime let's talk about health care and this is one that we won't be able to get through all the way before the bottom of the hour break but on your website you talk a lot about um being able for Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies directly let's talk about that yeah that's I I Am I\nSo dedicated to that down to my toes and here's why I've worked with a VA for ten years\nAnd in the last years I was rising through management because my prior prior business experience and you know doing those three companies I talked about and being a medical director at a missile in North America a fortune five hundred company [noise]\nI've watched the pharmaceutical companies pleased to be a I've watched to send boatloads of money to the pharmaceutical companies for overpriced medications and then cut services to veterans and I think most people can probably hear\nThe anger in my voice [noise] it is just wrong no other country let's the pharmaceutical companies set their own prices and no other country you know with a large organization like Medicare\nPuts handcuffs on the organization so they can't negotiate on price with a pharmaceutical company really we call that capitalism where you know somebody who's paying money can't negotiate [noise]\nThis is crazy Medicare needs to be able to negotiate on price for the pharmaceutical companies and that's one of the first things I Will do on getting to Congress we all know that Congress has bought and paid for on this issue\nThe two that got the most money from pharmaceutical companies in twenty sixteen were named Donald and Hillary\nThey each got close to a million dollars and when I'm you know our president rolled out just pharmaceutical package a few months ago he didn't include it though he said he do that in his campaign promises\nI can only be a um a voice in the wilderness in Congress to lead to Medicare negotiate on price of the pharmaceutical companies to import medications from Canada\nUntil we get it right because they're safe and effective and they're made by the same manufacturers that we have an to claw back billions of dollars from the opioid manufacturers who ... who said that their products were not addicting\nSo our congressmen has been in ...\nOh back billions of dollars from the opioid manufacturers who ... who said that their products were not addicting so our congressmen has been in ... in office for eight years he calls himself a health care provider\nIf he wanted to provide healthcare to our people he would have started taking on the pharmaceutical overcharging he's been in Congress eight years and he hasn't lifted a finger on any of those things that I just talked about it's time for him to go his time is up\nSo let's talk about\nThe the\nPlausibility of change with the stagnation and Congress the partisanship\nIf he were elected and you go back there now you said you'd be a voice in the wilderness because as you put it Congress has bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies how can you be effective in pushing legislation to change these types of policies [noise]\nMy dad was a minister and he worked um yeah I've told them a lot of people on Monday morning she'd get together with other ministers priests rabbis in the area and they would talk about different paths to God\nAnd their flocks in what's going on in the community and I as a kid you know really enjoyed those and that's pretty much the way I've lived my life ever since [noise]\nIt's gonna be hard there's no question about it you got party leadership on both sides that are going to try to whip the or they're you know their uh their party members into line for party line votes\nI hate to say it but I think party line votes are mostly bad for the country we need boats where people are where we are getting the center involved and people are going across party lines so that we have sensible legislation instead of one which is just\nA real victory for one party and a failure for the other we need to we need to share this which is standard and business association so there's no question in my mind this is going to be a one to one process of building relationships with people who are reasonable and building those relationships across the aisle with [noise]\nWith the people in all parties and I'm Glad to do that but I Know it's going to be it's going to take a lot of one on work one on one work sitting down and saying hey I Want to sponsor this will you help me sponsor it I'll help you with this you know and so on and so forth that doesn't happen in Congress much anymore and that's what I'm going to be doing\nSo I think one of the challenges that I see is that you have to pick and choose your battles there because you can go in and say well here's the fifty things I Want to do but they're ...\nI see is that you have to pick and choose your battles there Jeff because you can go in and say well here's the fifty things I Want to do\nBut there may be one or two of them where there is actually the potential to accomplish something up and with short election cycles every two years now um it makes it challenging to accomplish those goals\nOh no question um it would be I think it would be smart for Congress to have a longer terms and we especially hate the idea that Congress a Congress member spend half of their time while in Washington fundraising\nInstead of paying attention to our business which is what we're paying them to do we're paying them to fundraise that to me is crazy [noise]\nBut everybody knows me I've been a businessman for decades\nEverybody knows me knows that I prioritize like crazy and that's what I Do every day I pick out the things that are the biggest you know the most important to do and also the ones that I'm most afraid of I teach that to my children you know ... what you were afraid of and go out and do it right away so that you get over that fear\nBut yeah we've got to pick the ones that are most important and sometimes let the others go I'm you I Am used that I've been doing it for decades\nWe're getting close to the bottom of the hour break when we come back I Want to talk about tort reform because that is a major topic it's going to impact whether or not pharmaceutical prices I Believe can truly be affected\nAnd changed in addition to that I Want to talk about your thoughts on the Affordable CARE Act and where that's going in order to bring affordable truly affordable health care\nTo people that need it\nYou're listening to K. why ca fourteen Ninety am one of three point five FM I'm your host Charlie Arnold than we were interviewing Dr David Brill who is running for Congress for a congressional

right now it's pretty much being let's face it sabotage is being dismantled I think it makes a lot more sense to just make Medicare available to everybody voluntarily not as a mandate\nYou can't do it as mandate but make it voluntarily available actually majority of Republicans now support that because it's the only good option we have\nPeople know what they understand it as reasonably simple it's stable it's not going away and making it available to working families everywhere would be would help stabilize their families so that they're not one medical disaster wave or one medical problem away from financial disaster\nAbsolutely so I can tell you that um my I use the marketplace 'cause I'm self employed and my wife and I are health insurance is almost sixteen hundred dollars a month for two adults in their thirties right now\nYeah it's it's impossible but it uh everybody who knows me knows that also you know it was my businesses I've had I'm about competition competition is a fabulous thing and by the way competition is um I think helped our congressmen to perform a little better than he was doing before\nBut competition between Medicare and the pharmaceutical companies we got a habit competition between well here's what I support I support the veterans also have access to Medicare because the choice program that Bernie and John McCain put through frankly wasn't the best thing\nOr it's micro managed it's low [noise] it's it's rough\nNo let the vets have medic let the veterans have Medicare let them go into the community without having micro management from the VA and if they want to use their Medicare benefits at the VA ... has to compete on customer service with them and to get it right\nI Love competition so that's what I'd like to see make Medicare available to everybody and especially make it available to veterans so that they can get fast here in the community and they don't have to travel like they do now with ... and that opens the VA to competition I think I Love it\nBut we've got a few callers we're going to go to line one and talk to Leon first good morning Leon how are you doing great thank you you're new to Prescott and you have questions so go ahead\n[noise] um I really regret the guy from the California young kid shopping fresh get over a year ago\nI grew up in a really progressive the guy from the marine corps out of California\nFor a

you'd like to ask about\nWell yes I Would um I I don't know how you feel about the past that you would have to make it\nA little to make the tanks and it's been lower and middle income earners permanent and with enthusiasm\nI won't vote I Would vote to repeal the tax cuts for the billionaires because those dollars mostly go abroad they did not come and work in our district we have Twenty one trillion dollars of debt that is seven piles of one dollar bills going from here to the moon\nAnd every dollar that we give to a billionaire is another dollar that one of our children is going to have to pay\nThat we're borrowing from our children because we're giving handouts to billionaire so [noise] yeah and our country we have socialism for billionaires and we have capitalism for everybody else\nCan you describe a billionaire what's been done a billionaire or somebody that has a billion dollars\n[noise] okay so you want to go after the rich or do\nThey need to pay their fair share they need to pay their taxes I have been a high income earner in my life and I have no problem paying you know I can afford to pay more so I have I'm OK we need to invest in our children we need to invest in our retirees\nAnd giving more money to billionaires just makes the rest of his well makes the rest of the of our people poor we cry poverty we give handouts to billionaires and then we said we can't afford Medicare Medicaid and Social Security\nAnd we can't afford to schools for kids we can't afford teachers for kids we can't afford infrastructure uh we're making artificial poverty in the wealthiest country on the planet so young I support their taxes\nThere you go to listen to these callers call in and um and I I Am not political at all I I actually don't get it all the holidays we

you know it just it just you know we\nCould make all the all of the solar farms all the wind farms you could possibly think of but we um\nHave a distribution system that's not copper how are you going to get to the consumer right now you got to do so much electricity to get some of the winds don't lose everything before it gets to the consumer you can't make it solar farm or a wind farm big enough\nIt's so much electricity they can get some winds don't everything before it gets to the consumer can't get solar farm or a wind farm big enough to get it to the consumer and so we're going to mandate it is to ask me\nWhy they can do it you just got to spend a lot of money you know more than you can imagine we don't have enough time left in the next three decades\nAnd infrastructure necessary due on solar and wind consumer\nWell in a huge project going on at like a transcontinental railroad\nFit sound exactly like it and all we already are hearing a lot of myth sexual\nWill that set and the whole the whole thing you get ready and you spend people's heads hey thanks for calling in money thanks barbecue so\nMuch we'll talk with you too\nAll right Bye bye and you know I got to agree with him though I think a a new one on one twenty seven and you know there's players on both sides of this she got that what's dire guy on California right he's throwing money into this one and uh then you've got a PS on the other side and\nI don't know I agree with some of the things they've done in the past too but uh this one it it looks like a no what do you think\nI I'm I'm with you I I'm an knowing when twenty seven first of all I don't think that the impact the financial impact our families we don't need that right now number two is and and I and you know I'm not an engineer but it was so we generate all this electricity on our rooftops doesn't have to go back into the system which is owned by a PS\nAnd they're going to charge you a amount of money to handle that extra electricity it somehow it doesn't work ... work out so I'm I'm a definitely a new one on twenty seven um\nAnd you know what a what somebody was bringing up today and we don't know if this is true or not but apparently this one is pulling so bad for the on the ... in favor of know that they're actually pulling money out of this and throwing it into campaigns that they think\nThey got a shot at exactly the star and his group already realize that this is going to fail big here in Arizona so according to our source that money's going into a other campaigns that are are liberal are liberal based\nHey we got a call on a prop one twenty seven John you got something to say\nHey I Want to pile on to for this one twenty seven a ridiculous notion for the first thing is I was talking to someone they said oh it won't cause the common person and airs on ... ... well I had I saw on my house 'cause that's\nFor the first thing is I was talking to someone they said oh it won't cause the common person and Arizona anything extra\nWell I had a smile on my house because I think it's kind of cool I just don't want to force other people to buy it and it cost twenty thousand dollars\nExtra and then when I went to sell my house um it took me an extra like six months longer than I should have 'em to sell the house and I had to keep dropping a prize dropping to fry it's almost like I had to give the solar panels away and so how can you say that at twenty thousand dollar edition\nTeam or how a lot of cost somebody the money that the ... the ATF companies whoever is providing the power's gonna pass it on you\nKnow John did you own your solar panels are releasing those\nI wouldn't leave the none but even with the relief I if I would've bottom it would have been twenty thousand but with the lease no one wanted to chance or the leaf through its head that sell the house\nRight in the middle of the the association of realtors is working on that right now to get some changes because it's been a huge sticking point because you do not own those solar panels what'd you entered into a legally binding agreement to to pay for him and have him on your house and there was no easy way of passing that through so it sounds like that's what you bumped into\nYeah and it's also just based on talking I like to read one reason your data if you're on the whole global warming thing the reason why is because most of the arm for mom and her to or not the um\nWhat do you call it that keeps the data a weather stations most of the weather stations that collect the data\nWhere we get our

a form of taxation because you can't live without electricity\nOnce you've destroyed and industry the government has to take it over once a government takes over all of the power throughout the country will be able to cross over to the different power grids [noise] but I don't know what we're going to do that\nAnd I don't know how much pain that country's gonna have to go through to get to that point\nBut it's one twenty seven does pass it will definitely cost the rate payers money\nLay might thank you for the call appreciate it okay by ... it's kind of sounds like a Mike wants to have the United states' power come ... it's a it's an all according to the pain when you know I say I think when you\nYou start talking about the whole grid there is a lot a lot of a patchwork of it and it

front of houses that do have the grill and the great cough seemed to also have the thrill Weinstein and so my gut feeling is the vote no on\n...\nYeah exactly yeah well the same thing with a one twenty seven uh you know they say that it's not a endorsed by any cat day yeah\nWhen grill was on your show Chris he pretty much in Dorset in a way but he wasn't really flat out for it but you also I also as they did an awesome job of imitating Al Gore\nWhen he was talking about global warming oh you're you're you're a mean one Kurt [laughter]\nI Know I Know after your show I did go on its face for us and I tried to get a conversation going on in regards to is the\nGreen energy topics and he didn't\nDid not engaging he claimed to on the radio that he likes to talk with people who disagree and yet he seems to be afraid to on now okay not ... they're dropping tracks here a district gangs there seems to be a hot button issue was that he claims that goes there was a carpetbagger yet when you looked at\nTheir CD one district\nWhen he was a A R congressman both black stuff I'm Prescott were included in the redistricting split the two towns\nAnd so that automatically made him a carpetbagger\nMhm well it sounds like you're going to vote for ghosts are\nI yeah yeah definitely\n[laughter] well I I Know on three sides the one thing that was getting us was a ... ... ... and you know what\nGlenn it seems like there is hardly anybody using this program for it to be such a big issue and see what they say in just like five thousand or by thirty thousand kids drink are taking advantage of this program right five thousand\nFor it to be such a big issue as I said what are they saying just like five thousand or via doubts thirty thousand kids are taking advantage of this program\nRight five thousand people that leaves twenty five thousand more people can take advantage of this program if it passes\nAnd it seems like a warm on a hook you know what because here okay you get 'em for a couple of more ... four more years you'll get increases ... but then it shut off and it will never grow again\nBut doesn't really get shut off because they can always go by on the ballot again and we can re vote on it again it's like I was talking to another person might have been you Chris I said you know what you can't uh you can't just make these things go away\nIt's like how we heard the last ... P. S. P. R. S. U. that's gone away heavens no and thrill five it's not going to go away either so we still have the ability to help twenty five thousand people onto with three or five and I say yes and you know when we\nAre in Iraq and I got to go on a drink one game during the\nNo we do but you know we were taught that around that maybe we should start doing that we'd we'd have clear because on three or five we couldn't come to what we did was we said OK Seventy five percent of the group has to vote a certain way for us to take a position and thrill five was pretty much split right down the middle\nYeah I was surprised I thought we would ... a boat for three or five but um it was right down the middle so we take no position\nSo can you tell us I tell you what you will make the decision for all of Prescott right now ... five yes or no no okay that's the that's the thing occurred has spoken things were going in buddy up thank you Bye bye\nAnd you know the last one on thing I think is a slam dunk it's real obvious to me it's prop three oh six and it comes with the clean elections money and basically what it's saying is when when you're done with your election if there's clean election money left over\nAre you allowed to donated to a party to a candidate or does it have to go back to the clean elections fun yeah and apparently that had a problem with this in the past and ah I'm I mean the whole group was saying yes where there's a hundred percent absolutely yeah and it back\nYeah 'cause why keep that ... it it's not your money to begin with\nAnd why center to either the RMC or the DNC right it either way back to the clean elections committed senior I used to\nBe against clean elections too I I actually what I Will not against ... down south but the but the money and then all of a sudden you know a kind of hit me when I started looking at where money was coming from for Canada in ...\nI'm not against Russian down so that the but the money and then all of a sudden you know a kind of hit me when I started looking at where money was coming from four candidates that it's almost impossible for your average good clean guy to not take any money because once you take that money I think you can also be a little obviously like\nYou know when you get that giant check for may be as you want to vote for solar not saying that they did that never my cat my whole shows become and disagreement [laughter] yeah you know the trade on trying to run in ...
