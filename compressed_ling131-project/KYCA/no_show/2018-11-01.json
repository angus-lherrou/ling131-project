Prescott\nIt's time now for another morning report and this is Bob Boilen for the YMCA and they were going to talk about Halloween with Prescott police department deputy chief anybody maybe how you doing this morning\nGood how are you good so Halloween as a bomb is right now and uh we just want to ... as far as safety on ...\nYeah it really is it seems like it sneaks up on us every single year but here we are at the end of October once again and of course we all know that there's going to be lots of little ones I'm running around all over town and in some specific areas um that we definitely want to make sure we keep safe and pay attention to\nAll right um what about the kids running roaming the highways streets here roadways here in ... uh what are we doing about that\nWell as usual we have a couple of areas in our community that are really heavily frequented Mount Vernon avenue is one of those um in particular and as we do every year that street is going to be closed it will be closed from\nGirlie street all the way up I'm right until the start of senator highway well have extra people out there um staffing not making sure that the\nThe people on foot are staying safe um but there are lots of other neighborhoods in our community that don't have um close roads and so one of the most important things is\nYou know sugar treat with your kids taking them places that are well lit and um you know easy to see and a pay attention to what they're doing and look for cars and if you are driving of course we know there's going to be lots of people out throughout the night and so pay attention\nCertainly we did just pass a distracted driving ordinance not in effect just yet but of course put down the cell phones\nThey attention um anticipate seeing somebody dark and from um you know between cars and just just in general slow down and pay attention and and make sure that we help keep everybody safe\nOkay now what about the patrols all looking for a drunken drivers\nWere going to have um our standard patrol's out looking for anybody that's that's impaired or is not driving safely in general\nWere going to have um our standard patrol's out looking for anybody that's that's impaired or is not driving um safely in general\nSo definitely something we'll be keeping an eye on and we want to make sure everybody is able to stay safe and enjoy their their holiday tomorrow so we have um the area of country club in park is also an area that we pay attention to\nWe I'm as usual you know have extra patrol out there as well and this year we're doing something a little bit different in that area we are going to restrict parking\nSpecifically in the area of country club so that we can prevent um some of the issues with people starting back and forth between the sides of the street so we are going to have some some extra signage out there and restricts some parking in that area so that we can increase invisibility\nI'm One of the other things that's really important is making sure that your kids who are in their Halloween costumes can actually see a there are lots of masks lots of different costumes that that those ghettos where and so we need to make sure that they're able to actually see out so that they can help to keep themselves safe by paying attention to what's going on around them\nWell I mean we're going to take a break here uh the morning you were born and we'll be right back after this\nHigh we hear from many pets get water resource management join us Wednesday November twenty first at noon at the public library for next water spring drop by drop in the nation are eleven interactive educational presentation and we'll discuss groundwater and this is my friend region in a long time commitment to the city's water coming\nTogether will learn how to become a lot of community again that's November twenty percent of that and you have to press the public library either [noise]\nWe're back now here in the morning we're born with deputy police chief maybe by the press good police department so trick or treat time ... ... troops do a report to or maybe some of the older kids are running room during Halloween\nWell of course we always pay attention to you know what the kids are doing and usually it's all in good fun but we we tend to see a lot of smashed pumpkins\nSome um the no toilet paper rolls being thrown about the trees and anything like that of course I Want people to stay safe and have fun but there are some some things that definitely cross the line um don't want to smash anybody's pumpkins usually kids pick you know take a lot of time to ah\nTo create those and so it always makes them sad when that happens so just don't smash any pumpkins keep keep your ah\nYou know tricks to to in your family and and have fun with it but of course we want people to be safe\nDon't smash any pumpkins keep keep your ah you know tricks to to in your family and and have fun with it but of course we want people to be safe\nNow for the kids are collecting candy from everybody what your parents be wary of a woman or kids go trick or treating\nWell as a parent myself I always make sure that I um don't accept any candy that is not um wrapped from you know wrapped in sealed like from the manufacturer so there are a lot of people that want to make\n'em treats at home and of course not knowing what is in um um those intentions are good but we just want to pay attention to what they're eating um check the candy thoroughly before you give it to the kids it's so rare um that somebody does something\nWith those to make it dangerous for the kids but it is and never um you know it's always a good idea to check those candies make sure that there's nothing obviously opened or anything sticking out of them um of course if you have kids that have allergies you want to make sure that you're paying attention to what they're eating\n'em and just in general just be cognizant um I Know there are some dentists in town every year that will buy the candy back from your kids if you don't want to eating all that candy um but that's that's definitely up to you as a parent but just just be cognizant of what's going into that little um trick or treat bag and make sure that you pay attention to what they're putting in their mouth\nLet me ask you this is a better time for parents to take your kids go trick or treating\nYou know I think that's that's up to to people just personally I'm you know of course it's it's\nWhen it's still light outside you might not have as many people home\nUm but it certainly is a little bit safer a little bit easier to see so right at dusk and you know in areas like um the busy frequented areas like Mount Vernon you know what we do tend to see is earlier in the evening the costumes are more family friendly and they have every\nEvery now and then as the evening progress has been some costumes that are a little more\nUm adult oriented shall I say and so it just you know depends on what you um what you're comfortable with as a parent as a family and you know generally the the younger kids tend to go out earlier in the evening and the older kids tend to\nGo out um after dark and you know I have heard some people say oh we don't want the older kids come into our house and and I understand that you know but we need to remember that those kids are out doing something fun and not doing something that they shouldn't be doing so maybe we can have a little bit of patience and and try to help them have a good Halloween as well\nWe meet a woman for your time here in the morning\nFun and not doing something that they shouldn't be doing so maybe we can have a little bit of patience and and try to help them advocate Halloween as well
