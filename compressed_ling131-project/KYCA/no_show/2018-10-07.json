Stein did that is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film\nA is during the twenty sixteen election or they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way\nUm but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was or five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know\nThings seemed to be pretty balanced but Google in every single search position of the\nTop ten search results\nThis result favored Hillary Clinton\nWhere they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump in the same search results um and you know by his estimate that this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't\nTell the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is science essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nI and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that ran undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they are sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nDecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that one day sort sort of going to the Google Search and say which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially oh elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\n\nStill waiting for the perfect time to buy a new Chevy car truck for right now is a great time at lamb Chevrolet hello this is ed Walsh the two

mean imagine a ... imagine I'm ... now or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us\nTrust us George Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nAnd Google basically tells us as trust us yeah last us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois Lyndon\nHello am I Am I going to make a quick comment a lot of them believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with going on Facebook and all these people out of what I really called us asking that want to thank our guests are what he's been doing um about search engines and\nThey're used to be I could click which had a they they have another one called start page the same company that they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolved\nAnd I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppressing ex quicker what happened to it and I use that that go\nI Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing the research is but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because they wanted the information and the data that comes to search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing\nEverywhere and you're exactly right star page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without\nData being present I think that is that is going to change your bench Lee biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck a while ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges them best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you to either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or for other parts of

God created that is our heavenly father will to create to give a life where none existed or exists it's there where God for nothing brings everything into being you\nKnow the history you've heard it many times before from darkness comes light than water than land than vegetation than sun and moon and stars then see life followed by life on land we see God's handiwork bringing life into its very first existence\nAnd God made the beef up the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds and everything that creates on the ground according to its kind and God saw that it was good this accounts alone would be a magnificent event to watch ethics for sure\nYet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to a bus\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserve nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how loved you are you must see how enemies as we are God's still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts maybe then we can see how his love extends to every one everywhere and that they too are valued and

return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understanding of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow if you are listening\nAnd you have gone against that which God wish for you to have taking a life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain\nI encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil wants you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center the last the broken the one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age\nAnd in that there is much to be thankful for the life giver our lord and savior ceased to give us life eternal in him he wants to share his love that you would share his love with others also\nMay we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purpose is God

found out that I was pregnant with our youngest daughter now well\nI was not thrilled to be pregnant and I'm embarrassing to admit that to people\nI have two kids that were getting ready to graduate high school and I was just at a point in my life where starting over with midnight feeding and diaper changes that wasn't really what I had in mind for myself at that point and so for the first few months that I was pregnant I actually really was struggling with\nNow I Know this is a blessing from but it doesn't feel like one and of course then I obviously did come to terms with that I was very\nReally was struggling with now I Know this is a blessing but it doesn't feel like one and of course then I obviously did come to terms with that I was very excited when Noelle was born and she was beautiful but when we received her diagnosis of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome\nThere was a guilt and a little bit of fear and wonder you know it's a it's a Scott punishing\nMe for for being so ungrateful and for not\nAccepting his gift right off the bat\nYeah that was something that I did have\nTo struggle with for a little while before I finally found peace\nNow I can think of times where I looked at my past you know when I was young and it's kind of like\nYou know Solomon lord forgive me for my rebellious youth but there there\nAre instances where things come into your life and you'd be like oh you know I Wonder if God is on the need\nFor that but that's so it's really not how God works right\nSo it sounds like both of you had an opportunity to come to a point in your lives when you learned\nTo submit to God's will\nCertainly plants that I had for this season in my life have been changed dramatically\nBy Noel arrival you know ideas that I had for myself once on my\nOlder for children were in school finished school or\nLeaving home even all of those things have been put on the back burner because now I and\nNot only mothering a small child again but also a child that has some added neat\nYeah I think if there's anything that we know by reading God's word is not the you become a Christian and all of a sudden your life is perfect but in fact you you can expect suffering you can expect trials because\nYou are literally going in the opposite direction in the world wants to take you and that's going to increase friction gray friction\nThere have been a our fair share of trials but um there's also been a lot of joy and a lot of a blessing and I think\nYou know specifically speaking to Noelle and her surprise arrival but also her\nI'm surprised diagnosis I think that when we received that diagnosis we all reacted in a very human way we were\nScared because we didn't know what that meant we were\nSad because\nGrieved this idea of the life that\nScared because we didn't know what that meant we were sad because\nWe grieved this idea of the life that our child was going to have\nThere were elements of you know uncertainty and fear of what other people going to think and how does this you know how this is going to impact our family long term\nI started thinking about the fact that you know Perry and I may never have an empty nest and that's a huge thing to deal with and to come to terms with and what I didn't realize and what I didn't think about was the huge blessing that we were going to get through her\nThat was one of the greatest lesson that I learned through this whole experience so far I'm a God Bless us with her was just that once we got to know her and once we recognize how amazing her differences make her\nHow kind and how unconditionally loving and how\nAmazing she is like she has to work so much harder than everyone else to achieve the same tasks that we all achieved quite easily\nThere is so much rejoicing rejoicing over\nLittle tiny things that you would normally take for granted those are the things that I feel like God has taught us through the well and when I watch\nThe way that our children are older children are with her and the patients and the acceptance that\nThey have learned and the ways that they have grown in their opinions of people with\nTolerate I'm Thirty years old and June thirty in June and your wife's name are Linda Linda jello and okay wall is life like for you growing up growing up on the reservation\nTo me it was just normal I guess the just went on up there just traditional stuff being a part of the whole culture up there at my grandfather was a medicine men so our whole family was ...\nJust what went on up there just traditional stuff being a part of the whole culture up there at my grandfather was a medicine man so our whole family was kind of knew there were very traditional ended we took in ceremonies and\nLife and that nature and on the reservation also there's there's a lot of\nAlcoholism and drug addiction and various sorts of ... that are there present and the culture alcoholism is probably the biggest one I originally started drinking when I was Thirteen Years old\nAnd everybody drained my grandfather and grandmother uncles my mom and my dad and\nIt was just something you did when you've got to a certain age you know do just part of the it was ... pretty much the most places in the tip of violence then I got off the reservation after high school I went to work in the valley for construction company\nAnd then once I started making money I started you know\nSupport in my hand was a little bit heavier\nDrinking a lot I just lost control of of this you know addiction really took over then into other than a pretty picture it's just ... and you know\nNot carrying really\nJust caring about myself and my habit at some point you made your wife how that happens I met her and paste and first to when we met in a bar\nOf course um do we combine habits together and you know we were we were having ... you know what we thought it was a good time at the time for a living and paste and I was living in a company house there at the time and I'm sure she was already there living with her father\nAt that particular time when I met my wife no I wouldn't know what it was just getting rolling hard then we'd been together after that for about three years and we drink a lot together\nIt was probably until somewhere around two thousand and the one I started taking notice that something had changed and that\nWas getting old presidents don't watch party anymore it was just you know\nTrying to trying to keep up with the habit reaping\nThat it was getting old wasn't so much of a party anymore it was just you know\nTrying to trying to keep up with the habit reaping the the outcome of\nThe habit and the day I did the next day or whenever the ban ended you know you'd\nYou'd be happier general hangovers and they weren't intend to find them worse than the than the party began to feel like something needed to change but I didn't know what and necessarily need to happen there was no reference of Christianity in my life prior to that so\nI didn't know where to look I just needed I knew that I needed\nTo change your traditions give you and they did they tell you anything that you could use to change or they gave us\nA sense of hope there was ceremonies that could be done to get a person to you know to realize you gain\nA hold of their lives but from what I've seen personally though those only last a while and then you see the person to a month or two down the road and they're still doing the same thing and you know it it it didn't seem like an help much if not make causing more damage\nThat's true I didn't go to the rehab too too I'd I searched at rehab hit it helped a little bit you know\nIt's just it's just not the same as\nGiven your life to Christ and surrendering and getting help from there but the other culture they the traditions the ceremonies they say they can help and they say they can break the curse but\nBut it doesn't work in one case you know that\nReminds me of it is we when my wife's parents start out man a medicine man he was telling us that there was some sort of a paraphernalia that was\nBuried in in front of our apartment of some sort that was causing the curse fall upon us of addiction alcoholism and\nBad omen his answer was paying me five hundred and and uh I can get rid of the deal but you know supporting your habits in trying to come up with five hundred dollars is two different things how did you find change how do we find out what Africa stumbled upon it\nReally was one night driving now to bash is to get the more alcohol and some more beer to\nTo to to to\nReally I was one night driving out to ... to get some more alcohol and some more beer\nTo to sue to just to the er\nThe addiction and habits\nWhen I saw a band playing out in the parking lot and I didn't know what it was they were they were jamming so you know I just stop those feeling pretty good\nI thought I listened to some music Christian outreach scene is what it was I listen to it for a while I guess was towards the end so they were given\nAnd all in all to call in and I'm been offering this what they were given so I I I felt that I felt compelled to to to give a little stumped and seeing how I was listening and partake in a little bit you know\nSo when a been I don't necessarily know how much are put in but it might it might not have been much because allied I bought the did die beer that's how I I stumbled upon and you know you came out to me when I went back to my car\nAnd you told me about Christ\nI told you I Would I Would consider it but I had beer that were there were there you know they were still pretty much a curse on my life and they were they they had to hold on me so I went home I didn't give you my address\nYou know so little preacher your address you can buy you can buy and uh he doesn't want to\nSee how we were doing and see if we wanted to receive cries several times you\nCan buy and we were in you know we were still at it we're managing it was in everyday life and you can come and buy and sell the vantage ended maybe a couple of weeks later hung over pretty bad\nAnd there was a flyer that there was there with the beer on it in a circle and slash around that tired of tired of living your life the same way ... not answering your problems or something like that but\nWe were ... I was looking at the ads and\nAll of a sudden that that that was what I needed I felt like that was what I Need it and I needed or maybe the last desperate desperate grass we went down to the church that we we started there was a time a date on there and we went down there and there are there has been a real violence going on all week\nWe went down in the church that we we started there was you know time a day on there and we went down there and there are there had been there a lot going on all week and I suppose and\nKevin McCarthy was there he was the visiting minister there and he had spent time on the reservation is why for Navajo and it really hit home when he was you know when he was talking about all the men living life on the reservation and how there was\nSuch a hold on on on that particular group or with the ... that addiction he just he just brought it all home\nIn may and what he was saying to us and and uh what Christ in his life and how he had the victory over\n... I remember this church service at the end he gave an invitation for people to come forward and receive Christ you guys raise your hand he went forward he prayed a prayer to ask Christ into your life what happened\nWhen we were told to buy our heads and rivers to God you know and those around us and we weren't looking around to know to call you send in your life and you need to get right with God didn't raise your hand and you know there's two heads are still down and we were raised their hand which\nWe went to the altar we gave our life to Christ we set\nUs then there's ... I didn't know as soon as prayer was but you know as I was saying the prayer\n... it felt so real that I could feel\nThat there was\nSomething lifted off my shoulders that happen caring for a long time it was just something I never felt before so what happened to the alcohol the alcohol\nHaven't had a job ever since then\nAnd that was in September of two thousand and two it was yeah ... the traditions tried for years to do\nJesus did in a moment in a moment time is pretty incredible it was it was a new addiction with a positive outcome I should\nSay if kids we were we were on Jesus we were there we just we had to be there and we want to hear the word of God every every day it was it was something\nThat you know we needed to here and it was something it was a guy is what it turned into as a reference\nPoint and that there's so many people that had traveled that road and that was what we need it\nWas something it was a guy is what it turned into as a reference point and that there's so many people that had traveled that road and that was what we need to begin to deal with us a lot of things that we thought was normal\nEver be nominated for the United States Supreme court and that just a real problem\nBecause he is a conservative Rush Limbaugh weekdays at ten on the news fourteen Ninety and one of the three point five FM cable I ca\nListening to the news for ... ... ... it's four o'clock [noise]\nA deadly limo ride in upstate New York I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News authorities saying the limo ran a stop sign before crashing into a car and pedestrians in a crowded parking lot all Eighteen people in the limo and to pedestrians were killed\nThroughout the next few days NTSB investigative work room scene\nToo thoroughly documented\nTo gather what we call the perishable evidence the information that goes away with the passage of time Robert\nSumwalt with the NTSB saying it's the worst transportation accident in the U.S since two thousand nine the limo reportedly heading to a birthday party Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh taking his seat on the bench this week\nOn Wednesday the justices will consider another question that they've actually heard before\nAnd it's whether or not undocumented immigrants can be detained during deportation proceedings now that case involves an illegal immigrant where they prior criminal record but who is no longer in custody that should be very interesting indeed now don't forget\nMonday Night at seven o'clock right here at the White House the president will have that swearing in ceremony for his newly minted justice Fox\nIs Kevin cork the Senate confirming Kavanaugh fifty to forty eight and a vote mostly along party lines some on the left already calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment\nThere's only ever been one justice that's been impeached and I think talking about it at this point I'm isn't necessarily healing out some moving forward Senate\nDemocrat Chris Coons on NBC's Meet the press Florida governor Rick Scott declaring states of emergency for more than ...\nAt this point I'm isn't necessarily killing us in moving forward Senate Democrat Chris Coons on NBC's Meet the press Florida governor Rick Scott declaring states of emergency for more than two dozen counties a tropical storm Michael approaches also have a\nTeam from FEMA here to merge provide federal assistance that includes experts from homeland security BPA department defense health and Human Services and the Army Corps\nForecasters predicting Michael could reach hurricane status tomorrow night or Tuesday the storm packing winds up to fifty miles per hour this is Fox News [noise]\n\nDocumentaries and more\nOf your favorite for our time is going to be on the\nNation coming soon to be the personal\nMission done gum now Fox News rundown weekly morning ...

amazing\nWell thank you so much and thanks for noticing that yeah it's a it's been a long run and I guess you know what's what's reassuring about that I mean personally exciting but also really speaks to A People's interest long term interest in this type of information that you know so much to flash in the pan right and I mean as an educator you know that\nYou know we started out way back when and you know who knows where the industry was going to go and now it's so popular in mainstream\nIt is and uh you know regarding immunity you know people are suffering colds and flus I I'm myself them uh getting over one right now and\nYou know one of the problems is so many of us are unrestricted diets I've seen figures that somewhere between twenty and twenty five percent of the American population is on some kind of restricted diet whether it's paleo or Quito or a vegetarian or\n... or kosher or a gluten free there's so many of these variations but whenever you're on a restricted diet\nYou're restricting your ability to get certain nutrients are the some of the classic ones are are vegetarians with vitamin B. twelve or omega three fats or or you have the people and the Quito diets who might not be getting all the nutrients they should or restricting carbs or\nOr fats or things like that so uh what's that in mind we're not necessarily getting all the nutrients we need to be fully functional and to be able to resist these challenges\nEspecially during seasonal changes in times when we were moving indoors and exposed to more people\nYou know so Neal you know but there's been a lot of blowback against supplementation lately in fact you know some a media reports that several multi vitamins are really you know we used was a kid can you respond to that a critique because you know many conventional doctors are now taking that attack\nYeah but that's that's really a myth that you can get all the nutrients you need from a healthy diet without limitation because the food tables that were built by the U.S department of agriculture in Nineteen forty our way out of date they don't reflect the current food supply or the way that people are choosing their foods\nOr the way foods are process today\nAnd so they're kind of imaginary numbers that I mean imagine that we're getting everything we need from our diet if we eat and the ideal diet\nOr the way foods are process today and so they're kind of imaginary numbers that I mean imagine that we're getting everything we need from our diet if we eat and the ideal diet with all the options that were choosing not to eat a lot of foods and the\nNeed for bridging those gaps there's nothing better than a supplement than a lot of the negative reports are saying\nThat dietary supplements and multi vitamins especially do not prevent cancer or heart disease in short term studies these are not short term developing issues and people don't take multi vitamins to prevent cancer and heart disease they take them to bridge nutritional gaps which is a logical sensible thing to do\nMhm what what are some of the star and nutrients when it comes to a immune support it and I'm thinking particularly\nYou know people who are uh you know maybe they have medical conditions maybe they're on medications leader interfere with nutrients but also you know older adults who will you know it's a big deal when somebody whose Seventy five gets a cold or flu it can really knock him back\nIt is and the first thing I Would always recommend it multiple vitamin because you get vitamin a vitamin D you get vitamin C. vitamin e they all have role that immunity you have minerals like selenium and think that have roles in immunity\nSo if you get the basics then you know you're not deficient and the body has the resources to have defenses against these illnesses we've known for over a hundred years for example that vitamin deficiency makes measles more aggressive\nAnd there's more recent research showing that viruses react to a lack of nutrients in the body and become more aggressive they can even mutate in that body and become more virulent so or the ability to resist depends largely on nutritional confidence\nThey need now taking an example of that might be selenium where they failed in part of China where he was there were selenium division that to see 'em V. virus which is a serious virus but usually recover from it or if you're nutritionally competed other can result in in just a horrible cardiomyopathy\nWhich was referred to as ... disease after the province in which is selenium deficiency occurred and\nYou know the Chinese figured it out and they begin supplementing their populace was selenium and now that condition is a thing of the past\nYes and the even the national Institute for health calls selenium an anti accident that ...\nWith selenium and now that condition is a thing of the past\nYes and even the national Institute for health calls selenium an anti accident that tells protect against damaging free radical attacks that we can immunity and resistance to illness by depressing immune cells counts\nAnd it protects cells from oxidative stress that make them more susceptible to illness so\nYou know ... you can take them separately you could take them together there's a lot of herbs in botanical that can be added ... sometimes you on vitamin D and larger quantities for
