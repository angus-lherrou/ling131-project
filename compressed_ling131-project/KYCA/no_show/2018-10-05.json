be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no collaboration in that certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree uh and they were made\nUm here's why white women are abandoning the G O P\nA new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree uh and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took white women to task after the Trump election who helping him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\nFaye Faye focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent whom of whom voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support among Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points well that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people\nVoting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the ...\nWell I think that is the the biggest both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and and victory points for the Democrat so far which is that the closet what I Would say the costs of conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women [noise] who voted twenty points for Romney's who voted\nProbably Thirteen fourteen points for uh for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis Kavanaugh nomination never hope that I always thought that a woman nominated for even a woman nominee what might have been more conservative would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to win them back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those issues\nThat Trump has focused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six us see uh LA Times poll\nCounted twenty ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage among married white college educated woman women a group long tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nCollege educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um is is is this is a substantial block or the married college educated women and that's a substantial block\nBut among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm and they like things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and they seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know [noise]\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof women who as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy\nAnd its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day every day that the the national question is is she\nA rapist or not\nIs it a day that nobody is focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states than show again the races are tightening\nIn do you think that they perhaps Donald Trump busy data that shows and this is driving conservative and conservative voting base back home of course the the Joe\n... is exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing

said he's one of the most qualified and and and one one of those things is worried people sign judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David\nBecause that they're Democrats or the party of resistance and intimidation rabble rousing in chaos and meanwhile Trump is slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is if Congress this fall but we did read it NAFTA\nHe's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again it's not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than a seventh of all federal judges are Trump\nAppointees uh and obviously it's Kevin gets

and your new book a Jesus has risen Paul in the early church continues um\nYou're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ... ...\n... and in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings of our society but it's really important for people to understand\nHow the early church was formed\nHow unlikely it was that these followers early followers of Christ\nOr we're going to you know basically drop everything and develop their entire lives and and give their lives or to this ah this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ a tell us about why this book was you know it was so important for you to write at this point in your own life\nAh well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible cause I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands and I started\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I add something\nSome some books some guy in ... that would help me understand it better to be less intimidated so as I've\nStudied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back and start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last week I wrote was about the gospels\nAnd ... put it paraphrased and and stayed at most of the versus the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book Jesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early church\nWhich follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed that he planted and they were they were dissipating from the the true gospel they were following falls teachers and he wanted to write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of of\nAdversity and opposition and secular influences core and it was a hotbed of sexual immorality and I dollar trade with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't mix and sinker ties their religion with\nImmorality and I doubt trade with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't\nMix and sinker ties their religion with our religion\nJesus Christ as the son of God to follow him and come back and we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church\nThere's there's the conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which is faith then Jesus Christ alone to salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so\nWe want to ... to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was\nSteeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law\nAnd win anyway it was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were a new competing religion\nBut that they were perverting the religion of God and and it was Judy as well as a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be them aside because they expect that the Jews expected a military\nOr political or deliver from the the forces the authorities at the time\nAnd I didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was\nA hung on the tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver the victory didn't even raise a hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't meet him aside and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians up and in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the St ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road blind them with light and converted him\nTo from the ... the greatest persecuted the greatest evangelists So Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and then in the periphery of the Roman empire and establish churches and they were as if they were his new born babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith\nFrom an empire and establish churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God picked him the Bible says before he created the universe\nAnd I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual and relentless\nAnd determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThe part I think this is Mike around two fifty seven in your book um\nWhere you

regime which we've got a hostile relationship since Nineteen Seventy nine\nWhich probably an overdue step frankly\nIf you work John at 'em walk the icy day the international court of justice or the world court it's sometimes called I ordered the United states to do is actually a company United States is perfectly willing to do and that's make exemptions to allow humanitarian trade with Iran I think what the administration really objects to do\nIs the very idea the ice feet Jay has asserted jurisdiction in this issue because for the United states they did on national security and it's not really subject to the world courts jurisdiction\nAnd it's a matter of national sovereignty also uh having them into fewer and as you said America does give humanitarian exemptions and has always provided for it but you know when they talk about the aircraft parts being coming on to disguise of of being humanitarian need when we know\nThat the Iranians civilian aircraft are being employed in Syria\nAnd deployed carrying troops and doing other things so it is not a non military issue when they talk about the um ... it certainly in the military equipment and we know the mullahs sell a lot of that medicine so so in fact the United states cases is a lot stronger\n\n\nI'm John ... with Malcolm hold on\nSyria and Russia are separate story from Iran\nAnd Russia because of the ongoing conflict because of the promises made and the question is blood and treasure ... has invested a deal of boats and right now a lot of our potent is quoted most recently in the times of Israel saying all foreign troops should leave Syria after the war\nI guess Malcolm that means the Iranians to I suppose that would be the logic of that and Turks and everybody else but after the war is a catch phrase how does that happen we welcome bars Silverman who can help us to get this\nCareful lawyers language by the former KGB agent a bar is a very good evening to a foundation for the defense of democracies we take you to Syria the recent shoot down to the Russians surveillance crap\nLed to twenty four forty eight hours of turmoil in the Kremlin and in Jerusalem and in Damascus blame shifting the Russians responded by saying we'll issue as three hundred system\nTo the Syrians who had managed to shoot down a Russian craft following er during an Israeli airstrike or how do you measure the relationship between Damascus and the Kremlin right now is it one of confidence is it was on a disk trust is there a betrayal of foot good evening to bars\nGaming and thanks for having me on I think certainly people you think you have a quiet shutting down on your own aircraft with weapons that you're at fault them in a long while ago after um\nUh your client on the side regime shutting down one of your own aircraft with weapons that you saw them in a long while ago after hundreds um you know ... systems that really can't tell friend her phone I've kind of one on one of one of the problems there\nAre for the for the Russians are but it's deeply embarrassing and I think they use this as an excuse\nI'm to transfer the as three hundreds to the Syrians would resort video of earlier this week um they've been wanting to do it so that's how he's twenty Thirteen Scott earlier or they had to deal with Israelis back twenty Thirteen to not do it I'm obviously that this\nUh this incident with the excuse that they've been looking forward to quickly go ahead and move forward with the transfer\nWho had very complicated situation just as a one reflection of it when you have the as three hundred coming in addition to the U.S two hundred but we have an ally turkey a NATO member who's getting the S. four hundred supposedly the most advanced the system is are the\nThe Chinese and there'd been threats by the U.S about sanctions cats are uh the countering America's adversaries who sanctions act and other\nMeasures ... what do you see the the us reaction now both regarding turkey and trying to do they go to the mat on it and how will it affect Turkey's relationship\nSo we didn't rush into orbit\nLook I saw at the public at a trauma diminish racial issue the sanctions the cats are related sanctions against Chinese\nOr one Chinese agency and the Chinese individuals that executive director of that aid for their purchase of as four hundred ethical a thirty five fighter jets off I think that's certainly a shock to the Chinese to the Turks\nI'm either just report today that the Indonesians were putting on hold a their purchases of sick or thirty five fighter jets because of their concern about sanctions\nSo I should be taken seriously that um you know the conversation has worn turkey that this could lead to sanctions or not if they follow through on sanctions and kind of set the precedent what China\nUm you know the the lights flashing red or for turkey whether there for you stop 'em you know I I that's a mistake I think they go they go through with it\nBut as far as I'm I'm On a press you on how the Russians deal with the Syrians in Damascus Russian military intelligence is excellent Russian networks are first grade\nI Want to press you on how the Russians deal with the Syrians in Damascus Russian military intelligence is excellent Russian networks are first prayed throughout the middle east always have been there are a lot of Russians have married Syrian so there's a ... there's a comfort here working in the audience will\nDo the Russians trust I saw it in any fashion they totally penetrated his organization did they know everything all the time\n[noise] but I have one person basically making decisions I don't know if they know everything all the time but they've got no alternative they have this\nKind of multigenerational forty nine year basing deal with the Assad regime for uh the base and its hardest a naval base it on the air base there I mean um and so they they're holding on and there's no there's no political alternative for them they don't they don't see anybody\nOutside basically guarantee 'em their equities and in Syria so I'm not sure it's a matter of crossing or not but it's that's the kind of\n[noise] they've got the foot hold down a little box and Assad is\nThe partner for that I'm and I'm not sure you know how ... there's not there's no other way come for them to move\nAnd as far as it relates to the United states or Israel or are there key players and the reason that just kind of the reality now and we do the Russians are doing with Assad as they are and Israelis are kind of doing it would do with Assad regime and a very I'm kind of realistic way and\nI'm targeting target and same with the Iranians um and so I think it's it's more of the actions than than any trust to having maybe here when they give the three hundreds to Assad it's more about making sure that as\nThe kind of that crack troops that Assad has are ... are really lax uh don't end up shooting up there on aircraft as we saw when it's incident that they have something that's more advanced now that can actually tell Russian aircraft from Israeli aircraft are from you know other aircraft\nYou know we have another front where we're seeing a an ally a moving closer to Russia in some regards to the president's ... Egypt\nTo Russia I think when the seventeenth to Sochi do you see this as a an opportunity for Russia to establish another base now that they've consolidated hold in Syria a naval and air force base they bloom so they do in in Egypt what what else could be on the agenda for them\nSo they've had I mean I think it has its uh\nAnd they ... they they ... they do in in Egypt what what else could be on the agenda for them\nSo they've had I mean it's I think it's just it's a fascinating trip on the seventeenth I mean is it an Egypt cc's previously visited Russia as well uh they've signed kind of a slew of military and economic cooperation deals but on the military side we haven't seen\nSome of the kind of basic things come to fruition yet and so that's that's in my mind is that the key thing on their gender the Soviets had some basis in ... in western I'm\nIn western Egypt do they want to revive somebody's airbases to they want to revive some of the naval kind of access they had um military and they were actually had to Egypt in front porch there so I think that's what's really interesting here to watch that describes coming about fairly\nQuickly um and again builds on already military and economic ideals have made in the past couple of years so it's it's it it should be concerning for the U.S where you have\nIs you know traditional ally I'm continuing to gotta get get colds here with the Russians and part of that is where we're not engaging with them you know we still I'm Still waiting for a ... Egypt to be named or the state department or David shank or the sophisticated for Near East\nStill has not been um confirmed by the Senate um so they're still we're we're kind of still playing this game of of catch up on the diplomatic front while the Russians are clearly pushing ahead\nJust to detail here about where we are in the scheme of things the price of oil has gone through eighty five dollars and I'm told by\nInformed sources that it's headed towards a hundred dollars to go to cycle it's nothing different about the Iranian upset is affecting it does that give Russia more leverage in the world because their coffers are good above sixty dollars a barrel\n[noise] they're they're they're tricky position where they I think they're they're planning for around sixty five dollars for their budgets they do they actually can't domestically deal with\nPrices are a hundred a hundred more because they're you know they had their their own domestic prices\nFor oil gas goods commodities whatever started going up and the Russian economy is not doing very well uh inflation's up in an all those things so that you've seen some kind of some small protests some some kind of\nSome some issues domestically for pollutants\nOh uh inflation's up in an all those things so that you see some kind of some small protest some some kind of\nSome some issues domestically for ... so I think there's a sweet spot for them or I Know it's kind of maybe what time I was like oh you know where it goes up to a hundred and twenty dollars a barrel it's great for the Russians you know if the economy was doing better a macro level maybe but it's not\nAn otherwise Horace Silver men STD mouth a whole lot I'm John bachelor\nSous those Savage Nation what hit I tell you what did I just say to

Israeli presence near the Gaza border bringing ... additional military after last friday's twenty thousand people and\nA lot of violence escalated violence from the ... or ... what do you anticipate tomorrow in this is this something that that is going to continue in this way it's come us really ready for war\nDoesn't want war is a single are literally doing the same\nBut at the same time they want to see escalation they want to see brinkmanship in bringing more and more escalation on the one hand but look moving comfortable in a way that will lead to overlook all out war because they know they were not going to gain anything out of that\nOr the logic behind it because they escalate from federal they planned for all of you know it's a worthy fighter or for debate or the or the planning is that this will cause to go to the\nFor all of you know it's already fighting a full today are they a lot of planning is that this will cause is willing to go to the Egyptians and asked them to convene ... believe a money to Hamas\nOr the TV fuel to smoke a because it will be so ah concerned about the possibility of a break up with another war in God\nSo because of that everybody here

to any any kind of escalation and that's why the Iron Dome battery worded deployed yesterday along the border so that these are these days I think it was a pretty thing itself the possibility of a collision by the Hamas uh Venus Asians that's what's going on\nSo the information is that Hamas is he is he's in position just started a rocket barrage again\nThe position but they don't want to go all the uh they they developed the law is a an awful lot of options that these ... million in law then they use it for rockets\nAnd they hope that they're going to there won't be enough in order to

clear a message yesterday when he met with the chancellor a miracle that the expected them to believe that the money to to Hamas\nOr to Gaza and uh so he's one of these is doing to Hamas expects it to do but\nUh it's very difficult to convince a modern the modern has no inclination to help him out\nAnd they are just some of the country wants to push a to put more pressure on them to all these complicated situation it seems that the escalation for the coming days is almost inevitable\nSo the hot issue obviously has been the delivery of the three hundred to Syria or new\nFor the coming of age is almost inevitable\nSo the hot issue obviously has been the delivery of the three hundred to Syria and you've been a military analyst than than the winter very distinguished career in the military and\nIt ... how do you assess this what what is the Israel has a complex in a relationship with Russia\nIn on many fronts and and ... spoken highly and and even defensively but Israel um ... what does that this is this the beginning of the new period due to date to really turn to get three hundred to the Syrians or how how will this change the relationship or impact\nWell of course makes our ability to operate in Syria more complicated\nThan on the now the rain or do anything for the uh the U.S from Russia and the Iranians\nCan more or less the will of the things that are serving in order to help us out\nBut for whenever the Iranians use that to Syria in order to promote activities that are dangerous for you know even though they have the rights to ah take action against it and uh it just has to call and it was the Russian so to avoid the friction\nA bit with opposed to follow the ah inventing which they lost a plane or the Russians and fixing a shoulder\nOr by that a move the Russian was trying to change the equation and to prevent that from taking this action against a hearing in ... by law to be able to tear gas against\nDoes that help Russia Russia doesn't want to see Iran and certainly ... getting these weapons so doesn't isn't Israel doing there's already more often than\nNot I think that the Russia doesn't carry for a while I get to this weapon on doesn't care that much if Iran continues to bring into ah the weapons in Syria into a base from which can operate against these or they don't care that much they don't care if we take action to prevent it but they don't care if the if it does happen\nAnd all our efforts to convince the Russians the way to prevent Iran from bring that\nAre worth ... so I'm now a say in the ... much more complicated situation\nIt was a committed to keep working against the Iranian activities but I think the one difference it's going to happen now is that Russia yes\nCommitted to working against the Iranian community but I think that one because it's going to happen now is the Russia\nYes you mentioned it has to be no much more complicated than to responsible in preventing Iran from bringing the weapon because otherwise you know we'll have to operate in the presence of the three hundred and why was that the Upper East side of the few months\nAnd the the dangerous and may causing this can Asian even

you're delivering babies you're an accident trying to get somebody out of a car or there's just it's thing hoping to political\nHow how has this flipped and how are you dealing with it well it's been a very\nLooking a evolution I think because of the fire service in general you know we are kind of entrenched in tradition we still call ourselves a fire department but the reality is we've really kind of shifted the model to become all risk\nAnd ah as you alluded to you know emergency medical services are\nReally makes up about sixty to sixty three percent of our calls for service across the Prescott community and that's pretty much across the Prescott base and but all risk means ah you know we're kind of a Jack of all trades we do emergency medical services\nA technical rescue we have a a very robust trail system here that sometimes people overextend themselves in and put themselves into trouble for themselves and we ended up having to go out and effective rescue\nA hazardous materials or is part of our game now um terrorism in next is a we have a role there with active shooters and those kinds of things that we work\nVery hand in hand with our law enforcement\nAnd then you know back to the fire and uh\nSo we've kind of diverse apart our um our ability to respond a much more of them fire we have capabilities\nAnd that's where we always kind of get a question a lot I think a lot of folks ask is you know why do we send a fire truck to an emergency medical call while the reality is much like a plumber has to take his tools to the scene of to do plumbing work we need to take our tools\nDo we send a fire truck to an emergency medical call while the reality is much like a plumber has to take his tools to the scene of to do plumbing work we need to take our tools and our tools just come in a bigger vehicle and it allows us to respond to our risks\nWell and and the term covers all of that it truly does whether you're pulling somebody out of a creek or the area they shouldn't be are taking\nGoing over and getting somebody out for mountain that they shouldn't be do you we are you looking at some kind of fees some type of something because it's pulled you from what you would normally do in your department how do you handle in\nWell you know capacity for the organization to respond always a a major concern for me uh what I look at the as the chief executive for the department is our reliability numbers\nUh in the fire service good reliability is that a fire truck is sitting in a in a station ... roughly about seven out of ten times\nA what we are seeing in our data a views is those numbers are starting to be compressed a under Seventy percent specifically in the downtown area so at some point in the future I think that we do need to have a a solid discussion\nAbout adding capacity and uh\nYou know the reality is with more people comes more call volume I think historically if you look at it uh we stayed very flat on a personnel needs but uh the time is is fairly quickly approaching that uh we have to add some capacity to call volumes going up\nAnd part of that is a you know courtesy of Hollywood I think uh you know they've\nThey've kind of said you know if you need help this is the number you call\nAnd uh by default or a lot of stuff lands in our lab and\nFrankly when somebody calls nine one one that's their time of need and they need some assistance it's gotten beyond their scope to handle and we're kind of the uh persons that we can come out and respond and take care of people's problems\nAnd she put expected chief it's not a thing as an all risk in in you doing that they expect\nWhen someone fall splits had an elderly person gets up in the middle of the night starts to the bathroom or to get water she falls and who who does she caught [noise]\nAnd that's exactly right to the nine one one system gets activated and\nStarts to the bathroom or to get water she falls and who who does she caught\n[noise] yeah and that's exactly right to the nine one one system gets activated and uh we respond in a you know we give him a medical assessment the you know because a lot of times it's not just walking in the dark that cause the fall and was the person lightheaded was around lying medical condition or was it just to slip trip and fall\n... chief the drug issues that are rapid right now they're calling the fire department out for over to ... [noise] yeah\nThe the um\nExpansion of the opioids are I think as a direct impact of that [noise] ah you know we kind of ... and courtesy some from the medical profession not not knowingly I think by a just accident or was see over prescription of opioids\nAnd that creates the in the mindset that of need and when the need for a prescription meds runs out in a recreational street applications come into play and that's what creates a drug problem\nBut uh you know our law enforcement colleagues also have methods in in approaches to neutralizing these effects especially when it comes to opioids are three nor can or those administration and ultimately the desire is to save the life uh\nWe don't try to act as judge and jury of two principles lifestyles we try to treat or\nWhether it is a a well respected member of this community like yourself or somebody that is just down on their luck we try to keep our ah our personal judgments to ourselves and uh we just treat people as people\nDo you see the calls are getting more on the drug overdoses or the leveling out to a point for your department I think it's actually\nKind of hit a tapering point uh I don't see an escalation uh we get a uh some very good data specific to a ... opioids and I think at the national and even the state level some of the measures taken by other levels of government is working very well to curtail that\nEspecially when it comes to replicate a prescriptions the ability to get opioids is really becoming challenging\nWell and and you also have your fire districts and you have your central yeah but I so all of these partners or out there dealing with the same thing that you're dealing with a little bit larger area population\nRight into you know vigor of it is\nPartners or out there dealing with the same thing that you're dealing and it's a little bit larger area not population\nRight into you know vigor it is still alive in our community I mean uh there's probably not a weekly goes by that we don't respond to at least one or two a substance abuse or\nType events but I Do think it is kind of starting to taper off that it is on the ... is not quite flat line but it's a it's not a big seller eating as quick as it was a perhaps a year ago\nSo I was just thinking while we were talking with severe medical colds whether they have fallen down and they can't get up you're delivering a baby or\nOther kinds of issues maybe we could start to monitor dream medical colds and you can get one of your firemen in to medical school what do you think\nYou know ... it's not unheard of but I actually I have a registered nurse are already on staff or he happens to duplicate to not only working for us but working with YMCA at the hospital on a very regular\nBasis that you are going how 'bout to snakes in the garage ... cat up the treaties still deal with those kind of issues that I see him on TV\nOh yeah well you know the snakes and that um you know snakes are normally in this a habitat up here but we still respond or I'm I've taken the approach that um I rather put eyes on it versus a six year old child taking a dads ladder and throwing it up and hitting power wires to get a

that could be handled could you know you just wear it off your grass and that's it and it is that it's when you see that fuel owed out there\nAnd a lot of people kind of ignore it I don't know whether

the aim being a place to display the artifacts from the uh element of uh the aftermath of the the tragedy and secondary is to honor the memory of the last ... with the eventual undertaking to\nCreate a a platform for learning about wildfire in our community and I'm you know right at the moment it's more on the on during the last but I think that will shift or\nTheir words or you know in their

that we're such cold hearted people in this you know in this area I I just it just takes me back to think\nThat you know these people have so much and that's one of my comment is that the family should pay for this memorial because they got some money badly extra money but boy they lost a lot and uh you know I just wanted to make that comment I think that's pretty low\nThen I appreciate that

Center for the arts over in stage two is doing there ah annual ghost talk performance\nUm it's a different than it was for many years but for the second year in a row it's in stage too and I wrote the script for them okay and go talk ghost talk it's an annual ... Center for the arts Halloween event and it's coming up the last weekend in October\nThere is a lot of folks that have asked me since I've had you on the show uh that want to know where in the world stage to\n... it's a ... it's the hard to find it is the entrances in a in an alley hits in the alley directly behind ... books which means you should park out on the street or in a local parking lot\nAnd you walk down the alley there and you'll find the alley between marina and Cora toes\nOkay and how many people how many people that actually hold\nWell fire regulations make that very they only allow a certain number of people in the building at a time I think about fifty a so depending on how many people are in the cast can cut into the audience size that you're allowed to sell tickets for but let's say a\nAverage uh depending on a cast size you can have about maybe forty or forty plus people into each performance so\nIs it mostly a readers theater there do they do other stuff do they do they do other smaller cast plays\nInto each performance so is it mostly a readers theater there do they do and there's no they do they do\nOther smaller cast plays in a ... some that are maybe are a little more well daring and they would want to see on the main stage\nToday I have heard and then you can tell me if I'm wrong I've heard that they are embarking upon a fundraising effort to do some remodeling and also enlarging oppressive perform performing arts that is correct\nThey're looking at building a whole new small theatre facility on the parking lot next door to them and that would encompass uh moving the stage to productions up there among many other things so OK you think that will be successful\nUm it probably will on stage to has been pretty good and if they move it up there ah it'll have a larger seating capacity for those particular shows I don't\nSee why it wouldn't do well so the ... round the back side of the old church then that parking lot yes okay and so they're my understanding is is they're just getting ready to kick that thing off yeah they're doing a capital fundraising campaign for ups you know how much they're looking at it a try and raise\nYou know I've been told but I don't remember but a new facility like that would probably cost at least like a at least a couple of million to build I Would think\nWell it'll be interesting to see what happens and if you want to call him feel free to do so with ... and you're hosting Blair here on the cable I see friday PM show by for one what is your one six five four one once you're once in a
