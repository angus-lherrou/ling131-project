home and uh by the time I got to my grandmother's house my neck was stiff and or had body aches a high fever I went to lie down on this little bed my grandmother had in the kitchen\nAnd ah that's where she took naps I guess when she was cooking but anyway I I I was lying down and the the relatives started coming over and saying things like oh this is what happened to your cousin when he got polio and this is what happened to your older brother when he got sick and died the next day so they were just scaring the heck out of me\nAnd uh my grandmother my mother was very upset and I kind of drifted off into asleep and then I woke up\nA few hours later and ah I saw this really bright light up in the ceiling between the beams and this old farmhouse\nAnd the ceiling and it was very warm it was very bright it was in the ...\nWhat I Would call in angelic shape and it kind of a humanoid shape and uh the ... the best thing about it was that I felt like everything would be okay I didn't have any more worries I I I I felt fine I went back to sleep and\nWhen I woke up in the morning I was completely well I didn't have any any health issues at all and my mother and my grandmother said it was a ah\nWent back to sleep and when I woke up in the morning I was completely well I didn't have any any health issues at all and my mother and my grandmother said it was a a a miracle and that was my

clear vision of him and he told me all about his\nThe spirit world you know his uh his after like what is after life was like and it was quite detailed\nAnd a ... he he actually gave me the the name of the book timeless that's that comes from my friend gene\nBut uh he told me that in in the spirit world that he was in there is there's no there's no future there is no past it just as he said I just am it's just all the present everything is just present and he said it was it was very it was a very nice and uh he had\nNo more but I don't hear about it or I start to stop stop Dr talking to Dr

experienced doctor\nOkay sure so uh I was Eighteen years old living in my brother's garage I was at a very low point in my life and a sleeping on this mattress on the on the garage a floor and ah all of a sudden a this\nGarage I was at a very low point in my life\nAnd a sleeping on the mattress on the on the garage a floor and ah all of a sudden a this call them a fire appeared or from the foot of the mattress or my feet were and and went in an arc over my head as so probably you know I don't know when six feet up in the air and an ark\nAnd it was it was moving like a like a river fire and there was this low guttural voice that was speaking in some kind of language I didn't understand and ah I pinch myself I slap myself just to make sure I was awake and I was awake and this probably went on for about five minutes although it seems longer than that\nIt was it was terrifying and and I uh\nI got up and I I called my girlfriend and I told her what had happened and then she\nTold me to come over and she was quite worried about me she said come over in the morning and ah I did and then when I was there she told me well you should maybe we should call a psychiatrist and I said well just forget about it and don't worry about it maybe it was just a dream but if it wasn't it was\nReal higher and I think what\nNo I've yeah and it was column ... column fire engulfed you while you were sleeping while you were in bed well\nIt was like a river of fire a column that went over my head in an arc shape it wasn't a engulfing he was over me you know\nThis is talk of Bruce all over so

weren't being able to get out on bail\nI and I understand where that is coming from but then part of the bail system is then it gives a financial incentive for somebody to go get the person if they don't show up for court\nSo there is a downside I understand that this makes it better for people who are lower income because they were not able to get out on bail whereas wealthy people could so there's pluses and minuses on either side\nI Do like a good financial incentive there's no doubt about that and I'm I'm very fond of those however uh I find it at first off the idea that uh if jails the punishment then it shouldn't be the thing that you're given before the punishment then you're punished for the arrest or something right and like\nThat that there have been all kinds of studies that show that for jury trials specifically if the defendant enters the courtroom wearing the prisoner orange or blue or whatever the color is\nAnd they're handcuffed juries are more likely to find

didn't intend to harm anyone right so\nThis is a story that I'm about to relate not out of California but I Do remember there was the a storied few months ago out of Alabama where a couple of\nTeenage guys were you know basically up to no good had broken into some houses a cop shot one of the guys in the back yard and somebody that was with the group\nWild up getting charged with a felony murder that'll happen yeah even though he didn't have a weapon he never shot a weapon and he never fired a weapon he'd ever stab never did anything but because someone died in the commission of the crime and he was charged with felony murder\nYes that is held in selling murder a law works there's also the misdemeanor manslaughter rule in many states where if you're committing a misdemeanor for example example shoplifting and somebody dies then you can be convicted manslaughter\nI wasn't familiar with that one interesting so going on here is as long as the accomplishment an accomplice murder someone in one instance reported by the Marshall project five teenagers went to buy marijuana at a house near Malibu in Nineteen Ninety five\nFour were convicted of murder after one of them fatally stabbed someone during the drug deal most were sentenced to life in prison under this new law most a murder convictions and these felony cases would be limited to the person who actually committed the killing those who assisted the killer and intend to take um intended to take a life\nThose that participated in the felony well acting with reckless indifference to human life or the bill would apply retroactively allowing hundreds of people who are currently serving time for felony murder disproportionately women and young men of color to petition\n... apply retroactively allowing hundreds of people who are currently serving time for felony murder disproportionately women and young men of color to petition the court for shorter sentences and the Nineteen eighties the state's Supreme Court described the felony murder role as a barbaric policy from a bygone age\nAnd I as a person who was convicted under that basically this felony one murder law\nThe perky guy provides the lowest price

have one gesture or our talk calf\nI'm like that's the way I listen to the show so\nAre you guys at all familiar with that Ernest Hancock a show a clear independent\nYeah we are going to get him on the liberty radio network in L. A. R. N. dot of him and I've been to er nice house and I've sat in his show live from Phoenix\nRight well what he does with his a recording of the show\nIs he will a record not just what a what he's talking now while on the air but he also or conversations that are being had er during the break so if you guys like that go on that be great\nIf I did that I Would only do it for example fires and um yeah I I I\nI think what Ernie does he connects through something called a ... to the liberty radio network and most of his guest aren't in his studio they're connecting to him via phone call\nAnd he sets up his recorder and the heat it's record at the beginning of his show at nine o'clock eastern and he stops it\nEither at noon or whatever his conversation with the person winds up the ending the conversation which he's had shows go until like one thirty in the afternoon because Ernie likes to talk\nYeah I've noticed that he puts out a lot of content at like I Can't lift thinks all this delete delete but\nYou're telling me to go about doing something that you delete [laughter]\nNot not necessarily just like you guys are you guys would that put out or not the same amount of uh like you could put on your way mouth content or that you\nNormally do with the show it's just that instead\nOf putting out extra stuff that no one\nSo basically you want the pod cast to be forty minutes longer and contain a lot of silence\nYeah 'cause that's the thing is is that I'm a ... or early talker here in the studio I um it's it's kinda rough for new folks like Laurel [laughter] we're just [noise] even looking at stuff on our laptops or whenever the boring during the banks yeah it's boring guys aren't actually having like\nNew folks like Laurel were just either looking at stuff on your own laptops or whatever I mean pretty boring during the banks yeah it's boring\nGuys aren't actually having like\nOther generally we are not better now okay\nYeah okay so anyway ah to the top\nYeah oh that was a guy like\nUm okay so the topic is what I Would call the unanimous consent that\nAre now yesterday you guys were talking about a voting and how your vote doesn't matter which is absolutely true your vote\nDoes not matter because at no point will you ever have a circumstance where your votes make or break and I'll watch\nOr anything else for that matter however\nAnd before I a life or I'd like to preface that this is\nEssentially nothing nothing less than like a pipe dream I realized that the likelihood of that\nDo but you know when you when you start using terms like never I must a point out that I've had two instances\nI'm In the town I used to live in where I in fact was the deciding vote to different times in one case I was there in one case I wasn't in one case something passed because I wasn't there and the other case something didn't pass because I was\nAnd so it's possible if you have a small enough group of people write it when it's a town where I have seen a hundred people and it's a town meeting on a budgetary concern and two hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty people are in a school gymnasium then it's possible statistically that there might be historically\nPossible but a very improbable\nRight and this wasn't a fifty right even though it has to be by ... I'm sixty five sixty six percent so that makes a the math a little more likely that you're gonna do you have an effect maybe as to how many five percent it's even more likely so\nBut but here's here's the so there's like three hundred sixty million Americans are in the United states\nYou know what I'm saying around a hundred and twenty yards honestly thought okay you're twenty three thirty yeah and then there are different cultures\nUm life standard spinner laid it out\nVery well in\nThe constitution and no authority that\nPeople that claim to represent you don't actually represent\nA hub for numerous raids and they don't have power of attorney they they are not response or are you for any of the action or\nAs an enemy he wrote that actions are Eighteen\nThey don't have power of attorney they they are not responsible for any of the action\nAs enemy he wrote that actions are Eighteen\nSeventy back when there was still a mandate on having a certain amount of representatives per per a certain number of citizens\nUm now they don't\nAnd I'm\nThe only way that that a a so called representative could\nActually represent you\nIs if everyone\nIf if everyone I had an animal agreement on who their representatives would be\nAnd then those representatives was euros\nNot on the point of that I mean we all know the politicians can't possibly represent us one hundred percent so\nSo the idea and I and again that's a pipe dream\nJust bear with me on this job but the idea would be that\nUm have what would be called the unanimous consent act which would essentially no fight any laws that were passed with out unanimous consent prior to the act of being put in place\nAnd then uh all other acts or after a or all all legislation after the act being put in place would have to be passed with unanimous consent\nAny votes are in the sense to the uh\nThe uh to further acts um\nWould basically put the brakes on things and and it would not be able to\nPresent or I you know I\nI used to be a Quaker and everything in meeting house had to be done unanimously and we never get anything done we can never reaching a unanimous decision on anything\nNow have kind of the point he said to me is allowed to touch the average kid will not pass any laws like no longer shall pass no law or my five favorite words in the constitution unfortunately there are a bunch of other words that followed that right\nYeah there's there's nothing like a um being sitting through a meeting for business or the Quaker Meeting to uh you know disabuse you've those notions [noise]\nIt it could take a long time to get things done but one would presume if the most August legal minds are in our nation happened to be sitting together in a room that they should be able to come together a unanimously in and make the very best laws are\nRight and and that sounds great higher [laughter] it's a hard concept of this\nBe to create a system that's by design creates gridlock so much though\nRight and and it sounds great higher concept\nOf it would be to create a system that's by design creates gridlock so much so that while while the bureaucrats and politicians are recurring\nIn Olympia, Washington or

C. A. and of course don't forget the website at K. Y. C. H. dot info\nAlong with dusty Baker good morning hey I'm your host ... thanks for joining us this morning\nAs we begin another week of news talk commentary and conversation right here on the news we're glad to have you on board this morning of feel free to join in the conversation give us a call\nFive four one one zero one six let us hear from you five four one one zero one six we can take your comments and questions\nFive four one one zero one six\nWell we certainly had a change of seasons storms Saturday Night to fall arrived with a vengeance even had some hail and snow around different parts of town up on the mountains\nOr next few days are looking a little better though sunny but it's still cool days where did all this thing come from Eric sure came in with a war\nThat was a big low pressure from the came down from the northwest through the central ... well arrived here on Saturday Night\nYeah I'd let us all know it was here that's for sure loud loud all night long a\nStorms have been hanging around noon course tropical storm real came through earlier but I'm In a case here we are in October fall weather in full swing so\nWell before we get on to anything else in there is a lot of it big shout out to the badgers and\nIn full swing so\nWell before we get on to anything else in there is a lot of it big shout out to the badgers and bears\nWho played one of the best high school football games I've ever heard a last friday night John rustic course along with Kelly quarters had the call here on cable I ca\nBadgers came out on top ended the bears and beaten streak for the season it was touching go right down to the final whistle the badgers tried to give it away and to\nManage to hang on they put their best foot forward even a ... a big flurry of yellow flags if you missed it a missed the call\nHere on on cable I see a mistake great game what a way to emphasize the local rivalry really was really was good so we'll see how this season finishes up for the the two teams with a couple of games left to go\nAnd let's see\nToday is the last day to register to vote in the November general election\nIs the habit of some candidates hiring friends and family members of his campaign staff and paying them out of the taxpayer dollars the public financing dollars keeping the money bloody and house I guess you could you\nCould say maybe I could hire dusty and we'll we'll run or he could hire nepotism hire him hey you know nepotism as the game the whole family can play there you go there you go [laughter] [noise] anyway the lesson on all all the propositions all four of them\nIs to study up and make certain that the vote you cast on the proposition reflects your vision of the way the system's concerned should be run and that they reflect your priorities for the use of tax dollars\nAre just like one twenty six one twenty seven the use of tax dollars is at stake so uninformed vote\nFor the use of tax dollars are just like one twenty six one twenty seven the use of tax dollars is at stake so uninformed vote\nIs what's required after all it is your money and that there you are that they're dealing with and you might want to keep an eye on how it's obtained and where it's spent\nWell the one other interesting uh Arizona election items to pay attention to is the retention elections are concerning the state Supreme Court ah interesting those usually don't get a much attention\nBut this time it's a significant the matter of fact the wall Street Journal carried an editorial on October third or concerning what's going on here in Arizona about those retention votes\nOr because of the recent teachers' strike and the ruling of the Supreme Court here in the state that kept in in properly constructed tax increase proposition off the ballot\nOr the union has targeted a justice Clint ball like and Justice John P lander\nFor defeat in their retention election next month or the proposition that was circulating was intended to raise the top Arizona income tax rate to eight percent and to create a new nine percent rate\nAt which by the way would have surpassed the rates in New York and New Jersey of all places anyway the court found that the proposals a circulating was a improperly constructed\nAs so it's a proponents instead of going back in correcting what the court ruled was the problem [noise] want to oust two of the judges that are made that ruling I guess in in retribution\nBut let's take a a quick break from all the heavy stuff and look to are you can't make this stuff up segment for today a\nNASA I'm moving forward to return us astronauts to space on its own rockets you know we've been paying the Russians for carrying arm in to the space station\nUm we find out one of the things that NASA does is\nAnd paying the Russians for carrying arm in to the space station\nUm we find out uh one of the things that NASA does is to study the smell of items that are being lifted into space to see if they smell bad\nA seems the environment in orbit affects the older properties of the things that are set up there and many of them have smells\nWhich the astronauts find obnoxious or in some cases even sickening uh because weightlessness poses its own nausea problems you can imagine\nA bad odors seemed to make the problem worse like what yeah well [laughter]\n\nAnyway a there's a fellow named Mr Aldrich George Aldrich\nFor forty four years and he has studied these various items to see if they smell bad Aldrich has examined over eight hundred different objects for their reactions to the environment\nUm didn't apparently the orbital cycle the Ninety minute day night cycle causes he changes and uh that exacerbates the odor problem\nIn ways that a ground based studies can't can't to determine interestingly enough Velcro it turns out is one of the worst offenders no kidding yeah\nAre they tested the components of Velcro separately and there's no problem and there is no problem with them being separate in orbit\nBut when combined and put in the space craft Velcro ... reaction to the environment is very offensive it really is a bad odor\nAldrich a sad we expected they would pass the test but when we tested them on a scale of older for one item registered three point six and another three point eight\nAre both really high in the revolt things smell arrange\nIt I've never I'm a sensitive knows and they can pick up a you know the this this latest Doderer of that but ah I've never noticed the same thing about Velcro nope apparently it only happens in orbit okay so maybe maybe this would be a good\nPerson George Aldrich for uh the uh TV show about dirty jobs to\nIn order but okay so maybe maybe this would be a good a person George Aldrich for uh the uh TV show about dirty jobs to [laughter]\nInterview interview ham and do a segment on on Mr altered and on his his occupation and make make sure things don't smell bad in orbit so wow who who knew it was a problem\nAnd I got two words to words to solve this activated charcoal there there you go yeah had worked for can't so you know it's might as well work for the guys in space\n[noise] some things you just can't make it up it off yeah All right\nWell of course uh we all know now that the Kavanaugh nomination and confirmation battle is over\nThe justice will actually was sworn in will actually take his seat on the court today\nSo without getting into the merits of the case for or against ah the experience we just went through kind of highlights the importance of the U.S Senate\nAnd the majority party control of that body Congress for future legislation and for all the federal appointments and judicial appointments I'd have to go through that uh\nThat Senate confirmation just yesterday in the aftermath of the confirmation vote Tom ... who's the chairman of the Democratic National Committee\nUsed as a result as a fundraising effort stating that the Republicans need to quote pay a price\nFor the confirmation of Kavanaugh um since a change of only two Senate seats this year would change in the majority both sides are course pulling out all the stops in an effort to get their candidates elected\nUh eight states or the Senate election is critical Arizona being one of those are the other side of a Senate races in Florida\nIndiana Missouri Montana Nevada North Dakota and Tennessee or in North Dakota senator Heitkamp a Democrat apparently recognize she's losing she's trailing by double digits in her election\nSo she voted against Kavanaugh in opposition to the voters of her state\nAnd Senator Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri did uh like what\nKavanaugh in opposition to the voters of her state\nAnd Senator Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri did uh likewise those seats may change hands\nAnd of course here in Arizona a change is also possible with a a congressional representative cinema the Democrat betting it battling it out against a representative makes Sally the Republican\nFor the seat that's being vacated by Jeff Flake change your party there could be the difference in the majority in the next Congress\nA sentiment served for several terms in the state legislature before running for the house in twenty twelve\nAnd ... he was first elected to office in Congress in twenty four dean really comes down to issues of economics and a border security\nMakes Sally was late to the border issue but now strongly supports\nBoth increased to border security and the wall\nOf cinema um opposes those efforts in the wall while supporting her party's position on abolishing ice so\nA lot of things to a lot of things to consider there and we are headed toward the bottom of the hour right here on the news one of three point five FM fourteen

start here for us to get through to you a forty six militarily ...\nJust time and we believe is true I start where I start here for us to get through to you it forty six militarily\n\nOkay we're ... we're thinking today with Dr John Haas from Embry riddle Dr John ... associate professor of cyber intelligence and security or the College of security and intelligence that every middle and we're talking about\nSome things that we can do a here today or are you in your home with your computer or in your office these are some things that we can all do so that's why yes\nYeah we we can improve our cyber hygiene and our stance and we all use user names and passwords everywhere [noise]\nOne of the things is how do you make a good password and what is a strong password because there's a website you can go to that list the top ten million most common passwords and you'd say why would they want to do that well these days which you can do is you can attack systems at such a high speed\nThat they can just keep trying over and over and over until they break into yours\nAnd of course the ... the top one is something crazy like password one two three four five six say well no one way or ever use that but people actually do\nOkay so now to self don't use password one two three four five six as your password saying there's going to say there's so many people out there right now going great you just gave bypass\nSurgery they already have it [laughter] um but you say well how can I create a password that I'll be able to remember\nAnd these days one of the things because we need so many of them you might consider getting a password manager and a password manager is something you can have on your phone and it lists all of your passwords but it has a password to get into then that's the last password you have to remember\nAnd you can make it a strong one like for instance a strong one is like thirty characters long you say but how can I remember three characters but isn't there a dance that you had when you're a child and you remembered this song oh baby I Want to be with you [laughter] no one else is going to get that you include the spaces in it\nThat your password the odds of being able to crack that very very low\nBut isn't that the essentially putting all your eggs in one basket\nWell so one of the nice things about that is that if they did break into it it'd be encrypted so the passwords can be seen unless they're able to break it\nWell so one of the nice things about that is that if they did break into it it'd be encrypted so the passwords can be seen unless they're able to break it and you can do what's called this the next one two factor authentication\nThat is I Can't get into unless I put in my password and give some other piece of evidence as to who I Am\nA a lot of places are going there banks sometimes do that where you have to have not only a pin but you have to have your card so that's two distinct factors something you know the pin and something you have the card okay then we're moving now to a third factor something you are\nLike your eyeball or your fingerprint or the way that you talk\nAnd that's very hard to impersonate\nNow you're talking about scanning the ice you're putting your thumb print yes on a program or an app or something\nRight or you've probably seen that some of the new smartphones up oh so\nIt might not even not un without my finger my fingerprint riots can't even get on it yeah yeah\nSo so that's called biometrics so that's adding an additional layer we call it defense in depth the more ways that we can make it hard for somebody to attack us\nThen more secure that were being ... and uh this is a it looks like an apple product and so they're shipping it with every phone\nSo that it's included and then you're more secure and people don't think about it but you have to keep updating your software you have to update because as soon as software or a vulnerability is found then that vulnerability is actually broadcast\nOut so that people will know to fix it but unfortunately that means if you don't fix it the bad guys know to start looking for all those people that haven't upgraded\nBecause now they can be attacked it's like shooting fish in the barrel as they said\nRight now so would this be something that um your students for example at Embry riddle and they graduate from Embry riddle and they go looking for a job\nThey would be looking for a job you know obviously in cyber security but it could be a maybe working for Macy's in cyber security or working for a target or that's right so that's what they do\nThat's right they work for any number of companies because every single company has a cyber security issue today because can you name a company that is not using a computer\nThat's right they work for any number of companies because every single company has a cyber security issue today because can you name a company that is not using a computer\nIt's really hard I mean even the convenience store has their point of sale register that is a computer right it looks like a cash register but it's not\nAnd grocery stores because you know you get your coupons online today so every single sector and there's now Seventeen of them they just added elections as the seventeenth critical infrastructure because we now know that that could be attacked\nAnd there are seven states right now that don't have paper backup and they said to the national Security Agency what should we do they said at paper ballots ...\nBut we just spent a bunch of millions of dollars to get rid of the paper ballots you're saying to go backwards\nYes we are luckily Arizona or does have paper ballots as backups if something were to go wrong\nSee how far we go ahead and how far we go back it's like a cycle it goes circle back around pretty soon there'll be telling everybody don't do anything but right down and piece of paper and hide it in your you know in your file cabinet or something the way we used to do it back in the day or heaven forbid we use the carbon remember the carbon\nCarbon carbon copy yeah now now that's students say well that's the cc line on the email isn't it\nYeah and they probably don't even know what that means\nThey're just it's just must mean that somebody else is being copied email is ... and you know millennials about a third of them are sharing their passwords with their friends 'cause they're not thinking about it but don't share your passwords with anyone well\nNot even that they're signing it in on other people's phones on their friends phones so it's so much easier to look up your Instagram on your other friends don't say your parents took your phone away or whatever they're now looking up on their phones or ... chat and their Instagram and all their passports already loaded on their their friends so it's so this is a form\nOf them sneaking when when they've been told for example for sure they can't go on the phone they go to their friends phone ... used okay wow that's pretty crazy\nAnd that's why they have to share the password because they need to know how to log in right so we don't really want to be sharing passwords because it's like communicable diseases we just don't want to share them right [laughter] but you use your security software\nYeah and that means keeping up to date with your anti virus but when a windows or another application says it's time to update do it right\nPretty software yeah and that means keeping up to date with your anti virus but when a windows or another application says it's time to update do it\nRight well and then uh you know on the a list of some of the other things as well getting back to that so the number one thing would be change your passwords and change them Austin is that right\nWell no you actually that's the thing if you have strong passwords there's no need to change them\nUm unless it's been compromised okay so you know that old thing of changing your password that's when they were weak passwords uh but now that we're restricting it and saying you should make a strong password no you you make a nice strong password and\nThe odds of it are like the age of the universe if you have like a thirty character like that song that I did hear\nA ... for them to try and brute force crack that\nWould take them too long so instead just like the barest story they find somebody who's not as well protected\nRight so then the other thing the other thing we're going to talk about as soon as we get back here from our break is uh keeping your anti virus up to date is it so the anti virus is a very crucial part\nYou bet it's part of that defense in depth yeah because the antivirus knows some of the important malware to try and keep out\nOkay let's finish that thought up when we get back and we'll be right back we can take a quick break and please feel free to call in to a five four one one zero one sex [noise]\nHigh I'm Ida come see me and the rest of the family at the frame and I the best friend artwork ever had to twenty nine with curly downtown\n[noise]\nAnd we're ... we're having a top today I'm very very important issues that affect all of us and we're speaking with Dr John Haas and\nAnd we have here in ... mother of five who's experienced some of these concerns that myself as a grandmother thank God my my kids are raised and gone because this will be a ... all new challenge I think for a working mom\nSome of these concerns that myself as a grandmother thank God my my kids are raised and gone because this will be a ... all new challenge I think for a working mom especially you need it this is a fulltime job for you to stay on top of this I Know it's very difficult\nUm we have a caller real quick John uh we're going to take your Johnny they're wrong take your question do you have a question for Dr Hauser\nAaron great God actually actually I've got\nTo want is I don't do any social media whatsoever opaque record nothing but my first names on my computer and then the second thing that I'm actually still on dial up so I'm just wondering if that makes me feel safer or face [laughter]\nWell you know what I have a sneaking suspicion someday we're all going to be looking for those dial up cell phones I don't know Dr ... how how would you answer that is he I mean are they still in the phone lines\nWill so dial up just means your motive connecting to the Internet and it just means it's a little slower to get in and out but you'll notice most emails or just text and so it's relatively fast and my guess is you're dial up is still a sixty four kilometers connection which is a far cry from those old\n[laughter] ...\nOf the past [laughter] that's so true so I think the answer to that is no you're just going to get hacked slower than the rest of us [laughter] well\nMy point is that what they were all going dial a mate I Can't get anywhere a good guy out of some by somebody else\nWas true that it would be boring for them um because it would it would be a slower speed um but don't make you think that that prevents you from being attacked other ways because you could go to you still browse ah on websites sure and you still get email\nReally only through my insurance company or life day or things of that\nNature where we were just talking about spear fishing and so someone can pretend to be you're in a bank and they would just do a guest and say ... Wells Fargo customer and you would get an email the looks alone like Wells Fargo it smells like Wells Fargo it's got the right address it's got the right email address\nAnd says click here because we're concerned that somebody might have attacked your account\nAnd you might make the mistake of clicking on it\nYeah those kind of thing that I actually delete I had a email come through last week I had no clue who was\nThe lead it at that you can click on it ...\nClicking on it I think I actually delete I email come true last week I had no clue what was the lead it click on it [noise]\n... thing to do because those are all avenues absolutely yeah 'cause you just did the next one called when in doubt throw it out\n[laughter] that's a great line [laughter] well thank you thank you John\nI'm so Dr ... we were going to talk real quick too about browser safety\nRight you know or he just mentioned he didn't doesn't use email much but he's still browsers so all of us are out there are wandering around on the great Internet the worldwide Web and one of the things we're might not be aware of is that there's different settings that you can have where it\nEither keeps track of you or is it a\nNotices things about you and oftentimes the browser will say this Web sites keeps cookies do you want to allow that [noise] and on your browser if you have chrome or Firefox or even Internet Explorer\nSafari these are the leading ones you can go into your settings and you can ask it to not keep cookies you can say don't remember me you can disallow\nOr the website from downloading special applications because if you don't do that you'll be surprised to find out that there's\nFive six even a dozen various programs running on your browser\nThat are finding out information about you what your linking to what you're clicking on what tabs they're open all of that information can be accessed if you allow it on your settings OK want your most strict settings that you can do and usually they label them\nUm public um\nWork home do you trust these do the one that says I don't trust anyone what can you just also quickly for for all of us dummies explain what cookies are sure cookies is just a little tiny piece of data that is stored on your computer and it allows the\nCompany when you come back to that site to recognize you so for instance you can say remember my password remember my username remember my preferences and that cookie is a file that uh goes ahead and save that information you know\nUnique format I'll put it that way also\nSo I was talking to you about my search over the weekend for a down comfort her so I went\nAnd save that information you know unique format I'll put it that way\nAlso so I was talking to you about my search over the weekend for a down comfort her so I went on to a site was way fair ... you know a store called way fair\nAnd the next thing I Know I'm being blasted on that little side panel of my window with every other company you know in the United states I guess it was selling down ... it so it it isn't private you think you're on a private site that you're really not how does that happen when they know what you're looking for\nWell my guess is that you use the age old a search engine called Google to did yes and Google and when you sign up to use Google and get an account it says everything you type in as ours everything you talk about as ours and we can do whatever we want\nWith it oh my gosh okay well now that's that's news\nYes and every system for which you don't pay like Google\nOr any of those things Gmail if you're not paying for it you are the product and the advertisers are the ones that are purchasing you and your the clerk so not only are the you the worker but you are also the target for all the advertisements\nSo is there an alternative is there something that a person could do to create a more private search where it doesn't go out there so obviously you don't want to use Google\nWell Google does offer privacy setting almost all of the systems do because they realize that some people will stop using them if they don't do that and there's other things you can do such as um creating a virtual private network\nOr you can have a proxy some of these are more complicated but it's remarkable how easy some of these things are to do that can help with your\nPrivacy well my gosh that's crazy I'm Scott do we have time to take another call from John real quick okay go ahead John did you have another quick question\nThat we're going to go to break [laughter] are you there yeah yes I'm here okay go ahead I recently bought\nA a cell phone [noise] ha ha and about a week later I heard it on the radio at the federal government was telling people\nThat were an employee told jurors and things of that nature not divide ethical or sell it can do anything about [noise]\nYes unfortunately I Do [noise] Z. T. is a Chinese company and there are a number of a Chinese products out there\nAbout [noise] yes unfortunately\nI Do\nThe tea is a Chinese company and there are a number of a Chinese products out there that have inside of them a form of malware built into them\nAnd so unfortunately they're able to track you at a much greater rate in China now there is no such thing as privacy because I can only use government approved software now and so one of the things that were concerned about with these products is that they are getting into our supply chain\nWe just discovered another largest supplier of servers\nTo the Internet and they it turns out had hardware malicious systems built into every server so we have to watch for that\nSee those nasty Chinese that's what they're doing they're they're getting in the arts supplying that's with everything and uh you just never know I mean it's well it's been much more aware\nThey are but they published this they said in Nineteen Ninety five that they're going to be world dominating\nAnd so they are not doing it they're not being secretive about it yeah they are now they've let us know and when I was talking to a person there and they said well if you are so important why don't you protected better\nYeah exactly oh my gosh [laughter] hey listen we're going to take one more break 'em stay tuned takes John for the call appreciate it and we'll be right back\nOn TALK Klein who climbed properties investments fall is just around the corner and if you're thinking about selling your home consider this now is a great time so before we get into the holiday months\nThe Prescott market continues to be very active let me show you how my list of ready buyers\nWho are interested in buying right now before the holidays your home may already be sold for a while now you've heard me talk about why I should be your realtor it's pretty simple I saw my home's five times faster and make my soul there's five percent more money on average that's twelve thousand dollars more on average\nI'm uh Prescott native and proud military veteran helping families just like yours everyday don't risk losing precious equity and cash called me for a no obligation appointment or second opinion at night to wait for for three eight five zero three", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott", "day": "08"}
