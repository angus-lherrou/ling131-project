morning report Jason's I'm a lot of my guests on K ... this morning is Doug ... is a spokesman for the Arizona department of transportation down in Phoenix Doug good morning\nGood morning Jason good to be with you how you doing today I'm doing great um as long as everybody's cooperating as far as being safe drivers\nThere you go So Doug we wanted to talk to you about a couple of things going on with a dot that affects us up here a little bit and affects everybody really first of all of course we've been hearing a lot over the last few years over the improvements to interstate Seventeen are particularly\nThe flex lanes that are about to begin construction or between sunset wanting to ... canyon city a town on interstate Seventeen but also there's some other improvements going on as well uh\nThat's part of this project or can you give us a little bit of a timeline as to what's going to happen with all of this\nWell Jason I'd love to say that it's going to start tomorrow but I'm a ... we're just not able to do that without the funding that will be involved so\nUm we are looking ahead and it's not that far away to look ahead to the year twenty Twenty one four major projects to begin along eyes Seventeen\nOr in the area north of anthem in the new river area on up through sunset point and\nThat's what's going to be focused on a as we look ahead and so the timeline would be\nObviously still studying things that need to be done along the court or a and then you would get into the design of a project of but we are looking ahead to as you mentioned the construction of flex lanes\nAnd idea that might be new to us some folks who are listening\nWill I Believe this is something that a legislators in our area\nAnd and some sort of solution and this seems to be the best one a is there any uh any thought I mean in terms of this\nAnd and some sort of solution and this seems to be the best one a is there any uh any thought I mean in terms of these these are lanes that are not just going to be used in the event of an emergency or traffic accidents or they could be used on a more regular basis correct\nThat is correct now flex lanes that of obviously gives us flexibility and so that's what that's all about uh\nIt's additional capacity for carrying traffic or in that a tricky section of I Seventeen or north of black canyon city on up to sunset point and that's what we're looking at\nThese lanes uh which would operate\nAs a separate two lane facility\nA next to the existing south bound lanes and that would be separated by barrier wall so they would not be part of the south bound lanes they would be their own facility and would help ease a I Seventeen congestion a north of Phoenix a barrier wall as I mentioned would separate uh these uh lanes\nAllowing us to double the traffic capacity in one direction or at any one time so that's what we're looking ahead to that\nOf the flex planes will be designed with the gates systems or movable barriers at either end uh allowing them to be used for one direction of travel as needed so ah the example that we give to folks is a north bound traffic is heavier on a friday afternoon\nOf folks traveling up north from the valley\nAnd um that's where those lanes would come into play the ability to go from two to four lanes of total capacity that gives you that flexibility and then of course\nSouth bound for example on say a Sunday afternoon or a Monday holiday you'd be able to use those lanes for South bound traffic\nAnd of course I'm if an incident such as a crash or disabled vehicle were ... were to come into play in that area of these flex lanes could be open to move traffic beyond the closure uh and of course at least within the area between black cannon city in sunset point\nAnd many of us as drivers are familiar with the fact that sometimes we do have those incidents and traffic comes to a standstill especially in that area\nOkay well dug right now we're going to punish briefly for an important message here in the morning report and when we come back when I talked to a little bit about another problem\nEspecially in that area okay\nWell dug right now we're going to punish briefly for an important message or in the morning report and when we come back when I talked to a little bit about another problem that we've been seeing cropping up lately on Arizona's highways and that's wrong way drivers for right now let's pause we'll\nBe right back\nHi we hear from city press get water resource management join us Wednesday October seventeenth at noon at the press get public library for our next waters might drop by drop presentation\nOur tents interactive educational presentation will discuss how the city determines watermelon more have property together will learn how to become a water starring again that's October Seventeen at noon at the Prescott public library the there for more information the press the water dot com\nWe're back you're on the news fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's a lot of my guest is Doug mental spokesman for Arizona department transportation and dug wrongly\nDriving seems to be a problem that has picked up in the past few years and we hear quite a bit about it mostly in the valley but we've had a few experiences up here as well ah what is he doing\nTo help combat this problem\nWill Jason in addition to a state wide measures that have been taking place for several years now and that would include\nA larger and lowered wrong way or do not enter signs at a interchange ramps the off ramps ah we've done some other things such as the addition of\nUh the larger white pavement arrows that are outlined were with a reflective markers that point the right way on off ramps a these are obviously\nIntended to get the attention of wrong way drivers now we're also the first to say we know that is not going to stop\nA all wrong way drivers because of first and foremost this is usually a\nA case of someone being an impaired drivers so are there are some things that we're looking to do with technology and we are studying\nUm technology in the Phoenix area along interstate Seventeen or it is the wrong way vehicle detection and warning system of that is now in place or in between the eyes ten stack interchange near downtown Phoenix\nUp north to loop on a one in North Phoenix so it's a Fifteen mile stretch that now has\nThis thermal camera based system in place where the thermal cameras are set to detect wrongly vehicles as soon as they cross\nThat now has this thermal camera based system in place where the thermal cameras are set to detect wrongly vehicles as soon as they cross a line or add an off ramp or even if it were to be a vehicle that turns around on the freeway itself these\nCameras are set to detect a wrong way vehicle and immediately uh get the attention of a dots and the department of public safety so that troopers can respond that much more quickly or to a wrong way incident we've had some promising results so far Jason\nOkay so this is a new system this is something\nAs I understand uh\nOf the first or the first to put this system in place\nThis is a first than in the nation use of the thermal cameras in this way in that\nUh we have it plugged in to the uh the system is plugged in through computers right into a dodge traffic operation center so that if a wrong way vehicle trips the system is detected we are a alerted with an alarm right away the department of public safety is alerted right away\nAnd we're not waiting for nine one one calls to come in from other drivers uh troopers were able to respond very quickly uh we have had cases where those cameras or who have led to a troopers being able to bring a runway vehicle to stop without a crash occurring\nUh and then we've also noticed with the use\nOf these thermal cameras a we have flashing uh wrongly signs that are part of the system to try to alert a wrong way driver what we're seeing so far with the system is that in the majority of cases wrongly drivers on ice Seventeen and this test area are\nSelf correcting or turning around on the ramp without entering I Seventeen itself so ah again we've had some promising results we want to look ahead to the future we're going to be testing this into next year or before making some decisions about where else this might be a a valuable tool\nAlright looking forward to that expansion hopefully So Doug mental thank you for your time here\nYou have been listening to highlights of the central highlands when the news fourteen

the other day he owes me I'm old I'm fifty you're not old\nYou know the studies are telling us now that the aging process has changed dramatically I mean we're now seeing people in in the whole aging piece were really you know we always joked about it but really fifty is becoming\nA new thirty or thirty five we're we're definitely slowing down the aging process and our abilities and mobility\nIs getting better I saw a huge time the other day\nAnd it was promoted by really famous hospital that I have a lot of respect for and the billboard said Seventy is the new forty\nAnd there's a lot of truth to that with the advances that we're having now in health care it really is changing so your mind plays a huge role in this so I Want to say that to tell you this is that there's so much in store for your life you know there you are designed with a great purpose\nAnd because you get certain points in your life I Would not let age determine what that is\nBecause if if if the whatever the subconscious mind whenever you tell it it's like a computer so it doesn't have any relevance of of time it only goes by what you tell it and it it never shuts down even while you're sleeping it's been shown to the subconscious mind is still at work and so we control so much in the body\nAnd if you say you're old if you say you're you're worn out if you say you're too tired if you say you're just going to always be overweight or you'll always have diabetes or you have blood pressure because grandma and grandpa had it and so you must be okay\nYou're too tired if you say you're just going to always be overweight or you'll always have diabetes or you have blood pressure because grandma grandpa had it and so you must be you know it must be in the family line so you're going to have it if you tell yourself things over and over and over again I guess what\nYour body will make it happen mind Body Medicine is more powerful than we ever thought imaginable so I Want to tell you this to set

help you go from where you are in the current state of health to where you need to be your lifestyle is your medicine don't forget that our choices matter it was a great plan for your life you know you were designed with a purpose you got gifts and talents I don't have\nYou have abilities that that I don't have and I have abilities you don't have did you know that I tell you that because I think one of the biggest pieces that people miss with herself is knowing why they're here\nWhatever it is whether you're a mom grandma whether you are a dad had no kids or you're just you're working every single day and you've been given a certain set of\nOf abilities it's finding those in in using those to serve others so you kind of know your in your sweet spot when you're doing what you're good at\nAnd and you're making a difference in other people's lives that's what we're here for and I found that people that know their purpose that really walk in that in the making new women that that their health is pretty amazing okay the ones that don't that just kind of drifting through life I don't know why they're here don't really know what they're great skill sets are\nHave a real hard time health wise and you see that with people when they get older like the whole concept of retiring nephew retired and you you claim that and you're good with that that's that's fine it's just not for me I don't like the concept of it I don't like what it means\nBecause you've been given talent and abilities that you're supposed to use your whole life\nSo I think once you you're mentally once you tell you the brain that you're retired that it's you know it's kind of like this season where you're just going to play golf\nIf you look at the statistics that people that that do retire men or women and you look at their health their health declined and we say well when you're sixty five and you're retired you're sixty five right so it's just one of those things where you're you're older and you're the body is supposed to get sick at some point or break down or\nMean you retire you're sixty five right so it's just one of those things where you're you're older and you're the body is supposed to get sick at some point or break down or whatever and it's not the case\nThe cases that mentally you're not on point everyday mental you're not on purpose every day you see that with with moms a lot like once the kids grow up and they leave the house and they leave the ...\nEspecially if the kids become disengaged right like it's okay that go do their own thing they move halfway across the country and they have their own life and you see 'em twice a year\nWell there there's a lot to that and if a mom has all of her stuff worth in in her own purpose wrapped up in the kids well now what and you see that person get into a situation where health declined\nSome alternative telling you that is is is that you really want to get into who you are your district ... what what they're four\nAnd you'll find that great health the matter what your ages will come out of that and that's a real big key so we're talking about arthritis want to jump in on this because it's a big big topic before I get into these two points of arthritis rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis I Want to get on the phones for just a minute so let's get to marry Hi Mary\nI'm calling from my husband Mike and she kind of diagnosis and math how my question is is there a protocol for trading at math\nYou know there Mary I I'll tell you this\nMultiple sclerosis is the challenge for for so many and it it's one of those situations where most just break it down for what it is okay it's looked at as an auto immune process in the body\nThe body attacks itself and it's the actual nerve if you think about a nerve kind of like a piece of of electrical wire so you know how the electrical wire has the copper in the middle right in the middle and then it has that rubber coating around the outside that's kind of like a nerve in our body\nSo if the nerve is healthy but the ... Mile Island which is Milan is the chief around the nerve which kind of like the rubber coating on a wire\nWhat happens is the body say something wrong with that so it starts to eat that away\nAnd when that breaks down any begin eats away than it exposes the nerve the nerve because a lot more fragile and in creates a lot of dysfunction the nerves begin to lose their function and then of course they are you there in turn you lose a lot of the ability and and the function of the body and that's where you see the decline of someone\nSo really you have to look at what's going to slow the process down because right now\nAnd and the function of the body and that's where you see the decline of someone so really you have to look at what's going to slow the process down because right now in medicine and with with a lot of the the findings and the evidence as we call it\nThere is technically no cure right but but there are things you can do definitely to slow the process down and that's what it's all about it's about maintaining the highest quality of life you can when you're faced with any challenge\nThat you can for the duration and that's really what the focus needs to be on with MS so one of the keys that you want to look at and this is really interesting\nBut if you look at what makes the mile and in the body there's there's something because it was created remember this is all being built when you were in your mom right when you're in your mother and and God was developed in the body at that point all these different process for being foreign broadcast what makes them island\nIs milk so there's a milk sugar called galactose it's very different than glucose which has table sugar or is or is it a form of sugar and yet sucrose and yet and you got fructose which is the fruit sugar that's to crush this more on the table sugar\nBut the galactose is milk sugar and the the mother's milk created and built the mile and\nWhat's interesting is goats milk and goats milk yogurt anything along organic goes smell is a very similar almost the same molecular structure is human mother's milk\nAnd what's really interesting they found is that by eating the goat smell and by utilizing that galactose no sugar it can potentially help to reproduce smiling and help that grow even better or prevent the breakdown of it\nAs well so is that is that a cure no is that something that you can incorporate in your eating plan along with high level of mega three fatty acids\nTo to really help support the nervous system sure\nAnd that's what it's all about so there's there's a lot of natural things you can do information and cutting down information in the body is a big key too\nSo that's that's one of the major major keys is cutting down inflammatory process and and mental and emotional stress with somebody with MS\nIs a major trip so if there's any kind of emotional stress going on at all\nYou have to eliminate it you have to get as far away from it as you can\nAnd build kind of a fortress of that person\nI've just an entire situation with it\nYes you're limited you have to get as far away from it as you can\nAnd still kind of a fortress who that person\nSo I'm just an entire situation with them\nWhere there's there's a lot of\nAnd really make a difference too slowly Boston soon it gives them a boy and his wife is starting to persist and pay the sales AAA to a three seven to step into the struggling to pay three Seventy two self two lines are open to talk to one\nIn shape network dot com we're due for each and every day coming up a little slices might help they just don't want our help\nIs determined by the choices that we make every single day health is not the absence of disease let me mindful about our daily lifestyle that's where my health becomes in what come to the easy to use mine helping out designed improve wellness and build strength which when your lifestyle choices and your progress of the mind healthy I can easily tractor health goals\nIncrease awareness connect with community reduced stress and improve physical wellness visit mine healthy dot com that's mine healthy dot com\nMakes the Andrew brand with Fiji media PG media or the digital business and branding expert with innovative and affordable website design fast turn around and amazing customer service call about your friends at PG media today at triple late for one for\nSeven four or five for ... for one for seven four or five for a visit P.

food habits\nMake a tremendous difference in the way you feel makes tremendous difference in the joints they make a tremendous difference in the ... the overall way that your body functions and so if you if you're going to have\nGood I'm Out like let's say equal amounts of lean quality proteins that you're eating every single day like chicken fish beef or eggs that's great you want to cut back a lot though when you're dealing with arthritis\nA lot of the starchy carbohydrates or bread pasta cereal crackers potatoes rice you want to cut a lot you want to cut back on that because that can sometimes for some can raise the inflammatory response and one thing you definitely do not want to do is go low fat\nThen when I say good fats I mean things like nuts seeds things like whole eggs right but things like the fats found in fish like we just talked about avocados or great coconut oil is great too\nBut given the right amount of fats in your body every single day is tremendous on cutting down the inflammatory process to a huge deal so when you're dealing with arthritis makes sure make sure that you that you have those kind of on point your eating habits going to be one of your

twenty four hour drinking beer niche and and this this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and as you said\nOne of the things she Texas okay do you have a condom and he replies yes and she text back\nGood yummy two minutes since so you know the inevitable follow\nOkay do you have a condom and he replies yes and she text back good yummy two minutes since so you know you never ... follows and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reasons and now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is going to show me as willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trips with this con demise guy or she sent a message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now\nSo the guy that receives these messages it's going to perfectly\nRationally and accurately assume that he has\nAffirmative consent from his partner and yet occidental college she was under enormous pressure from the Obama administration they want it to rack up as many male scouts as possible and its feminist crusade to basically right males out of out of western civilization uh\nOccidental expelled the guy he's now he sued the school of that case is yet to be heard but the text message trail is is completely a vindicate semantics ...\nYeah yeah there was another one you talk about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is we characterized as being as being raped a she checks to the to the boy how are the more I'm sure the boy checks to her\nHow do I compare with your boyfriend and she replies you were a great [laughter] and then of course after the fact she says I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes\nAs I describe it in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nIt's completely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses first survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at its magazine\nA forty three percent of the females homes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is\nHomes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is they have you with that is completely in on think of all if you have actually been raped\nYou art that is for the most as I said the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant for from this violent criminal you do not go on to voluntarily have sex again and and the the key to this whole whole\nHope is that the numbers that we have on alleged campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves\nThat same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine when the researcher ads that girls whom she classified as rape victims whether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so that that these phony campus rape epidemic\nA conceit depends on\nViolating one at the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she hasn't been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know whether there's this ... this couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be a to B rape\nBut and then that they combine that with this with this idea that tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet and hearing\nThat any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask whether it matches up with a known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you know you just have to believe and and as you may know Heather I spent forty years in the courtroom okay\nAnd and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know uh\nMost witnesses or don't lie in almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie but but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man and for the same reasons\nAnd and I was this idiot allergy that somehow women are are you know camp you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nThen for the same reasons and and I was this year the allergy that somehow women are are you know camp you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nSo again let's let's go to remember where the ... coming from it is coming from the campuses and it's part of a much broader assault\nOn on western civilization it is based on the idea that that America\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of endemic racism and sexism that the world is divided into permanent victim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive\nWorld the victim world it is of the ruthlessly competitive totem pole that is constantly being rearranged we thought that maybe gays or at the top now trans people are at the top but they\nThey're put position there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that's gonna kept claim top dog victims status\nBut but females you know we started there early on\nAnd and they claimed that they are victims\nRate of sexism this is preposterous it is it is preposterous particularly on college campuses which is that are open to everybody where females are encouraged\nFrom from the time a girl is five years old today on words she is the in incessant recipient of messages to six feet you know women and spam girls to code\nAh encourage them it right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys\nWho are an afterthought who are bombarded with the message that they are the ... they are the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point\nMail to just going to check out entirely because\nWe are now a culture that is is sending nothing but negative messages that them\nUh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is is the value but as you said the court room\nYou know the reason that we the western tradition developed these truths are finding mechanisms like cross examination\nCourt room you know the reason that we the western tradition developed these truths are finding mechanisms like cross examination\nWas with the understanding that human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate it's very hard to remember things there's implanted memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know with this Christine Ford\nWhat her therapist was doing to her ... therapists these days are very left wing who knows you know one\n\nThing happened whatsoever\nYeah it's a ... and I think it was probably an eye opener to a lot of people who haven't been following\nClosely the phenomena that you described other on college campuses they've gotta burst into public view here with the accusations against a judge Kavanaugh a but this is the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention if if you've got a child going off to college uh you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself\nAnd and the rest of us have to realize don't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating this victim ideology\nUh it's not just about the Democratic party that although the Democratic party has now been overtaken by campus identity politics that is poison for civil society it's teaching students they hate\nThe hate each other to hate the ... greatest works of western civilization or and they're carrying that animosity into the world at large\nThat's what we're seeing today the ... on you know it's

speaking to use your host on K ... see a fourteen Ninety am in one of three point five FM we got Jerry cell air from Jerry so more each and we're talking about all kinds of different things and while we're on break we start talking about\nUm loans or interest rates on loans over the years that he's been in the business and and I can tell you that when we moved here\nTo Prescott, Arizona we had a uh we got a mortgage loan from a bank at fourteen and a quarter percent interest on a house this isn't a some kind of alone for a for a\nYou know a motorcycle or a boat or something and this was our house um and um we refinance I remember we refinanced at twelve and three quarters percent it's so laughable now that uh\nI Am just unbelievable Jared you remember some of those\nTell ya I as I mentioned um uh I started in Nineteen Seventy nine so uh when I started my mortgage lending career you know I was making a a loans that Eighteen\nAll the way up till I Believe I made one at Twenty one percent and that ... that was in fact on homes and um so I was a kind of young men didn't understand exactly what was transpiring as far as interest rates were concerned\nAnd uh just decided I thought I could make it in this business and I'm here I Am a [laughter]\nI don't know if I Would do that today but uh at the time it sounded like a logical idea and uh so that at all I ended up in the mortgage\nYou know back then it was it was kind of the norm things were a there was a lot of inflation going on and there were there were issues going on and it was just what the market will bear kind of thing and we're all kind of stuck I can remember people getting CDs that were very\nIssues going on and it was just what the market will bear kind of thing and we're all kind of stuck I can remember people getting CDs that were very high interest rate returns and no risk at all you buy a CD and and uh they would pay this fabulous return and and uh\nI don't know if the rules seven's a came in at that point in time or not but uh it was close and add to that amazing\nYeah the uh rules sevens was a I think that was about Nineteen eighty two that are they actually started a simple interest a scenario as far as uh uh interest and how they determine how much interest you owed a\nBut that's I haven't heard that term and long time [laughter] All right let's so we probably talk a little bit about credit reports um folks out\nThere um if if you if you're listening and you have some\nIf if you're a I don't know why younger individual and you haven't really borrowed money yet or you're thinking about doing it or or whatever your beer accumulating a credit a history and you may not even know if you have a credit card and those kinds of things so\nAh Jerry why don't you talk to us a little bit about\nA credit report and how they can affect alone that you can get and what you should try to avoid doing so that you don't get yourself into a situation where all of a sudden you really can't even borrow money to buy a house which can happen to people also\nWell I guess I'll start out with the credit scores um there's three different uh repositories basically entities that are determine what scores are so each time we get a credit report we have three scores and we always go with the middle score\nNow typically to ditch your\nBest interest ray you're going to need a score a middle score of seven fifty or higher now that's not to say that you can't get a loan a that's less than seven fifty for example I've got one right now that the middle score seven twenty nine\nThey're paying a little penalty in the way of the interest rate uh they'll still get the loan but uh they're not going to get the best price the non alone\nRight so if you so you have issues with your credit report you end up paying for those um mistakes you may have made or maybe\nThe loan right so if you so you have issues with your credit report you end up paying for those uh mistakes you may have made or maybe not even mistakes but issues that have come up um and you don't get the best loan rate\nThat that's an excellent way to put it because you're actually paying a penalty but if you make your payments or as you should for the first a year to two years I Would say at least one year\nUh usually your scores going to go back up and then if it's feasible there's a possibility that you could refinance and go from there\nBut it that's all going to be predicated too on what the interest rate would be in the future because that's always a a moving target so to speak\nAnd uh so uh that's one thing that everybody needs to be aware of um uh is their credit score a one thing that I might mention is that one that comes to mind\nIs that a lot of people will get these offers a in the mail for zero percent uh interest rate right so a transfer your balance over okay and I'm a so a lot of people will do that which is understandable\nBut at the same time a lot of them will take that old card that they just transferred the balance\nAnd they'll they'll just go ahead and uh I'm a cancel that out which is a bad thing to do because in essence a you don't have as much credit and your score will actually go down down result in what you thought was a good decision\nYeah well we got about ten seconds to the heartbreak at the bottom of the hour or so I Want you to stay tuned because we're going to talk about all different kinds of loans you can get a five for one one zero one six ... right after this message we'll be right back\nAnd I'm a so conventional is a good product to just depends on the person coming and uh as to what their needs are and what program would best suit them\nRight okay well I got a caller on line one so we're going to take him after the break and um we're going to also talk a little bit about manufacturing homes and whether or not you can borrow money on those before we get into the reverse mortgage say so stick with a spot for one one zero one six we'll be

V. D. their fees on the mobile ... one is uh the affidavit of fixtures in place and recorded then it all becomes one\n... real estate and you you can't move it in the whole thing okay let's get this guy he's on line one Scott I Hope you held held on e is still there\nOn science or go ahead please how are you a real good Scott thanks for calling\nQuestions on a mortgage uh I I my understanding that things have changed dramatically in the past five years or so because you are by choice from where I knew someone who\nHad a reverse mortgage and they had the movie and it just uh\n... where I knew someone who\nHad a reverse mortgage and they had been moving into a ... and it just made law [laughter] it was a real bad situation for them\nYou know I'd heard things like the actuarial tables for the reverse mortgages were based on things like a hundred and twelve year lifespan and I knew that they were all I'm All right well good long time I don't know that still the case law but can you tell us a little detail saying\nOh absolutely Scott let's let's start out with uh the program itself now to answer your question about the assisted living a it's a requirement that uh the individual is the primary occupant okay like\nSeveral years and they are small they had to move and letting the ad that was bad and that was a problem with a long time\nThat's correct because see they were no longer\nConsidered the primary occupied\nAnd so that's ah what no doubt initiated the process and then typically if you no longer are the occupant then you have six months to a um a dispense with your home namely you'd be selling it on the market\nAnd I'm a\nTypically you can ask for an additional six months for a total of the year\nAnd they'll give you that'll typically grant you that additional six months but uh once you move from the home then in fact a you are no longer the primary resident and then that's going to an ... an issue foreclosure proceedings\nAnd two other items there that would initiate it would be the fact that you're not paying your taxes are not paying your um uh owners homeowners insurance correct thanks Bob I'm now as far as the\nUm a\nChanges they have evolved over the years but uh it was about a year ago October so a year ago this month\nThat uh they came through with significant changes and those changes basically reduced the loan amounts based on your age or\nThey came through with significant changes and those changes basically reduced the loan amounts based on your age\nOr so the percentage that you are able to borrow a today is less than what it was last October and so yeah they are significantly reduce I won't say significantly but they have a reduced the loan amounts based on your age\nSo uh that is a big change a now you are semi income qualified as well and this is all a to make the program a little more viable because ah what what we had experience in the past ten years\nAs far as foreclosures are that put a huge drain on the what they described as the mortgage insurance premium fund because of a foreclosures\nAnd so they've not only decreased the actual loan amounts but they've increased the amount of the mortgage insurance premium so those are things that uh uh have to be taken into consideration when you are obtaining a reverse mortgage\nBut it's part of the a part of the uh uh a\nProgram now and it's unfortunately it's not going to go away so now did I miss a question there Scott\n[laughter] oh yeah the extra weight or is it at all\nOr no you got fixed rates you have a um a fixed rate available you have what they describe as a an annual adjustable and a monthly adjustable\nSo that [noise] excuse me so there's three products that you can select from and again it depends on the scenario or as to what the best program might be for you know typically people are going to come in and request the fixed mortgage\nA which I understand completely but there's definitely some a pluses for the other two programs and I would say specifically the annual adjustable rate\nA lotta people uh their primary purpose today is to remain in their home and they would like to do away with their existing mortgage essentially pay it off\nI've got one right now that uh\nTo remain in their home and they would like to do away with their existing mortgage essentially pay it off I've got one right now that uh will pay the mortgage often no actually get a loan money left\nAnd with the uh adjustable rate mortgage the annual adjustable rate mortgage they will also get that money back and they have the ability to deposit that into what they described as a growth account", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Prescott", "day": "09"}
