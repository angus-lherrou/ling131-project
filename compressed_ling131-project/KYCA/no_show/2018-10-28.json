{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KYCA", "content": "Time when you have to beef up or take that extra step or try a try harder sometimes uh it is possible to try harder even when we think that we've already tried the hardest there is room for trying harder\nAnd um this year if ah we've lost four games we lost four games in the same fashion uh she's driving to score to try to tie up the game at a San Diego state uh and we wind up losing by a touchdown\nI'm the same thing with Washington you know a last quarter were driving in the last few minutes trying to get that at all ah get that game in overtime same thing with Colorado in Stanford but I I think that uh what I if I if I had to say anything the coaching staff number one things for being a coach\nAnd I know you guys try but uh we need to start learning from our mistakes not repeat the same thing over and over and that uh some of these uh senior players need to step up and make their last season and it'll there last plays at ASU good ones to remember\nAnd um sometimes I I of course everybody wants to win but not everybody can be a winter especially in a football game and then into double a division one and I I think that what I Would like to tell the coaches at summer one\nUh when you have freshmen players that are good that we're that I see some of them start in for a issue I think that we need to quit telling them that you know you're you're only a freshman year young player\nA I think that it would be better if come across if you say you're a division one player where you're expected to play just as good as the seniors are you know and and I think that that would make a difference in other words what kind of a psychological way are you going to prepare your team because when you start telling a team you're young\nYou know they can say well I've got room for mistaken I'm young I'm In\nAs a coach I Would never do that I Would tell them you know if you're going to be on wearing the Jersey down there you're just supposed to be just as good as he often said as good as the defense on the other side of the team and we need to start preparing a better for these games especially when we have the UCLA southern cows and the Arizona is\nComing to ten P. and with the the new building the addition that we're doing at issue uh make it harder place to play for the team so that they can't just come in at home\nAt some level stadium and and and walk away with the when I mean I I think that this team has lost games that they should have one but that's going to happen in sports\nI'm the only thing I can say is today's when is a good when\nI think that uh this team um has last game that they should have one but that's going to happen in sports\nI'm the only thing I can say is today's when is a good way and but when the when but how do we get that when did we get lucky to win that game that they didn't get that on the side kick because I can only imagine what the what I'd gotten\nThat on side kick I mean they could have simply scored a touchdown or they scored a touchdown and when they weren't supposed to and then we wind up went in ... I call this a lucky when but like I I once again a win win and I'm not trying to take any credit away from the coaches are from the players specially the players\nBut uh I I think that the key word here learn from our mistakes that we don't have to repeat them and that's one of the things that I wanted to bring out in you know um I Love the devils are my team and they'll continue to be my team and I just would like to see improvement in the areas where we needed\nSurgery on pre she'd call wish you the best with your family situation with your dad and I appreciate your comments I I don't know I'm I'm totally on board with the comment about it being a lucky when you look factored into it there's no question\nUh but there was a bold too and recovering it on ...\nAnd that's part of the reason why you have a special teams coach and you work on those things so I don't think it was just simply luck that allowed or you're shooting covered that on site kick you was lucky to have gone out with when you're right I mean because at three twenty eight\nI think a lot of people thought well it's over and that's Steve uh everyone else thought it was over and she didn't and they went down and scored a touchdown quickly so it's fortunate today issue gun out with the circumstances somebody get one more call and for the break T.

and I've been to some of these countries\nI don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through that shrine we deal with it and they don't have to\nThat's right and uh they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very ...\nAnd they don't have to do next right\nUh they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially a toilet to

argument for that\n[noise] oh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough so it was interesting

opposite way they're quite capable of gardening that border is a proven over the years and suddenly decided\nTo their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they have suddenly stopped\nThen there's the advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new a new president and in Mexico city [noise] ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but obviously I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that

have made us write you a made us into your below the suns you're below the daughters\nQuestion of justification is on avoidable cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provokes him and so on this particular Wednesday evening as Harold waited for the bus his watch suddenly stopped\nThe U.S Harold washed trust him into the mythical path of fate little did he know that this symbol seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death\nWatch watch\nHey hello why why yes hello excuse me why and how it's\nHarold burst into his apartment ransacked the closet throws open doors turns out in drawers searching for the voice\nOkay where are you probably heard you come on you stupid voice say something\nNow Harold becomes his own narrator Harold frantically grabbed his lamp\nI heard you come on you're stupid voice say something\nDesperate now Harold becomes his own narrator Harold frantically grabbed his lamp Harold incense she'll get about the room for no apparent reason smash it on the ground stopping it repeatedly come on say something say something say something\n[noise] Harold distraught God Harold distraught\nThan the author speaks not about you this time but to you\nYour author addresses you personally now I'm going to ask you to stop imagining and just believe part about God being your author it's true there's another part of the story that I haven't been telling you and you need to hear it before it's too late\nHour author is not limited to one way author character relationships are author is not a solitary on moved mover he's not an evil genius playing with us like puppets are avatars he's a father\nBefore it even started this story from eternity\nThis author has a give and take relationship with his son than in the power of his spirit he loves his son and as much as he loves his son this is how much she loves you\nThat's why he created you you know so that you could become not merely a character and his story but his adopted son his adopted daughter\nHe justified your existence not because of what you could do for him but because of what he wants to do for you to bring you into an authentic to a relationship\nA father son father daughter relationship of love and trust and to recreate this relationship of love for us the father sent his only son to be born into history to take the named Jesus to become a character in his own story\nAnd as a character\nThe son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters and the strange and sometimes confusing story\nJesus showed us what it looks like to actively strive and to passively suffer as God's below the children and his death\nHe showed us how to express doubt with a job like faith my God my God why have you forsaken me he said\nHe showed us how to express doubt with a job like faith my God my God why have you forsaken\nMe he said father into your hands I commit my spirit Luke twenty three forty six and in his resurrection of Jesus showed us how face waits on the author of life\nGod is God with or without us yet God became ... God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nFace alone was the phrase that the Protestant Reformers use to describe it to a relationship between God the father and his beloved children the reformers were just following the apostle Paul and they insisted that we are justified we are put right with God to face alone\nThis means that we are rescued from our rebellion by hearing in Jesus the voice of our author and taking him at his word trusting him receiving his story is our story that's what it means to be justified by grace along\nThrough faith alone in Christ along to the glory of God alone\nAmen amen\nYou're listening to the Lutheran our I'm Mark I sure along with Dr Tony cook and or a new speaker Dr Michael Ziegler we thought we use this time to help our listeners get better acquainted with you Tony when did you start off\nYeah oh well first of all welcome it is great to have you here thank you I thought it might be interesting if we would get to know a little bit about your family so is there anything that you'd like to to share\nWe enjoy each other [laughter] but yeah yeah yeah our house is a lot of fun my uh wife Amy and I we've been married for\nSeventeen years and we have four children are the oldest is Fifteen youngest is\nEight and yeah we just we have a lot of fun we have for chickens and a dog and I and we live in the city of St Louis so you're allowed to have chickens in the city and I just to give you a view into our our family life we had a Fox\nI and we live in the city of St Louis so you're allowed to have chickens in the city and just to give you a view into our our family life we had a Fox\nAttack our chickens a couple of nights ago and my Fifteen year old son and I drug ourselves after our daughter woke us up and said the chickens are screaming and my son and I had to go out with flashlights and chew off the Fox and\nUh didn't get a great night sleep at night but that's just kind of our house and a lot of energy an action and my wife is always makes things fun and the kids do as well\nLet's talk about the your work as Lutheran our speaker each speaker that we've had has spoken to a particular context and its issues you represent now a different generation of Lutheran our speaker what do you see is the great challenge of our context\nWhat was I understand the organization we are an outreach organization and I think the challenge that we have is the same challenge that everyone in the church has that our our culture at least in North America has shifted and\nThere's some church hurt and some skepticism and I'll often apathy towards what we have to say and\nOf course I Want to share Jesus and I want to share the word of God and so I think that's the challenge is how to\nBridge into that that apathy and sometimes a anger towards the church and\nOur listeners might be interested to know that besides being the river and Dr Michael Craig Miller you're also lieutenant colonel\nMichaels they learn in the United States Air force reserve tell us a little bit about your military background and maybe get into the transition that you made from air force to the ... years ago\nMy dad served in the military for Twenty one years in the air force\nAnd for one of those assignments we were stationed in Colorado Springs which is the home of the air force academy and we had season tickets to the football games\nAnd when I saw all the cats in their service dress run to the end zone and do push-ups whenever the falcons would scored a touchdown I knew that I wanted to do that I didn't know what I didn't look like ... really cool and so that had been my lifelong dream is to go to the air force academy and\nThank God it happened I almost didn't get in and actually got rejected and then a month later he got a call from the the ... the senator who got me my er my nomination and and said hey you still want to go to the air force academy I fell on the ground and it was so excited that my my dream was coming through\nAnd\nEr my nomination and and said hey you still want to go to the air force academy I fell on the ground and it was so excited that my my dream was coming through and\nI served a five years on active duty I wasn't a chaplain actually a lot of people ask me that\nI I served as an aircraft maintenance officer in a air mobility command which is all the big planes and cargo planes and the arrow medical evacuation and air air refueling those planes you\nKnow one of the things when we were going through all the candidates I'm a for the new speaker one of the things that stood out to me was that you have a a distinctly different style in preaching did you talk just a little bit about how you develop your your preaching style\nMy desire is to be conversational and I think it relates back to the question mark asked about the challenges that we as preachers face today there's a there's a book you probably know the title as as one without authority or I don't remember who wrote it but that's we we can't\nAs preachers or the gospel it doesn't work as well the lead with our authority and so how else can we lead to connect with people connect into Jesus and so that was part of it is just a desire to be conversational to the desire for me to be interested in what I'm saying and to become a\nA student of the Bible anew every time I go back to the text\nYeah this is a unique opportunity now that you're just starting out and people listening getting to know you a little bit more if there was one goal that you had in mind for what you hope God would do through your time here uh what would that would be\nWhat drew me to this organization is that the love of the last and to focus on outreach\n[noise]\n\nWelcome to God's amazing love real people in real life stories\nOf Jesus Christ and his power and ability to change lives because he has risen from the dead\nGood morning and welcome again to God's amazing love we are going to hear today from buddy riles and this is a real good couple in our church to of been missionaries to some ... or as they say it's more\nUm pastor several places in the United states Illinois Kentucky right here in Arizona just good folks got touched their lives and buddy riles today is going to tell us all about the goodness of God and the love of Jesus take it away buddy\nMy uh my life begins with\nAnd I was five years old some of the memories that I have a my dad who at that time was a heroin addict I remember would come up to my dad and you know kids always want to ask her dad questions and and my dad would sit there smoking a cigarette and he would say\nWait till I'm done smoking a cigarette and then you can talk to me\nThat was a memory other times it's friends would come on over want to give me beer and they carried on for several years as kids we never knew that dad was a heroin addict to later on after he'd gotten saved but when I was about nine\nYears old my parents were always fighting my dad was beating up my mother and I remember\n... we had a\nBaby sitter this taught us how to pray and so I knew how to talk to Jesus I did not know Jesus but I began to press a God or whatever you do don't let my dad leave my mom I Need my dad and I had no clue that\nWe're going to have a generation of young people that don't have a father\nI was just to to not have a father and out of my heart I cried out to God and shortly after that for early on a Sunday Morning I got now but my dad was in the bathroom\nOthers and out of my heart I cried out to God and shortly after that for early on a Sunday Morning I'd gotten now but my dad was in the bathroom\nShaving and I said dad ...\nWhat's going on they said we're going to church of why we're going to church the okay and so he told me about my cousin that had invited and Jesus and to her heart and when he said that I had all kinds of toys I had a nice bike I had friends\nBut that was something that I Want to more than anything at that moment as to how do you do that he says I don't know you want to talk to your aunt\nOut to a church at that time we lived in El ... California we went to church afterwards went over to my grandmother's house my auntie was there and she led me and the Centers for and that was a moment when I first\nGot saved as a young boy now if I Want to start with in my life would have been so much better my dad had changed and he had taken the bar that he used to keep it a liquor he gave it to his friends down the street so well now we don't have anywhere to go see a guy that's where I [noise]\nI could hide from my brothers my sister's [noise]\nSo anyway we moved from Muncie to Lakewood, California when we moved there I was Thirteen Years old went to those don't hobbies short when I was Fifteen Years old and I was invited to be a rock band\nThey asked me to sing and I said I I don't think I was very very limited intimidated I Do not speak in front of people\nAnd I'm not going to send them to me saying\nOh back and and the way I say was\nThat's actually what you heard nothing coming out of my mouth just my lips moving [noise] and so that was an example of why\nI ended up reading ballet and going back to when I was Thirteen Years old sitting in the back of the church and [noise] God spoke to me very very clearly\nThat I was going to do with a man of air was doing and that was preached Jean and I told myself there's no way I Would ever do that at the beginning at the age to assert came and began to rebel I began to get into perversion\nAnd although I was at a music group of the church by the time I was Fifteen I was smoking pot\nAnd doing things that should not be doing my father or mother\nVersion and although I was in a music group at the church by the time I was Fifteen I was smoking pot\nAnd doing things that should not be doing my father or mother or when I was almost sixteen years old they made a decision to move to Arizona that January I it took me about ten minutes to find brand new friends\nAnd my parents gave me away from my old friends that would be better for me but\nYou know I brought me and myself and my problems to Arizona\nAnd begin to get high begin to continue to rebel I'm I looked like a normal kid that was all good and cool but I was writing skating orange started hanging out with the wrong friends we had as a guide or sorts of name was ...\nAnd he was kind of a joke or a guy here in Arizona and one day he was at the house and\nMy dad would end the sugar looking around and I saw my pot plant my dad had no clue I was smoking pot well they\nThey came back in the house so Craig harbor this friend of ours hey who wants to go out to shed class out there come out in here let's talk about it and so I got busted ... and I always acted like a repented but I was only sorry I got caught down never do it again\nAnd one in my bedroom got the rest of my marijuana joined flush the toilet and it was not repentant that it was oh man why did I Do that where am I going to get the money to get more drugs and so I was Eighteen years old\nI go to the altar and try to repent but the problem is that got him wanting me to do something a there was a call of God for my life and I could not speak in front of people I knew that if I answer the call them God\nThat I wouldn't have to speak in front of people and I said no way I was kind of a private person I wasn't one that went to the tonight Columbus and or just goes like my wife did I wasn't into that I had a few friends\nA lot of times I Would just party by myself but when I was Eighteen years old I started dating a girl her name is Sharon and\nThe relationship with OJ uh she said at one of the services Johnny Metsu was preaching that button may I wanted nothing to give my life to Jesus I just would go to church because my parents wanted me to go to\nSo Johnny master was preaching at but may I wanted nothing to give my life to Jesus I just would go to church because my parents\nWanted me to go to church and so anyway for two years I was completely back slid I remember at one point when I was Nineteen years old and dealing with my speaking to me there was times God would be very very clearly to me\nAnd I'm driving down the road and I totally got us to know I Do not want to serve you my girlfriend is more important\nThan you are and I had no idea that you can see around the corner he was trying to save me from a lot of pain they're always going to come very soon to my life and so another year I just went on and did my old thing started working at a place called Mickey's restaurant there\nIn North Phoenix and ah I was almost Twenty years old one day and all of a sudden I saw was like a daytime dream and I saw myself walking down the road and I came to a fork in the road in the voice spoke to me and said you're either going to go to the right to\nWhere you're going to go to the left and I thought to myself I Am going to the left I Do not want to get out and I knew it was invented\nAnd I'm just going to go that way and gun show them in my life with out him and he showed me having bunny showed me having a business and he showed me having everything that I wanted and then at the age of sixty five years old\nI Would still be happy and I'll tell you that bugged me out\nAnd then it got said okay let me show you something else if you go down this out of the road and he shows me my life changed he showed me justice and he showed me the call of God\nAnd as he showed me I got really discouraged because I thought I Can't ... I don't think I even wanted change and so as I'll\nTry to get them actually arguing with God I have a cigarette in my hand held said I cannot sort of you know\nI like getting high enough that I Do it every day I like drinking beer and and getting drawing of not that I Do it every day there are things that I Do that you do not like and I know you don't like my rock music and all of a sudden it's like\nSomething happened to me all the hills that I had was gone and I don't blame the students just to me with a cigarette in my hand\nAll the bills that I had was gone and I don't\nBlame you and just to me with a cigarette in my hand wait a minute the cigarette out to work your\nWay home and I went to sleep you got in the morning and I'm shaving getting ready to go to work and I look at
