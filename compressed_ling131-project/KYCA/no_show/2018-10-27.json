what does seem like your first home game and a long time to START I guess the first half of them as second anti settled down and you know the little alcohol and tears just your thoughts are wrong because performance and that game\nWe Williams has some good players and so that first half the game they gave us a little bit of trouble if we started to wear 'em down a little bit and I thought our tempo played a role in that but in a good job there very well coached and we expected a battle and we got one\nHead guy he was question again the driving force of a route or what was it for I think for rushing touchdowns in a touchdown throw for him and uh you know just another really great game and a great job I it was all kinds of line opening up Tim holes\n... Austin's around the ball rolling role here on running backs round the ball well as well as we were five or six basketball too so we're very efficient in that area so that was good to see\nSpeaking Austin clock I just saw recently that he was actually nominated for the Edwardian award which honors ... football player in the states to tell us a little bit about that on our\nCats exciting he got

primary running back sixteen hundred yards rushing Fifteen touchdowns and you also have aunts ones of all of their quarterback who's thrown for nearly a sixteen hundred and twenty three touchdowns so just tell us what the plan is going to be to try to take those two humongous weapons\nWell they have a great offense there were well coached offensively as well you know just to give me an idea how

excellent\nYeah much Nelson carry the football has fifty one more cherries than Austin on the air in one less game so he's got two hundred thirty one carries on that's a lot of games\nAnd other quarterbacks an excellent player they got a tight and that is a monster linebacker as well Ken distract their senior class as his one a lot of football games for a lot of years and it's an extremely talented group\nAnd I imagine with Nelson ... doing the job to do and that means they have to have one heck of an offensive line to talk about trying to take a\nPicture of area kinda typical ... offensive line hard nosed played tough fundamentally sound all that stuff um so it's what you expect from a ...\nYou mentioned Ken Jews struck he's one of their primary not just consumers titans but also under linebackers you also got shells Taylor number Fifteen you gotta watch out for us that's a pretty dangerous combination on both sides and the ball\nI guess that their senior class has been extremely talented for ... years I've never quite seen an outline where they don't have one rushing area that's not a senior I think they have three receiving are just not a senior in about six passing or it's not a senior so they're led by their seniors and and it's a danger here for seniors no question\nAs we head into tonight's game obviously in the region title is on the line you look at

cholesterol what about me I have type ... diabetes what about me what about me I Need to lose thirty pounds\nSo a lotta people listen to the show and I I hear people all the time\nAnd it amazes me at just at what goes on to their head because so many people I just sit on the sidelines and and they would love to get in the game why do you think that the stands and sporting events are packed full of people and that some people do just like to be entertained most guys though if you look at them they want to be on the field\nOr they remember the glory days and they used to play ball or hockey or basketball and they'll sit there and tell their wives or the buddies you know they'll criticize every jump shot or ever touched down or the steel goal\nBecause they they can kick the field goal\nAnd and everybody wants to be on the field in some way that's why I vicariously everybody gets so excited when there's touchdown or there's a big play or somebody dumped the basketball or there's a three point shot made when the buzzer goes off because we won\nAnd there's the we win mentality there's the group mentality there's the mentality of we all did it together ... you didn't do anything\nYou when when the titans one or whoever wins the Packers one or when a football team wins or when your favorite team wins ... you didn't win anything\nThat team did\nNow you may have cheered the mine you may have won the Jersey you may have bought a two hundred dollar ticket\nBut you didn't win anything because you're were thrown on the field they might have heard you cheering for them but you didn't want anything it's different with your house\nSitting on the sidelines and you've got diabetes or you've got cholesterol issues or you just been diagnosed with cancer or genetically they've told you that you got what grandma hat\nSidelines and you've got diabetes or you've got cholesterol issues or you just been diagnosed with cancer or\nGenetically they've told you that you've got what grandma had and what your mother had and now you're twenty five and you've been diagnosed with a lump in your breath and they buy opposite and it's DC I asked Dr phil\nAnd you're freaking out\nAnd the doctor saying to you\nWe're probably going to have to do chemotherapy radiation we're probably gonna have to you know we're going to take no doubt and we're going to see if there's cancer and and they just found out that there was cancer and the knowns and then it might have metastasize so what do you do you're going to say on this on line\nBecause if you still on the sideline then things aren't going to look good on the sideline and you don't get on the field so that's the difference between health and between sporting event is that the fact that you can step out of the stands and you can get on the field and you can do something about it\nAnd you can make it happen but you have to want to make it happen\nYou have to realize that that by the choices you make every single day you can change what's going on inside of you all of us can why is that because the body's amazing it generates every single day old cells die off new cells form\nWe get a brand new body about every year so the choices we make today can and will determine the kind of health that we're going to happen tomorrow\nAnd tell you something great story then I get this all the time all the time and I'm not boasting\nI'm just I'm humble by this so I'm sitting in a restaurant and the sweet lady comes up she comes up and and my wife is there with me and we're just you know we're on a date and just having a great time and\nShe comes up and she says\nI just want you to know she says to my wife she walks up to my wife she goes I just want you to know that your husband got me pregnant\n[laughter]\nIt was hilarious my wife started dying laughing because she knew what she meant and she had she had gone to see it basically what had happened she had heard the radio show and she had applied some information on the radio show to her own health into her own life and her husband\nAnd her had tried they'd had two kids and then went to six years didn't have another child and and then had applied a lot of these principles went to see a some physicians in town that had bullied and a lot of the principles that that we teach here on the show and they apply those principles in their clinical practice and and and her and her husband\nThey had that had believe that a lot of the principles that that we teach here on the show and they apply those principles in their clinical practice and\nAnd and her and her husband were there were was she was two months pregnant and she was just excited and the just the joy in the glow on her face and and just just all of the countenance that she had and the gratitude and she was just saying thank you to me\nWhen I haven't done anything I'm just here giving information that's it\nAnd it was so great to see and I hit the stories all the time I'll be at a I'll be standing in line at the grocery store or a ... of the at a restaurant or at a gas station or in a bookstore or just wherever and it just the stories are just amazing and\nWimax sided about that in in my whole point of telling you the story is that it it's about you know I say this shows about your health it's about your life it's about you [noise] it's about what's going on within you\nBecause I don't do anything you do\nYou have to get out of the stands and get on the field and make it happen you have to decide to eat better you just have to decide how to live better you have to decide how to get out of toxic relationships and get into healthy relationships you're the one that has to decide that you're going to put all the negative thinking this stinking thinking has ... has to put it aside\nAnd begin to think positive things through that believe that you can be more and do more than you ever have in your life before and then you can have a brand new life\nThat just because you're being given a diagnosis doesn't mean that that defines you and it puts a chain around your neck\nAnd then it makes you into something that you're not that you can get rid of a diagnosis typically unless it's just stamped as his total genetic disorder\nAnd then you can make a difference but you can't do that when you're sitting in the stands\nListening or watching other people do it that's the thing about our health it's your health your health your life not mine not my producer not anybody else it's your health and your life and what you do with that is\nIs for you and it's for your kids or for your loved ones for your husband for your wife for your grandkids\nIt's it's up to you but that's the great thing\nThe great thing is is that we have the ability\nTo make changes in our lives [noise]\nOur past abound or pass and bound to poor lifestyle choices over the last ten years and now you have diabetes type too and they're saying you're going to be on that for me to go to the rest of your life to just get ready for it that's a bunch of bunk [noise]\nOver the last ten years and now you have diabetes type too and they're saying you're going to be on that for me to go to

something we're seeing often let me go back for a second what is your age again\nI'm feeding one\nOne okay so young very young and and the thing is women when they start hitting their forties around forty five the menopause time you know that time at that time of your life when you start hitting forty five about fifty five worst thing a lot of low libido with women a lot\nAround forty five the menopause time you know that time at that time of your life when you start hitting forty five about fifty five worst thing a lot of low libido with women a lot\nAnd a lot of the physicians are talking about that different ways some guys and gals are using the pallets to raise up testosterone that's kind of a big craze right now and and I'll tell you it works I mean it's making the women be excited about sex and and their libido goes up and they're excited to be with her husband\nAnd their into it again it's like the twenty five again and they're all it's just everything's working\nSo but the problem with that is is a big rebound effect it if you raise your testosterone up as a female let's say just that you know norm arranged for testosterone female happy medium is about thirty five to fifty five those are good numbers on a blood test\nWhen you take a pellet given by some of the doctors do raise it up to about one forty to two hundred it's too hot women get facial hair they start their their their voice starts a deepening\nAlmost like a male and they get some side effects I mean really one lady that I've spoken with before had actually taking testosterone so long medical tourists are clutter us had grown inning Gore's itself so much that it was I mean it was it was extremely visible and that's\nThat's a that's a that's part of it and say these are side effects that you really don't want\nYou to do so what can you do I would get a blood test your doctor and\nGet the values looked at from all the extras there's three of them as drone Esther dial estriol had to look at your growth hormone levels\nAnd you're at a stage and you're alleging all that's really important because the those are drivers of other hormones pituitary gland is kind of mastered landed the body and it has it that's just kind of what it's always been called and it it's a big driver so you always want to check that out and make sure it's OK makes sure is functioning alright get your testosterone levels checked\nAnd all that can be as fast\nAnd your physician will be able to come up with a good game plan for you know if they don't understand\nThe natural type of things that you can do to get things where they need to be there are for for a local providers in different areas that had been trained that way that you can get in touch with so there's there's ways to do that and figure out naturally 'cause see there's two different schools of thought when it comes to hormones\nAnd I'm not opposed to\n... and all that I'm not I'm not because sometimes people do need them\nWas a thought when it comes to hormones and I'm not opposed\nTo about the ethical hormones and all that I'm not I'm not because sometimes people do need them\nBut the first thing you always want to do is you want to give your body\nThings whether it's their foods or ... or whatever it might be wearing an exercise exercise can list it\nMore of a a testosterone and hormones are spot in males and females\nBut you always want to push the body to make its own hormones to to reproduce it I don't because the moment you start getting into body exhaustion is hormones meaning the bow down to Coles or the shots of the pellets or whatever the creams once you introduced that end of the body it will shut down your own production which was already low\nIt'll shut that down\nAnd then of course they'll start relying on the pallet relying on the Korean relying on the injection and whatever it is\nAnd then your body's not going to be able to produce it on its own as well as it used to\nIt so that's something to consider and that's why if you can use things like mock a route and tribulations and you can use different supplements\nThat can help produce testosterone or black khojasteh can manage estrogen or while the emirate which can help with for a gesture on levels and you start looking at those sorts of things and manage it with blood work you've got to keep good baselines and good clinical data about about what's going on with your body\nBut if you can do that and then get it to a good place\nThen that's when you're going to start seeing the results and you'll notice libido goes up you'll notice the way you feel energy levels and then of course pain levels with fiber mileage that might have been shift as well there are hormone link to that so there's a lot involved but the biggest thing is I Want you to be encouraged\nBecause at the end of the day I Know you just want you back\nYou want to be able to function the way you always have you want to be with your husband who you're happily married to and you want him to be\nYou know excited and and not feel like it you're stuck in the mud and you're not really into him because it may make him feel less loved to build a really good solid foundation in on that foundation he can build a structure that can last for years and years and years and whether all the storms of life and\n\nYou're listening to the news

force pilot a national security columnist for the Washington Times and the editor in chief of ...\nDot com it'll be talking about the national security aspect and getting into [noise]\nThis interesting theory now understand\nA little bit more about me I have a background in Russian studies actually have a degree in in what was Soviet Studies at the time now Russian studies and so following the Soviet the former Soviet Union ah what's going on there and the U.S Russia relations is a an area of great interest to me\nAnd in fact I I'm I'm Still very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians\nUm about about water and putting them what Vladimir Putin wants\n[noise] and it's interesting because she said to me\nMeddling by Russians um about about vitamin putting them ... ... ... ...\n[noise] and it's interesting because she said to me and and this is always stuck with me well I don't remember what it does not care does not care who is in charge in America\nWhat vitamin putting cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength and our Democratic Republic to use those against remember flood aren't buttons martial artist\nOr and so what he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about ...\nAbout a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about uh somebody might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact\nWe don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that the you know so so that's that's but as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort and then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert who was actually a tax possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti putting stances\nHeat heat specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't it interesting\nI have it be that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to and designed to do what's happening now more of his you know and so in some ways we shouldn't fertile out of me at ... dairy strange moments and and we have no idea where it comes time\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and again not conspiracy theorized and again I Am just trying to find\nTo understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and again not conspiracy theorized and again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post marked on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's a very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announced is\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I. N. F. treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan\nAnd negotiations are pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty bladder mayor potent turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThan the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale if it wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir ... wants\n\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing earth sending fake bombs through the mail in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot [noise]\nA right wing or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\n[noise] in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd ... a former air force pilots ... editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five forty or that if a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on where I'm Andrew longer I Am sitting in for ...\n\nIt's your last week to get the genius of sunspot correct or for free for sunspots aged bought that even read inflamed patches Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving

Germany's luxury micro generation also free she can rejuvenate and clog your pores for instantly radiant and baby soft skin\nWell it was possible I mean look they sprayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nFor you know the vice president's et cetera uh the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nThis point in time but let me ask you this because getting getting back to\nPoint now that's just my ... you know I have reporters all over the ... former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that\nThey would do that at this point in time but let me ask you this because getting getting back to this item treaty and you've written about and I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles\nIn central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I Can't talk so what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how and it was what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is he going to do except threatening you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan when the first thing too is against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinate Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting part time out of that period of\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he what I mean my\nPoint of that article is that we've seen this all before then this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThe you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations it's you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot or he is a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the ... show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explained it was a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\n[laughter] yeah well I Know I had\nPage on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nI Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy their language I you know learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point in and you and I ought to know how to talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for people to talk to the hottest show dog she was on a show\nSo my but my my question unlawfully people what they don't understand is it is it this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nThe reestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire\nAnd and you're exactly right and things like me what the bank you Buddy Guy thank you was supposed to be able to\nClaim that a little bit explain explain what that means in the modern context of modern Russian Empire looks like\nBut I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Ford roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah exist today as a monument and so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union\nWas one of the most productive successful countries they said do you really have to world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them it destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally\nI mean what Russia last with the Soviet um you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nBut I mean this is this is why this is changing stance visa view Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strength it's not quite ...\nThe idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual that you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want to collusion early in the Bahamas or their their entire administration on down with the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways uh you you look at a uranium so you know those sales you look at\nWhat's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there were intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate then and so it's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to I guess\n[noise] taught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work you're doing and I listen to get

... razor here\nI'm a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times but I Want to make sure that a hammer that point home so do we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form that usually when I had this conversation or a yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are ... you know the cameraman and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb the pressure cooker

evening John ah\nSeveral questions there they don't all have the same answer a does is putting smiles on people's faces I don't think so [laughter] these are not happy event or is this the nature of democracy uh American democracy and the twenty first century\nShort answer yes it is the nature of democracy right now a fellow at least of American politics democracy I think despite his left her routinely wailing that Trump is destroying American democracy last time I looked\nUp we're still holding elections people are still showing up a still casting votes and uh the outcomes are as is always the case in a thriving democracy are difficult to predict uh we don't live in a country that we're just one side wins all the time [laughter]\nI'm having said that um [noise]\nHow the American

people show up every day to do their jobs that is still going very very strong\nSo you know we and media tend to elevate some things over others at the moment to what's being elevated is Cesar ... the

California and trying to have in common our jobs and that's where it stops because what it really is China is sucking jobs from California so uh yes we do one thing in common jobs but we're not we're not hanging around him here in California and China's pulling away faster than you can imagine\nThis report from the Los Angeles times so this is not a blog just worry says half a million jobs lost to China and I'm going to guess that that's not the end of it ah we're looking at Johns just Silicon Valley but\nThe apparel industry and all the other small manufacturers that have prospered in California have left they've almost maybe maybe Jeff they went because the transit veteran Bush in Shanghai you think is that it\n[noise] that's quite possibly one of the reasons but you know California has been suffering for a number of years\nBecause of the high cost of doing business here taxation is crazy the cost of ... is crazy or the threat of litigation that's hanging over your head whether it's for a chart reasons or dealing with regulations is again crazy that's that's the watch word of the day crazy because\nIt is just so tough to do business here now there are a number of people and businesses who moved to other friendlier states like Texas and such but really it's a China has gone whole hog and trying to recruit people and companies out of California and they're doing a pretty darn good job\nThe story that is hard to imagine in the twenty first century but at the fact is that the most expensive house of representatives race in the country it's not even close\nKnit is Devin Nunes this district twenty second ... congressional district in the San Joaquin Valley\nAnd he's being challenged by a nest assistant us attorney or an assistant district attorney named Jan's and the numbers are stunning as to what Jan has been able to raise and spend again Devin Nunes chairman of the\nHouse intelligence committee and a long time resident in Fresno worried about water issues which is what the farmers concern themselves as water water water\nNunes has been very successful for all of his terms\nWith the farmers and yet ... says Ben\n...

I don't know Jeff ... it can be six million eight million twelve million enormous amount of money against newness and it's not close is this the nature of California races these days it doesn't matter who wins you just spend money\nIs truly a the nature you know there's been a lot of effort in California to flip the remaining a Republican districts uh to Democrat and they've been pulling out all the stops but in some of these districts that are safe flight divisions are you wondering what are they thinking how could they be doing this I mean\nYou know you do have to say Devin have spent a he's raised ten point five million but it's really like you said it's the opponent who's who's putting in over seven million dollars\nThat's just it's unfathomable at least it was nowadays in California you're just seeing huge amounts of money coming in a Mayor Bloomberg decided today or yesterday that he was going to dump millions in California and some key races this is California's going\nThese days and two other congressmen who are not threatened even slightly\nThis is Adam Schiff and Brad Sherman did it just has taught me you call everybody by their first name in California

don't think he's got into the socio economic the socio political aspects it yet\nBut I can guarantee knowing how things are with transportation throughout Southern California particularly in LA\nThat that will come to come to the fore and that will be a problem in the near future\nHe's just a problem is this a story in LA do people worry about these ... you know somebody drinking ... digging tunnels underneath me is that ... is the culture in different to the\nFolks are the most part are indifferent they're actually excited by more set by the prospect of getting across town faster they do now which would be anything faster than two miles an hour some days\nThey're much more side by that than they are worried about a cave ins are seismic activity and really you know people in LA they get kind of laws they about earthquakes and such but uh this they're they're really much more about the prospect\nOf getting across town faster especially that means that can get to a baseball game or

about this there are not they're not many people in LA that are are really pushing for Eric our city and part of that is because they see that he's not getting a lot done in LA on the big projects a big effort to the big problems\nWhat about the homeless and go see if he is he is the impressing with the homeless\nWith homeless so you know he's throwing a few hundred thousand dollars here and

at work you know that I never ever waste your time or if you're on a highway or some of the country driving along fearing\nYou'll be mourning put to sleep by the endless miles just keep your radio tuned to here and turning up\nFrom day one of the program I have always assumed you weren't really smart I have never felt the need to go first grade on you and explain the most basic concepts before I delve deeper into the subject and\nSort of the neutral rate and is it two percent is it more than two percent or because you know you look at where our rates are now and compare them to for example\nA German bonds three point\nThree percent and ours are now a well over two percent so what what's the difference there I mean is that really makes sense are in other words are we really kind of a hampering or growth by jacking up rates a little bit too aggressively kind of like President Trump has talked about or is there really a good solid reason for that\nIt seems to me the inflation pressures are usually coming from two sources one is a\nPlant and equipment and other words the capacity utilization there is no problem with that we're still way below ... a historical averages are plants and factories can accommodate further growth the the one issue is\nA labor and yet you look at the labor participation rate there are more people who could come into the workforce it hasn't really happened to any big degree\nBut again if you look at historical averages that you know there's more than a million workers who could come back to work if wages are tempting and you would kind of hope that that's what begins to happen at this point in the cycle\nAll the ... I shouldn't say all but a great many of the companies I think two thirds mentioned some cost pressures in their earnings releases but and and many of them also did raise prices we saw that from some of the big industrial companies and so forth you know you and I remember times when\nUnder normal circumstances there are some\nUh costs pressures and companies that are in a position to do so passes along and there are a commodity producers who cannot do that so you do get a sort of buy for Haitian of the market companies that have that pricing power and companies that do not we may be going into one of those periods but even\nWith that said I really don't see any huge underlying pressure\nOn prices that the fed has to really stomp out now\nYou know I think the numbers game tells you that the expectations of a December hike had been tempered a little bit uh I think most people still think that the fed will raise rates in December and unfortunately one of the reasons might be that Powell feels he cannot look like he's vowing to President Trump\nA by keeping rates even in that corner in that at that meeting um it might be though that the data suggests with a somewhat cooler a

in the media the red and the blue the global lists and the nationalist the urban and rural Michael has guided this conversation towards\nMoments in American history that resemble and alienation and our radicalization of the population we can speak up the revolutionary war but today because there was a new book\nFrom the distinguished professor at Columbia University in American studies Andrew Delbanco we turn to the period of ten to Fifteen Years Twenty years before the civil war of Eighteen sixteen this is\nComing running up to the to the fugitive slave act and then after the fugitive slave act they gave the power to the southern slave owners to\nPush gangs pot these into the free states and drug goon up gone kidnap a duck brutalized slaves to run away Michael a very good evening to you I go to jail bunkers book the ... the title is the war before the war\nFugitive slaves in the struggle for America's soul from the revolution to the civil war and what I find surprising parallels that professor Duncan finds himself\nIn the process of the two sides drawing up so that the conflict of Charleston Harbor and the first battle of Bull Run was a product of no\nUh no voices on either side saying wait a minute what are you doing where one country no that was defeated in the ten or Twenty years before\nEighteen sixty one and debacle has this one line in his first chapter about fugitive slaves and maybe a thousand ran away a day but many were murdered we don't have good numbers it enraged the abolition of the north and encouraged\n... aggrandize the slave owners and the south and this one line from Delbanco both sides had incentives to exaggerate the scale of what was happening a very good evening to you Michael\nThe perilous between the Eighteenth fifties the world and happening for the last several years is startling and most acutely skate when it comes to the\nTeachers and contours of the two um thriving radical groups in America\nIt comes to the features and contours of the two\nI'm driving radical groups in America today are which also correlate rather well with the idea of two different elites el although the um the so called progressive elite\nIs in many ways the more radical just as it was in the Eighteen fifties\nLose Sean Hannity show they want to keep going you want that success or do you want to tune in put on your television and hear Lance you below sea speaker Chuck Schumer the Senate majority leader because they have no plans to make your life better\nNothing they are proposing nothing to make the lives of Americans

sides\nAre in ... new book the war before the war\nHe presented the story of fugitive slaves and the struggle for America's soul from the revolution to the civil war this is a a historical analogy if it works and Michael is identified the the abolitionists the Eighteen fifties look very much likely strong minded\nA social justice warriors of the eight of the early twenty first century and according to the analogy here both sides are forcing those in between to choose so that they're destroying the middle there discouraging the middle\nWhat his last when that happens well Duncan things of that I don't want to read a passage that he's tied in his introduction this is from Richard ... the historian\nHe wrote the op ed in Nineteen sixty eight during the year fifty years ago when the U.S was pulling itself apart\nOver the Vietnam War over civil rights over violence in Europe over the Cold War public itself apart and ... wrote about the loss of comedy that it's a concern for Delbanco that was a concern in the Eighteen fifties and Michael and I talk about it because that means there is no center\nWhat it comes down to according to ... this comedy exist in a society that to the degree that those enlisted in its contending interests have a basic minimal regard for each other\nOne part of your interest seeks the defeat of an opposing interest on matters of policy but at the same time seeks to avoid crushing\nThe opposition denying the legitimacy of its existence or its values or inflicting upon an extreme and gratuitous humiliation beyond the substance of the games that are being thought\nThe basic humanity of the opposition is not forgotten stability is not abandon\nThe sense that our community life must be carried on after the issues of the moment have been fought over and one is seldom very far out of mind an awareness that the opposition will someday be the government is always present repeat an awareness that the opposition will someday be the government is always present\nThe reality and value of comedy can be best appreciate it when we contemplated society in which it is\nAnd awareness that the opposition will someday be the government is always present\nThe reality in value comedy can be best appreciate it when we contemplated society in which is almost completely lacking Michael that's a warning hopped on a road in Nineteen sixty eight we know that at some point\nThe alienation that we experience today started there in the Vietnam War we know it's we live we were young men\nIt's wonderful and important that those sentiments should come from a Richard Haass to enter\nA because Richard hops that it was writing a in the Nineteen sixties in in ... before or Vietnam\nOr the fifties and sixties in the last period of the after glow of World War two that had created\nUp the longest lasting\nUp period not simply of comedy comedy but a lot of a sense of national kinship and unity that that Ben began to pray\nSlowly with Vietnam and has unraveled to the point where it is today much like the ... before the civil war but hop status was riding\nFrom a period where both both of elites and America you know right and left to that extent we're we're committed to the same larger vision and to each other\nA ... there's no getting around it and today the opposite is true and what's really important and do both go in and all of his writing about abolitionists and the civil war that\nUnderscores the fact that the Appalachian is considered terrorists to be necessary if only to break the never ending gradual as some of good man a quote in his book on the\n... because they meant Roy the opposition not on the basis of policy but physically destroy still the opposition would never be the government that's what they meant to do\nExactly and it is because as I'm as\nRadical a profit seeking to expunged what is evil the expanding of evil is the destruction of fat author\nElite party which is no longer fraternal but now\nThe devil incarnate and what this does which is exactly what happened in the Eighteen fifty is is\nThat this I'm I'm ... clear and uh you know unvarnished a declaration\nThe Eighteen fifty is is that this I'm a clearer and uh you know unvarnished a declaration that we are out to\nTo ah to reform you and make you submit and if you refused you will be expunged is exactly what drove the south to\nThe intense aggressiveness that they exhibited in the Eighteen fifty it's not just the fugitive slave act but all of the ... of of terrorism and and and the like\nAnybody can and the ... some neuron the Dred Scott decision and the fugitive slave all the laws are going to Boston and humiliating the Bostonians by having to deliver a young man we we've gone through all of this Michael and we see the same\nThe same cycle going on today right one side ... when defeating the other side\nThey there is no possibility in the minds of either of the a radical elites today that they can survive without destroying the other and the fact is that the red side\nWhich is a smaller league as we've discussed and which is less are connected to the use of national power in Washington and in the economy certainly the the red a side is on the defense\nAnd it is quite clear ah and you can see it from the larger national media but there is a dominant voice uh and and the preponderance of\nOf a ... she might say a ... on the part of blue and blue is seeking um\nTotal an absolute objectives right\nNow [noise] highest Michael pie asleep thinking there is there is the ... election that does not

him so he can take some up front deductions that that offset any income that might be coming in business owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment\nThat they buy from many cases up to a million dollars a year John and if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment like Jared cushion you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the arrest as long as you put that equipment or that property into service you can take a big tax deduction Ford cushion or did this\nTo the extent where

even exceeded his income and then he was able to carry forward those losses or even carry them back as well so everything he did was\nCompletely legal and above board and not only that it's good tax strategy a business owners themselves should be paying attention\nTo that kind of tax strategy making investments like that and capital equipment property taking the tax deduction I think it's a very very good you know strong business moving I Hope that a lot of accountants are making those recommendations to their clients\nDid the tax cut and jobs active twenty Seventeen make this even more attractive as because this is the first year we discovered that\nIt did so do these these deductions\nHave been in place for a while I mean the big one that a lot of business owners need to be aware of it's called the section one Seventy nine deduction just ask your account and about that that deduction year after year I'm is kind of up for whether or not it was going to be renewed ball and the taxi format\nNot only was it made permanent but it was increased from like five hundred thousand dollars up to a million dollars that businesses can take as a as an accelerated depreciation to touch and not only that and the tax reform act\nThe act at allowed an added more deductions for certain business used vehicles trucks in your business as well that didn't exist before\nSo these are all things that are there and you and I are talking about this now it's late October there is still time left in the year business owners that you can you can make investments in capital of the equipment you can get them finance put him into service before the end of the year and take a significant tax deduction while doing that and why not\nWhat the number again Jane [noise] you can the section in

but there's a dispute with China as I indicated is going to drag on does this worry small businesses because they're worried about the macro economy or can they be this and their prices\nWell there is that there there were a lot of impacts on small businesses most small businesses themselves um or not to ... affected by the trade war but their interests\nThere is that there there were a lot of impacts on small businesses most small businesses themselves um or not to ... affected by the trade war but their indirectly affected by the trade war and\nThere are large companies like Ford who had announced the approximately twenty thousand employees that are going to be laid off because of increasing costs and Harley Davidson that's moving operations to ah you know other countries that side of the U.S to avoid ah the terrorists that they would have to pay and\nCompanies like three am and caterpillar that are facing increase costs on on some of the core materials that they buy 'em and also some of the market's up they might be losing because of the war that's going on right now and it is a war\nWith China that as an indirect impact on on small small contractors\nSuppliers vendors that that work up to those larger companies\nAnd then of course there's the consumer effect there is you know the most recent round of tariffs do affect electronics and consumer goods that are being sold by the Wal Marts and the targets of the world and that you know filters down to consumers you for many you know our our customers of small businesses and\nIf they're paying more there are willing to take away some disposable income that they could be spending this holiday season a at a small merchants are or restaurants so it does have that impacts right now like you said things are pretty much resolved with Canada and Mexico to be aware\nYou know all the legislature still have to approve this right\nSo that's still up in the air depending on how the midterms go\nEurope right now we're sort of at a truce so discussions continue on with China like you mentioned before is the big thing [noise]\nI I was at a meeting of ... a bunch of small manufacturers just this week in Minneapolis and

face to face and work it out with him I don't need my sales guys are representatives doing my part\nAnd some people think that that's what Trump strategy is that that's a lot of bravado and all building up to the big deal that ah that that the two of them are going to we're going to make in in November um doesn't sound like you're as optimistic about that have happened\nOh I Know I'm not however I Am\nThat uh that that that you would ever going to we're going to make in in November um doesn't sound like you're as optimistic about that happening\nAll I Know I'm not however I Am I Do have a positive peer to end this the macro consumers are spending Jean yeah ending spending and spending the wall Street Journal notes that\nThe consumer spending is powered by all the jobs and the really good jobs and that means a good Christmas Eve and and that's what we care about right now\nAgreed agreed and you know I think that the president now at near realizes we've heard that GDP um you know as potentially impacted by a trade issues with China\nBut John I mean right now the GDP is growing and like you said consumers are spending in the economy is strong and uh you know maybe from the president's perspective is like if I'm if we're going to fix this issue with China\nAn issue that so many of my clients have been complaining about for years why not do it now when we're in a position

troubled by perhaps\nA a troubled computer main computer and a backup computer the last time Bob reported the curiosity it sent pictures which is positive news and I believe there's more ... more positive news about curiosity a very good evening to you Bob Let's go to gale crater curiosity how's our friend\nOf John I have to tell you that was the shortest best summary of the story of Apollo wait I've ever heard it captured that year in less than\nFifteen seconds Berkeley\nUp we're yes we've got more images from curiosity and in fact we've gotten images two days in a row [noise] um they have been proceeding very very carefully I think because they switched to their original primary computer which early in the mission on on Mars had had problems and they had switched to the backup and I've been living with a back up\nTo now for many years um but uh they had their backup I suddenly had\nProblems in September so they switched back to their original primary computer they think it was fixed they figured out the problem years ago but they left it as a backup and now they're going to go to what they want to be very careful so they took a few images about two weeks\nAgo and they spent the week looking at things I gather and then they proceeded to take a few more images about a week ago I'm just a few more but I was talking about two images the first time and for an engine second time and so\nUh they looked at those for another week and then in the last two days and this is the first time in five weeks they a lot downloaded a almost normal number of images from their navigation and there has it avoids cameras for those um and they did two days in a row\nAnd that's pretty full complement of images from those four cameras and two days in a row and that's it suggests\nThey are increasingly confident confident\nThat the computers now it's operating correctly and can be trusted that has been no press release yet but I kind of expect one anytime now give me the specifics that I think we can look\nForward in the coming days of curiosity starting up hill that Saudi and its journey off of aerobic version on onward\nAnd I think we can look forward in the coming days of curiosity starting up hill and starting its journey off of aerobic version on on word\nCuriosity got his mojo back maybe and that positive news now be unhappy detail of the recent Mars

this is this is a good news story or the Russians you know how to fail ... launch with two astronauts on board about two weeks ago and uh they therefore they've had to do a lot of patients about why that happened bought\nA this week they successfully launched\nA Soyuz rocket launching military satellite or out of that plus a large side space port in the middle of the country or what that means is that they now are confident they pinned down the issues with the Sawyers rocket now there's a variety of Saudis rockets but all of them generally use the same\nFirst and second stage configurations which is what was the problem that first launch that bad last two weeks ago the change of the third stage uh they do use a very interested in cages and show\nThis launch was a success and it does indicate that they're getting closer to solving the problem\nIt's more important that they want to do a variety of unmanned test launches with the show are used to make sure they've got things right\nAnd this is one of them that got at least two more before the man's flying December that means I assess is almost certainly not going to end up having to be evacuated unmanned John there'll be able to get the manned launch in December off on time for\nThe report also had an interesting detail about the investigation into the failure we thought it was a collision between strap on second stages and the core first stage of the solar use a there was some speculation that one of the foul vented vows that's supposed to help push that strap on away did not work\nBut new reporting suggests that the booze that the booster itself the strap on itself was installed incorrectly when it was assembled and they forced a mounting log\nIn that ... out of shape in the process that's what I've got

test flight of style line it's tentatively scheduled no early March while the good news here is the atlas five upper stage descent or upper stage has now been delivered um\nTo Florida it's came by barge but it has arrived and so they're beginning the assembly process or the actual rocket that will launch star liner\nSometime early in the first quarter next year we\nBlew arch knew Glen we

what's a little different is the ship we'll be moving to pick the one who picks it up I'm not sure why they're doing that but that's what they say but either way it's been delivered to Florida and they're going to do work on it and there's the articles of them as much information I linked to\nOther than that it's going to be a much bigger public announcement and about a week so we'll have to wait to see what that means\nBut it doesn't mean that people are just moving forward on its new Glenn orbital rocket John I'm going to see it so\nGreat for us Bob Forrest do I get my uniform a patch

special show scary thing\nAbout those parts of real estate that my view the shift\nLike borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars more putting down roots in a way you would never do if\nOnce you know the fact none of that is really scary I\nRecently spoke about some of those from real estate topics to go in the night with a lot of men and haul CEO of re max bloom realty in Columbia, Missouri and the president of the national association\nAnd as we approach Halloween my first question to Elizabeth was are you scared\nAlways always Colleen is it is always a scary scary them but also one of the most people thought of in\nAir too [noise] so what happens in Columbia, Missouri on Halloween Night trick or treating\nIt is always a scary scary than but also one of the most fun of into the air\nToo so what happens in Columbia, Missouri on Halloween\nTrick or treating you know trick or treating happened with all the the last day of October so like many communities the last day of the month of the very popular day for clothing with um homeownership and and so as people get ready to wrap up those mortgage payments and they move into a new home\nAwesome [noise] some people across America fought about buying a little bit scary should it be\nAnd before I bought a home I got home ownership was scary to me any repair or anything that might have to happen to how it was always two thousand dollars no matter what I was if it was a roof for it so it was a leaky faucet I thought it was going to cost two thousand dollars\nBut that's not the truth and certainly you know sometimes homeownership is scary because you realize not only are you going to now be responsible for your monthly payment to live you're going to be responsible for the most ongoing payments and you know realtors that's a great place where you can use your local realtor who can connect you with\nThose experts in the neighborhood the plumbers electricians it takes away a little bit of that fear because sometimes not everybody has those connections and they need to a realtor cannot make\nThose [noise] you make a really good point because you're not only paying the mortgage also paying for maintenance but it's your house and you can maintain it you can make sure it's done right\nAbsolutely in and maintain it the way you want to I think that's another one of the great benefits that now it's your home and you can do what you want to do with it and you can add on a deck if you want or you can put that picture in a while or you can decorate the outside for all those trick or treaters\nAnother scary thing is borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy that house for some people that just terrified I'm\nSure that's one of the very first thing that's going to happen when you meet with a realtor you're going to have a conversation about\nThe mortgage process and you know and in a row of trees are going to recommend some lenders in the area who you can talk to about what that payment means how you pay it back what happens is you know you feel you can't afford it or you or you can't payment and how\nTo manage that process but it's their long term payments and it's you're investing in you know you're not investing and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less and\nDean and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less in a home and invest in yourself and someone else\nOn the other thing we're here to visit some mostly young people are afraid to get tied down they don't want to put down roots they want to stay free and that's why they don't buy a house how about that part\nOf one of the values of this country is freedom and being able to move and do what you want to do but in order to do that it does require resources and many times those are financial resources the best way to build wealth to have the freedom to do what you want to do it to own that home it's an investment in yourself and your future and so\nUm it's a great way to really establish your financial portfolio for life\nAs a matter of fact as one young person told me the other day they're going to buy a house but they still want to live in different places all across America so at one point dove rented out and they'll move somewhere else solid\n... I mean certainly you want to check with your local realtor find out about the communities there are communities that rent better than others and so but it becomes an investment portfolio for you and we are seeing that you know as people want to continue to move and\nHome owners today also become traveler and are renters in property for vacation days do you get to have the benefit of both is a tough one\nTen years ago the financial markets crashed some people are afraid to buy a house because they're afraid that's going to happen again\nSure that's where your local realtor really is important to have a conversation 'cause every market and different and every market has recovered differently from that financial crash certainly there's been different changes and lending\nThat are going to help mitigate that for the future so there had been some rules and regulations that have been put in place to try to avoid that which will help our home buyers and that but you want to talk to your local real chore about the conditions of\nThe area where you're considering the by whether it's a first home or a second home you know our prices increasing the inventory low or high you know that it will give you more of a sense of a long term investment picture\nSo finally if someone gets passed all those scary things by their own house [noise] we need to remind them that one of the most comforting things ever to sleeping in the home you know\nOr their own house [noise] we need to remind them that one of the most compelling things ever to sleeping in the home you\nGet what everybody wants to do at the end of the day\nWhen you're tired when you're excited you want to go home but it's also the place you get to celebrate so many memories get to celebrate birthdays and dinners and you certainly get to celebrate hopefully all those trick or treaters who come to your door and and the costumes and the sun and the interaction with the neighborhoods and that's a great fun thing about this week\nWell happy Halloween was about ... men and all the EEO of ... Borneo in Columbia, Missouri and the president of the national association of realtors\nComing up on a real estate very if saving tens of thousands of dollars for a down payment scares you knew you

with our special show a scary thing real estate take on Halloween which of course is this coming Wednesday and right\nI look at something many people find downright terrifying it the number five a number that strikes fear into the hearts of home buyers who worry about whether there'll be able to get a house if mortgage interest rates hit five percent\nEarlier this month the interest rate on the thirty year fixed rate mortgage did just that it reached the five percent mark for the first time since two thousand eleven\nWhat does five means for the housing market the big question of course when that discourage buyers\nThe first time since two thousand eleven\nWhat goes five mean for the housing market the big question of course when that discourage buyers buyers who are already facing rising prices and buyers who can't find a home for sale in many markets\nWhen that could be a discouraging factor but others point out that even a five percent interest rate is still historically low especially compared with the double digit rates scene in the past\nAs real estate today's bill Thompson tells us real tours lenders builders and bankers are all getting ready for five percent\nIn places like Reno nevada rising mortgage rates are already changing the market says Monica my column was called little bankers select real estate she told cable TV on TV\nFires are being more cautious

very own homes charging our smartphone it's an important topic because after all so much of our lives and our real estate happens on our phones these days so you need to keep that phone are charged up\nBut you know how phones keep getting better and better well part of those improvements involve charging improvements that can help make that daily chores easier and faster than ever\nThere are two types of new charging jak you need to know about one is high speed charging the other is wireless charging we'll talk about both of them starting with high speed\nBecome any Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones habits basically a charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast and then the speed slows down to protect the battery\nBasically a charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour no that's really fast and then the speed slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a list of the ones that do that the Qualcomm quick charge website just search quick charge\nOkay so quick charge is great but you still have to plug it in right well right but that's another area where the tech has gotten better\nThe old us be many connector is worthy industry standard but you had to put them in right side up or they wouldn't go in\nToday's us be seeking actors can be plugged in right side up or upside down and they work just fine same goes for the very latest ... connection called ... three\nOkay so that's high speed charging now wireless charging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or desks or square blocks and when you get home just put your phone on it\nDone no plugs no cables just put the phone down and let the charging begin\n[noise] it's not as fast as quick charge but it's so easy\nAnd if you get a call just pick up your phone no on plugging it from the charger cable now the original wireless chargers weren't that good because you had to put the phone down just write or wouldn't charge the new ones do have a really big charging surface so they're excellent\nAmong the phones that habit the apple ten the Samsung Galaxy s nine and Google's pixel three\nJust a couple of ideas for you to help make one of the most common

course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with the down payment\nHour we talked about new research from the Urban Institute about barriers to homeownership and how coming up with that down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely on founded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are\nThey think they need more money than they really do and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has a down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into that house\nLet's talk about that now joining us once again is Rob crane what the organization down payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible homebuyers an eligible properties\nNow joining us once again is Rob crane with the organization dome payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties where it's hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate\nToday sprayed today with you again okay so\nRob let's talk about those down payment assistance programs first of all\nIt's not just for first time buyers Everytime correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because the definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer 'cause you have an owned a home in the last three years so you could have a lot over the past and\nNot all but three years then for these purposes nice to meet the first time homebuyer requirement also there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs down at any first time homebuyer requirement\nInteresting and another thing Rob about downpayment assistance programs you don't have to necessarily heavy starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making a really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with where you live because the um ... household income limits on these programs they not only in the area from program the program but they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas\nThe area median income is going to be higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live you might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household and still qualify for a lot of these programs\nThat is amazing to Rob how to our listeners learn more about down payment resource and the down payment how that might be available to them\nWell they can go the down payment resource dot com and ... button that says find programs and to her about six or eight pieces of information about their household\nAnd then assess civil tell how many programs that are eligible for an a\nTelling about those programs where to find money most importantly right that if I doubt you're eligible for money or had a pass to get there and and it's just similar I'll tell him that I'll tell them not only where the where where to find the money where the participating lenders participating education\nThey're at and and it's just some tell them that they'll tell them not only where the where where to find the money where the participating lenders participating education fighters and so forth\nI see so Rob let me back up just for one minute if I learned that I Am eligible for down payment assistance they don't just write me a check writing all that happens during the mortgage application process\nExactly exactly so it's really important when you were looking for a home to find a lender as Leonard or you go out looking for actually that's that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about trying to figure out a ticket for Ford it or not right\nBut when you're talking to different lenders\nThing that you want to be sure and do it asked\nWhat downpayment assistance programs they participate in it doesn't matter they led protests age I think that the lenders that don't necessarily participate in every program\nThe most large metro areas have dozens of programs so really find out first what do you talk to the lenders how that can help you with the programs\nThat is great advice and Rob I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about\nThe latest report barriers to homeownership by the Urban Institute and also the ways the down payment resource can help people find the money they need to put down on a house thank you for being here\nThank you Steve and it's always great to be with you I appreciate the opportunity\nYou're very welcome Rob crane were down payment resource connecting eligible home buyers and eligible properties with hard to find a

for both sides combination of good defense in some really big costly penalties\nAre just to show you how much of an offensive shortage there was both teams had two of the best Russia's an estate Austin Clark for press get Alex Nelson for both of them with more than Fifteen hundred yards on the ground and neither of them got close to a hundred yards on the ground last night\nNelson actually had more receiving yards any did rushing yards do most of that was on a Saturday yard TD pass you calling from ...\nAnd got a feel for poor Bryce Peters he kicked one field goal successfully but

Ninety I Am one oh three point by that time and online at K. Y. C. A. dot info\nOr the wind gives me an gets the Grand Canyon region championship and an automatic bird in the for a conference state playoff press get well they weren't ranked number eleven going into last night's game the top sixteen teams\nBe a chip in an automatic birth in a for a conference state playoff press get\nWell they weren't ranked number eleven going into last night's game the top sixteen teams make it to state and as we speak the ... is doing its selection show and I do have the contacts who says she'll text me she hears any news about where Prescott ends up in the brackets\nOr if they're left out of the post season dance now you might be saying come on rust you really think the batteries are going to drop six months after that last last night\nGiven the sitting there and again I've seen with PowerPoints over the past couple years it would not surprise me at all last two years press it's been a seven in three teen and they have not\nGotten into the playoffs I'm Sorry I don't mean to be negative but I just do not have much faith in this power point system\nBecause this is what happens when you out of computer making all your decisions\nKind of like the Dodgers dating game to the world series they had their for top homerun hitters start the game on the bench why because of the lefty righty match up because the analytics said this and that now granted putting money ground all on the bench\nOkay under the Raleigh talk about what it was like when that game was finally over your ... got to win and you knew you were going to nationals\nUm when I came as our I think we're all just kind of like oh my gosh that was that was a lot but we were excited because our ultimate goal the whole season wants to get to nationals and we had just completed it so that was exciting\nYeah it wasn't the first time that ... going to nationals but ah it all in all the previous national tournament experience experiences they they were one and done last in the opening round so Chris not only did you get to play in the opening round but your foot yacht hosted it at Embry riddle against University of science and arts of Oklahoma\nReally great mascot named the rovers so I Believe they were named after Glen and Sean drove or the former guitarist and drummer for for\nOf science and arts of Oklahoma really great mascot named the rovers so I Believe they were named after Glen and Sean drove or the former guitars the drummer for for mega death\nOkay maybe maybe not I think ... they were named for the people who like herd animals what what anyway so Christ it in a game with the University of science and arts of Oklahoma man what a mouthful um you actually had your Thirteen game shutout street snapped a the ... got the first\nGoal on you so what was that experience like I think you actually went into the locker room down one to nothing American\nIt was definitely different us to be down because like you said we had a streak of wind and shut out but\nIt was kind of a weight off our shoulders like we were waiting for a not a lot of teams go shut out so when it happened they were like okay this happened now what's important is how we react to it and he went into the locker room we regrouped and he came out and we won the game\nMhm right and and Barker when a when you got that wind that history making when first ever national tournament when for Embry riddle what was going through your head\nAnd I was just outside of our tainted able to come back like that and then for us to finally reach our goal to got Alabama it's I think Raul ecstatic and so happy\nWell speaking of going into the Alabama Riley I interviewed you after a that national tournament win against the University of arts and science of Oklahoma\nGot to be a short who's going to be a shorter game for that one so I'm interviewing you and again I I asked you you know so so your thoughts about going to Alabama around to the answer you gave me was it's going to screw up my physics grade but who needs physics\nAll in Embry riddle athlete would give me an answer like that so now I have to ask Raleigh after after that experience with the national tournament how did you do on that physics exam\nYou know I didn't do as well as I have but that's my only be so far in college but it was worth it to go to Alabama to have a V. [laughter]\nSo so Christopher for a few ladies are there any additional nerves playing in a national tournament game or what\nYou obviously have a ... a high stakes game by if you can't ... you can come out really successful and I think that's what we did\nOkay so Parker last year you go to the second round of national tournament your take on spring Arbor who are actually the the ah the ultimate ah the national champions um they'd be in a second round\nAround the national tournament your take on spring Arbor who are actually the the ah the ultimate ah the national champions um they'd be in a second round last year I'm In the course they'd be in the tournament the went to a tournament this year Spring Harbor beaches there so what is it about Spring Harbor that makes him such a great team\nUm they just have a lot of very talented players and I think they've all been planning for a while together um and we just said respect them all I think and they just kind of very strong and that just have to pay difficulty anything against\nSo Raleigh for yourself as an athlete playing on a team that's in the top ten in the nation in the eye when you go up against a team the caliber of spring Arbor um\nAre there are a lot of nerves going into the game that you know this is the number one team the defending national champions or as an athlete or you like you were up there in the top ten they're on the top ten and I want to go toe to toe with this team because I Want to prove that you know we belong with a team of this caliber\nUm there's definitely nerves going into it but you just kind of have to look at it as they're eleven players stepping on the field we have eleven players stepping on the field and we're all just kind of play soccer you definitely have to respect them a little more than other teams but you also use that respect to try to compete in with them and do well\nOkay and uh so Christopher I'm you know again you you guys have been on a Thirteen game shutout street going back to last year you're on a ... game winning streak this year ... through the ... conference so what does it take for you ladies to when you step on that field\nNot get overconfident and not take your opponent lightly [noise]\nUm because we ... we we had a vision for the future I think that every game that we go out there we no matter the stats because no one cares about ours that they come just as hard as that as we go out there and we want to use every game to get better as a team and work together 'cause there's something we can improve on every time we step out on a field\nDay so Parker again last year riddle won its first national tournament game he got up to the second round and unfortunately last Spring Harbor so what do you feel it's going to take this year for this very experienced team with a really good group of freshmen to go even further up the N. A. I. national tournament\nOn I think it all scientists are five says they all have this or you know working really hard to gather and like continued for that try to go even farther and which I think we can do because I said I hear and ... and ...\nI'll have to you know working really hard to gather and like continue for that ... case I can I hear and ... and having all there are times we want to go again I think ... how they come out on every single game and keep working at each other\nOkay well folks in the studio with me today I have crystal e park early no relation to even though they sometimes want to convince people that they are related and\nRiley Martin sand with me from the number eight rank Embry riddle women's soccer team so we're going to continue talking with them on the other side of the break but before we do go to break it's time to see huge shined over the past seven days as we present the drive to these sports round up three stars of the week\nStarting with the ladies are number three star is Victoria McCarty of the pie college volleyball team she made thirty four digs in the lady writers three to drive over Arizona western last friday\nThe number two stars ...

Jon rushed with you here and in the studio with me I have Parker league crystal E N\nRaleigh Martin scene from the Embry riddle women's soccer team and as I always do when I Am local athletes in the studio we've got to ask a little a few questions about their teammates so it's lightning round time so Parker let's go with you first\nWho is the best dressed player on the Embry riddle eagles who is the team fashion plate\nOh man [noise] and uh also now also say in high school you were a member of the link crew what exactly is the link crew on\nLincoln is just a program I think it might be nationwide that helps your so junior and seniors are in link crew and you help freshmen transition to high school\nAll right so of course do let's go over to you and let's cherry pick some stuff from your biography off the Embry riddle website up I got to do with their first off on\nLast year on last year on our tries to be sports round up a Christmas special you said the one thing you want for Christmas was a hermit crab with the unicorn horns and sparkles did you get\nThat I did get it but uh he no longer with us anymore because\nHis heat land broke out one weekend and they were not at home and my house it's too cold\nA rip\nA unicorn hermit crab I guess and also on the lines of we're pets you also I guess at one time had a pet tarantula\nI did and then I only sold or because I had her in my dorm room and it was not practical\nBut she was probably my favorite pet I loved her [laughter] okay\nAnd now you're a major you or a global security and intelligence studies major and it looks like your area focuses Arabic in Middle Eastern studies so what got you interested in that field\nWell we have to take a language for global security\nAnd intelligence study than I chose Arabic over ... they just was more interested in learning about the Arab world and I studied abroad in Morocco and I just absolutely fell in love with it right\nNow coming down to your favorite movie you know we got park early with lights out we had Riley with iron giant\nYour favorite movie is Batman now I have to ask you the dumb Michael Keaton Batman or the Christian Bale Batman Christian male [laughter] okay now of all three of those Christian Bale a Christopher Nolan Batman movies which is your favorite\nAbout the one with the heath ledger in it but I have felt that questionnaire out when I was a freshman and\nChristian Bale a Christopher Nolan's Batman movies which is your favorite\nProbably about the one with the heath ledger and it but I've felt that questionnaire out when I was a freshman and since then I think my favorites that changed and my favorite movie would be the death Fallows\nWho are sharing actually probably my favorite for Harry Potter movies I'd probably go with either a prisoner of asking ...\nThat's funny because the prisoner of aspirin is my favorite book ah but my favorite movie of the death valid\nAnd for me my favorite book or the Harry Potter series is actually order of the Phoenix so then I guess we just have to agree to disagree okay now I just my favorite book is actually my least favorite movie though I probably would have to agree OK I'm Glad we can agree on some things\nFor your favorite band you have Mumford and sons into them I don't know\nRap music and all that stuff I can only listen to when I'm In a mood but ... I can listen to any of the day any day of the week no matter what\nSo do you have that on the uh the team music mix Noel unfortunately it does not punish everybody up and I have to listen to everybody is like uh\nYeah so so do I when I met those games in most of my legs do not come in the field in the form of rap and hip hop\nOr like you know or like you know pre packaged pop music or whatever so so so far girl that's going to get back on the soccer field here in our last few minutes here um and you and your soccer career college highschool club what's probably the worst field you've ever played on\nI'm suffering being from Washington there is I don't remember exactly where that is in Seattle area where it was just dirt and not get a play on and just\nTerrible really bad [laughter] okay so ... for you and you were actually also from Washington to see you may have a similar experience to Barker worst field you've ever played on\nThe worst failed I ever played on was ... a old clubs field [laughter] those things where like playing in a forest of grass it was so long and thick the ball did not move it all your cabs burned out to the game from having to run through it\nSo Parker agree or disagree that the your club field was just horrible\nI'm going to have to desegregate like it's fake grass but it's still nice grass and it's a very nice complex so\nI think she's just picky ... I think we're going to get an argument to after the show goes off the air so Christopher yourself worst field you've ever played on\nField that just ... I had a bad memory of is when they lost to marry him out\nThe show goes off the air so Christopher yourself worst field you've ever played on\nA field that just ... I had a bad memory of is when they lost to Marymount at their place it really isn't there a place in California in my freshman year there it was bumpy and lumpy it was dirt and rocks and hey it was awful\nI put on a side you know that's what it looks like\n[laughter] when we're there like any like livestock their grazing on probably [laughter] oh [laughter] okay so so Parker I mean of course you know big time soccer player here and everything but did you play any other sports besides soccer while you were in high school\nI did play basketball um up until I just fashion and sophomore year and then I also they track and field\nSo what is doing track and field I say the Joplin oh how did you do in that event\nI actually did pretty well for my side of his ... are pretty bigger for females that I pay far and then Iran only a few times freshman year I just didn't like riding in circles\nSo [laughter] that's what we're running up and down this one in ... counties for something\nYeah OK and ... what about you did you do any other sports in high school besides a soccer\nI only did track for three years in high school so what did you do in track I did the one the to the fore by one and the four by four wow so which one was probably your best event\nHonestly I'm not very fast so none of them I don't know why did I was not going to track flu just stuck with soccer then yeah those\nAre Christa oh for yourself what other sports do you do in high school besides soccer\nOther than soccer I played flag football and I ran track and oh and what would you run the drug I ran every sprinting event the one the two to three hundred or does the four hundred and all that relays\nSo unlike with Raleigh I guess did you ... did you feel that the being the track and field help you get faster on the soccer field\nIt actually did learning to run on your toes and learning how to actually run faster\nZero and maybe you could have benefited from track and field and ... a little faster\nI don't know that that sport was a lot of running for no reason [noise] first planes or something isn't it's hard to motivate yourself I Need like a ball at the end of the line [laughter]\nTo\nSo and along with worst feel Parker which probably being from Washington I imagine you got some stories what's the worst whether you've ever\n[laughter] to so and along with worst feel Parker what's probably being from Washington I imagine you got some stories what's the worst whether you've ever played in\nI have played inhale before and that plays a painful not find the running is coming down sideways and just awful\nAwful okay Riley for you to worst weather conditions you've ever played and\nI actually played in a blizzard one game it got called I think twenty minutes early because the ball was accumulating snow and turn into us like a snowball\nAnd we had to find they call it quits because we couldn't see it on line we couldn't see the ball we couldn't see the other end of the field it was pretty bad Cristo worst weather conditions you've ever played in\nI'd be on the complete opposite side of the spectrum I Lived in Vegas so playing in a hundred and twenty degree weather probably had to be the worst thing ever\nAnd you didn't collapse of a heat stroke or anything did you try not to\n[laughter] way first we're coming up to the end of our show here and I want to thank Chris delete park early and Riley Martin for joining us here on the tri city sports around talking about the other season and so of course to your next game I Believe it's actually going to be your last regular
