know where this is going but I'm going to stick with it eight five five forty Laura the or the Democrats I think thoughts um wrongly that [noise]\nAll they need to do is mentioned the word race or racism or maybe maybe every election it's always okay do you support the Confederate flag how many times that we heard that question raised so it goes to the Confederate flag Robert release statues none of that creates a one\nJob for African Americans not one job but they beat that drum why why do they beat that drum\nYou're listening to your healthy radio addiction your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American votes for Republicans or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so Connie continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nHillary every one of the cats\nDecision making and you know I can get to see my dad all the time like the guy\nWas it was a strong enough to put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made\nThat was the favorite superhero [noise] and you made a Superman case for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that's what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nAll said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that ah they're Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president in ...\nLandslide you remember that I Do we played them every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her and for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy\nAnd but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow\nAnd I'm someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true but\nDo you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that comedy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West's let's listen to\nThe music all the other hand he someone to help them they've been guide him and he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nGo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative and who want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people who devoted their lives for this oil I mean you could raise the question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to\nDorm room\nKaty Perry running around college campuses it's trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy if it bit him in the back side\nOn college campuses ... trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy of a bit him in the back side will take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls\nEight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans flip the script this is a unconventional moves and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go after\nThis is Michael ... and here with my stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans are decreasing us here so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate health markets offers a free service with access\nTo thousands on Medicare plans plans that can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with a new euro dollar premiums and even plans that pay you back\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objected to help to find a planet may cost less and cover more with lower co pay more choice of like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you choose don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free thanks my this is Michael ... for health markets\nJustified of this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting\nPeople to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress you nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nAlmost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled\nHe nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into aid uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[laughter] well as you know the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stand the idea that a President Trump is now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point in the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a\nA two to this uh unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh when you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have when the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nJustice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that\nBait do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with a with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of a mob rule\nAnd senator what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard Becker very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n... that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the ...\nWell I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see it down there in a turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said while he would have voted for a cab and all but I'm the truth is\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term than we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking and just going to count on our issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court tech the incentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for relieving a FBI report\nOr a or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions at least now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter and then linked then send it to the FBI after the initial um the initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or M Ms cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford's interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're going to we're going to get to the bottom of this uh I pick up they'll probably be an ethics committee and\nDidn't serve Dr Ford's interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yet we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this uh ... they'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA successor and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that\n... names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration\nWith outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their text messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there is nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh Ogden I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator or for the next uh you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands around back\nPeople are working together they're not back biting each other as much I mean Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win re election you haven't had Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nLot more optimistic that I've been in a long time law I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darn impressive I Know\nThe mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but really this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this is ...\nHere but really this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\nA has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right I'm to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or\nA warning cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the ballot ask Jill McCaskill\nExactly on Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time\nBut there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and I just thought it was I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every egg exploited on earth but he was at that reading poetry so and now and everything like that is great we're reaching out of it is wonderful it's authentic and me not Trump as that's near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not\nI I think so well it's just driving makes their heads explode and they act in all sorts of ... Russian irrational\nWays and and uh we've seen that and looked in the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on on TV and uh I think this or we just need to get this midterm election behind as we need to keep the house and the ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including a adding more federal judges to the bench\nOh my gosh that is ... the judicial branch coal equal ranch of our government article three judges and we need more on Trump nominees on the bench and when you declare those are cleared those through Senator Cornyn again thanks so much for all you did a confirmation battle over Kavanaugh's Iraq\nThat old process was definitely not smart then I went to it because they figured out hiring for\n\nFree at last ...

Manhattan he's talking impeachment not only of President Trump but also a Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what you have is that there is no longer a belief that governance however you define governance whether it's a Supreme Court decision or or laws statutes that are passed by Congress no\nAct of governance can alleviate theirs and in fact any decision\nIn any uh government sphere only in flames\nThe situation so this is where I come up with this idea of of a curve\nThat that at some point gets beyond control that there's no way to call it back and you know other countries like China seeing this understand that this is there a moment\nTo potentially intervene once the U.S is fully a mobilized to achieve all of their objective\nLook what they just did Michael they disappeared the president of Interpol in front of everybody and I have no explanation for it he says he resigned his post he's a member of the Communist Party in fact he's a senior figure in the ministry of state security\nAnd they're that China is arrogant to the point of believing that the international community can not in any way make them pay for that\nThe moment the president\nIs um through some sort of event shown to be\nIn charge or to be uh\nIs um through some sort of event shown to be not in charge or to be a made\nA ... in some form an impeachment would be one of those processes\nAt that moment something will happen abroad and that will be an earth shattering historical moment for the United states in the world and the the the people who to cry\nOr the president will have been in effect for those who have brought this on\nIt Michael there is a reason to make the case now that it's already too late for this that we can stop it that the escalation cycle\nThere there's pleasure in the escalation cycle for too many parties China Russia to name too but also those allies who are not all that friendly say Germany or Great Britain already going through their own disorder\nAnd that a ... and with the American superpower weakened by internal drive\nOr our allies and our phone believe they gain another word that may be there a moment to take a chance\nAnd we're not we're not prepared to defend ourselves Michael were not an estate I I Do not know if the Democratic party presuming it takes control the house I don't know if they'll follow the constitution I mean going after the president with\nCharges of impeachment based upon you understand that that kind of disruption makes that makes America I'm disorganized to the point of not being able to defend itself\nWill people living in the moment who are wrapped up in the beliefs\nThat they are in charge or we have less than a minute Michael go hey represent the leadership\nThose sorts of people are not I'm sensitive to nor are they attuned to shift in which the entire situation shifts\nAnd there\nIs today I think a larger atmosphere shift in which expectation is now the driving element in other words the Chinese\nAnd the Russians and of course even the Europeans expect that this is going to be a kind of end game for America and as a result they are going to act accordingly\nGoing to be a kind of game for America and as a result oriented act corny early\nIn America people in power whether they are\nRed or blue or simply obsessively and understandably focus on the domestic\nWhale leave it there Michael a house of

are only three countries from the Arctic Ocean to the Arabian Sea and that's Russia or is it by John and Iran\nSo if the U.S or European partners went to conduct trade with East Asia over land and

United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nThat they can document and I don't doubt them than Mr Trump inherited more than four hundred million dollars from his father who was a very successful real estate developer in New York and in the boroughs\nI joined the puzzle here is does receiving four hundred million dollars from your father make you a self made man when you're worth billions [noise]\nUh yes it most certainly does make you a self made man let's look at the Forbes four hundred there airs in it and there are self made man it it's very rare that there's both in it in Trump's case\nNo one's going to the night it surprised exactly no one that he inherited more than the one million he claimed but his father was a very successful outer borough real estate developer obviously a brilliant guy there's no question about that but Donald Trump has his name on buildings in Manhattan\nThe most difficult and competitive real estate market in the world he has his name on buildings around the world by the New York times very own reasoning he is one of the great marketers of all time relentless march or relentless dealmaker if that's not self made what he did\nTurning what his father gave him into a global brand I don't know what it is\nBecause Mr Trump is often in the news and because we're watching him as the president quite apart from as a

lots of livelihoods around the world you stay at all the time John So I Want you to\nHelp the audience to understand why it is that rich people are the job creators\nWell let's say I want to stress ... your your point to New York times acknowledge that everything Fred Trump did to avoid taxes was okayed by the Internal Revenue service there was nothing illegal here and thank goodness\nFred Trump did and the Trump family did what Bill gates has family does what Mark Zuckerberg's what any rich person does is try to minimize their tax Bill Bissett gets to your question\nThe rich prayed all the opportunity precisely because they have unspent wealth\nInvestment is what drives economic growth there are no companies and no jobs without investment first so when we limit what the U.S Treasury

a real estate portfolio when you were still really young and right now\nA real tour in his early thirties who's been buying investment properties for nearly a decade and has his experience gross he uses that to help his client both young and old become successful investors themselves\nJoining us now is Philip Becker real tour and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas in two thousand fourteen Philip received the prestigious thirty under thirty award from any are and among his investment properties is one in the U.S Virgin Islands Phillip welcome to real estate today\nThanks rarely seen it a tragedy here\nWe're delighted you're here and by the way good choice on where to locate your investment property\nThat's not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nActs soon so Philips how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell when I bought my first investment property even I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nSo fed up you also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novel\nSo fed up you also help your client to invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that\nA lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the investment game and you know when I first started I wasn't made my first investment was an owner finance deal and I bought that land with just ... percent down and so I help a lot of investors especially being younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got\nInto real estate in two thousand nine\nAnd I have a lot of younger people that are able to help with investments and it's great to show them how you know things like solar financing and even use responsibly financial products such as hard money loans can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest in the may have no idea how to do it how do you help them\nI think just with every other Clyde it starts with you know a buyer counseling session\nAnd one of the big things I tell my clients is don't be afraid to invest outside your market you know even for people that are just getting started specially if there are a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean being involved with you know the national association and committee such as a young professionals network has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lotta times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great a referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real estate investors how do they tend to pay for these places\nIt does kind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me\nWinds by her first investment property she did not have amazing income but she had a fantastic credits in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars\nA call and we were in for a total of eighty seven and she was able to turn that thing for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars make him about a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs on her first investment which was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and Philip you just mentioned getting a hard money loan which is a private individual\nAbout an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and fill up you just mentioned getting a hard money loan which is a private individual or a private group who fund a mortgage without the requirements than a major national bank would have so tell us how do you find a hard money loans\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way\nTo accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing that it's also portfolio\nWhen I was but as far as hard money loans it's really just about networking and finding other people that have done it we started group called the broker underground and the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share referrals such as\nHard money lone individuals so we've got an entire list of different people as well as feedback from agents good or bad on how the experience was for the consumer and for the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think\nNetworking is is so key for trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and and can help your clients\nFill up that is such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years ahead\nThere simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is\nNow with the people that are older you know what I mean for the people that are older it's\nNot too late but those that got started in investing in their twenties there simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them\nYou know I ... I Love that will fill up by really appreciate you joining us on the show today and sharing your strategies your tactics and your techniques for investing in real estate thank you\nThank you so much Steve pleasure\nPhilip Becker realtor and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas and a millennial investor\nComing up on real estate today stumbling a team of experts to help you get started investing that's next on our special show that\nThis was the news fourteen Ninety and one oh three point five FM K Y.

building wealth and income along the way [noise]\nSo what if you're interested in real estate investor how do you start [noise]\n[noise] well let's ask someone who specializes in exactly that guiding people through the process of becoming a bona fide real estate investor joining us\nIs Chris ... Clark real tour and investment specialist with century Twenty one signature real estate in Des Moines Iowa Christian is a national thirty under thirty on hurry and is currently serving as NPR's commercial and business specialties liaison for president Elizabeth ... [noise]\nA national thirty under thirty ornery and is currently serving as NPR's commercial and business specialties liaison for president Elizabeth men didn't know of course don't welcome back to real estate today\nThanks so much for having me back\nWe are so glad you're here to crush the first of all how's business\nIt's fantastic business is always good that's all I can say\nThat's wonderful so Christ a year now thirty three years old twelve years ago you bought your first investment property\nBut I Know that even though you are real estate investor your heart is really with your clients helping them grow a portfolio that will generate income and wealth overtime\nAbsolutely absolutely I you know I was lucky enough to have that opportunity to invest the age and given that opportunity is the other is really why is that for me\nSo Chris when you are young real estate investor gets started first of all how young is young who is your youngest investor ever\nYou know what I actually had a young kid from my home town actually that bought his first home which actually was an investment because it needed some work it was a foreclosure that he had found and he was willing to put that work at it and he had just graduated high school I was Eighteen\nSo yes I think he bought the property and like June and he had just graduated in may and his parents help them you know with a little bit of a down payment because it was\nNot going to be financed throughout the day or anything like that but he got the financing on it though and he held a job through high school that show that good enough income to cover the payment and it was crazy by far the youngest\nThat is awesome and so when people come to you and they're very young and they say I Want to invest in real estate what did they tell you about the reasons why\nHonestly most young investors are looking to build a\nStable future which I think it's so encouraging right now because I you know our generation is is really good at only wanting to do the things that they've fine fine and so I Love the fact that they actually see you know investing in real estate in ... and ... and the hard work themselves as something that's a fun activity for them so I it's really encouraging for me\nTo if I Want to invest in real estate in by my very first property am I going to need you know a great credit be really solid reserves like money in the bank\nEstate in Bahrain my very first property am I going to ... you know great credit be really solid reserves like money in the bank and to be a really high income or not so much\nWell you know obviously life easier when all of those things are are there but it's certainly not something that should stop you from investing actually you know one of my my biggest investors that I've been working since I first got my licence eleven years now he's built a very impressive the fees got\nHundreds of units across the state of Iowa a little bit you know across the border and Illinois and a breath guy\nHe bought his very first property on contract he ended up buying the property on contract from a landlord that was just tired of having to every model every time a tenant moved out\nYou know you're paying your carpet things like that plan to rent it out and then felt like you know I put all of this hard work into it I think I should probably try to sell it and you know it's sold right away so that's where he got his very first nest egg to start going so he bought his very first investment property on on contract with I think\nIf I remember right it was something like three or four thousand dollars down with the owner financing situation and you just build from there so it's it's crazy what you can do with a little bit of resourcefulness\nThat is awesome and among your clients are a lot of them young\nYou know they are I I Will say that you know I built a pretty diverse client base which I'm very proud of it at this point\nBut a lot of my ... the the one that I was just telling you about that I've been working with for over eleven years you know he had been investing since he was in his\nEarly twenties he's now forty nine and has built something that and I consider forty nine young so especially that took though he's built and you know he started in his early twenties and he hadn't stops and so I Would say good chunk of my investors are definitely what I Would consider young\nSo let's look at the big picture or person comes to you in their twenties and they start investing in real estate tell me how are we going to change their life as the years passed\nI'm sure you've heard this a million times in a million different contacts on the on the show here but the one beautiful thing about real estate is you make or lose money only one yourself so if you can buy into something early if you can start building that portfolio of rental especially and how you're paying your mortgage for you and building equity for you\nIf you can do that at a young age the sky's the limit on what you can do because that first investment that second invested that third invest but it's something that you can continuously snowball and wrong\nIf you can do that at a young age described a limit on what you can do because that first and that's that that that that that that that certain that that is something that you can continue every snowball and run in a down payment option for a bigger and that and you just keep going and it grow exponentially in a way that you would never imagine on paper\nThat is great advice will Christian I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about investing in real estate at a young age thank you\nAbsolutely thanks for having me anytime\nYou are very welcome Chris Scott Clark real tour and investment

information traffic and whether\nNext according to Nielsen Seventy five percent use them to get factual information like trivia or history and sixty eight percent use them to listen to the news but in a tie with news and this is fascinating sixty eight percent also said they use their smart speakers\nFor something completely different they're using them to have fun [laughter] that's right just to

profit professional organization of home inspectors in North America and has more than eight thousand members Tim welcome to real estate today\nThank you glad to be here we're delighted to hear So Tim here we are getting into the fall season what should I Do first if I Want to make sure that my home is in tip top shape\nFirst thing I Would do is check your gutters and down stops because the biggest issue with the homeless and water and in the fall the gutters get clogged up with leaves and other debris and need to make sure that you keep those ... clean subtle water gets removed away from the house and you don't have any moisture intrusion\nYou know that's a really good point okay so the gutters and down about ... where to start now what about the windows and doors what am I looking for their Tim\nWhere you want to make sure your windows and doors are caught concealed properly southern cold there doesn't get into the house [noise] make sure your windows function a lot of times people leave their screens in the windows and we tell people take your screens out storm for the winter because the ice and snow and\nSleet and hard cold weather can really take its toll on screen so we suggest people to take their screens out same thing was screen door's takers screened or screen out and put in your storm door\nSo what about the roof now how can I really know if my roof is in trouble or not what do I need a pair of binoculars\nOr [laughter] you could use that that's true but I Would recommend contracting a qualified roofing contractor and have them come out and inspect your rough they can let you know if there's any damage shingles baking also let you know how long you refer last what the estimated life as but again that's another place that water can get into the home\nThat's absolutely right now a lot of us think about getting the air conditioning system service before summer but he's got another area that you should have inspected prior to the winner\nAbsolutely a lot of HVAC contractors have maintenance contracts where they charge you a nominal fee\nIf you have both of those checked and so what they do if they come out in the fall and they check your furnace and they come back at it in the spring and check your air conditioner so that's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue\nOr to make sure that furnaces functioning properly and efficiently also helps to reduce your heating bills get\nThat's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue but to make sure that friend is is functioning properly at efficiently also helps to reduce your heating bills gas or electric\nInteresting another area in the house that I Know is really important especially in the cold weather months is the insulation but Kim how does a homeowner insect back\nSometimes that's difficult it's by staying in the walls but at the addict people can get up there and they can measure the insulation see how much

think some of the folks at the thunderbirds stadium enjoyed that broadcast to what am I talking about well I inadvertently gain some new audience members at the start in the fourth quarter we had a bit of an\nIssue as the third quarter ended it looked like press can recover the phone call so I went to commercial break before the fourth quarter got started so we came back and no action another minute goes by\nStill no action and I was like six minutes the officiating crew was talking over how to roll in the last play and well what it takes a long time for the officials to figure out what to do I tend to get a little um\nI I mean I'm medical a football game not to describe people talking on and on and on so long that goes on to more ticked off I get until\nStealing a phrase from this geek culture YouTube commentator I watch I was filled with the rage of a billion exploding galaxies chock full of TNT so I'm going there are still\nGreat so let's talk about uh the atmosphere of that game last night like like any hit on a you had the soccer team there you have the softball team there and I guess you also had a bunch of Glendale parents and supporters there and I guess on a scale of loud and is it sounded like\nSay maybe your average arch enemy concert to\nYeah it was super loud I Know that none of us have voices anymore from screaming so much it was such an intense game and even when we were down you know\nOur side like never let up they always were cheering and I think that's what really helped get the team through is could we play a lot of energy and vibes and as long as the sidelines they're helping out who's on the court I think that will come up and talking\nSolely she was there any particular said turning point in that game where you're you're made a play or you got on a runway you felt okay we've got this whole magic we're gonna take it tonight\nIn game five we were down\nIn that game where you're you're made a play or you got on a runway you fell okay we've got this whole magic we're gonna take it tonight\nIn game five we were down like ten fourteen and it was getting that and um the went back to serve\nAnd she was ... and then we play defense against them and we did not let up like where like we're not going to lose this game you can see an attitude on the car they were going to go all out for all the balls and they were going to get that when stuff\nSo any along with that incredible windy out against Glendale that came on the heels of another incredible when you out and this was against one of your the one opponent and that was Arizona western who came into Wednesday nights concerts they were ranked number twenty in the nation\nAnd you're pulled off another upset against them and I think at one point in your down two games to one against you know again it's a very good hours on the western deem so how was it you were able to come back and get the lid over the matter doors\nUm at left everyone pretty much speech us our coaches that are really good job of preparing us for that game so we knew that we were going to have to work hard the whole entire match and um I think that's what it comes down to I I really can't put in where it's how much that when I went to all of us\nSo a layer of obviously for for maybe those who aren't very familiar with the rules and bought and volleyball when you get up to the fifth and deciding game instead of going to twenty five points to first team to Fifteen as long as they're up by wind up with a ... when I saw the final score was I went\nTwenty one Ninety why how did you get a Twenty one Nineteen scored a game\nFive I think that just shows how much neither team wanted to lose you know it came down there was so much so much work going on in that court westerners making Great Plains we're making great place\nI think like when it came down to is that we just wanted it more and we we fight and fight and fight and that's why it went and Twenty one Nineteen because neither one of the teams on and to want it to lose\nSo way see again I I got to ask you this question of what the Glendale game so any particular play any particular run the ... by God on Wednesday night that was the turning point for that match for you guys\nI Can't really think of any turning point I just we were just ready to play especially in that game when we saw the scores and stuff we were not willing to let down stuff we just want to go and play and we end up paying in practice we put ourselves in these scenarios during practices that we were ready for it we were I did go and fight to the very end tell if\nWilling to let down stuff we just want to go and play and we end up paying in practice we put ourselves and they scenarios during practices that we were ready for it we were I did go and fight to the very end until they finally came out\nSo anti you'll go back a few weeks a prior to these two matches or you have a pi they were on\nNot a great streak I think you guys lost two games at a tournament you come back to Arizona you drop to to a couple of your ah\nA conference upon as I think it was ... and ... in eastern Arizona laws do you order for ... losing streak so how were you guys able to turn that around and really start to pick things up as we're coming down to a you know the final few matches of the season\nI think our team really has a lot of personality and um it it really took all of us just like we if it doesn't start with us we're not going to make a change and we need to make that change so we just started becoming ourselves again and started feeding off each other's energy and that's when things started with Mac into shape\nAnd a leg up furnishings yellow pie team I this is almost like an entirely new look a lady writer team I remember going out to to the meet and greet the packing August looking around at all you ladies and going okay I remember her from last year and\nI have no idea on these other girls are so just and and your sophomore yourself but you actually transferred in from from Chandler Gilbert yeah well first of all your what made you decide to make a transfer from a Fiji all the way up here to you have about\nUm you know trying to get rid of the grade school it's a great team I think I just needed to change and I felt that you have a pile of the best that for me and\nSo what was it like so many of you new players on there and just trying to get to know one another and are trying to work together and form a cohesive unit\n[noise] um I think that we all clicked really well really early on you know we all had to work a camp in the summer and that's when we got to me most of the freshmen sophomores and right from the beginning we just clicked and ... pretty soon ... we\nWe go through a lot and preseason together in our bodies her and where where the practice of the day conditioning we we really really work really hard together for so long and\nI think that that just helps us grill like as a team of the unit and we're seeing get together every single day so we really are like a family we really do\nReally do click and we really do love each other I think that that's just what sensors on the court would make such a great team together\nSo Lacey all all three ladies are are\nReally do really do clicking we really do let each other I think that that's just what ...\nOh so Lacey ... all three ladies are or Arizona natives are you yourself ah come from Mesa, Arizona and a year from Glendale uh LA you're from Tucson so lazy before you got the yellow pie did you know any of the other girls on a on the lady riders through either your high school career or club career or anything\nNo not really and they were all exchanges on their face when they first met that can't\nThat we were all able to get along really well they were all super fun not one of us is not there's not one guy on the team and like oh my gosh I Want to stay away from her anything [laughter] I Love all of them and they all it just the giants and then you can totally tell them anything and you know on the court and everything\nSo ah so any uh obviously the first a match you guys had it was a it was a tournament was it in Vegas or is it the Roswell tournament I forget\n... Roswell automatically ...\nYeah so so just to just tell us what was like that that first weekend where you ladies were in actual competition that that meant something and uh yeah what kind of progress you felt the team made throughout those four matches\nWell going and we hadn't actually play the game together we ... we didn't really know what to expect from other colleges\nAnd so when we went into the tournament I had a little bit and as I Know all that other people probably did too but we were able to come out of that tournament for three and one and I think that gave us are really good head start to our season\nOkay those on the show with me today I have Lacey tiny eye at any hard and I have a lay of the I guess from the apple pie college volleyball team they are coming off to really spectacular wins this week against two top twenty opponents in the nation\nSo we'll be talking more about their season looking ahead to a ... the last few matches they have including the paint match coming up October twenty third at Prescott valley event center which is of course to ah support a research into the fight against a breast cancer so we'll be talking a little bit more about that as well but before we go to break\nThis down to see who's shined over the past seven days\nAs we present the tri city sports rounded up three stars of the week\nStarting with the ladies are number three star is Nick ... some of the other by college volleyball team she posted twenty kills and Seventeen gigs and the lady riders three to to try and alter Arizona western Wednesday but number two star is tests are rough is of the Prescott volleyball team she recorded thirty to assess eleven digs in seven\nOlder Arizona western Wednesday but number two star is tests are rough is dubbed the Prescott volleyball team she recorded thirty to assess eleven digs in seven skills and the lady badgers three to to win over Coconino Tuesday and our number one star of the week is ...

Thursday on the Lars Larson show we supply honestly provocative talked for the United states of America\nAnd we're glad to have you join the conversation as well it's eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com how's this for a conspiracy theory we've actually used it as tonight's Twitter poll question we try to make a question out of each and every day's news\nAnd some days is more interesting than others but this one is intriguing should President Trump\nHas talked about Jeff Sessions possible replacement\nWith some obsession subordinates now imagine this you're working at any job and the boss comes down and talk to people who work for you under you\nAnd he's saying who do you think we ought to replace Larson with when we get rid of them that kind of thing the Washington Post the venerable Washington Post and left leaning so they're never going to paint Trump enough favorable light reports President Trump talked recently was Jeff Sessions' own chief of staff\nAbout replacing sections as attorney general according to people who've been briefed on the conversation signaling that the president remains keenly interested\nIn getting rid of his top law enforcement officials the conversation between ... a Trump or President Trump and Matthew Whitaker has seemed somewhat nebulous it was not clear for example whether would occur would take on an interim\nJob as attorney general or be nominated in a more permanent capacity or how definitive the president's intentions were on a long list of indignities that session has endured from his boss Trump's discussing replacing him with his very own top paid kind of stands out on the other hand\nI Want to give you a perspective on this\nBecause I'm not a legal expert enough certainly never served in office like this but Jeff Sessions has deeply disappointed almost every conservative I Know that I've had the opportunity to talk to in fact every time we take the show on the road Washington DC a wind up talking to members of Congress and their staff\nSure but if I Know that I've had the opportunity to talk to in fact every time we take the show on the road Washington DC a wind up talking to members of Congress and their staff\nI asked them what the heck is up with Jeff Sessions\nHe comes into the job and everybody I think almost every conservative thought very well of Senator Sessions he seemed to have a steel backbone you seem to have a real command of all the issues that he took on and it gets into this job and all of a sudden he disappears\nIt's like he's not there anymore because he had to recuse himself and we've talked about whether or not there was actually good legal reason to recuse himself from the Russia investigation which led to the appointment of Robert Mueller which as you know has now turned into a a giant jihad or\nYou know Don Quixote like you know crusade to go across the when the landscape killed at windmills looking for that hidden in Russia\nThat Russian and the Donald Trump's campaign looking for that collusion that you just know is there if we look for it long enough\nThat Dan

M. weekdays it for on the news fourteen Ninety am [noise]\n\nConversation Lars Larson God God love them\nBack to the Lars Larson show blind to be with you in blind to take your phone calls and emails we'll get to that Kanye West\nHave just a little bit later on this hour but ah I've got Frank by play with me who's a a foundation professor at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican Workers Party or the Trump victory\nThink by play with me who's a a foundation professor at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party now the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed this Buckley to welcome to the program things all the time\nWith large thank you for having me\nI'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of the president but frankly I I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we needed\nA survey right I mean way we're bound for stagnation remember when people talked about two percent growth in the new normal now we've got four percent yup they said it could never happen\nAnd we had a yeah I'm Sorry to say we had a Republican Party led by you know really nice people but they just weren't up to the struggle of take it on the ... you\nKnow they weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over enforced everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departure soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he we we are getting rid of him eventual enemy now at the end of the year\nUh but but this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nCat food they write you know and the thing about and I'm Glad you mentioned Paul Ryan I couldn't agree more of a thing as the Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I work on the campaign I wrote speeches for the for the president I buy some ... we were very consciously going after just regular American you know all races creed and all that I mean but we're looking after the people who have been left behind\nAnd I you know I'm I'm afraid that the kind of internationalist wing of the Republican Party have fallen favor of you know free trade agreements and all of that they had lost touch with them and and then the end\nYou know we succeeded I'll tell you one thing about the book I debate left wing earth and and they say workers kind of we own that for what I say you know you're here to there you can be a Democratic Party\nThat looked after ordinary faithful and that was not on both parties but you've given that up and you know what your lunch\nAnd in fact doesn't it seem and I I look I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the fight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man and working woman I keep wondering uh policies they adopt\nUnbiased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man and working woman\nI keep wondering uh policies they adopt\nSeemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of folks who are just making a an average family income of I think now the ... sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well\nAnd and so there there it's the antithesis of representing that individual worker who's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nBy the way that's up from about fifty six thousand about five years back I mean we're we're doing pretty good I mean are wages are growing up but you know the the thing about the the dams as they invested in identity politics which had nothing to do with the concerns of of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and a boy talk about a way to bankrupt the country I mean that you know they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans than uh you know who who are misled into voting for these guys\nYou don't miss dramatically you just said something that made me think from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and\nBut sometimes are used terminology that that seems a little opaque to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms in one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that for my audience the way you see it\nIt's hard to hear from them um you know you start by saying what's their race what their gender and so on\nAnd uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong way through the wrong ... does to your your your there they're not they're really interested in you but mostly you know it means that they're obsessed with\nYou know critical concerns like transgender bathrooms bicycle lanes I mean concerns that played because of the elite of the country\nI mean it's only people are really rich are going to worry about that stuff okay it's it's not the coal mine are looking for a job a right to know about the oil worker who she was worried about what about you know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've\nInvested in frivolous Lutherans are the people who got you know made it and made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank\nAnd invested in frivolous concerns of the people who got you know made it\nAnd made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed\nBut I think you've spoken to some of these really important because\nWhen you become an a lead in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with our people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I make the house payment this month of the car payment or\nCan we really afford to take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class\nAnd so like you say your your concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to build in or out and pretend that you care about that coal miner who's being booed Hillary Clinton famously promise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job for a new running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county in Kentucky Harlan County that sacred ground to the left this is where the the series justified as sad and it's where\nThere was this big old union battle back in the Nineteen thirties and you know Pete Seeger had the song which side are you on and I I I thought this is great you know I Know which side the elite is on I thought the coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump\nSo you know but you know talking about the elite I Love you know I Confess I'm living inside the beltway\nI'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire to be a traitor to my class 'cause I got these relatives\nWho are working on the assembly line than Detroit\nAnd I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall Street Journal recently uh was telephone justice what how does that figure into the whole equation the oil and\nYou know I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works in Russia is see for a judge reaches a verdict telephone up the you know the party boss and they all communist days you'd say what should I Do right so the telephone you know using the telephone to determine what what's going to be the result\nAnd I said you know in America we've got a somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law and Russia and we got too much but here we got we got to search going on for the great Trump defendants and and you know mostly is as just\nFor all the live tutor the law and Russia we got too much but here we got we got to search going on for the great Trump defendants and and you know mostly is is just kind of ordinary strollers like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of the life of the FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause\nI don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talk to the right to\nTell the Russian ambassador is going to be recorded by five different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI does it say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have every jot and ... from your conversation and they may be trying to maneuver into a into a process crime\nOr you know we're we're ... the people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement of the FBI confident talks in most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask land and and you know sadly wherever we are in a country is that is the wrong thing to do\nMaybe we should I mean I hate to say it Frank is I've had friends who were FBI agents Secret Service agents cops sheriff's deputies\nYou hate to started acting like when the police show up or the FBI shows up you say I should treat them like a treat the G are you if I was a a an an occupant of of Russia or the old Soviet Union his book is called the Republican workers' party and he hails from George Mason university professor it's good to have you on the program we'll look forward to return\nThanks so much larger than eight times\nGlad to have you on coming up in a moment flaws students in New York are now skipping class to protest Brett Kavanaugh should they be reprimanded for skipping class to protest cabin off our new as Supreme Court justice will get to that and your phone calls and emails and will play a little Kanye West from the oval office [noise]\nSo their job was to simply a from that and put them on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way and I mentioned this\nLittle uh it was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump\nCourt which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way and I mentioned this\nLittle uh it was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump sitting behind the resolute desk in the oval office today and Kanye West sitting across the desk from him\nAnd Donald Trump listing for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes now I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is near west and I know the standard line from the left is what this man is crazy\nNow why did they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy well I'm find to be put I'm I'm okay with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit\nOf\nA I Would say welfare of the reason why people and I say you know first of all let a lot of jobs the jobs and they say we're getting more money for has more\nThen we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute and AIDS and and I tend to just shy and\nWas actually going down right now he\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problem I saw the secret\nSo uh I think it's the way\nCare for\nGives you power in a way he's talking about the hat that does keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great Donald Trump's campaign slogan and he's saying this how gives you power and why\nYou know my dad and my mom separated so I have a lot of mail and she came out and all of a marriage or are\nThey doing that\nHere's where everyone was like hey I was hired by the\nIt was it made me feel like super super fair there are now\nThat's Kanye West saying that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero [noise] I Know that a lot of the left who said this man is crazy and yet in all of what he just said\nDo you do you find anything to object to\nHe says he grew up without a male figure in his life and that that damaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively said two young women\nHave more kids and we'll send you more money and that that's damaging as well and none of that ... that is all Republican orthodoxy it's it's conservative orthodoxy to say the programs that are supposed to help people often end up damaging them\nAnd you know for me like I said you know what\nAt that point I didn't believe that one out but I made sure it didn't hit the air if you're listening on stream yes he did use a couple of swear words and that was one I miss but I I dropped out one out because he was sitting in the oval office ... was managed to drop a couple of swear words\nBut his message was all conservative and\nThis is what's driving the left nuts they can't stand the idea that a man who was both black\nAmerican and successful is sitting there in front of the president of the United states saying I admire what you've done I support what you've done I'm warranted us had it turns me into Superman and wanting the world is wrong with that glad to have you with me at eight\nSix six four three nine five to seven seven and we're talking about intellectual property rights again see smartly who's going to join me next and you're listening to Lars Larson show [noise]\n\nHere's the story of ...\n...\nHere's the story of Laura pool resorts to play a little bit of the game will come\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nWas never that good a long time ago but he also\nLearned how to get to see them a lot of money on car insurance so he switched and say this your story has a big after all\n[noise] here's the cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is the second by and it's hard water contains harsh mineral that can dry out and then here hard water can raise our electricity bill signed up to\nForty eight percent ... types that can lead to pathogenic bacteria grand stressed out yet no meat cell based water ... can solve all your hard water is you get the\nFull scoop at a little salt out or\nNot she's from the Mr ...
