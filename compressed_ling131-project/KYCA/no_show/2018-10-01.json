about because of a speech from Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety two when he was a senator and he insisted that an incoming president should be the one to pick his Supreme Court nominee and after that they made the Joe Biden\nWas and the and the election year that they were talking about was during the presidential election not per\nSe I just heard them say you can't vote on judicial nominees daring any

the street to the cops finally shapes picked up by a couple of gals who take care of the police station makes an accusation comes to really listen um and then she goes back and it makes the accusation again\nUm she ends up actually back with him\nUm and he forgives or for this because well no harm no foul I guess and then ultimately they ended up breaking up in the in the future\nAnd uh so I'm going to presume since she didn't follow through and\nUm he says that it was false that was there for a false rambling of somebody who is incredibly intoxicated\nI'm I've also seen another instance where this uh this happened to to somebody\nAnd so I'm Wondering how many accusations don't actually in this case in the ... and the ... the letter case the student yeah the letter case it wasn't

Ninety nine percent of the time we'll be hearing us MCA\nHas a good ring to it I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that with Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nAt last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs she was about twenty five percent of birth order jobs even more than that [noise] throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise but for twenty five years as a civilian as a businessman I used to say how could anybody have signed that deal like NAFTA and I watched New England and so many other places where I was uh just the factories were leaving the jobs while leaving people were being fired\nUh we can't have that [noise] so we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and trade because we'd been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that\nWould just signed a much better deal with\nSouth Korea we had a horrible horrible deal and we just signed up at the United nations and that's worked out well and they're happy we're happy it's good for jobs good for a lot of things when that deal with side they said two hundred and fifty thousand jobs\nWill be given be by signing this transaction then they were right I've said it before they were right two hundred and fifty thousand jobs to South Korea not to the United states [noise] so that's changed and very much for the better and this one is a brand new deal\nThe agreement will govern nearly one point ... trillion in trade which makes it the biggest trade deal in the United states history\nI Want to congratulate us trade representative Robert Lighthizer always worked nobody understands how hard [noise] [noise] [noise]

to thank president of Mexico we had a few disagreements but I really like um a lot\nI think he made like me I'm not sure but I think he's a terrific person then he'll be leaving a soon but he's really done a good job and\nWonderful wonderful person\nAnd the Mexican president elect Lopez Obrador who has given his support to this agreement and\nWe're developing a really good relationship which I think is very important for our country frankly an from Mexico\nAnd uh so they work together on there's this was done by both I said look I don't want to sign an agreement and then a new president comes and they don't like it and we have difficulty ah they work very much together on it\nAnd I appreciate it from both\nI have to certainly\nGive my highest regards to prime minister of Canada adjusting to do\nA lot of stories came out about adjusted and I\nAre having difficulty together and we did over the trade deal\nI'll tell you it's turned out to be a very very good deal for both and a very very good deal for all three it puts us in a position that we've never been in before\nIt's very good and when you look at the world and what the world is doing and what when you look at the unfair trade practices that countries are using against the United states\nUh this is a terrific deal for all of us\nBy Congress this new deal will be the most modern\nUp to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our accounts\nIs a terrific deal for all of us\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern\nUp to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country would the most advanced protections for workers ever\nDeveloped if you look at the reviews people that would normally not under\nAny circumstances say good things because automatically they have to say bad even some Democrats say that's amazing we had some they they haven't been given the soundbite she had I guess Mike but actually had some Democrats say this is really amazing if he really\nGot all of that but by tomorrow I Would suspect they'll change their tune\nBut that's okay because people know how good it is it's an amazing deals for a lot of people like why is it will be the most advanced trade deal\nIn the world with ambitious provisions on the digital economy\nIt's very important financial services in other areas where the United states has a strong competitive advantage Mexico and Canada have agreed to strong new labor protections environmental protections and new protections for intellectual\nSo important this new deal is an especially great victory for our farmers are farmers have gone through a lot over the last Fifteen Years they've been taken advantage of by everybody prices have gone way down\nAnd we're working on some other deals that are gonna make I'm very happy also but this is a very very big deal for our farmers are\nIn Mexico and Canada\nA lot more than they are now and I think there'll be a better spirit between the three countries which is important for farmers the agreement will give our farmers and ranchers far greater access to cell American Grown produce in Mexico\nAnd in Canada the deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to export American wheat poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few\nI Want to be very specific\nI Want to be various [noise]\nMany other products but those products or we're not really being treated fairly as far as those that work so hard to produce them\nAnd now they're going to be treated fairly [noise] these\nDoes it work so hard to produce them\nAnd now they're going to be treated fairly [noise] these measures will support many hundreds of thousands of American Jobs [noise] this is also a historic win for American manufacturers and American auto workers who have been treated so badly we've lost so many jobs over the years under NAFTA\nUnder the current new deal\nAnd if you look at the current NAFTA deal\nThe new deal is\nTaking care of all of these problems 'cause NAFTA foreign companies have been allowed to manufacture many of their parts overseas shipped them to Mexico and Canada for assembly and send their foreign made cars into the United states when no tax so we let people go we fire everybody\nThey make cars they make products they make everything\nIn another country they send them into the United states no tax\nAnd the cost is very little difference sometimes it's more\nFor those people that like to talk about cost where this agreement we are closing all of these terrible loopholes that flows that gun there were a disaster for example we're requiring a large portion of every car to be made by high wage workers which will greatly reduced foreign outsourcing\nWhich was a tremendous problem and means more auto parts and automobiles will be manufactures inside the United states we will be manufacturing many more cars and our companies won't be leaving\nThe United states

of my career was in Spokane, Washington where I was to solid waste manager and we have a very large waste to energy facility up their\nCurrent that facility worked really well in Spokane valley because we were on a sole source aquifer and we could not put in place in other in a landfill and so after much public process\nUh they installed waste to energy facility that we'll loss enough homes

you um either self ... to the facility or the city trucks came in with the solid waste it works well it's a good answer for that community\nI Would assume here Mali that the infrastructure the initial cost is probably where the you know the pretty big hill to climb to get this you know started\nAbsolutely hundreds of millions yeah\nYeah [noise] Kurt um were ah we appreciate that a question and uh
