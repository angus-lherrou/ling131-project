information officer for you have a pike county and David good morning\nGood morning Jason how are you doing today and good thanks great well this is our bi weekly a little meeting that we have because we have a a supervisors being later today at nine o'clock and or this one's going to be here in Prescott is that right\nThat's right okay board meeting at ten Fifteen fair street so\nGreat okay so I'm looking at the agenda for today's meeting there's always quite a bit going on but there seems to be a lot of the more mundane things going on this time around but a few things caught our eye and let's turn to the consent agenda first\nAnd uh item for from the board and this is a professional services agreement between a simple the central you have a pi metropolitan planning organization and a eight UCON technical services for the twenty forty five regional transportation plan a two hundred and sixty thousand dollars to tell us about the ...\nYeah and I actually had to come from it we are talking about the year twenty forty five so this is a so far out plans and we're talking probably twenty five years or so from now but I Know they they like to make plans and simple does a really good job of coordinating with the localities ... all the different towns and cities\nAs well as a dog to kind of coordinate efforts for road maintenance and development and unfortunately right now with budgets being as they are um all they're doing is maintaining they're really not planting any new roads but this is just kind of again looking out to the future because these things take a long time to plan and do right\nAnd so this is just the board kind of signing off on this agreement 'em and things may change between now and twenty forty five but at least they know going forward that they have an agreement and they've got a budget and making kind of move forward\nOkay so as you said just maintenance right now there's nothing big plan but that could change with the population growing the way it has been especially lately in ... in the Prescott area hasn't it\nRight now there's nothing big planned but that could change with the population a growing the way it has been especially lately in ... in the Prescott area hasn't it\nAbsolutely yeah if you know we get more homes and more developments roads are going to become a necessity I'm quite often the developer we'll put them in in themselves as long as they're built to certain standards the cities or towns with the county\nCan sort of adopt those roads if you will um but a lot of the new roads to a dot has talked about ... kind of put on hold because of budget but again that could change over the years as developments come in and budgets changing the economy grows there'll be funds for that but right now are they're really just focusing on maintaining the current roads that we have\nBouquet and that is a long job looking at a twenty forty five yeah OK well moving on on the consent agenda item number fourteen under the school superintendent\nUh this is part of the consolidation and substitute teachers between several districts and yellow pike county and I believe this is something that a superintendent Tim Carter has been working on for some time and it just seems to be going well so far is that right\nIt is and there has been quite a bit of good a movement on this this is kind of one of those economies of scale situation where each school district can't hire their own substitute teachers or you can kind of consolidate all those services into one\nHow one organization to worry about payroll and insurance and all that stuff when you do that a large scale you tend to save money and it just makes it a lot easier for the smaller\nSchool districts and we're talking about hillside Kirkland camp Verde and ... school districts\nUm they don't have a lot of fun to waste anyways now by consolidating they can sort of become a larger group and get their substitutes that that they made filled quicker and easier and it'll cost everybody laugh and that's just a an overall good program for the community\nOkay well right now David we're going to pause briefly on the morning report for an important message and when we come back well it's actually a little bit more about today's meeting and what's coming up for the board of supervisors but right now let's pause we'll be right back\nHello this is ... ... the

going to start a I Believe about nine o'clock here in Prescott is that right that's right okay so David item twenty on the can set agenda\nIs under the sheriff's department and this is concerning\nUh a funding from the governor's office on highway safety for the twenty Nineteen DUI enforcement and equipment grant and we're talking about thirty two thousand dollars so what does this entail\n[noise] really what whenever department or or a department within that county goes out and get a grant and there are great given that grant they take that to the board just to get the boards approval on receiving those funds makes sure that the board knows what's going on and approves of all of this but really this thirty two thousand dollars is going to pay\nA for a lot of the sheriff's officers who will work over the holidays during those big events where unfortunately we have a lot of a lot of uh drinking and driving that that there's a lot in the county but that seems to be when it happens\nAnd this will provide the sheriff with the funds necessary to put men out there on the street doing these DUI enforcement efforts just to keep everybody safe\nOK so very good that helps from the county the from the state that the county can\nDo all of this and keep the rogue states really alright\nSo also we want to look ahead because typically the board of supervisors holds two meetings

that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon's abolishing\nHappening at the border who who are worried or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon's abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight the Democratic\nParty um doctrine I'm and I'm In the end who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty margin of people who believe that you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically to favor the rights of the illegal aliens\nThan they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump is put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um and and um it changed moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the cabinet off a stop these numbers probably are even more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house are already many of them pledge and we now have their chairman I'm up there\nTo be chairman and if they win this year in committee I'm sharing Adler saying what we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we've got all these investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy and I'm a sense that um this is\nGoing to be ... chaotic and that it is\nGoing to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular president whatever they say we know that their agenda\nSome had had a couple of years to just to recap so many issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\n... yes but it will move is the number of Democrats and many independents civil moving the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment mob\nI'm a party um uh [noise] and you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least much more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting to out of the ...\nAre booming for most people are at least much more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are all things out of the middle\nOne democratic socialism covered all with the idea of chaos you know whether and banging on windows they are going to disrupt the country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nYeah so the law and order and I'm not as let's say hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order calm the respect\nUm respect yeah souls you're really good terms and then the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections or what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing all it is imperative it seems to me that those were and what I call that prior to the\nUm the Democrats have health care and you're not going to take that away from its to light 'em but um except for the fact of the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nA socially the Democratic socialism on that bothers people and then she ... does\nOkay it is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the whole you know he's the he's the ... the statistical a journal and you know he he practiced statistical journalism um\nAnd he you know he didn't get the production right and twenty sixteen uh but this time he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive assumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's ... it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable\nFact so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no it isn't it's not an avid about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hang 'em I leave it there must be very hard to predict the business environment\nRepublicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging um I I agree with them and it's very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection that there are many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is one elected trumping sixteen a fear of returning\nThe country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress that that has been made and they they have that anti Washington anti elitism still exist very great with\nThe issue has been from the Republicans to nationalize the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network to advertise you've got to be inside of shows rather than crammed into all the local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize the cousin Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who are in the party that the the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade between the the\n... when you put the big issues in front of people have consequences then something happens and I think the Republicans doing and all the candidates are doing a better job but frankly the patch and all those they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do 'em to mash them further national\nFor life and now we have not and not just stay local X amount\nIs in a national election and people need to understand the choices\nBecause there are concerns are very great and again the Kavanaugh hearings the beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this incivility arguments\nRetribution that had some numbers yesterday that showed overwhelming rejection of the Hillary Clinton proposition or even split among Democrats\nOr whether or not you know this notion that you can't be simple to you when I'm there is and the things at the end they believe by the way by a large a plurality that if the Democrats\nCan't be civil so when I'm there is and the things at the end they bullied by the way by large ... that if the Democrats win civility we'll get war things will become worse than they are now\nI Want to play a Nancy Pelosi for you or this is below sea on discussing Trump's desire for a long especially given what we're seeing these new migrants let's listen\nTo the model [laughter]\n\nWarmer issue\nUh manhood issue and and that ties into what an ... to be the last question they still say it's a year the woman you have a lot of these interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans\nAnd some of them doing really well so they are the woman you're the one it could also be the year of the man\nOf because well our thing with a man and masculinity being attacked and its Kavanaugh at all\nYeah so I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap but it goes both ways and the men are and again I come back to it's not just running up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remembered with Trump carried\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy with the way things these the the prospects are going and it is and heritage really that those voters as well as the base\nBe exposed to the larger consequences of what happens if you allow the Democrats to take over and what will happen to\nThe country I think as a symbol of Seattle simple formulation simple formulation mobs versus jobs resistance versus results\nForward or backward\nWe're going forward we're going up not down they want to kick they want to kick you and your down they want to kick you and you hit hard okay we're going up we're not gonna learn out looking back on up\nAnd resistance versus results I like mobs

Arthur\nUm what is broken pottery diplomacy and why should we be concerned about\nWell this is why diplomats who were supposed to act like diplomat\nA start acting like a local frog and they pick fights and they uh insult people as they are falsify incident and we've seen this in Sweden we've seen a number of other countries\nWhere the diplomat for the CIA circled diplomats really or the people around and the purpose seems to be to make people mad at the same time allowing the Chinese to blow off steam because they're so frustrated if things aren't going their way\nYou know this is really extraordinary here you have a country that many people think will be the dominant power in this era and you have its diplomats I'm acting like three year olds I mean three year olds with nuclear weapons but nonetheless three year olds\nI'm ... and this is very worrying when when you think about the anger and the insecurity and the aggressiveness of Chinese diplomats around the world and it's not just the diplomats is also the other representatives of Beijing so for instance journalist\nSo we got to be concerned that we're not dealing with a normal state we are dealing with a

One oh three point five FM K why CIA [noise] go\n\nI'm John Bass with Gordon Chang the Daily Beast North Korea\nWe welcome our colleague\nGregory Scott ... the executive director of the committee for human rights in North Korea or riding most recently in the wall Street Journal\nAbout the diplomacy the dance between the president of South Korea Moon Jae in\nAnd the undistinguished dictator the failed state of North Korea moon ah and the question here I Greg ... asks in his op ed and I'll ask him to help us understand it can you imagine Greg what it looks like for president moon\nTo move from a man who is obese and an ... to a an undistinguished dictator\nWho is learning over human\nHuman Savage ... can you imagine that same moon dealing with the facts in North Korea in the imaginary future of reuniting the peninsula good evening to\nGood evening to you John and Gordon a that would be a very serious stress of the imagination president Moon Jae in of South Korea has had three short on my meetings with Kim Jong un the sheer human rights was not raised once ... once\nI'm moreover we all remember that um while president one gene was chief of staff to the late ... than normal showing a he was the one who consulted with the north Koreans and advised that South Korea should abstain on a\nU.N General assembly resolution on North Korean human rights condemning North Korea as a human rights record so up presumably this\nGeneral assembly resolution on North Korean human rights condemning North Korea's human rights record so up presumably this is done in order to appease the north Korea and honesty in order to press ahead with this so called national re constantly ... process\nBut the question that I Would ... would like to ask is um at at what point does\nAppeasement at what point does neglecting North Korea's crimes against humanity turn into endorsement of the angry just human rights violations\nBeing perpetrated in North Korea pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the state\nSo great we could put that question perhaps in a different way you know people point out as you've just mentioned that Moon Jae in a was a human rights lawyer and that's how he came to prominence um many people say well you know it's a course ironic now that he's not raising the issue of human rights\nSo maybe the question is\nWas he never a human rights lawyer all along that he was just using that to um basically gain power in the south\nTo pose a people who he um didn't like the military leaders and actually that he was very much in favor of North Korea and the first place that he was like ... the senior advisors now\nI'm very much sympathizers for North Korea we don't know the answer the question we don't know what's moons head but the point is he may not be naive he may be complicit all along in North Korea's human rights violations\nA he has certainly I'm invested tremendously in this process of engaging the north Koreans the south Korean economy's not doing too well\nThe unemployment rate among young uh college graduates is high and still on the ice remember that the important part of president Moon Jae in support base so he's basically laying 'em most of his bed so all of his bets on this inter Korean rapper Sean process\nWell was he a human rights lawyer yes and he was famous for having defended some I'm a democracy activists who are basically working against the military dictatorship up until the late Nineteen eighties ah of course she does a a lawyer on\nActivists were basically working against the military dictatorship up until the late Nineteen eighties ah of course she has a a lawyer on several Robin tore us cases that involved um Marxist and Marxist material of course\nAt the time um that type of materials band\nSo are actually being a human rights lawyer in South Korea does not necessarily imply that ah that that one would be equally active on North Korea Kim writes but then again\nBeing a human rights lawyer by formation a president Moon Jae in does understand the gravity of crimes\nAgainst humanity and ... go ahead please you\nIn on that point let's talk about Amanda's letter I'm Amanda ... as a human rights lawyer she wrote a letter in the ... the south Korean newspaper um tell our audience what amended asked of Moon Jae Amanda ... oh go ahead Gregory\nMind more widow as my colleague shes our human rights attorney or a charge a human rights attorney currently base things so [noise] ah there was a terrific letter she published in the ... the very basic question that she asks from a human rights lawyer\nTo another human rights lawyer she tells him look I have witnessed\nUm I have a atrocities myself elsewhere in the world we both understand uh basically when are you going to take these violations seriously Mr President when at what point are we going to see your administration getting serious\nAbout the the the the human rights violations being perpetrated in the north\nIt's a good question so let me come back to moon does he have a plan to your knowledge to transition from this ah generosity that he's demonstrating towards a man who has no capability as a as a as a transparent leader of people\nThat is a ... to ... ... is there any significant body of literature that says that moon is going to move to another phase when ... when North Korea's engaged\n[noise] ah well of course this is the argument that engages will make that engagement will bring about exposure to the outside world and implicitly\nAh well of course this is the argument that engages will make that engagement will bring about exposure to the outside world and implicitly\nI'm a chest we improve the human rights record of North Korea but on the other hand if South Korea focuses on infrastructure projects tourism projects\nEnergy projects pipelines do not talk to people Powell law is to not talk to people tourism projects can be tightly contained with few if any social side effects so these are not necessarily projects that help\nThe people of North Korea so far I have not seen any sign\nThat the moon Jae in administration actually has a North Korea human rights policy I haven't seen any encouraging well eight eight when encouraging statement and I would be very very very cautiously optimistic that statement by that\nSouth Korea and permanent representative to the United nations who said something along the lines that South Korea is an active participant in the ... thing of the U.N General assembly a resolution on North Korean human rights now in ...\nWill have to leave it there Gregory Scott ... of the committee for human rights Gordon in North Korea Gordon Chang on John ... [noise]\n\nTo Sean Hannity show\nThe Justice Department is now pro being told me his memos over classified materials just so the horse those are the memos that he leads to is Columbia professor friends for the purpose of launching is a special counsel with those other buddy Robert Mueller I mean in other words it could have been predicated just on a\nOn a criminal act itself which is unbelievable when you when you look at this on the surface Sean Hannity\nThey want and are asking the attorney general and the department of justice of the United states launched a full blown investigation into the possible crimes that were committed by the former disgraced FBI Director Andrew McCabe Loretta Lynch Peter Struck Lisa Page Hillary Clinton they're all being referred to today\nThe argument is that the supply chain in electronics specifically electronics is deeply in China deeply engaged in China because China was there it's it's a miracle happened ... with the explosion of\nCommercial and retail electronics for consumers and therefore\nIt is not credible at this point at this point they're cagey about this at this point to replace John however there is migration underway to Vietnam\nAnd Indonesia those are the two countries the economists mentioned\nAnd that going forward as the supply chain altered you know devices are getting smaller we're getting rid of chords we're getting more mobile devices and let them the desktop so they are the tablets and other electronics bigger ... the big box servers become little Biddy box servers\nIt is possible that China can be augmented with other countries but not yet\nYou know John that's not an unreasonable view but the point I think the economists tends to gloss over\nIs that you know first of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing and China but you know the more important story is that the jumping the Chinese ruler is making life miserable for foreign companies in China and I think what he's doing for various geopolitical in city has\nIs making China an unreliable member of the global supply chain\nSo companies for that reason alone are going to lessen their um exposure to China's geopolitical risks\nAnd therefore as they can move their supply chain um vulnerabilities and get out of\nChina Allen you are Mr supply chain what say you\nWill gored I hate to say it but Gordon's got it right I Would\nGo oh my lord realm I learnt let me fall off my chair for a moment and your leadership Fallon that got it to this\n[laughter] thank you so much um let me just make two quick points first of all what what free trade extremist of publications like the economist ignore constantly is the fact that national governments much smaller and less powerful then the the the U.S government jerk around\nMultinational supply chains all the time in countries like Malaysia and Singapore and Thailand are constantly imposing conditions on in\nMultinational supply chains all the time in countries like Malaysia and Singapore and Thailand are constantly imposing conditions on inbound foreign investment that for all of this talk the multinationals rule the world the company's\nAlways wind wind up complying with so if Malaysia can do this certainly the United states can and secondly there's a great deal of that reshoring ... or I should say of\nA of shifting production outside China that's either already taking place or that's being contemplated because these companies know that we're only at the very beginning of Trump's China trade policies and they want to be prepared and pass\nThey are not panicking and all they have have repeatedly said that you know weight of course rather not do this won't be the easiest thing in the world but we think that within several years we can shift a lot of electronics in information\nTechnology hardware production outside China to other low wage countries I oh by the way that that includes Mexico because\nOf that would really help this country is southern neighbor which which desperately needs it and would ban would by extension help the United states tremendously and I think that that that is far from implausible\nForum Gordon apple and apple most\nApple can move but it's going to be extremely painful because apple hasn't stuff manufactured by Foxconn Foxconn of course is deeply embedded in China but we got to remember John and Allen that socks on once was in Taiwan\nRight move to China yeah the economist reminds all of it that many of the factories were talking about in China are owned by the Taiwanese or Taiwanese investors have created them in addition that means that whatever we regard as the difficulties of portability has happened already\nAnd it's gonna it's gonna they can move again and also the other thing when you talk about automation and robots\nThat makes it a lot easier to move because that limit does not eliminate but it's certainly reducing substantially China's labor cost advantage because a robot in the U.S as we've discussed on this show before is just about the same cost is a robot in China\nAnd in fact the economists did make one good point and that is that that as electronics products become more sophisticated or for the reasons that that Gordon mentioned because of their production is so highly automated there is no more China costs\nThat's become more sophisticated of for the reasons that that Gordon mentioned because of their production is so highly automated there is no more China cost advantages and Foxconn and factors in the process of making a very considerable investment in advance electronics production in Wisconsin\nSo we could very well have the\nThe result that China still winds up making the vast majority of the world's welcome and perhaps but the more advanced office increasingly made\nOh I live in that system fear use of walkman I was thinking about you know the everything you need to know about pac man is in China okay go one more detail sure one more detail of concern here that I've had for some time there's a new phone from Wall way and I've seen it advertised in the United states what the heck is going on how and\nWhy are we allowing that to happen in the United states\nWell thanks in large part to the massive transfer of advanced technology by us telecommunications companies to China hallway has become a global leader in the latest generation of that telecommunications technology which was called five gee\nUm and and certainly ... wants to be a big player in this she was\n... when you when you we don't allow packs of cigarettes for thirty cents on the street in Manhattan I Would go why don't we allowing a wall way phone in our borders for that point\nWell you're absolutely right and it's weird also because the U.S government and the intelligence community has already label called way as a threat to us\nJordan news to people I mean I saw the phone being advertised the latest from Wall way it's that there is no privacy worthwhile way it can last\nLong ... yeah I don't think it'll last look I mean not only does one way but also the ... the Chinese\nAnd why the People's Liberation army yeah the state within a state our state security spy\nSure I mean they do make these handsets they are sold in the U.S they have been but I don't think we're very much longer because of the reasons that huge on a new Elena mentioned this is just politically unsustainable and certainly under cuts and undermines our security it won't last long\nWe have great fun with

maritime strategy at the Naval War college he blogs at the naval diplomat\nUsed a surface warfare veteran in the United States Navy ... a very good eating whew what in Vietnam for the secretary of defense and the U.S navy good evening\nGentlemen thanks for having me on as always ah well I guess I I guess in in general terms I guess two things are at stake in Vietnam first of all there is this the need for a for a partners in Southeast Asia or if you're going to do things to uphold the freedom of the seat in the Southeast Asia we need we need help\nWhich goes to address that directly to the second broad point which would be just location I mean we we hear from real estate people all the time it it's all about location well Vietnam has location the United states\nIn effect has no strategic position in Southeast Asia unless it has a allies who are willing to to provide us access to their bases so that we can do things like roads freedom of navigation operations and so forth [noise]\nUh we used to we were used to having a very good relations with the Philippines than the president ... was brought into office a couple of years ago has proved to be a very mercurial pull up ally of the United states\nSo it's we're we do we just don't so we just don't see him as somebody we can lead on entirely therefore to diversify our portfolio it only makes sense to reach out to the former photo of in Vietnam\nAnd Jim that former foe in Vietnam is also got strengthening relations with Japan and also with India it seems to be a a critical country in the defense plans of other countries are and it seems\nAlmost to making in South central in terms of the coalition to um protect the region from the Chinese\n[noise] yeah but I don't care where there's a running debate we have with our students in Newport about what they're small states have strategies I mean we think about strategy is being something for big power says it ourselves such as Russia such as China Germany or whoever the case may be\nA and I think it is unquestionably a fact that a small state like Vietnam or the Philippines have strategies and in fact I Would say there's even a greater is a premium on having a good strategy if you can't afford to for resources that things like the United states does enough a wealthy nations like increasingly China does uh\nIt only makes sense for for Vietnam to make common cause with strong outsiders in order to counterbalance China so the United states are obviously would like to be known as the balance or a first resort in this case a that would help

far side of the moon what is your best information about the long march five have they solve their problems or do we hold our breath and see if it works good evening to you Brenda\nWell good evening John and thank you again for having me on and hello Gordon and to answer your question\nI'm back home in Florida we have a saying even a blind pay confided ... once in a while um the Chinese yes it's true they're having some technical difficulties but to be fair we here in the United states in the sixties and seventies had our share of technical difficulties\nWith our space program if you give them enough time though they will adapt and the Chinese are heavily invested\nAnd they're heavily committed to achieving a what we know in the national security policy arena as space dominance\nAnd uh they are they are effort that so whether or not the next launch\nAnd the next few months we'll work uh I think it probably will but even if it doesn't they're going to keep trying until they get one right and we hear in the United states unfortunately are not competing the way we shouldn't be the way we did against the Soviets in space\nAnd so they basically in China have a lot of time to perfect\nA the technology they're trying to ah create and and you\nWant to translate quickly there's the moon raised on and there's only one contested is that is\nThat's that is one hundred percent correct yes Gordon\nRuined another to just choose the topic a little bit because I heard you speak yesterday and I was absolutely flabbergasted it's something that you said\nWhich I think is critically important which I think every American needs to hear and that is um we all know that Google has declined to participate in a Pentagon contract to develop the cloud some ten billion dollars\nA lot of people in Google or upset that this does not fit in with the Google philosophy of don't be evil\nBut I heard you say and and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is about to participate in a technology contract engine\nAnd and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is bound to participate in a technology contract in China were stuck to the partner on the other side of the People's Liberation army if you could just run through back because we're a lot more details on that but I think everyone needs to hear this\nYeah so basically a quantum computing is it's the next revolution I'm that's that is the thing it is an ex industrial revolution whoever can figure out quantum computing first\nIt's basically like having the cotton gin you know other laughing duster revolution it it will completely change the way the world works uh the Chinese presently have what's known as quantum Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it\nIt's a physics has shown that to put up a particle can exist in the same place and exist in two different places at the same time and the Chinese have figured out a way to manipulate that particle to transfer encrypting data between the two particles\nAre and it's worked they've been ... says twenty sixteen\nFrom that technology that initial investment they spun off technologies like quantum radar which can be a it's believed can see through the at thirty five that multi trillion dollar\nA program of ours to build the great stealth fighter they can see through it and they're married that to the S. four hundred Russian built defense system\nAs well they are now investing heavily in an actual quantum computing center and on and we and they have reached out to Google and about a year ago and Google has expressed interest in not only sending over talent\nTo this massive new center there building which would be probably operational around twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nBut Google also wants to infuse cash this is under the umbrella of a state owned enterprises in China which happens to be basically reporting to the People's Liberation army the Chinese have actually not been very secretive about the fact that the quantum computing center that they're building that Google could potentially be helping with\nA is actually not only for civilian purposes but also for military ads in the same way that Google and Apple's investment into a I research artificial intelligence research in China is also going to be used for Chinese military purposes\nMe set the formula here if I understand this correctly Google as evidenced interest in participating in the ... yeah\nChinese military purposes let me set the formula here if I understand this correctly Google as evidenced interest and participate in the pie LA's an advanced\nAdvanced work on a lie and quantum ... corner and quantum computing at the same time Google's employees have raised a Raul when Google was looking to compete with Amazon and now with Microsoft\nFor the super secret cloud contract ten billion dollars a year at the Pentagon I lay out this task very clearly Gordon\nThis looks like Google is siding with the non transparent dictatorship and just standing there transparent military that protects Google's copyright\nYeah I mean that's the only interpretation I couldn't think of John and this is something that I think the first of all the president needs to think about and we need to start thinking about whether I'm\nYou know in a company which is headquarters in the United states which does business in in our country is permitted to help the Chinese develop their military which is considering to kill Americans\nAnd brand and have you seen Google addressed this paradox in any fashion\nWell no and if anything there's you know they they're they're continuing to seek to do business in China I Will say though are in both cases of the the way I Am a quantum computing\nOn Saturday and not actually going forward with it this is all you know starting the groundwork right now but ah if we're less awareness has risen I think\nI I think that things will go on without the American people knowing until it's too late and so part of my\nMy hope is to raise awareness among the American people to say hey maybe we shouldn't have some of our best companies going overseas investing in the centers that could be used to it early defeat the United states uh enough you know whether it's economic\nOr military competition and there's something very interesting that there is a man by the last eight months later when twenty seconds for a no go ahead\nOr basically the there was the English English man is the reason why we won the industrial revolution against Britain it was a British expatriate and name Slater they called him slate of a traitor in England and so the same thing might be happening with American companies going over to China building up our our rivals\nAre somehow that phrase that they liked early on and Google garden that don't evil\nSame thing might be happening with American companies going over to China building up our our rivals\nUh

having me on the most difficult part about polling is that pollsters half to\nEstimate and this is where the art is what the turnout is going to look like and\nThe heart of that usually happens through screens of registered voters they asked them how likely you are to vote so you get what are called likely voters screens\nSome of it also happens I'm through the responses themselves you can start to tell by the the amount of sort of information people have are the enthusiasm that they have in certain questions that you asked them um\nHow likely they are to participate and all of that\nInformation kind of helps a pollster understand what turnout may look like\nBut the problem is we're in something of\nAn unusual mid term environment we're seeing both parties bases ... very enthusiastic I'm almost equally enthusiastic not quite but almost and interestingly\nEnough people are saying that they're planning on voting with a high degree of certainty and that is just\nNot usual in a midterm election in other words mid term elections yes we have this dynamic of waves yes there are times where all of the sort of the enthusiasm of the out party\nBuilds up and sort of cast this referendum vote against the president but what we're seeing in this instance is it both parties bases are very excited I'm and we're not really sure a little bit about the middle of the electorate\nThe middle of the electorate is nonpartisan it's either independent or not terribly excited either way it's waiting for that last week under that last days so is there another way to judge or to measure or to get some mid term does the money tell the story lower\nMoney certainly can suggest some enthusiasm and it is true that money has uh some very real\nImpacts on whether or not candidates are able to win I think as political scientists have long studied and Gary Jacobsen is I'm sort of high on the list of canon of political scientists who have understood the\nThink as political scientists have long studied and Gary Jacobsen is I'm sort of high on the list of canon of political scientists who have understood these dynamics but one of the things that is true is that incumbents have to raise money\nBut because they are already known they usually um are raising money in a defensive posture in other words um they need to raise more than the challengers but at the same time I'm every dollar that they spend\nDoesn't help them as much as say a dollar a challenger raises and spends and that just has to do with the familiarity of these candidates challengers are usually not known so every dollar that they spend um does\nMore to help them advance their causes in other words is a better marginal return on their dollars spent but the truth of the matter is for both\nCandidates the challenger and the incumbent and there is essentially a saturation level um or there is a diminishing returns that go with the additional dollars spent\nI'm look I'm told about saturation level but we passed it about a week ago that there are the odds are no minutes left on any TV channels anywhere in the important battleground districts\nThat's right and\nOf course so much of half of this is also happening on line so there's a lot of digital advertising um where people are spending money but really what you're looking at here is\nIf a challenger hopes to sort of beat an incumbent they need to raise typically at least half as much as the incumbent raises and spend that amount what is pretty extraordinary about the election we appear to be in is that\nMany of the Democratic challengers have\nOut raised the Republican incumbents that usually doesn't happen it is a rarity and it does suggest that the energy is on the Democratic side of the aisle\nBut we do have to realize that um challengers need to kind of be known if they're going to essentially\nWhen there's a twist there too I saw the New York times feature of the story that the candidate for the Democrats in Texas O'Rourke this is the Senate candidate against Ted Cruz has raised some spectacular amount of money tens of millions thirty\nBut the candidate for the Democrats in Texas O'Rourke this is the Senate candidate against Ted Cruz has raised some spectacular amount of money tens of millions thirty eight million was not named I don't know what the total some is\nAnd and is not spreading it around the way Congress or the way members of Congress usually do and so there's all and all a lot of the money this is a New York times reporting was coming from California and New York in other words not from Texas\nAnd that's the power of online that's the power of crowd funding but at the same time I wonder if that's effective money Laura is that a detail the political science can help with\nWell at the end of the day all money it's good money and that you can spend it I mean I Do think that one of the things that Beto O'Rourke\nHas um declared is that he's not taking pac contributions so that is helping him\nAt this level at which he can say all of this money\nWherever it's coming from is happening through individuals given to me um and that\nDoes allow him to spend an extraordinary amount he did thirty eight million in the third quarter heated twenty three million in the second quarter so there is no doubt he has plenty of money for all of the media advertising buys\nHe wants to do um\nThe real question is will it persuade\nRepublicans because obviously the challenge for eight or ... is the voter underline voter distribution and registration in Texas we know that there are more Republicans there\nThough there are many Democrats who are not registered and this is sort of the new fight of the Democratic party which is the you engage in persuasion or do you try to turn out voters who have not\nVoted before and in some of the states that they're in right now in particular some of\n'em these more contested typically Republican states like Georgia\nI'm you are seeing a lot of of questions about\nUm who can actually vote and who should be voting\nLargest to detail or with less than a minute to go the conventional wisdom also says that the Republicans retained the Senate in some fashion whether it's a pickup or stand pat do you see anything to interrupt that we have about thirty seconds\n[laughter] know again I think this is where the underlined distribution of voters matters a great deal um if you look at it\nSeem to interrupt that we have about thirty seconds\nYou know again I think this is where the underlined distribution of voters matters a great deal um if you look at those states where Democrats are on the defensive\nGranted they are incumbents and they've raised money but they are in very Republican states and with the enthusiastic Republican base it will likely be hard\nTo um secure those votes for them\nLara Brown is a political scientist she's a professor at the George Washington university I'm John bachelor this

Ga talks\nWhat does it today if I see a tax in the morning with your normal Thursday morning host Malcolm beret junior otherwise known as Malcolm in the morning to morning dusty good morning it's Eighteenth it is the ... that is good morning Eric good morning okay I got asked the question wins or an extreme\nOr Saturday we got a pretty good chance and that's half will stick with us or through Sunday through Monday or even to say\nThat's great because our our October rainfall is already significantly above average were over two inches of rainfall and most most areas of the county of course it a wide wettest October on record Phoenix got a lot more reading than we did there over the answer that famous\nGot soaked by Roosevelt we only got a little off your sprinkled from Russ oh\nWell that's good that's good will take it anytime we can get it so keep our fingers crossed maybe be will be wet again on\nA Saturday and thankfully I don't have to extend my hunting season [laughter] congratulations thank you thank you I was able to uh I get my ... on Tuesday Morning and we took it to the processor and I was back at the office by ten o'clock\nOnly in Prescott can you have a morning hot and still make up for work day\nIt was nice means you may have actually gotten up earlier than I Do that day uh I was up at four okay got up the same time I do it okay if that's your normal ... four oh five of my alarm goes off I'm Glad I don't have to do that because I don't do well\nAnyway in Studio my guess is more is Dr John ... good morning John moaning Malcolm John is a you know I read your bio you're you are\nA PHD in what is a micro genetics what is it now in epidemiology epidemiologist okay you notice that that just rolled off his tongue and epidemiologist as a study of diseases\nAt the molecular level [noise] well a more generally are we study the distribution of diseases and the determinants of disease and\nIs at the molecular level [noise]\nWell a more generally are we study the distribution of diseases and the determinants of diseases okay so um you know the research you hear about whether aspirin or [noise]\nOr reduces the risk of heart attacks for example would be epidemiology um the information you hear about influenza and it spread that would be epidemiology so there are various sub specialties but in general we're looking at\nThe distribution of diseases and factors that either increase the frequency or decreased the frequency\nOkay we can we can take it for granted then you're obviously a well studied smart individual [noise]\nWell um I Know a lot about a narrow area of science\nThat's okay but you know how to study you know how to do your research and I was in trade 'em by a letter to the editor I saw published in our local paper\nOr talking about the Paris climate accord and who is in compliance who's not in compliance whether we are members or not and I think number one on the list in not in compliance even though they're not a member is China\nOr your windows draftee heart opener so fucked up you can see out it's time to replace your windows major improvements have been done over the last ten to Twenty years\nAnd ... when does give you a superior energy efficiency while stopping harmful UV rays\nThis Jeff Edwards order of Tripoli construction the only certified Palin's dollar and the Prescott area we are highly skilled professionals train certified and approved by palate expertly install your windows and doors calls today and get two hundred dollars off her window seven seven eight thirty fifty six Tripoli construction for a job done right and integrity you can trust\nJust not how we do things here in Arizona lying about our neighbors and co workers friends more than the valley in her Washington allies keep blind and out here in Santa Monica would fall than dirty ... children and grandchildren aren't listening the truth ... cinemas voted for\nA penalty against anyone who preyed on our children\nNationally young girls are more than the valley nearly\nNoon wonder ... already condemned Sally ...\nFall and local news media and all these latest didn't have and then the bally's allies including the mask ESPN has\nCondemned Sally disgraceful last fall and local news media calling these latest can hack and sending valleys allies quote that mass ESPN as low as you can gather saw\nNasty after well if you can get to think about it more than the valley on line just to get elected and she knows the lie about anything and that's not how their\nRent and I do things here in Arizona and I checked in Santa Monica candidate for us and that and I should have been married for like for Arizona local\n\nLaw\nWelcome decay Y. C. H. talks with Malcolm in the morning joining me in Studio is Dr John Arquilla\nAnd he is talking about we're talking about the Paris climate accord even though the U.S is not a segment to a signatory to it\nAh we're in compliance with the guidelines of the court so when people start screaming about while the U.S doesn't cooperate internationally with environmental\nA controls um even though we're not a signatory we are certainly in compliance with what the court is where some of our neighbor countries who are signatories our way out of compliance it's all lip service\nWhen we think about Canada we think about what Canada is great we want to be like Canada in Canada is the world leader and doing all sorts of things socially and scientifically but in reality\nIt's all lip service they don't do it at all\nAnd what's ironic is Canada has a reputation for being the most progressive countries in the world where in fact a Canadian Business they are not in compliance I Know half a dozen Canadians and ironically they're all conservative\nIn a free one of them really despise the current leadership of Canada and\nYou know we all think about where I Want to be just like Canada but really look at what Canada really is like try to immigrate to Canada and see what you get\nThe most restrictive country on immigration out there you cannot immigrate to Canada unless you have a skill that is needed for example if you're an RN in one emigrating in work in Canada they will not allow you\nCanada unless you have a skill that is needed for example if you're an RN in one emigrating in work in Canada they will not allow you because they don't have a need for registered nurses\nSo you can go and visit but you can't gain citizenship unless you're gainfully employed in an industry where they need workers can you imagine if we did that in this country\nWell I'm of course we do try to get the best and brightest here in other ways and we do and we did our educational there's there are incentives right\nAnd that's why we have so many foreign people working in the sciences because we have a real shortage of our domestic product that's that's willing\nTo work in the sciences right you know Malcolm I worked in the pharmaceutical industry for ten years before I retired to uh Prescott\nAnd I can't imagine what the pharmaceutical industry of obvious in California with the pharmaceutical industry in California would be like without um Chinese are individuals who came over and studied medicine by a statistics and the like and\nI'm also people from other parts of Asia ... and just um you know you see a tremendous concentration of um those people in the pharmaceutical industry and just very important to drug development in the United states\nWell I have a three sons in law all of them um scientists were it well engineers I should say a one in the electro as electro mechanical engineer\nOr in ... Minnesota and another one who's working for rape you ought to Tucson and they're the ones that are working on the um um cruise missiles\nEvery time you see a cruise missile launched its good fares are because they're a million dollars a pop [laughter] and it's not the\nThe military budget isn't about the people who are dropping the bombs in pulling the triggers it's about the people who are designing them in building them if you look at at the average a cost of a ballistic missile the million dollar I think as well over that now Ninety percent of it is in development\nAnd uh a design and manufacturing only ten percent is spent on the actual delivery of the weapons so\n[noise] people forget about that in the defense budget or Ninety percent of the defense budget isn't paying for the military directly it's paid for the ...\nSo [noise] people forget about that in the defense budget or Ninety percent of the defense budget isn't paying for the military directly it's paid for the cost of development of the equipment\nYou know the bombs rockets the airplanes tanks all those things and it really drives the economy especially down in Tucson were right there on his located Southern California has a huge a defense um budget\nAnd if you look at all the employees down there in the sciences you'll see a a large percentage of foreign engineers working in our um defense industry in terms of devout development and you're saying the same thing is with a pharmaceutical\nAs it is with um computing and or any of it you know information technology companies and\nThe like and the other the fourth son in law is an engineer for Google in a I'm a I'm not sure where he works but it's in the metrics how they develop the market and he's actually a software engineer began his career as a software engineer with Boeing\nAnd that's where he met my daughter and they both now I'm living in uh Seattle area he works for Google again he broke off for a year or so for a start up decided that wasn't a good idea went back to Google and she's now working for rocket dying\nDesigning now I'm a propulsion systems so I can actually say I have a daughter who is a rocket scientist [noise] well\nThere are so many great careers in science and uh you know I've been practicing in my field for about forty years but when I started in school I didn't really even know my field existed\nAnd I'm sure a lot of people who go through a and get degrees in science find themselves working in fields that they didn't necessarily think that we're going to find employment in and some of those are really great field so right a Christian Science are great\nAnd I guess I get a little worried when I see you know fewer Americans [laughter] proportionately taking up science careers I I just wonder you know why that happened\n... well even when I was in my formative years in high school and moving on to college um I didn't know a lot of my peers who went into the sciences they were going into the social sciences ... the social sciences programs or\nUm I didn't know a lot of my peers who went into the sciences they were going into the social sciences ... the social sciences programs or the general business programs and I'd say half of them go into the business field and a very small percentage now are going to science\nRight but it's what you know improve our lives just significantly well somebody's got to do it somebody's got to do it so why are the foreign um it's a particularly Asian why are they so focused on the science is when we are not what the answer to that\nI'd have to sixty four thousand dollar question Malcolm and I have a couple of ideas okay but um [noise]\nYou know a depending on the state of development of your country you you need certain things right right and so there's been a huge infrastructure build in China over the years writing a huge industrialization\nThat requires a lot of people in science so um you know that's a really important factor\nI Know of course one percent of the Chinese student population compared to what percent of us student population is that Ron numbers are tenfold over the u._s. right China has an enormous population or it's huge\nAnd of course I think part of that whether you're China or Vietnam or or anywhere they identify a the opportunities in the sciences in what they can earn and do a in the U.S is it's a huge incentive for them\nIf they can legally immigrant and I admire their work ethic oh they're really dog is that it's a it's an entirely different culture um\nAnd they're they're maintaining their culture where a lot of times we what is our culture do\nWe even know what it is anymore\nSo anyway we're down to the heartbreak ah we'll be right back after these or\nAll from the comfort of America's Best selling some combat home with the venerable ... now with financing zero percent maybe are for up to sixty three customers in some of the first one you're going to go to USC accomplishments\nKnow

C. H. talks with Malcolm in the morning joining me in Studio this morning is uh\n[noise] ... welcome\nBack to ... Ga talks with Malcolm in the morning joining me in Studio this morning is Dr John Arquilla he's a recently retired epidemiologist\nAnd how you proud that I can say that now rules right off my time you're learning about them I'll get there I may be slow but I get it eventually for an old guy mhm\nAnd talking about a total\nA unrelated subject about the difference the disappearance of job mall to show me anyway we've got a caller Elly Yu recommends books on discussion\nEli are you there yes\nI Am okay I didn't hear your voice [laughter] um yeah I was just for the thing and I'm thinking about that culture ah we have a different culture than China and um there's a new book I'm reading it's called spy schools\nIt's written by Daniel Golden jail at the end and he also wrote the price I mentioned he's a Pulitzer Prize winner right and um what he's exposing and I saw him\nA tendency for colleges and universities in the United states to accept foreign students because they pay cash a lot of them and they're really serious student and about their countries use them as spies\nAnd we also a A R spying on foreign schools and its espionage trying to\nUm undermining each other's or discover each other's motives so I think the Chinese wind up control of the world basically and we don't have the same Ames\nWell LA I can tell you that you know recently we're made a big subject about interferes with the elections allegedly by Russia\nNow comes to China and I will tell you every single world power who it can be considered not a friend of the u._s. is doing that yeah and if you remember back during in the bomber administrators and trying to interfere with the Israeli elections right and yet that was a good thing right\nFor the U.S to interfere with their elections\nBut it's not a good thing not with a bad thing if it and I agree it was accepted though because of the the leadership people said well that's okay it must have been OK and of course are meddling in the Israeli election had absolutely no impact whatsoever [noise]\nUm but foreign powers have been\nWell that's okay it must have been OK and of course are meddling in the Israeli election had absolutely no impact whatsoever [noise] um but foreign powers have been a fighting each other with espionage way before the Internet\nRight and now they have the Internet it just gives them another means\nI we are interfering with other countries just as much as they're interfering with us yeah\nThat's it details the FBI and CIA involvement but the only problem is that\nUm they're getting some of our secrets and it it's our technology that they're using but some of that they that book has um sometimes it backfires some of the Chinese students especially after that CNN square massacre right they decide to stay in the United ... face\nThat's always that's always a risk for foreign powers because once the students come here and get accustomed to our culture and society and see the opportunities it provides they can be way more successful here in the United states\nAnd going back to their home country right in in ... and that's the biggest risk yeah okay thank you for taking my call All right LA thank you\nYeah I Know Malcolm from a first hand experience we hired a fair number of um epidemiologists who were trained initially in China and then came and finish their PHD's in the United states\nAnd um I think virtually all of them are staying right because they love the lifestyle and you know I Know this ah spying goes on of course\nBut um the people who I've gotten to know and worked with made tremendous contributions to drug development right so you know I I Know that car and the opportunities\nAre available in this country to somebody who's willing to work hard and dedicate our unlike anywhere else in the entire world if they stay in their home country no matter if it's China South Korea Russia up pick any country once they get used to culture here it's difficult for them to go back\nRight and it's not just for them um you know they see it in terms of a future generations right you know their children go on to be recommended asleep successful they pass it down to the kids are time going to the best colleges you know scoring the highest on achievement tests it's an ethic from them and\nSo that I think they see it more is just than just their own personal benefit in the short term\nRight well they're educated in their home countries to believe a certain thing about the U.S it may be\nHad more is just than just their own personal benefit in the short term\nRight well they're educated in their home countries to believe a certain thing about the U.S it may be recruited for espionage but once they get here and see what it's really like\nA change in attitude and of course their risk is a country may come after him if they don't walk the line with what they're supposed to do\nI'd like to think that it's a minority of them as a minority that are recruited for espionage and right now most of the others well intentioned my experience you know would lead me to believe that all of them that I I've worked with over the years were well intentioned and and we're great colleagues\nWrite well especially I have a daughter working for rocket dying as a really a rocket scientist and there's a big percentage of a foreign workers are working with her uh in that development there\nShe she's dealing with propulsion systems now doing actually what she was trained to do and she loves it\nYeah well being a rocket scientist is hard you know I'm I think anyone who's in a scientific discipline looks at another scientific discipline and says well that's really hard that's harder than what I Do [laughter] and you know what I hear you're describing your daughter I think wow she must be really smart and that's a very difficult discipline to work\nAnd yeah and she loves it anyway we're up to our last break give us a call five or one one

they own the business over there on hillside their advertisers on cable I see a as well as I Am so maybe we'll team up and have an advertisement together that's a long time forty years in business also coming up\nOn December first is the sixty fourth\nThat's a long time\nSixty fourth that's older than I Am by the way\nSixty fourth annual courthouse sliding will be taking place on December first right after the parade and that will be taking place roughly around five o'clock there's a lot of musical group some performances that go on from five o'clock\nOr the lighting ceremony will roughly be at six PM on the north side of the plaza so\nI look for cable I see a to a an ounce maybe one or both of those events they have in the past so I look forward to hearing all the wonderful things that take place out there on that first day of December and right here on cable I see that's what happens so [noise]\nThe news the news the news the news the news is that we have a president of the United states has serious about what he does or people from Honduras that are marching this way to the United states I'm ... can you imagine that four thousand plus people\nHow to you march that far do you have any idea Scotty what what I mean seriously what the miles are that they're marching and as I've heard today who's feeding them\nHowdy march that far do you have any idea Scotty what what I mean seriously what the miles are that they're marching and as I've heard today who's feeding them were their health facilities come from what's going on with all that and they're they're marching to the Arizona border\nTo come into the United states and frankly I I take some of those things that are taking place ridiculous and and we put a put down and stop all that stuff so [noise]\nUh I think it's just a challenge of challenge in the United states at our freedom once again a there's a lot of folks out there that don't appreciate our constitution or what the constitution stands for uh I Do\nAnd I believe in the pledge allegiance to the constitution and the rule of law\nAnd I hope somebody out there continues to a beat on their chest and says enough is enough oh you got it on the screen now look how far that is can you can again getting idea that's Honduras Guatemala beliefs is right above that\nAnd then you go on up through while the peninsula of of Oklahoma or from Montana Montana Mexico\nAnd that's a long ways\nI have no idea will try to figure out how far that is but anyhow four thousand people moving towards\nAsylum in the United states President Trump has threatened to bring out\nOr the military and stop them at the border I Would support that a hundred percent I don't blame him or they don't have the righteous indignation to come here and do what they want to do so [noise]\nAnyhow that's part of the news is going on out there today the president's heading to Montana to do some electioneering for the\nSenate seat up there in Montana he's going to be in Arizona my understanding later next week so we'll see how that unfolds and were that will be taking place where there's in Phoenix or whether that be maybe in Prescott valley at the events in her again\nAnd we'll find out what happens with that also going on in the city of Prescott we have a lot of things happening right here in river city ah we just\nHave put together a conversation at city hall to talk about texting and driving and actually using a mobile phone while you're in a vehicle\nOr we have made it clear that this council supported unanimously for the city attorney to come back with some kind of resolution\nA vehicle or we have made it clear that this council supported unanimously for the city attorney to come back with some kind of resolution that dictates\nA what you can and can't do and you're in your vehicle and one of them would be is too I have a hands free device in your vehicle\nAnd not be holding a cell phone or looking down at your crotch trying to press in an answer text and all that kind of nonsense I see people do that every single day\nAnd frankly as far as I'm concerned I'm surprised there's not more rights than there are out there already based upon in to the driving so are we here at my brother's Arizona I got some folks that work for me and all of us are a hands free\nAnd if you have an iPhone and I don't know how many people out there have an iPhone or but if you have an iPhone and the apple devices you can buy apple or your ear buds to go on each one of your ear\nFor about a hundred and twenty dollars\nUh you can buy those locally at a at a business here in town or you can go to um some website and purchase them as well and that'll make a hands free they're tied into your phone and you can just talk away matter of fact you can tap twice on your ear and you can tell\nThat device to play your last text so you don't even have to go to your tax to the ... will do is\nIt'll tell you what's on that last tax so a technology has improved there's absolutely no reason whatsoever for somebody to be distracted by having something in their hand other than the steering wheel\nA while you're driving down the road at twenty miles an hour or forty miles an hour or Seventy five miles an hour it's not necessary any longer with our technology will take a short break here on the news fourteen Ninety\nAnd the one oh three point five FM we are the PM show feel free to call and fight for one once you're once six right here with your councilman your native the Blair we'll be right back\nCurly and they closed off um gosh they close off mount assume a and they have all these folks out there that are doing they're seeing their doing their musical instruments and had been starts at five thirty and runs through about eight o'clock\nAnd that again is in downtown Prescott a court history mount assumes street all around and make sure if you get a chance\nYou know go out and see what's happening with that\nEven ... you won't regret the fact that you were there and you were part of that so I'm also going on well\nGoing on right now is what I ask guy to figure out the Honduras and the Guatemalan folks that are down deep in the peninsula they're making a move to the United states or I guess for I don't know free healthcare\nAngle and some Democrats mine's that's what they want anyway they're moving towards the Arizona or in the Texas border I'm mostly the Arizona border as the crow flies Scotty saying the distance between Honduras and the US's proximity sixteen hundred miles\nSo do you really think\nThat these folks are walking sixteen hundred miles think about that for one minute\nSixteen hundred miles and\nThey're having somebody um feed them they're having somebody provide sanitary facilities for um some place to sleep at night and my question would be the same as what I've heard today who is funding this exodus out of Honduras Guatemala\nIf they covered twenty miles a day it'll take them approximately eighty days\nTo make the U.S at twenty five miles a day it still takes them over two months\nTo go from ... to the United states that's amazing in it\nSo logs or all\nIn all these ... ... ... ... children that they talked about\nYou know there's more going on in our world than just adds so anyhow I hate to bring up the negative with the positive but there's two sides to every point a lot of things going on here in the community we have a coming of a city council meeting next week\nA which we will be a city council chambers on Tuesday a Super Tuesday Billy or an ... will be in the house next\nNext week a which we will be a city council chambers on Tuesday a Super Tuesday Billy or an ... will be in the house next Tuesday a prior to the council meeting I'm there also is a things going on out there that you probably want to be aware of\nThat have to do with you know the discussion about the details\n[noise] um [noise] we're getting ready to have a UPC meeting which is a universal development building code meaning that talks about the ... liberation of signs in our community\nAnd about what the loop road the laws and the rules and regulations are going to be frankly I have been very surprised with a number of signs\nAre that we've had out there we do have a law on the city of Prescott books\nAnd the fact of the matter is there's people that have violated those rules but I think they've got out of hand\nAnd I think it has been our city attorney's opinion that based upon how out of hand is Scott and\nAnd the fact that we don't have the staff to manage the number of science that are out there that we would allow this stuff to take place this election season and the next election season this will not happen also you know save the deals folks I appreciate everybody out there that likes to granted deals I Do as well [noise]\nUh and the ... say to deal signs banners are everywhere in the right away they don't have a permit to put those out there in the right away\nAnd again I think that's against the city code as well [noise] uh so we have a lot of things to talk about when we have are you D.C meeting coming up this next week I think it's scheduled and no I don't know what day it will be scheduled for but we'll be talking about uh the sign code in the city of Prescott\nAnd you have something ... what does that\nYeah we get a caller call into a\nCorrective slowly William
