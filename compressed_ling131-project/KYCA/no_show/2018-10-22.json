saying they're trying to come to the United states and I suspect that's true for some of them I don't know if it's true for all four thousand\nOr however many estimated there are that are coming up uh as of yesterday and I didn't check on the status today they were held up at the Mexican border\nAre they the Mexican government was saying we'll let you through women and children first one at a time you can apply for asylum so basically it's going to take forever\nIf you are a man who is in this group you are going to be waiting a long time but Donald Trump has been hammering out at his Twitter saying today earlier\nOh let's see here full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border people have to apply for asylum and Mexico first and if they fail to do that the U.S will turn them away the courts are asking us to do things that are not doable he says\nAnd then he goes to blame the Democrats for it and another tweet where he says the caravans or a disgrace to the Democrat Party changed the immigration laws now he says\nRight so he's blaming the party that does it have a majority in Congress because his party that does have a majority in Congress hasn't done anything\nThe paranoid a viewpoint was aired last night on the show where somebody said that the theory is that there are certain groups who are funding this

out last night yeah yeah [noise] uh which doesn't make any sense at all because these people don't even have water to drink so if it's if it's being funded by George Soros he's done a really crappy

there are apparently a lot of people are trying to get out of a hunter as there there are photographs of them that that do exist and so I did I did want to bring in rather than you know because

dot com\nDonald J Trump on his at real Donald Trump on Twitter says if the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour a look at the needless pain and suffering that they are causing look at the horrors taking place on the border Chuck and Nancy call\nMe All right so the the\nHorrors on the border all the Democrats the separating of families yeah that was Donald Trump\nAlthough he's saying it's the Democrats' fault yeah he's a lot of talk to him and make a desire and all this out he's the one that actually I think it was uh\nOh no he's saying it's the Democrats' fault yeah he's a lot\nOf talk to and then they could just hire and all this out he's the one that actually I think it was a the Little Mermaid skin from Alabama Jeff Sessions with that we're going to take a a you know tough on crime something zero tolerance and a throw the\nKids in jail with the parents are pending something oh but wait\nWhat what he's blaming on Democrats was the provision that children can't be detained for more than Seventy two hours in a while there's no limit on the parents so I guess we just got to separate the kid going to follow the law\nBut then do in order for them to put back together\nYeah yeah the hiring and reconnected because some of the parents have been deported and the kids are still in foster care and they're eating ... like Fifteen hundred kids that\nThey do know who they belong to\nYeah they didn't even take down and that the information when separating the families like that record keeping it's terrible\nYeah and to just blame it on the Democrats I mean it's been throughout multiple administration the government has been destroying people's lives yup that's what governments do and if Donald Trump wanted to stop the horrors on the border he could just order the border patrol down to stand down and do nothing but of course that's not going to [laughter]\nThat's not going to transpire because as not what he wants\nHow many times over the last twelve months have there been those internal border checkpoints in northern New Hampshire\nAre a lot actually they've been doing it probably did several at least that I've heard of this year\nYeah I I think it was like every other word every two to three weekends it's the summer yeah I'm saying somebody post border checkpoint and I was like wait didn't they just do that laugh at all no other way in the same place in the same exact spot\nSo anyway if you want to comment You're welcome to zero toll free number is eight fifty five four fifty for him to continue\nWith the story from the border patrol agent Josh Childress is his name he's writing for the Daily Beast dot com tells a story about encountering an elderly man or who was crossing or an older man perhaps or who is crossing the border at night\nAnd ultimately he knows he's just going to get sent back and try again because legally he can't legally apply given that he was caught trying to cross the border they now banned him for five years\nThe way he knows he's just going to get sent back and try again because legally he can't legally apply given that he was caught trying to cross the border they now banned him for five years\nFrom even trying to do it legally he says the average migrant who crosses the southern border as anything but average all of them risk their lives and their freedom to make the crossing\nMost are from desperately poor parts of central and South America toward the end of my career people from Mexico we're in the minority of those we encountered\nThe older men usually have rough hands simple dress and little education most of the younger men can a younger man can read and write and are concerned with fashion the women usually where looks of desperation for themselves and for their children\nSome of the people we caught were violent criminals somewhere model citizens all of them were people who had lost the geographical lottery\nFor almost seven years under presidents Obama and Trump I enforced policies that separated children from their parents husband's from their wives and millions of ordinary people from their dreams of living better lives\nThe policies remain generally consistent between the two administrations I worked under But Trump's flagrant made people pay attention a public outcry was so great and the government's reactions so strong that family separations became far more difficult to accomplish than they were under Obama\nIt took me several which kind of an interesting you know counter right right or is all this noise made about immigration and so it brought attention to these issues which slightly improved those circumstances all that's not saying a whole lot\nHe says it took me several years to understand the impact of what I was doing as a border patrol agent there were contradictions I could not reconcile ultimately realized that I was putting people in cages for non violent offenses something I posed in every other area of the law\nI was impeding the movement of people when I Want it to be able to move freely around the world\nI was enforcing the rules of the game I had one simply by being born on the right side of the line\nIn August of this year I approached my supervisor and explained that my views have changed and that I needed to quit\nRespectful but taken aback he remarked\nPeople don't usually quit his job\nAnd so he wasn't sure of the proper procedures\nCalls replaced I 'cause I imagine benefits pretty sweet right you're right working for the federal government get all that government health care all those pennies the tensions floating out there and the distance for you\nHe says in August uh or excuse me he then turned in calls were placed in the next day\nYeah all those pennies the pensions floating out there and the distance for you\nHe says in August uh or excuse me he then turned in calls were placed in the next day I turned in my badge and gun\nCurrently he says approximately one point to six million people from Mexico are awaiting visa approval numbers for central and south Americans are in the hundreds of thousands many of them applied in the Nineteen nineties\nFor their visa\nTo just visit just ... yeah\nIn the nineties and what he's writing this again when\nUh this last week I think it's been good the date here are the thirteenth of this month so a week ago\nSo like twenty plus years that's what he's saying waiting on ... yeah I I Believe it yeah\nI just think you know like it's something that not a lot of people hear about you know like how I feel like oh wait a little more time consuming I knew a lot of times you had to wait yeah he's going to explain a little bit more about that coming up here and again why he quit his job he realized\nHe was the thing that he disagreed with you disagreed with people being arrested for non violent crimes but yet he was the one out there making that happen was working on a pure moments you got to be the changes to see that for this guy ... looking for that\nEdge during those intimate moments we see many as part of the house with

testing out because it can work that thing about it I I think about them or not ... percent\nTune curse about\nEither claim here that you're correct thing is he says it's because\nUh according to federal loan knew more than seven percent of visas maybe issued to people from any country in a single year whether they're from a place with a large demand for immigration in the United states like Mexico or El Salvador or from a place with little or no demand you're saying that number's actually Fifteen Percent\nIt makes that ... ... only applied to\nSo I appreciate the correction ups or Laurel but I mean all of this seems to be quibbling over the details of what is ultimately a policy that restricts freedom of movement and I mean I definitely appreciate the info but it certainly doesn't change any of my opinions about this I mean there's still don't know what I mean if you're a grandstanding and now he's\nGetting this great he's off is that if you're trying to order cloth apply for five years but I don't know I Know somebody who's appointed I couldn't bring them out by\nWay of life that we are and\nSo there's a special waiver is what you're saying you have to apply for and get past the fire restriction\nHow many people know about that I can tell\nAnybody when I talk to her [laughter] right right going to hire an attorney and how many people like this old guy the ... guy trying to visit his mother his mother or grandmother went back to America to visit his dialogue or\nYou know how many people like that that don't have a lot of money are going to have the funds to conduct a lawyer because a lot of times lawyers\nOh you want to talk it's gonna be five hundred dollars for an evaluation\nYou can have a Thirteen can go to a nonprofit nonprofit out there and the offer or on the\nUs assuming that the person can afford the attorney to learn about this waiver what does the application process the government you know what does the waiver costs because I Know that in ... in Canada if I Want to go back to Canada or after ten years I have to apply and pay them to narrow way aren't you can get\nYes I have to pay two hundred and fifty dollars for every misdemeanor that I have on my record that they're concerned with it so it cost me about five hundred Canadian dollars to apply to have that waved to wear to ten years but it is nearly waiver where you don't have to\nDemeanor that I have on my record that they're concerned with it so it costs me about five hundred Canadian dollars to apply to have that waved to wear to ten years but it's a narrow waiver where you don't have to wait ten good question I'd have to call and attorney about that but I really want to do that because all they want to do is go and have lunch sometime and that's not really worth the money to to do any of that stuff\nSo what's the cost if you're going to get this waiver\nGliding their feet\nAnd filing after the nine hundred and thirty dollars\nYeah that's a lot of money and that doesn't matter what country you're coming from rights for others you know coming from Mexico or somebody coming from China it's still going to be a nine hundred and something bucks laurels thinking

dating in the DC area\nWhen a women on dating sites or I guess the vice versa can be the case but when the other you know whoever did you want to date finds out that you are a Trump supporter in his case then it's off\nOr in some cases for for just people on the right just finding out there on the right means\nIt's off I'm just you know people will jump to a conclusion about you\nAnd again I'm saying you talking to conservatives out there this is probably true to some extent on the river side with\nAre conservatives on these sites who find that they're you know attracted to a liberal but then they find out that there are a liberal that might turn them off to that's just not what the article or in this case happens to be about so I guess I'm curious to know what your experiences have been as a libertarian because some people make\nYou know they jumped to the wrong conclusions about us to somebody right believes that libertarians are on the right others believe that libertarians are on the left\nAnd of course the problem is on a lot of these sites is you're never going to find out what somebody thinks they're just going to not answer you write like you you send a message to somebody on one of these dating sites they look at your profile and they see oh this person is against you know fill in the blank government program this person must be a\nWhatever liberal or conservative based on whatever their preconceived notions are and then it's just like well even if they thought you were attractive maybe you're right off\nThe black government program this person must be a\nWhatever liberal or conservative based on whatever their preconceived notions are and then it's just like well even if they thought you were attractive maybe you're right off the list anyway because of your politics so is it a good idea to hide that information and wait until you actually do get a on a date with somebody or hands\nOn how important it is to you\nKnow I like so as somebody that has taken up and running over the last couple of years you know I spend a lot of time doing that thing that I not put in a profile by the way I run a lot\nWell that's way less objectionable right like the idea that you run a lot somebody's gonna be like man this guy's fit um where at it so\nA couple of months ago I send a message to somebody and they were like oh wait so you're like running all weekend is you're not going to have time to ever see me really yeah\nOkay so you know like if you spend time doing certain things whether it be running or politics somebody could take action to\nThat I see that I don't think it's going to result in as many objections not\nNecessarily going to be as many but you know if there's something that is important to you should you hide that because of the question somebody else might not find that important to build\nNormal person's going to have a moral objection to somebody running or doing rather\nTime consuming hobby that doesn't really have any larger political or social implications I Would guess though that anybody who's listening to this show politics has probably a big enough part of their life that disclosing that and you're dating profiles a good idea\nI just want to know what your experience has been the toll free number here's eight fifty five four fifty free and of course you can bring up anything so I'm not sure what to free market penguin is calling about but he's on the line on our discord call in line number four go ahead\nYeah I'm ... now raking in the new new for online working on\nYeah going great likely I'm I wanted to call about actually I think you can really hit the nail on the head and bravo her bringing it up the ah that this is talk for libertarians to call from the left just because actually the first person that ever mentioned that ... is he in a new image of probably like a just started listening to the ... live kinda regularly\nAnd you wrote a letter from a guy that was on the left and he had you had brought him to liberty and um yeah I mean that it it it really made it ... it\nAnd you had 'em read a letter from a guy that was a on the left and he had you had brought him to liberty and um yeah I mean that it it really made it pretty and it's funny 'cause I actually never been brought up sense but you really made it pretty in passing case for why like people on the left really just a like Jackie said was to get a I'm\nA ... an economics lesson I mean really people the people they are very so many well intentioned people that just wants what's right for society and worth what society and people are the uplifted did have you know people are they are kind of a\nMore equal footing in certain ways and that they overcome their then isn't it and then they can decide oh problems\nAnd there is their answers in ... in liberty liberty and then the parent movement and ... and you know\n... this side of the political spectrum I'm to those issues to people with those kinds of concerns and not just a fully individualistic ... you know pro I'm kind of your your your ... is David I'm\nHad any individual is ... and kept kind of um situation kind of thing and they know the right thing to do or very important and they are you know sacrosanct to to many libertarians but at the same time you know\nPeople\nMost people have don't have a clue what libertarian very passive libertarians are and and and\nNo they don't have a clue um I remember hearing or there's a gun organization here in New Hampshire and half your firearms coalition has to believe what it's called\nAnd they do one of those uh you know candidate questionnaires that if you're running for office they send you a questionnaire and then they will\nEither endorsed you are not endorse you based on your answers to the questionnaire right like how you believe on guns\nAnd of course you know I did very well presumably I haven't gotten my raining yet but I don't know if they've come out with them but the due wrote me back like really impressed the the organizer of this or this ... or ... wrote me back impressed with my answers like you don't sound at all like the libertarian presidential candidates\nOr did basically their bill weld and uh Gary Johnson she specifically mentioned bill weld and seems like he really hates bill weld because he's from Massachusetts so he knows how bad he was a on guns apparently\nAnd I was like well you know there's there are some people who are actually libertarian when people who understand what non aggression is and we talk about that and then there's people like Bill wealth\nOr so you know unfortunately that's just the reality people don't know and especially if they're being confused by these liberty so called libertarians getting national press then it's understandable\nOh you know unfortunately that's just the reality people don't know and especially if they're being confused by these liberty so called libertarians getting national press than it's understandable why people will be turned off and disgusted\nBy libertarians and then jumped to understandable conclusions thinking that all libertarians must believe what these candidates believe because why else would they be their presidential candidates if they weren't the standard bearer for the libertarian belief system\nI guess the way they will be mall all Republicans would actually like Trump does\nThat's what's going on here though right like that's the problem with uh these dating sites apparently is people are jumping to conclusions based on if somebody says they're Republican or Democrat ... conclusions are jumped to and the same thing's true about libertarians which is why I prefer the term volunteer is I don't know if you had more to say

M. K. Y. C. A. give us a call five four one one zero one six dusty and I'll be glad to hear from you\nWell we were just getting started\nWith a discussion of the uh the Senate race here in Arizona that he has gotten so much a national attention it's one of the critical siege there's about eight of them\nUp for grabs and that will determine which is the majority party in the Senate starting\nAnd that will determine which is the majority party in the Senate starting in uh in twenty Nineteen with the new session so we'll\nIt's a it's a significant one between Martha mix Sally and Kirsten Sinema to both a sitting congressman or sitting house of representatives members are facing off against to one another for the ... the seat that Jeff Flake vacated [noise]\nBut uh of laid it seems a Kirsten Sinema has developed a real case of foot in mouth disease and turns out it's been going on for a long time [noise] way back in a\nA twenty ten when she was in the state legislature she addressed a Texas gathering\nA telling them to be careful and she was going to help them so they're state didn't turn into gross crazy Arizona ah she ... she said quote can you actually believe I stood for office in that living nightmare of hell hole meaning Arizona\nAnd one gross unquote um course sentiment called Arizona's a meth lab of democracy whatever that is supposed to mean\nAnd now it turns out that in an interview with Scottsdale nightlife magazine some years ago she referred to I'm a stay at home moms\nAre in a rather disparaging way she said and these are quotes again these women who act like staying at home ... off their husbands and boyfriends and just cashing checks is some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life\nVats\nWords I Can't say meaning bow vine manure\nAnd I mean she says what the blank starting with F. are we really talking about here this is the kind of language she uses and what she thinks that the people of Arizona\nNow maybe a number of her voters agree that the problem with Arizona is Republicans as she told that Texas gathering [noise]\nBut you might be inclined to wonder if a voters have heard the way she thinks about the state that she hopes to represent anyway this is one of the most closely watched races around the country\nDon the record supporting Medicare for all with the uh the Sanders build it's been introduced into the Senate ah that bill mandates the elimination of employer insurance coverage is um the employer insurance programs\nWhich happened to cover about a hundred and fifty million job holders in the country um some have gone so far toward misleading the voters that they say Medicare for all would be voluntary\nBut without the ability to have employer plans and it would also prevent a purchase of private coverage\nThat's not exactly an honest thing to say one other thing on the state ballot this year\nA significance far beyond Arizona\nInterestingly enough is the retention election for two of the Supreme Court justices or in Arizona Supreme Court justices are appointed by the governor or with Senate confirmation button must run for retention in office\nAfter two years and then every six years thereafter\nOf this time around justices Clinton bought like and John ... are on the ballot\nOr they're retention is being opposed by the state teachers' union the Arizona education and ... and some of their national allies a lot of out of state money again\nAh when the Arizona Education Association tried to get a proposition to old seven on the ballot\nThe high court threw it out of the state Supreme Court threw it out because of legal violations in the language now or the proponents of that and it did not make it to the ballot\nOr they want to take that ruling out on the two justices that are on the ballot this year so there is a big campaign going on to reject retention\nOf those two uh the it was a misleading tax increase the tempt 'em and the way it was worded on the on the ballots was improper so the courts the carts threw it out that's simply part of our process but that\nThat and the efforts to unseat two Supreme Court justices here in Arizona\nHas gotten quite a bit of a national attention\nWell let's take a look at the national scene aside from arrows\nHas gotten quite a bit of a national attention\nWell let's take a look at the national scene aside from Arizona there are several\nOf Senate races worth watching in Florida or as an example governor Rick Scott currently the governor is running against Senator Bill Nelson for that seat a real interesting um campaign broach\nThe nails and campaign has criticized Governor Scott for ignoring campaigning accusing him from hiding from the voters\nWhile what's been going on is that he's very he's very active down in the Florida Panhandle on the Gulf Coast\nUm with hurricane relief efforts after hurricane Michael came down on the coast so heavily uh that's probably where one might expect the governor to be rather than out on the campaign trail\nBut that ah that rate is race is pretty tight uh Scott holding a small lead a but there's been no polling since Michael hit so we'll see we'll see how that one goes into another one to watch on election night and then in the ... in Missouri\nThe race between Senator Claire McCaskill and senator Josh Hawley um their McCaskill opposed both justice Gorsuch and just as cabin off\nA they're in a neck and neck race however\nAre just over the weekend it was revealed that to\nPlanned Parenthood has been filtering campaign dollars to the McCaskill campaign\nThrough third party groups to hide their contributions um now that wouldn't matter so much\nExcept for the fact that Planned Parenthood receives about over five hundred million a federal taxpayer dollars every year uh some of those dollars go into the McCaskill\nCampaign a third ... the use of third party packs to hide their contributions are kind of questionable [noise]\nAnd that's

doing pretty good did you given my words I Hope I sure hope you do things I Would tell them to get out of bed All right Peter\nSo this all things considered is doing pretty good\nDid you give me my words I Hope I Hope you don't ... I Would tell them to get out of bed All right Peter I'm\nReading the summary then says as a result of the Supreme Court decision in two thousand Fifteen relating to municipal regulations on signs\nOr the city council adopted presidents current sign regulations in two thousand sixteen inch to ensure the city land development code conform with the constitutional protections of free speech this was a revision two the two thousand three\nA land development code signed regulations and was the result of the staff research\nOther unified code committee and planning and zoning commissions meeting a subsequently to that the city council raised concerns about the revise regulations including sign regulation size on individual temporary science and permits and sign size and temporary commercials signs\nWhich have resulted in a council a motion for a moratorium on enforcement of the existing LDC regulations for temporary sign so we have a lot of things going on out there is a guy that's been putting up signs for a long time I would say you\nOkay he got a few things you know this is really complicated and then it's a than a saga I'm working this thing through um there was a period of time or the city had opted to use the right of way I'm a square footage to actually go down the side of virtually every street in the city\nIncluding my cul de sac and such and claimed that is right of way\nWell that is what got set aside um with the Gilbert decision on the Supreme Court\nRight and so then then the shitty backed away and said okay [noise] um they came forward again and they had this idea that OK I'm you're gonna have to register your science I think and then you can only have one signing your property only be so big and you have to pay or um to have the sign\nOn your property will that cause problems for guys that had property they were selling whereas if they want us to promote a candidate but the ad for sale sign on there\nThey would have to take the for sale sign on there and the candidate would have to pay to put a sign on the property\nSo so I'm a few people came together and we talked to a city the city folks\nThen it would have to pay to put a sign on the property\nSo so I'm a few people came together and we um talked to a city the city folks\nAnd they said you know we're going to we're going to put a moratorium on that altogether\nAnd then they the other thing that plays into this is the the city funding or does not have the uh we lost Mike and now we have windy over at the code enforcement and Mike I'm and windy used to actually it was Mike and I can't remember other name Robin or something like that\nAnd um so so you got Wendy she was answering the phone that Mike went on to other things and when he took over\nAnd and I work with Wendy I work with Mike I call it might just say look if you if you have any problems with my science call me I'll go right away and take them down\nAnd they've actually called me for other people's signs and I'm gone and taken 'em down because they were Republicans and I was able to talk to them so we don't have anybody to enforce 'em and so right now it's my understanding of the state came out with the with the rules saying that on state highways they're going to it's going to be a we have to contact you first\nBefore we take the sign down which was a change that used to just take the science down and we're the city was concerned there had to be a complaint against that sign okay I had a complaint against one of my signs it was blocking somebody's view of the road was an obstruction issue I went right\nThere they were so stunned I actually went to their house knocked on the door apologizing invited me and we spent forty five minutes just talking we were we were of opposite political persuasion but they were so impressed that the city has got me down there and I gave the city credit\nI said I said the other one is that called me and uh they said well we're going to call the city I should do that please do that\nSo that they know that they can do this if the right people are putting up signs but not everybody will do that\nSome people will just blow you guys off and just say well you guys will have to just take it down you know\nAnd so uh so as it stands right now Steve this is science that are now are only up there because we don't have the capability we don't have the people\nTo enforce the current cold which is that you're not supposed to be in the city right away and that is a certain measurement that comes off the sidewalk or off the middle of the street depending upon if he got a sidewalk or middle of the street and so\nI'm poor when he you know I finally called her and she says what are you going to do and she you know I just told me this is all I can do I've got some of the other things going so into the city which is doing a good job\nI finally called her and she says what are you going to do and she just told me this is all I can do I've got so many other things going on to the city which is doing a good job of taking up paying down the CSP are asked I personally feel that you guys did a great job on that I did not expect it but you did\nAnd so [noise] time comments where you could hire another code enforcement person\nThen maybe you'll be able to uh uh enforce jak better but as it stands right now when you didn't have a chance because these people come up from Phoenix [noise] and they have no idea what are ... are they don't care\nI just called I called each city okay what's your cold you know and I have a little city college because I Do all of you have a pike county and a little bit down in northern Maricopa and uh so it it helps to know that there's a guy or even the people at Prescott valley she said nobody calls us\nA call somebody and asked if I could put it on their property next year the first person whoever call [noise]\nAnd so there's to me I Would I Would write a short paper on science signage etiquette when it comes to political science\nWell I'll tell you what any forty going any further um I appreciate everything you've done and everything that you do out there for the folks that you represent and certainly you're making money by putting those signs up uh in the city did let this thing this jak Leonard so so to speak\nOr get run over by a by a big ... all of a ... Molina a because there's nobody that's in forcing any of the city codes so I Would say to you how would you like to have a job as a couldn't force or\nYou know I asked Wendy ... I I Know I Know the coyotes [laughter]\nWell I I Am saying that I'm seeing that tongue in cheek but I Will tell you know with the onset of a poor for three being passed and that's not being so hamstrung\nFor our our money tax money we do need and and I hope everybody out there sees the disaster that's taking place during this political season we were ever saying\nYeah we need to have people that are employed by the city of Prescott that take care of the laws and when you can't take care of the laws then why have them because you can enforce them and the bottom line to this is Pete and I was very serious about what I said at some point in time I've already told the city attorney\nOr as well as the city manager when it comes to budget time I'm going to guarantee or we're going to prove at least one or two could unfortunate people we cannot have this liberation of nonsense again within our community\nTime I'm going to guarantee you were going to prove at least one or two code fortunate people we cannot have this ... nonsense again within our community\nThat's just a ... it's um I've never seen it this way David to and you write about it being pretty clear downtown it's kind of a sacrosanct saying down there and that's why I didn't put any it back up on the Christians and a lot because I thought you know why they need to be there\nAnd thank you for that I mean there there are some places where I mean if you have private property I I can put a sign up\nI in my yard as says I'm a jerk I vote and and this is my son and I don't like anything about politics I can put whatever sign I Want to open my private property but when you start putting stuff up in the city right away and it's major by a lot of different things and you got to understand and I think you do as as well as anybody\nOr that most places along side of the road behind the sidewalk is going to be city property and there are signs everywhere and nobody's regulating it and frankly as far as I'm concerned I'm tired of seeing\nThat property downtown is private property and we do keep it back off what might be considered the right away\nBut still um you know if they were having they were having affairs and all this stuff and they were using that law so it just it just became too much but yeah I I agree I started seeing them up and down willow creek and places I'd never seen before that were show absolute\nSo we're talking about science and we're talking we got thirty seconds left and we're talking about a study session tomorrow then includes a discussion of the signs are you going to be in city hall talking about um tomorrow\nI certainly could be\nI Would love you to stand up and talk about a ... in the city and based upon how long you been doing it I think the council needs to have some dialogue\nThat city manager get asked me to come in when you guys are ready to talk to all the time it I'll see you tomorrow or one o'clock ...\nO'clock in the news for the short break stay with

be part of your day and I find it interesting there's always so much to talk about and\nYou know one of the things to talk about one of the things that have been up there in the air and I read it when I got back from the great state of California last night was the uh the uh a publication that I received at home\nThat had the ... I guess the candidates said they would support the election and who they would in would not support it was very interesting in a a challenge people to read what they had to say about each one of the\nFolks running for election I found that very interesting and I'm sure you will as well I'm also you know a lot of things going on at the city are also in that same paper I read or I guess it was Saturday or the number of people that\nThey called out or at the deals event they called out like six hundred people and I saw a live feed of uh the progress and the things that were happening out there and if there were six hundred people out there they must have been very small ... because I saw about two or three hundred people\nAnd I I Want to make it very clear I Believe in the future they granted deals will become\nA regional park and maybe even the Arizona State park I Believe the granted deals is a very special place a for a lot of special people to go out and enjoy themselves whether it be bird watching or whether it be bicycling or riding your horse or walking in enjoying a beautiful\nUh for a lot of special people to go out and enjoy themselves\nWhether it be bird watching or whether it be bicycling or riding your horse or walking and enjoying a beautiful out cropping Iraq something that you've never seen or something there won't be duplicated again in the future uh I support granted deals a hundred percent\nUm but I Want you to be aware that that property is publicly owned\nAnd the best thing that we can do as a city and as a city council and as citizens is wait until the dialogue unfolds with their private property owner and the city of Prescott\nRather than chastised the city of Prescott city council and I got to tell you very frankly I'm tired of listening to it that the city council has done nothing the city council has done more about saving the deals\nThis city council and passed city council\nAnd I will say one more time again and then I Know you're going to get tired of hearing it but the truth sometimes hurts\nBack in the day when we had an open space and wrote tax there was a group of people in the open space alliance that wanted to purchase forty six point whatever the number was forty two point five million dollars to buy glass hill and the ... mountain and\nBonded those were the two properties that they wanted to save because you could see 'em from everywhere well lo and behold two ... and as well as myself said no that is not the direction we're going in the details are the most prominent places that we can save\nA we went back we restructured are open space folks out there and ask him to uh put together a different list that had to do with something was more meaningful I'm back in that day in Nineteen Ninety eight Ninety nine ah we we actually purchased watched it in and we'll like\nNot only for water for ... for recreation a across the board and since then\nWe have purchased over two hundred acres of land\nAnd the granite deals area over the past many years all to preserve the beauty of granted deals and for some people out there to want to chastise and criticize the city council for not doing anything\nI take great offense to that so when they want to start beating me to death I Will take them to test\nAnd criticize the city council for not doing anything I take great offense to that so when they want to start beat me to death I Will take them to task every chance I get and what I read articles\nThat say that the city council is not doing enough I Would tell them take out a petition and run for city council\nAnd a half those people that were at that rally\nAnd I give them credit for being there don't even live in the city of Prescott I support the people in the city of Prescott that's who I was voted in\nThat's how I was a potent in it as a representative government you vote for people to represent you\nOn all difficult issues or simple issues within the city to be your voice out there and when somebody wants to take on a the council and say you're not doing enough\nI suggest to them that maybe instead of being negative that they buy some roses and take out a petition NGOs started collecting their signatures let's go to Allen line one hello al\nHow're you doing\nYourself I'm wonderful I'm just ranting and raving over here\nThe fun to do I like about what's on your mind\nThat phone there's no ...
