I had a good experience all\nThe ... cost involved and it's and they was fifty dollars so bad I I Believe that the instructors were not page don't quote me on that I Believe that fifty dollars was mostly for the ammunition and for um the refreshments they gave us so it was mostly volunteers who were teaching us so if you want to join us the toll free number\nEight fifty five four fifty free like freedom we continue CJ is on the line listening I'm not sure somewhere on the Internet CJ go ahead with your thoughts\nYeah from the ah I'm actually listening lie a lot from the ... in our studio or I've style casting guy show on on my network\nBut also you've asked for that\nYeah oh you know what I forgot that you that email I'll I'll do that make sure you have are I Wonder your type of a perfect yeah ...\nYeah ... yeah I was calling because um because I was talking to work high on the board um seller and out of this court today [laughter] and he accused me of being a coward\nBecause he made the leap to call in here by a quote unquote heroes a minister prevent and Mr ... and\nAnd get it get my belt and em I guess on the phone simultaneously like ... to Britain may live hair\nOrient or because I banned them so ah he's banned for three months for listeners who aren't familiar this guy he's talking about James uh is basically a nut job who has been calling in with actual threats of violence he used to kind of beat around the Bush and he wouldn't actually come right out and\nLike threatened violence he'd say things like sure would be a shame if your house burned down you know that kind of thing\nAnd uh in India and he's actually gotten into just coming right out and and doing straight violent threats like you know going to you know murder you and buster\nPlus you're up against the pavement and you know all kinds of of you know violence\nAnd so it was getting to the point where some of the co host on the show uh Darryl was taking his headphones off mark a was like not responding at all and uh and so we had to Institute a new rules saying there will be no threats are on the air here on free talk club and we we don't have a whole lot of rules on ...\nNot responding at all and uh and so we had to Institute a new rules saying there will be no threats are on the air here on TALK loud I mean we we don't have a whole lot of rules\nOn free talk live in a and I let it go for a very very long time but I told James that if he makes another threat a and a ... or insults because again he'll sometimes we'll just call up and and just straight up insult to host and it's like come on\nCall about something real and ah so I told him that and then he of course immediately insulted somebody right after I told him no more of that and so CSPAN for three months I'm Sorry he cannot call in at the same time as you\nOr we will not be doing in a conference calling with a with James with but he as you know he is there\nA he's still allowed in our chat server so we have a special room set aside for him or we created it just for him it's called the toxic users don't it's not it's not safe for work um and so if you want to talk with James with that's definitely the best place to do it but CJ others don't you want to go ahead\nNo it's just interesting that games are would've caught actually only call the hour for not calling him he didn't tell me that the reason why you haven't been taking it causes 'cause he was bad\nWhich are only over the last few days that's all he got banned last week so he hasn't been banned for very long\nOkay it wasn't just yesterday that it happened so it's really interesting that he didn't mention that I I think that's really interesting that he can call me what our handle on the uh what's your hand on a disk word oh it's my handle a part of our man hey thanks for the call tonight we're coming up it's talk less here is that\nThat's the sound of a house being trashed while the gang of these ransacked [noise]\nAnd what they don't steal will be destroy\nEach year resolve not to be the next victim of a break and go to the TV dot com and discover a device that create the illusion someone inside he's watching TV even your miles away security as a mindset and the TV should be part of your security solution be vigilant but not fearful think TV dot com\nOr when you use public why here's an identity nice see anything you do on line\nBears and photos your Web history even your password\nAnd then you know one side tries to attack the other side and then the other side takes over it attacks the it's just a constant cycle of abuse\nWell seeing what I saw last week in Portland at what happened this week as no surprise\nReally and you know I'm not a bit of a big advocate for\nPolice you know taking over anything but they really needed to stop with MTV was doing because then the there was harassing strangers bystanders on the streets and you watch it and I saw a lot of commentators saying people aren't going to put up with this\nPeople are going to put a stop to this and so this is no surprise and once again I don't condone violence at all but this is not unexpected using exactly\nWhat we thought what happened you were saying the the right wing group coming out in response isn't a surprise\nWas exactly exactly some something was going to happen because people are watching men and tape it was doing and saying why aren't the police stopping them\nDo you think it's true the because I've heard this said and I don't know if it's true but do you feel like it's true that people are more polarized today in the United states than they were ten years ago\nYeah actually Tim Pool did a really good video on this and he was drawing some are looking at a steady I think it was by the Pew Research center but I'm not a hundred percent sure but it was showing that\nThe left and the right ... like ten Twenty years ago or actually had more in common than not uncommon but they've been moving further and further apart\nSo yes it it has changed and I think there's a lot more violence now than there was before actually Jonathan height said last week he had an interview with Shapiro and he said that he now believes a civil war is possible he's not saying it's likely to have been saying that for a long time I got a lot of years ago\n[laughter] I I stand by it do you think it's going to happen I think I think is more likely now than it was them which we and what frauds\nThat's that's the problem\nWell here's you know I don't know that it's going to be a big civil war between half of the country and another half of the country I think what's gonna happen is we're going to have insurgencies were going to have small groups of people\nWho are going to do a lot of damage in fact we're starting to see that already that's what this is it over and Portland is just the beginning of it and those insurgencies once they begin once they start getting more and more violent that's a very hard to stop\nYou think they're going to target I mean if you're talking about an surge\nIt's just the beginning of it and those insurgencies once they began when they start getting more and more violent that's a\nVery hard to stop who do you think they're going to target I mean if you're talking about an insurgent group are they going to go you know attack a gun club or are they going to attack the government or like who is it that they're going to be in surging\nAgainst it depends on what they're angry about the man who they are blaming for whatever the issue whatever group at the moment exactly exactly and you'll see it well you know\nBack I use I went I sorry I Lived for a year and Dell fast in Northern Ireland at the very end of the Nineteen eighties when the war is still going on there so you had the IRA fighting the UPS you know and so they were mostly fighting with each other but sometimes you know people would get caught in the ... so we could be looking at

agree with republic right though\nRight well so that one of the things that we kind of tried to ah express here on TALK lives that there's more to sort of the political pet paradigm or spectrum than just left or right or middle so for instance you know if I were to tell you that I'm In favor of full drug legalization\nBut also in favor of full gun legalization does that mean I'm In the middle or does that mean on both on the far right and the far left at the same time like what does that I think\nI think I think what I Would say that means to me is one of those issues I can agree with you I Would throw it into the trash can\nBut which it is so therefore I ... I'm just going to predict which is you you you were then which as you and throwing the trash and so you would agree with guns freedom but you wouldn't agree with the freedom to put in your body what

all these new fees that show up and if the prices down like it's kind of being a little bit this year than it's the hardcore bitcoin owners who are they're the ones that you can count on every single time the programmers\nOr the you know the marketers the people who are who are in this through the thick and thin so the kind of the the the atmosphere of these conferences changes based on what's

recognize people and meet new people Texas bitcoin conference dot com\nWe'll see you there as we continue here Kelly is still on the line with us in Missouri You were calling for an original reason we never even got to but you were talking about some kind of point you're trying to make a point about uh the ballot box or whatever a moment ago and I wanted to make sure you had a chance to do to get to that and hopefully we can get to your original comments since since we sort of went off the track\nI Would just say what the ballot box is concerned you know it really it really gets under my skin it happened and burgers and um and it happened and the and in in California when I used to travel on beach for a company I used to work or\nYou know the inner cities and where the metropolitan areas are out east and a lot of them out west\nYou know the same thing that they're blaming\nI'm white people and and and different colored black people when they're when they're blaming that we are society breakdown\nI look at who's been running those cities are guarding those areas for years and years and it gets under my skin because they because they they wanna blame they want to blame it and and kinda make all of these Bob right wing people look like\nThey are nothing more than\nThat KKK and walking around and do it all of that but there are people out of here in southwest Missouri that are hard working people whether they're white black whatever but we don't seem to have a problem there isn't anybody or parading around and the crops in my field and\nBut there are people out here in southwest Missouri that are hard working people whether they're white black whatever and we don't seem to have a problem there isn't anybody or parading around and the crops in my field and there is no one coming down the road and there's no but when they can get under the limelight of of of uh\nCNN and Fox and all the other places I blaming right left and everything but they can get their bashful exposure of media which media has been driving driving this\nThis raid of a of an evil of our country at a riot but it's about ready to begin to put a civil war hey eating this narrative ever since they could and\nKnocked out by the I like him or he was only elected president and he is elected by the country and and I think you may be a great with me I just\nWonder well he was hit by a minority of the country I mean every president has always elected by a minority rights do they ... out of the people are voting\nOr it's only about half of the flu you know potential voters are voting and then only about half of them actually vote for the winter you talking about he's not a mandate you're talking about maybe a quarter of the population\nOf the country but either way you know might doesn't make right and uh people voting for thing doesn't make it okay whether we're talking about Donald Trump or whether we're talking about Barack Obama or whether we're talking about an ordinance banning guns or an ordinance banning you know possession of a pipe or whatever it doesn't\nYou know it's not okay for me to tell you how to live your life in and force my viewpoint on you with violence and it is still not okay if I find ten of my friends to come with guns in point them at you until you got to do your you know live your life this way and it doesn't matter if it's fifty one percent\nOf any given areas population it's still not okay\nWell I totally agree with you but you know carry a big thing I I agree with a few things that you said there I actually do I think you're right ... upon violence doesn't produce anything dialogue produces Congress station which can produce something but here's what I Would say as well\nThat that unless somebody wants to do away with the electoral college which we've never been able to do unless anybody wants to take the constitution and throw it out the window\nWell more stuff and we didn't get a chance because what a great idea let's get rid of the entire federal government can we do that\nWell that that's something that you can do as long as they keep running the narrative that they're running or they're trying to\nSee them or have your support and we agreed on the experiment ... secession Missouri seed New Hampshire should secede we should have\nHave your support and we agreed the experiment and because it's the session Missouri seed New Hampshire should secede we should have fifty different countries what are you still\nThat we're going to be voting thing that you can see what are the costs about that\nYou know like I was actually no you can't do it under the constitution because there's no exit clause there is no because you know\nThat was that the voting going on recently to try to see from the from the California trial they light up very\nDodgy students are no in building that and California the three thing didn't make it to the ballot because the Supreme Court intervened and so while the other hand\nWhat again if it did make it to the ballot you could vote on it you could be what he what we are in a country I mean whether we like it or not this country it\nOr it's not just an imaginary ... okay so they wouldn't believe whatever you want and Kelly thank you for the call it was a good one I really appreciate the discussion\nUm you can believe whatever you want I mean he said we're in a country well if enough people believe in that idea then yeah OK then it's real to you\nUm to me it's just a imaginary lines on a map that were drawn by people who have long since died it's pretty real when you cross the border sure there are men with you There God and there are men with guns who firmly believe in the idea of the nation states\nYeah understood that last a couple of weeks ago I had to hand this guy this this Blue Book with my picture in it and was this a Niagara didn't go to yeah yeah yeah\nI came I well I'm going I'm coming back was actually it took thirty seconds but really it was harder to get into Canada and to come back you know that's unusual most of the time the story is the reverse that it's harder to come back on it is to have nearly no issue with customs they seemed totally and interested in me\nDespite the fact that you created homeland stupidity and [laughter] we don't know if that didn't pop up on their uh their their profile of you so yeah I've been so no this is a bigger concept right Laurel the idea that the nation state is just a pure fantasy and that if people stopped believing in that they would go away\nYeah but you could say that about just about anything and culture you can certainly say it about money you could say it about horse you could yeah I just you know the roads why are we all driving on the same side of the road just everybody agrees that that's the correct side\nThere are things that are people agreed to because they're a good idea like driving on the same side of the row however that different from having a federal government well it's a terrible idea\nCorrect side well there are things that uh people agreed to because they're a good idea\nLike driving on the same side of the row however that different from having a federal government well it's a terrible idea\nThat that's an idea any government whether they be a federal or state government is nothing more than an excuse for people you don't know to use violence and the threat of violence against him that's all it is the government is nothing more than a group of criminals criminals thugs or who have successfully managed to fool people into thinking\nThat there's something more that there's something more special\nThan what they are which is just to uh you know very successful criminal gangs is working on it though if you want to kind of you're certainly welcome to although we've got actually a load of calls so we've got to get to that to your own thoughts You're welcome for example\nI ever wonder helping going in a theory him were

I don't remember the name\n[laughter] that was in regards to the gun laws are done right comparable to um lower able to do with our ah our bodies are like oh yeah that we are a body feel free to write a\nYeah I just kind of want to touch on something on guard that you're out in this guy you know kind of coming back with them a good point about you know if you if you've ever drinking or ... or anything regrettable um yeah and and and and I get where he's coming from either find myself\nUm but I just want to say like if the worst thing that my son does if he grows up to do is look marijuana might think I'm fine with that\nI think I'm absolutely okay with that because there's nothing wrong with it I think there is a ... and I was one of those people just like him I grew up on it I don't do it myself really um but I grew up and\nAh my whole family did it a lot a lot of my friends and I stayed away from it because the government taught me that it was bad and so I grew up with an ... mindset about right now as I'm as I'm older you know points that\nI realized that it now but I actually tried it myself um that it's not it's actually not as bad as they say that that you know like those commercials a grown up by\nWhere they would say you know you would do it to somebody last week or [laughter] you weren't afraid it all those other crazy like ... a night color goes down and we all remember like\nThose lose your brain on this is your brain on drugs yeah that is actually\nYeah this is your brain when you're smoking like marijuana and I believe that I one hundred percent\nBut we ... a lot of us did become alive as yet\nBecause that's what that's what you know the government\nExactly yeah this is your brain when you're smoking like marijuana and I believe that I one hundred percent but we learned a lot of us to become a lot of us yeah\nBecause that's what that's what you know they got into it like that they they told hey it was bad but we believe that it was bad and then we we criticize the people that did it like a you know that is not a legal that's that's horrible don't do that\nBut you have these people that are doing a lot worse saying you know like like math or or things for their their intact they saying that you can actually get a ticket you would think that could actually kill you\nOr things like well people can get addicted to a lot of things like I can easily get into a habit of eating ice cream every single night man it is so good uh you know so so there's a lot of things you can get addicted to in this world or some of which are more deleterious to your health than other now I Want ice cream\nI Do actually [laughter] if you'd like according to the office in the freezer um\n[noise] but ah Ryan so yeah so you've opened your mind who was it that are introduced to that got you to try cannabis after all these years of view believing it was bad 'cause somebody had to change your mind on that right\nNow I'm ... more [noise] um I actually I I I'm the youngest out of a out of\nYou know three three kids um [noise] and my oldest brother was actually you know the you know he did it but you it's like I don't want you to do and I you know you don't need to be doing this type thing by middle brother on the other camp but like you know I'm going to I'm going to pay you like we're going to go ahead we're going to destroy your innocence with\nAnything that I Try you're going to go and try and um I think the first time I did I was about a Fifteen\nUm and it was just like not not a bad experience but it wasn't like it would I Would say or whatever I didn't really enjoy it but I Know with like you know hey I did at one time I got in trouble for it\nI never doing it again and you know I didn't do it until recently about last year oh wow [noise] yeah and that was that was when it officially a kind of hit me and I was like you know what and and I do it maybe once a month you know\nAnd and but it it it took me so long to when it 'cause I I Would\nCastaway family and friends after so long because of that on to the point where\nAnd and this is the point of getting to like you know people will will say hey well drinking alcohol it fine if you're over the age of Twenty one because guess what legal\nHow many how many people have died\nFrom I'm from ... ... my oldest brother alcoholism rate do was not\nWhat what is your typical like if he's got all I Love to drink\nLove to drink and drink and it just it killed his liver and he\nHe passed away\nWhat what is your typical like alcohol I Love to drink love to drink and drink and it it actually it just it killed at labor and eat\nAway all the way he was he was thirty\nThirty years old that's rule will argue that they're blue in the face\nSaying oh alcoholic part because the government that by\nWow yeah I Do people don't really believe that this does that yeah it's I don't believe so ... ... that's ridiculous\nLike people because it's illegal that will that will be the way it'll shut it away\nYeah people won't like me I used to be that kind of person you know I used to be that person was like hey government that we don't do it and what people need to go through phases\nAnd understand for themselves and make that decision\nAnd open their mind because\nWhen I did I was like oh you know I'm not going to do this every day by right there's absolutely no like this isn't what I was taught at all like\nYeah I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't do son LSD every single day but a few times to you know here and there are now and then you you times a year maximum I mean it's for me at my spiritual experience\n... exactly that's what I mean you know and I try to think that the other great experience is that the government would probably say hey you know that that you get caught you know we're going to we're going to get in trouble\nYou know like I I'd experiment which room and\nI don't know anybody that had ever been angry like I had the best time in my life like I I was happy I like everything in my brain with Pete I just I ...

new facility is going to be built in fact the report also mentions interestingly enough that wind generation produces more heat from the turbans\nOf than anybody ever ever believed they did um they studied the existing fifty seven thousand wind turbans around the country\nAs well as the eleven hundred and fifty solar plants that are in operation\nAnd found that the what they called the power density the amount of energy generated per area of the plant\nWas about a hundred times lower than the estimates are had been when they the plans were built so they're not a very efficient land to use\nThat study also included a statement that over the next ten years when power actually has more a negative climate impact than using coal or gas because of the heat that the turbans produce some ...\nPower actually has more a negative climate impact\nThan a using coal or gas because of the heat that the turbans produce less there's the energy required to build the darn thing to manufacture them to hand the and the new employee eased demand them and to keep them keep them going they have a nasty habit of or\nBreaking a break and blades and catching fire of not just spectacular fire if you've ever seen one learn it yeah it's a really something in\nThe study went on to conclude that replacing present day us power consumption\nWould require covering fully one third of the continental us with wind farms\n[laughter] after I heard on one third\nThe damn harbored right yes of all places and uh they concluded that that that would claw cause more climate warming than we currently experience so all things to consider when you discuss mandates for new new plants and the new construction\nAnd of course in on the solar side of that there's the fact that all those solar panels are a manufactured in China right now and maybe we need to build a plant to make them here in this country for going to use them for ... electricity rather than importing them all from\nFrom China they're expensive too or they are yeah they are indeed\nAnd uh that's why everybody's got 'em on their roof because they were subsidized [laughter] hey can I buy them now you have to have to lease them I guess government money to charity it's free sure man oh\nOh and then there's a and there's one twenty six proposition one twenty six\nWhich uh takes an a power that the legislature currently has away from the legislature they've uh held that power and never exercised it since statehood\nAnd that's the that's a proposition to amend the constitution to prohibit ah ever living a sales tax on services in the state\nAnd the reason or the proposition came up was because there has been um talk over the last couple of years ah that the state income tax\nCame up was because there has been um talk over the last couple of years\nAh that the state income tax could be eliminated if the sales tax were extended to cover\nA services so it would be nice if that proposal was on the ballot as a companion so people could choose which they preferred sure you know unfortunately uh that isn't isn't out there but uh that's been\nThat's the reason that one twenty six got a got put on there is to prevent\nA the sales tax from ever being placed on services even though it would have the side benefit of eliminating the state income tax\nAnd sure and you know the the world is going a bit more away from production of goods to production of services and uh the goods taxes are always going to start dropping information technology yeah all those kinds of things that\nThat are outside the outside the brick and mortar system you know it's a user pay thing or or do you want a system based on income where you know some dollars are treated differently than other dollars a because there's more of them are because of where they come from\n... well if they limited one tax to start another one that we're still you know tax for tax\nWell yeah I Do prefer getting rid of a few of them any way and getting rid of a few of the programs that the state or the take the federal government a lot of those programs they run a don't have any purpose I mean there's there's things that are going on and have been for\nA hundred years members of the old ah telephone tax yeah that'll excise tax and ... placed on telephone services was originally put there to finance the Spanish American war and that that finally went away what ten twelve years ago\n[laughter] finally that they paid for the war of the time I have a I think\nI think so so you know it's a it keeps on it keeps on going in the death and taxes and taxes seem to be a immortal\nAnd for rental and they didn't parental parental Revenue Service I think that's what they're known as a now in\nRevenue Service yeah kinda kinda wonder and of course that that's been responsible for all the growth of of government over the last hundred years since they since they initially improved the approved the constitutional amendment to provide for in\nOf governmental the last hundred years since the\nSince they initially improved the approved the constitutional amendment to provide for an income tax in the first place the more money you give them more money they spend and the the ... more\nPrograms and projects they they seem to in the event that income taxes for the progressive nature of the income tax has never made a lot of sense to me um remember way back when there were thirty some different tax brackets\nAnd you'd get a raise and all of a sudden you'd take home less money because it bumped into another tax break I remember that that was maddening oh\nFortunately that went away but but it doesn't make sense that uh one dollar is treated differently than any other dollar which is of course the impetus behind the flat tax\nRates are going to pay an income tax everybody ought to pay the same percentage why why penalize some are based on these are the source of their income or the amount of it doesn't doesn't make a lot of sense and that's a debate we can have\nCertainly and continue to have both are in the state and nationally as we look at a\nIncome taxes and just how to how to how to operate the government we continue to expect more and more from it and become less and less satisfied with it as we're asking it to do things that it was never designed to you're not getting much of a return on our investment our way not in a lot of cases and we certainly are not\nAnd that's going to hit us toward the bottom of the hour here on the news one of three point five FM fourteen Ninety A. M. K. why you see a glad to have you with us this morning [noise]\nGive us a call at five four one one zero one six we'd be glad to hear from you and a dusty Baker and I will be back after this news break these missing from our sponsors [noise]\nEven if you take a couple of wrong turns and American family we know your car is more than four wheel is they get from point a to point B it's also freedom to pursue the things important to you which is why you want to make sure you have the proper protection to learn more get a quote contact me today Steve Joanna at seven seven five zero one seven five American\nFamily ensure rather than\nAmerican children ...

M. K. Y. C. A. glad to have you with us\nGive us a call five four one one zero one six we'd be glad to hear from you\nAbout where we left off going through some of the propositions let's hit the other two real quick we have\nThree or five and a three oh six both on the ballot as well or the first proposes to extend the existing state school tuition voucher program a naturally that's posed by the teachers union by the public education establishment but that's out there for years\nState to school tuition voucher program a naturally that's posed by the teachers union by the public education establishment but that's out there for your consideration\nThrill six is really kind of the interesting one um it's an attempt to solve a problem that has come to light in the ... state public financing of campaigns the clean elections program if you will\nA candidate to choose to participate received public financing for their campaigns ah the proposition would prohibit it what came to light as a fairly common practice a number of candidates had been doing this\nUh they would save up the taxpayer financed dollars\nThroughout their campaign and then at the end of the campaign they would donate those to either their political party or two particular lobbying groups I'm number of them in the past have done just that basically that amounts to giving taxpayer dollars\nEither to the political party or to the lobbying groups that taxpayers may or may not even support 'em\nSo that that proposition would end up in that practice\nA unaddressed in the proposition is another problem with that system candidates ... have been known to hire family members or a good friends or to manage the campaign and then put them on\nA large salaries are so that the taxpayer dollars stays in in the house if you if you want a that's been a problem too uh but uh that isn't addressed in the proposition but the\nContributions to political parties and lobbying groups\nAs after after the fact we have a caller on the line and need to go right to Pete and good morning good morning Pete thanks for calling\nShane shower you they were here [laughter] [noise]\nI Know it's better than that for you [laughter] it's like come on\nLet's see if I wanted to just talk a little bit about to go get get his ad on David Stringer I don't know if she know that she was putting some stuff out there about David being um you know for the decriminalization of heroin and all this other crazy stuff\nKnow that he was putting some stuff out there about David being a um you know for the decriminalization of heroin and all this other crazy stuff and we look he's just one of these loans just goes right he's the left fringe a that goes along with some Garcia and a cinema\nDavid is not for a decriminalization and go get had actually apologize and take that down and and I've got a proof of of the actual conversation between him and the guy who made him take it down so I just wanted this just wanted to get that out\nThere to tell you I'll tell you when it comes to a campaign ads it's probably not wise to try to judge your candidate on the basis of what the opposition might be saying about um probably works both ways but\nYeah yeah I just I just I just heard and I just got back into town and [noise] and the ... century all morning and her dad who thought what the heck you know and so anyway you know David ... is a you know he's just a good conservative guy who's a he's working on a criminal justice reform\nAnd he's trying to help keep a kid she would do something stupid from getting a felony so that they can't get a job for the rest of their life I mean that's that's the under ... you know the the cliff notes of criminal justice reform is all about is just\nTrying to keep these kids from getting felonies are at an early age to Arizona's really tough our laws are really tough\nAnd um he's just he's just working with the Trump is involved in all this to he's totally into this criminal justice reform and so I've got to go next trying to make it sound like David is you know what I mean kids to be able to go out there and get marijuana stuff so that that's not the case and uh I just wanted to\nLet everybody know that other than that hey\nI'm sure I'm up I'm sure he appreciates the non paid political in [laughter] right [laughter] okay I appreciate it nine here last night for the\nThanks for the call a one more thing on the propositions a lot of people ask about a numbering system and why they have different numbers\nAnd some are in one sequence summer in another one hundred series questions are proposed constitutional amendments and now he's those can either come out of the legislature or through the initiative process to hunt\nProposed constitutional amendments and now he's those can either come out of the legislature or through the initiative process to hundreds and there are none this year those would be from the initiative process solely and to create new laws\nThe three hundred is like the ones we're looking at\nUh our new laws proposed a has referred by the legislature settled the different sources of the propositions is why they carry\nA different numbers anyway there is a lot to think about it and to consider so with your ballots in hand or at least on the early voting\nAnd make sure you take time study up rather than like we say rely on all been the ads you might see particularly are the ones from the opposition telling you what you are ... they think the new law might do or or who they think might be the better candidate\nElections that create laws like these are really are critical because of the long range impact the laws and the changes might have\nThe voter's guide and the information uh magazines that they send out have been very healthy\nHuge this year a lot you ought to think about because the implications particularly the propositions right there are there new laws to we'd be operating under and and make a lot of significant change\nAnd it's more than just looking to see who supports it yeah yeah you really have to get the facts on a Saturday Night a Martian I sat down and we we spent a good hour and a half ago and reading and going over it and marking our ballots in there in the mail\nYeah there you go okay well that's probably a good time to shake off all this complicated stuff and turn to our ... you can't make this stuff up for today always or a relief to see and find a little humor in the world\nHasn't been a good three years for Dylan Mick Williams of Grand Junction Colorado

in Prescott, Arizona and by the way if you're one of the folks like I Am that don't pay your taxes when you're supposed to pay pay 'em in April April fifteenth and you take out an extension until October Fifteen\nToday would be October fifteenth\nSo if you have an extension on your taxes and you have not sent them in and taking care of him I Would suggest that you do so or probably be fined pretty heavily with penalties and all that kind of stuff going on so I have sent mine in and I will\nShare with you that I'll pay plenty of taxes and I'm proud to do that as a businessman in Prescott, Arizona let's go to line one ... out there ... there that's a good one to Steve how're you doing\nGood good how are you doing I'm doing well what's on your mind today\nWell I've pretty much decide and um how I'm going to vote in the election gone I'm I'm pretty much get a few years Don tickets proposition thrill five on on schools okay\nAnd I was wondering I Know sometimes you put out some recommendations thoughts on these things that I was wondering if you had any thoughts about which way to go on that\nI always have lots of thoughts and all\n[laughter] not Michael Michael and Michael's in a different level he's a he's a guy that dumb and doesn't have a well I'm going to say is probably more politically correct and I am but I'm the bottom line the thrill five I voted no on three o five you can vote however you want to\nEnd the Riyadh and the reason why I voted no on three o five it has to do with vouchers and has to do with\nUm the private sector and kind of the charter schools I have a real difficult time being a baby of the sector of\nOf public schools to know that the public schools have to provide\n'em you know transportation they have to provide a a meal program to folks out there they have to provide a activities they have to provide special instruction teachers for\nA special students were charter schools don't have to do that I'm In the only reason why I voted no not that I don't support charter schools because I Do I support the choice of people sending their students to where they want to go but\nBuddy out there that has a child\nOr a male or female child has an opportunity to take that child to that charter school and enroll him there it does not mean the cream of the crop that's a misnomer 'em by the far left to saying that public schools are failing and ... you know public schools are not feeling\nI got to tell you when I look around and look at all the people\nThat are doctors Dennis lawyers here in the city of Prescott every single one of those folks\nWent to school at Prescott high school\nAnd they're friends of mine they went to public school it just gives you different opportunity with a private school or and or a charter school to do different things and that should be left up to the parents now I totally agree and so therefore\nTo answer your question I like 'em all [laughter]\nIt's just they all have different dance and they all have different levels of parents wants to see their kids achievement so a bill for the call in five four one one or one six five four one one zero insects Michael Moore in the house glad to have him here and we have a couple of things that we need to talk about in things that are\nA so called on the hot seat or or just I guess people that are acknowledging the fact that there's change in Prescott one of them being the fact that you have\nThe say the deals group and save the deals through\nUm sometimes aggravates me and the fact that\nYou don't have to respond to this than I have to say it but to save the grew ... Dell's group aggravates me and the fact that I was on council in Nineteen Ninety eight when they open space initiative was passed\nAnd we had two different levels the left in the right or open space level one and two and they were different levels of what people wanted to do and we had an open may open space committee or folks out there the open space alliance and a lot of the people that were involved\nTrying to figure out what this money that we had set aside or we're going to bring in based upon the open space and roads tax how are we going to spend this money and people were clamoring about how do we do that\nWell okay so Tom pet it and Mrs Rovner\nThey wanted us to spin forty six point five million dollars right away my bonding that whole amount to by glass Spring Hill [noise] excuse me by glass for hill and click ... mountain and we wouldn't go for that and when Jim Lehrer ... got on council and\nTo buy glass spurt hill [noise] excuse me by glass ... mountain and we wouldn't go for that and when Jim Lehrer sin gun on council and I was on council we said we the\nMost important part of anything that has to do with open space is granted details we put granted deals on the list on the front burner\nIt was not unless one or listen to it wasn't thought of in ... when I brought that up and since then we have purchased I think close to twenty million dollars worth of open space it it's a tremendous amount of land\nMass hundreds and hundreds of acres you already secured and the bells and that doesn't mean that we're not going to try to negotiate with Arizona you go for more a good deal for the community but to say that there's this has been ignored or just said it to the council hasn't made an effort where the granted Dell's concerned is just disingenuous and not true\nAnd I think that's the part that bothers me the Prescott native and somebody on city council is a fact that people that want to save the details have made it seem like the council or is disingenuous and doesn't regard their comments now and that's not the case at all okay\nSpeaking of that and I for one one zero one six built pretty color we'll be right back\nTime and their grandkids but they are and I don't know how they don't drop dead of exhaustion frankly but I'm a public school awards outweigh the charter school towards more up\nWell I appreciate being part of the Republican women\nGroup out there that gives scholarships um work for the folks like you guys and also I'm being part of the county sheriff posse knowing that we give out right thirty thousand dollars every year\nAll these kids I call them young adults are are are moving on to a different world their parents may or may not be able to afford their higher education but I respect the fact that there's opportunities gain more money from these different groups and the kids\nAnd the young adults have to perform to that\nAre higher education but I respect the fact that there's opportunities again I'm more money from these different groups and the kids and the young adults have to perform for them money and thank you for being part of that\nWell thank you for all the support you give and my comment is you can bring your dog out here to granted oaks with us anytime you want to and I'm the cream will always rise to the time no matter what Barnett sense\nYou know I appreciate the thank you okay Bye bye bye okay we've got\nMichael Moore in the house bill pretty calling by four one one zero one six five four one one zero one six Michael one of the things we have coming up one of the things that we got chastised on a little bit is the fact that we have a hotel that wants to locate in the city ... they want to locate on the corner of showing the street and ...\nAnd we got chastised because the public didn't think there was an opportunity to comment on what the city of Prescott is trying to achieve in as far as I'm concerned\nUh when we brought up was the first blush of what was going
