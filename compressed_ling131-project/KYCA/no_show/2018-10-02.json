back here on the news fourteen Ninety morning report on Jason's on a lot of them I guess just on Devon ... who's the chief of the Prescott fire department and are done we want to look ahead the twenty ninth team just a little bit I Know we can't really speak to a\nParticular weather conditions we just know that we're always on the fire season and spring and summer and do people need to start thinking about defensible space now in the fall and looking ahead six months and maybe start making some preparations\nIs the perfect time to be thinking defensible space I don't know if you remember not but this year we got to a point where the fire danger was so high so fast that we knew that there was nothing we could do to change the buyer requests\nThis year we got to a point where the fire danger was so high so fast\nThat we knew that there was nothing we could do to change the environment we couldn't make it cooler and we couldn't bring in rain\nSo the only thing that we had working in our favor was fire prevention and ultimately fire prevention starts on each person's property there's the fire was programs you can go to ... dot org and it has his own approach it tells you what kinds of fuel to keep\nWithin ten feet of your house within thirty feet at your house within fifty feet of your house how to trim up\nYour trees so that fire that's on the ground can't get into the trees\nSpreading your Bush's apart from each other irrigate ing\nShrubs and decorative plants that are near your house cleaning out your gutters keeping your would pile away from your house not letting grasses grow underneath your what Beck's all of those things were going to have fires there is no doubt about it\nBut every one of those things decreases the potential for a fire to do as much damage to get onto your property and to damage your structure\nOn the Congress as bad as we've had structure fires that have started that because of continuous fuels low hanging branches trees up against the house grasses would piles of a light\nWe've had structure fires that have become wild land fires so the idea here is prevention is the only thing we really have because we can't change our topography we can't change that we're in the high desert we can change that we have low humidity's Hannah hot sun and the southwest went\nSo what we have to do is we have to prepare for the eventuality\nGoing to be a fire and break up the continuity of fuels and moves fuels away from our homes to decrease the amount of damage that a fire can do if it is in the area\nOkay so if anybody needs some information on this and of course they need to find out what else can they do to get more information\n[laughter] okay code red is a program that's available through yet by county sheriff's office or you can also go to the website for the accounting firm to reach the management and the nice thing about code red people are familiar with the idea of reverse nine one one where we could call and neighborhood through the nine one one system but since so few people have home phones\nThat really doesn't work that well anymore so code red as a way where you can register your cell phone and it will call you on your cell phone if there's an emergency anywhere near ... so that's one of the first things to do a one of the next thing you can do to get ready for the upcoming piracy\nPhone and it will call you on your cell phone if there's an emergency anywhere near so that's one of the first things to do a one of the next thing you can do to get ready for the upcoming fire season is go to fire wise dot org\nOr go to the national fire protection agency and you can look for things that you need to do like the county has a five piece program\nMake sure you have your pictures your paper money your prescriptions your pets are things that you need that are important to you for the future those are the things that you need to keep together in case you have a fire have already bag habit go bag has people that\nYou can call that can keep track of you in case there's a fire in your area so that we can know whether or not you've escaped all of these things this is the time of year to do it because by the time we get to\nThe spring when we're already going into fire restrictions and we're starting to have the fires\nThat's really too late and there there was a saying that came out from the out by county emergency management was taken a little wrong but I still love it\nAnd the thing was it's too late when told to evacuate well some people thought that what that meant was that you know once you're told to evacuate all is lost but that's not true there's a whole bunch of things that you can do\nIn preparation so that when you were told to evacuate you are ready so the idea that you can go on to the out by county emergency management\nYou can go to you have a pi fire wise dot org which is the Prescott area wild land urban interface conditions website you can sign up to have someone come out and assess your property and give you ... some things that you can do to decrease the possibility of a wild land fires damaging your house and you can spend this winter\nRemoving

years and they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they try to use protocol use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote they would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions\nAnd say you know this guy's taking us down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years on the way they went out that's

that is race class not class excuse me race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's ... who's running against by Kevin daily on a

guy but they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal and they're joining this new way but there are also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical

even one day and they're all like\nThey're all old white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nAt what Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat

the we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards\nIn uh in California there has to be female representation on public points at which point at which point I tweeted out though the Pacific islanders all Latinos and\nA black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be a lot of these boards on there and that's where all the decisions are made and so they want to mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look will be a Jew or through the gate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed and percentage fashion of the population\nThan there are so many different tribes with claims\nOf victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're going to have you're going to see a woman say what I Want to be in that bore because I'm not just a woman\nBut I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white\nTherefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on this war a war going down there and I don't know where the ultimate project for years but

got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump so the left will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans have been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have worth and that's the kind of a revolutionary messy at West and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interested or people that will be patronize wide government the title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics\nWe always have to have the after its identity politics but it's all progressive ... west\nIt doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have it wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison 'em and you're charged with sexual

about\nIt you know occasionally I have some landscape work done in my yard and this is a time of year where you go out and\nSupposedly fertilize it is for the winter and thank goodness um about Wednesday a every piece of education in my yard which is rather expansive with stuff now including the butterfly Bush's a grass all the garden areas in the front end up back were treated with ...\nChicken manure oh goodness it smell in my neighborhood light and I had a chicken ... store yeah must really love it I guess what since yesterday's rain and today's rain I can tell you who is love and it would be those plants that's right so there were well fertilized and well loved\nSpeak about will love Mr Erik Larson is our engineer or whether men and the guy that's\nOn top of the heap here and we have a rainstorm out there what's that going to do for us this week\nWell it's going to keep raining all through today and into tonight we've got a chance for some rain to continue into tomorrow\nThen scattered showers the end of the week is are all a courtesy of what is now a tropical depression Rosa formally tropical storm and before that hurricane rough it but yeah we should get a good amount of rain I don't know about the two to four inches that I keep hearing me and that could happen\nBut an inch or two I think it's very likely and uh yeah temperatures will stay down a bit then we'll have higher than the uh [noise] you know upper sixties maybe into the low seventies it's beautiful it's beautiful\nDay out there indeed it really is heavier umbrella or some kind of gear around you so you stay dry but I Will tell you that from my standpoint um I Believe I heard it started raining last night somewhere around eight o'clock at my house and it rained all I woke up like probably Fifteen twenty times with rain\nOn that side without causing the city of Prescott one penny\nAnd he will dedicate that to the city of Prescott as a conservation to the city as passive park area and also provide a trail head for trail had parking some twelve to Fifteen cars would be able to park and his development to access the trails [noise]\nSo I guess the reason why I'm bringing this up is that you didn't have this have\nCars would be able to park and his development to access the trails so I guess the reason why I'm bringing this up is that you didn't have to have a save the piece of granite\nFolks out there talking about saving some of a scar his property [noise] it was done by staff and by the owner knowing the beauty and the the idea of having that preserved and they did that with people and get it yeah so and so I guess the reason why I bring that up is the\nI don't know who owns Arizona Nico other than the namesake of the folks that everybody keeps talking about is Jason ... maybe the developer he may be a part principal owner I don't know if anybody else\nHas got their finger involved in it ah it just came to the city council here about a month ago not to the city Council on may ... it or a change that it came to the city of Prescott in the form of to the staff in public or development community development to have all the different departments start to look at\nSome of the things that are on Jason ... mind as well as whoever owns the property\nUm those things have not come to city council and they're not talking about coming to city council at least until somewhere in the middle of November even probably the first of the year\nUm they will go to planning and zoning commission first a staff again is looking at it there probably will be without a doubt negotiations\nThat are going to take place with\nThe principal owners of Arizona ... to see what we can do as far as the things that the city wants is a negotiation it's a tradeoff\nAnd I'm sure that save the deals folks want to be part of the negotiation\nAnd I always thought that that's good that people have an opinion which is great and they need to make sure their opinions heard but understanding it's not our way or the highway\nSo I think it's going to be negotiated and a lot of different ways there's\nUm you know there's land on the other side of the airport\nAh for the runway extension that we would have to negotiate and trade for do something with there's also if we're going to save a portion of the deal so to speak we'd have to probably trade for water or densities and move some ah things around and make sure that we're doing the right thing\nUm I see those things happening in the future\nBut I don't see as getting on wound up in it to 'em before even know what's going on out there so to speak I'm certainly\nHappening in the future but I don't see as getting a wound up in it to 'em before even know what's going on out there so to speak I'm certainly\nWhen Dr ... project went to staff\nThey talked about the things that the city could do for him and what he might be willing to do for the city ultimately before it even got into the public high those things had had been given up in a well received very well by the community out there so\nI'm only hoping that to save the Dell's folks will agree to the same thing I'm not opposed to having an I'll Try to email\nOr this amber field so I'm not opposed to having anybody from saver deals come in and talk about this and I don't think that you've been around here for a while I don't I don't see any reason why we wouldn't work towards that end\nYou know not at all not at all I mean everybody has their say but who has the final decision\nRight the property owner right in the city council and wonder we say about that in the city council everybody wants to talk about and even like when we're talking about this hotel that wants to locate\nDown here on the corner of mount assume I entertain Sheldon ... you know there's a thing called representative government and people and it's most often it's the same people\nThat show up at city hall and want to jump up and down about saying they don't have an opinion they're not being heard\nWell they were at city council and they were because they showed up and that's representative government you vote for representation in the city of Prescott and those people do what seemingly supposed to be the right thing for the city of Prescott to guide its future\nSo it's not always about necessarily not being heard but there's ways to be heard and that's the kind of government that we have right so uh we'll see how that filters out as we go along down the road but those are a couple of things that are indeed on the books I Would say\nUm some of the issues that are going to come up\nOn this next year it is an election year even though they're starting early and\nAh we need to revisit the sign ordinance at the city of Prescott and get rid of some of this political ration of signs right after the election very yeah and then talk about how we're going to handle the next election\nSo it doesn't get out of control like this ah I said I was in the White Mountains for three days Andrew all over the white males and and there wasn't hardly any science whatsoever up\nThere in the white so we have a lot of visual pollution here because of that yeah we do in everywhere you look\nSo um there's a lot of things that are going to happen\nThe science whatsoever up there in the white we have a lot of visual pollution here because of that yeah we do everywhere you look\nSo um there's a lot of things that are going to happen I guess where I was going with this my train of thought was the fact that there's going to be some very significant issues\nThat people are going to be talking about when candidates start taking out their package and I suggest that if you want to get involved in this community that you go to the city clerk's office you take out a packet\nAnd run for city council but some of the issues are going to be number one the airport because that's a move\nOr the airport the hotel in downtown Prescott um the granted deals and our ears on an equal developments also the one thing that always limbs out there is the word water right\nAnd so I think those are gonna be the four issues and everybody's going to be talking about um we were they were streets and utilities and I think the city is a done a great job with streets and utilities you can tell all the roads are torn up [laughter] they're in process of doing it rather I they're working on ... Willard creek road is and and let me say that as a public service reminder\nWillow creek road road from Mitchell\nA down there up the hill up to a green lane is going to be under construction for the next several weeks maybe a month\nUm they have come in already out of the company that was hired\nAnd I don't remember the name of the company right on top of my head is a company out out of out of the city of Prescott I think out of the valley and they have removed all the utilities which means they have taken out all the water encampments and also the sewer tops and all the utility a concrete pieces so those are all gone\nSo they have taken out a lot of sidewalks it they're going to repair ... places that have split and our disjointed so they're doing all the services um construction first then they're gonna start milling the top layer often coming in with some new stuff\nLook forward to that oh yeah it's a it's noisy when they get is very noisy it is in reading it off the top hopefully and I I find that interesting um you know people I I found it interesting when I was a pint top it's been about noisy\nUm they always up there well they had a they had up and pay top but they had a a a ... unknown to us they had a car show in a fair up there that was at the golf course and they had some vehicles their dusty that you would have died for there was probably\nI was trying to put my finger on how many actual cars were there and it had to be somewhere or in the neighborhood of five hundred ...\nBecause they're dusty that you would have died for there was probably I was trying to put my finger on how many actual cars were there and it had to be somewhere or in the neighborhood of five hundred\nVintage vehicle that's a big car show there was massive wow it went from show low they had a parade\nOn friday afternoon and it went from show to pine top and all these people were sitting along the roads in their lawn chairs and everything else to watch these old vintage cars you know that sweet the old ... to you name it ... every every car you could possibly imagine however there was not a suburban or a carry all\nSo it's mine was there I Would have been the only one there so maybe I'll do that I Do rag it'll try to do that next year anyhow it it'll be a lot a lot of fun and and\nWhereas going with that as it is also hunting season and in an area inside the force you had these private enclaves that are private and owned by individuals and they had signs all over the fence\nPlease no shooting we like our privacy too yeah you gotta wonder if you really like your privacy what would make you ever think that you're going to go and live next to a golf course or airport or a national forests when you have\nHunting and things that are taking place so [noise] uh with every situation you have consequences and there's no doubt about it so I'd like to privacy too but I Love laying there with the\nWith the window open the door open and you could hear the L view going and just raising cane during the middle of night and all morning along and that was the light wins through the tree was beautiful yeah it is no doubt about it so feel pretty calling by four one

where you always check your batteries and change them every single year and and I would suggest\nAh the first of October is really a pretty good time to do that and that's what he said on the morning report the other morning was it the first of October to use that yeah I think so I'll be doggone I didn't hear that report but I I always think that soon as you get a nip it in the air\nIt's time

service at six Ninety eight hillside avenue in Prescott\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to the news fourteen Ninety three point five FM and we don't have a specific thing to talk about today I never do we just talk about all kinds of things that probably some pre of thoughts yeah they need to be talked about I mean you know people go their their day where they wake up in the morning they settle on their shoes and shirt and pants or not they go and\nYou know by the time you get home and then you have your dinner and then you go to the same routine or getting a lot of times you know just some of those things need to be talked about just ... you know ringing a bell or are we are talking about off the air we are talking about\nYour your face [laughter] you're we're talking about your your ears and and that that the errors\nAbout just ... you know ringing a bell and we're talking about off the air we are talking about\nYour your face [laughter] you're we're talking about your neighbors and and that that the Arizona sun and what it does to people's skin and I happened to go last Thursday to the dermatologist and have some work done uh-huh well not yet yeah yeah you know what that means\n... yeah yeah during abrasion and little things being sliced out of your body and ask her they happened to me every year to\nI smile and when you say that because\nThis thing's sliced out of your body\nUm when he started talking about I say I asked the doctor and last Thursday when I when I said okay so what are you gonna what are you going to do or what would you do and he goes well we're going to come in here in order to put this stuff all over your face and all over your ears right and he said and when you leave here it's going to feel like the worst sunburn you ever had and then you're in a pill\nLike a snake and then after you feel like a snake\nYou're going to have brand new skin and then you're going to wear a floppy had news sunscreen take care of it\nAnd I'm thinking to myself you know\nI send MERS you're outside of the sun burn or I mean why why are they going to burn stuff off my face with you go out and get a sunburn you just never know and so it's interesting to\nSee how they do things but anyhow that's what he told me is going to happen so I guess I'll go through that procedure and now that I have the the dermatologist out of the way I go to my general practitioner today for my yearly physical which is required by\nUm Blue Cross Blue Shield with the plan I have for a wellness evaluation and\nAnd those kind of things and uh so we'll do that so it's no fun getting older you have more doctors appointments then you have any other kind of appointments so I'm looking forward to having that behind me as well so a changing your air filters changing your your batteries and your smoke detectors checking your body and\nHaving it all well and starting off the holiday season\nKnowing that you are in good shape is probably a pretty good idea so uh make those appointments out there everybody and make sure you do some of those things that you'll appreciate it in the end let's go to Ted on line one hello Ted\nI Would like to remind people what Thomas Jefferson tax dollar earned income in our food drink and our economy going and in our property face the return of slavery and the risk out much of an hour\nIn our food and drink and are coming and going and in our property\nFaced the return of slavery and the risk out much of an all powerful and despotic leak problem today what property tax to the biggest problem for the tax law skills are ragged ownership completely on encumbered\nIs that most people don't even realize what they say they might look at it they don't pay at some of us write the check and it's a big chunk right and\nIt needs to disappear to go way there's no way to pay for your thing government needs to be caught primary as much as you can\nAnd will have a freer that our country for it\nYou know the old saying isn't I I've heard of numerous times I'm from a libertarian in from different people that I like yourself dead and especially like Jim ... and you know when you have a home and you make your
