our friends and fellow Americans in the state of Florida and the states around it\nA six people died as a result of hurricane or the hurricane that hit and one million people at this hour still without power curfews and in fact hundreds of road gym\nUh six people died as a result of hurricane\nHurricane that head and a one million people at this hour still without power curfews and in fact hundreds of roads impassable and literally there are some beach front communities that are simply knocked flat by the storm that had and so you want to you want to think about those people\nAnd the way is that this country can help them out or many of them said they didn't leave because they said well this is all I've got I have to stay and protected\nBut when it gets to the end of the day I Would much prefer to see people evacuate save those lives\nAnd yet for such a devastating storm and the amount of damage if you've seen the over flights by drones of these areas\nCommunities just wiped out\nAnd I say that every single human life that was lost a significant all six of them but that is a tremendously better result in this might have been if the same kind of storm it had some other part of the world because you know do you routinely hear about storms like this take many many lives\nStill and all it would be nice to see more people evacuate leaves a things behind we can replace things we can't replace you the Washington state Supreme Court has decided that capital punishment is racist an arbitrary and therefore today it issued a a decision\nThat in the least in Washington state under the state constitution which means you can appeal this one to the U.S Supreme Court that capital punishment is unconstitutional\nThat means that the eight people on death row\nI have now seen their sentences or will be converted from a death sentence to life sentence and I've I've made the point to you before\nThat the death penalty ... murder and if you say how do you know that Lars that's just an idea no it's actually backed up by some of the best studies out there and studies done recently and frankly studies that come out of liberal universities\nWhose authors I Would imagine probably would have preferred that the data showed something else said many of these college professors would have rather had to stay and said oh no the death penalty is completely worthless but the bottom line and if anybody ever wants to get those studies\nI have a whole list of them and these are from major universities they'd been done relatively recently that there are people um\nCast sons being used to work for Obama and who is quite a solid left wing liberal wrote a paper once called him but he is the death penalty morally required and what he meant by that is if

it kind of convenient but as Amazon getting so big that it could literally threaten our economy\nWell Michael ... joins us now CEO of the cyber education foundation and founder of the justice society he's also the author of the devil inside the beltway which we've talked about before Michael welcome back to the program\nTo get it back with you sir I'm doing very\nWell so I like Amazon I Do business with them but I still do business with\nUh before Michael welcome back to the program\nMarketed back with you sir\nI'm doing very well so [noise] I like Amazon I Do business with them but I still do business with bricks and mortar stores a lot of other companies why do we now see Amazon and something so big it literally threatens our economy\nBecause a little baby tigers are cute and when they get around that kill ya okay [laughter] I don't remember for theft and and conspiracy theory Thursday step either I'm really by and [laughter] and so I\nYou know look isn't that interesting how he started calling an Amazon from the beginning it he pulls you and he does what we call loss leaders okay so we get so much money he loses money to undercut everybody else gains market control than\nYou know ... in close enough to slap in the face and now he owns the Washington Post so he can control the message you can control the media there's\nDamage that all bad I mean obviously they have done positive destruction they have challenged saying this market dominance and this monopolistic behavior and and how brutal they are\nAre too small business is as tough it's you know uh so it's it comes to an anti trust level I mean by a large I Love the efficiency that he built in and I I have time also and I like to challenge it's just you know ...\n... businesses will alternatives to develop your monopoly that'd be great\nOh yeah well actually I wouldn't because you know my goal I told I told my audience mild metaphor is not as good as your baby tiger metaphor but I've told them you know if you said what I like to be the only talk show host in America no because having competition sharpens my game and I'm afraid I'd get lazy if I was the only game in town\nRight near the exactly right so\nWhy is the founding fathers decentralized power is unified powers bad with human beings that just governments so we have Amazon who now has\nThese ... you know these machines that listen to a state can understand what's going on and as data that has now wants to be the only clout for services provider for the military for a decade and the amount of\nMarkets steak corner and that that state connect between those markets is terrifying when it's in the military\nAnd the amount of markets steak corner and that that state connect between those markets is terrifying when it's in the military and personal information and and and you know\nAt the newspaper and the media it's you know it's not about them it's turning into a true antitrust play and that's where it's going to go\nWhat has the FCC had the securities and Exchange Commission had anything to say about this because they certainly regulate my industry heavily they tell radio companies you can only own somebody radio stations and every market and we're not going to allow you to become dominant or is it do not big enough yet to to trigger that\nI ... well of course you know when all anyone cares about the media today as Russia Russia Russia and they can't believe out from President this is the price we pay because you know\n... ... ... listen these big companies you know how fast these guys got huge it's like the movie alien where it's\nAlmost a cute in the beginning and unlike ten minutes in the movie is ... feet tall so you know any like wait a minute why happen there or kind of caught off guard but the companies also learned from Microsoft and the government jumped on micro\nMicrosoft so that they were in Seattle is having a nice life and hear Tom's Europe and the U.S now everyone learns that and all you know Amazon ...\nLobbying and they've got these beautiful beautiful offices in DC and sodas soda school and so to stay stuck in there all break and bread and get the number by I mean they're not down there protecting their turf and their shareholders so\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation we have our problems and our addictions with our Facebook and our Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it but it is and this is the other worry I have Michael that even if we say well they're too big to respond to this one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well ... no longer and they're about to go out of business would seemed\nBut back when Sears first came on the scene and they had to be one of the first uh entities would enter the market boys and said\nYou don't have to buy your ... the local general store you can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darn amazing do say\nUh you know I can do you mean I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is on that\nIt'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is on that on steroids but we were\nYou know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns of the time that we're going to wipe out the local general store will they didn't you know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm I guarantee you they had an effect\nThe second concern I have is this um that\nAs we're in a world market place now if we say Amazon we got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big wheeled China and other countries had the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service me a worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can't get big but China can have a you know uh you know can have companies that are that big are we going to see the day where we've knocked down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've allowed all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them instead\nI can I can buy a small business part because although I saw what they did to publishing government part I I'm a little bit less less empathetic on because\nYou know apple apple Amazon and the the rights and the constitution of belief and that human rights things that they just look the other way when they do business than those\nStories a lead me to believe that if we put our foot down they're not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away and that while they want to practice and do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so\nUm if it just and this is the topic for discussion and there's no right or wrong answer because they have done a lot of really good innovation and that's good but there's also a lot of crushing going on and when it depends on the swings to find the other direction\nWhich I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas\nAre then we've got a problem but you know these people get so much money they do more profit margin is more than the economy is that most country yep\nSo we're very careful about this and their interaction with our regulatory because Iraq at Torrey and the Senate and the country is it's pretty lousy how we all all care about and for some of the United states not education and the regulars and his lawyers with\nA lawsuit ... they're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough to hold them accountable that's why I think the ... the only one\nRegulars and his lawyers with a lawsuit and they're they're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough to hold them accountable that's like the ... the only place to go and I'm Wondering what the the judicial system or not they'll handle at all\nI just worry that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it'll all come in a big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon but now we're going from you know a big company in China unless we could figure out a way to say you can't sell into our marketplace which\nSo far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance and overreach into cyber security medicine in small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the program\nYou started talking again glad to have you on by the way the liberals are taken off the gloves and they're fighting dirty Ann Coulter says the conservative should do the very same thing and we'll get to your phone calls and your emails at eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk\nAt Lars Larson dot com stream this program at my heart talk you can also stream medics and listen to it on ... by enabling the skill and telling a like sort of play the Lars Larson show [noise]\nA book but in theory what the accusation was something that it's\nJust qualifying for drunk college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who's um testimony was what was supposed to be believable because people watched her and while she sure looks credible to me\nUm but hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one backed it up I mean what about\nFront door she she had a front door because two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house this is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um she had said that she run they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or injure industry call them I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that\nShe lives in um she said that she rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or interns as she called them oh I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental apartment\nThat's a lie under oath or fear of flying um that certainly seems to me to be false and as much as she flew jets all over the globe to go surfing\nWho paid for the for the polygraph all I guess you correct in that one about whether she'd ever coached anyone on a polygraph or live in six ear ex boyfriend\nSays that he was present when she was coaching one of her friends on how to take a polygraph something she was asked about under oath and denied\nUm you know the next the next hearing 'em the next Supreme Court justice to go and and be replaced and I have a few guesses about who that might be um it's it's going to be it's going to be an absolute\nDisable make having all look like a day at the beach\nAnd what's the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent do you think prosecutors ... in ... during the more local cases are afraid to do this for fear of being accused by the meat to crowd of you're attacking women know you're attacking a liar\nYou're attacking a dreamer so so what will it take to get those people to get a backbone and say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and tried to falsely accused somebody you too will face consequences\nNo in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sent have sent innocent men to prison or jail um there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nWell and and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it but how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often gonna be a federal cases a local case so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking you seriously\nThat we take your ... your true accusation so seriously that when we find a full one were treated equally hard how do we get that dynamic to shift because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the world and go after a full ...\nYes and as you indicate it's odd are mad idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward\nAnd go after a fall accuser\nYes and as you indicate it's older men idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward\nNo actually we do want to discourage that we don't want people's lives being real and um but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rape um there's a there's a movie out now about Brian Banks at an eighth a\nI'm really bright had a bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in highschool served five years in prison [noise] um got out and his accuser called I Apologize to them and said she made it up I guess he got it on tape\nIt got the conviction or race they made a movie about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings\nSo it's gotten a zero perhaps that's this guy Brian Banks I tweeted a review of the movie um yesterday I'm but I'm dying to see it I've just I've just read the review I'm thinking of it this guy's life was completely I mean it's a horrible horrible thing that's being done and there has to be consequences for it\nWell I'm going to do this and the next time I talked to any politician author so they're all I'm going to say to them would you like to see us go after the fall to ... just as as as tough as we go after those who are making a

it's good to have you back on the program\nIt's great to be here thanks for having me\nI Am thrilled to have you on the program I just want to know what is the best way for Republicans to respond to this when some of the top figures in the Democratic party are actually out openly inciting violence there doing it on camera there doing it quoted in major media\nAnd so apparently they're not afraid to say when we don't get the result we want we're we're going to go out and engage in violence and we're going to incite other people's to commit violence and all of this not too terribly long after Congressman Steve ... very nearly lost his life\nBecause the left they decided to try and slaughter a group of Republicans on a baseball field do they know what they're doing and and do they understand how the American people are probably going to respond to this\nWell it's a very dangerous path that the Democrat leadership\nUh is putting their party on and it's a dangerous for our country when you hear Eric Holder said when they go low kick them Cory Booker saying get in their face Maxine Waters saying get crowds around with people\nSomething's gonna happen we already had eight Scully sketch shot we've already seen crowds on around Ted Cruz and chairs standards and other cabinet members but this is not what we want for our country and I think Americans are looking at the essence saying it's not\nDemocrats not just regular average people this is the leaders of their party advocating for this and I think Hillary Clinton what she said it's so remarkable it's a seismic shift in our democracy for her to say\nWe will not be civil\nUnless we're in power what a threatening thing to say\nIt is not simple unless wind power\nIt you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of standing in the grocery store watching some poor mom deal the four year old and the serial Iowa who's decided usually it's a little boy who started stamping his feet and screaming at the top of his lungs and he's not going to be civil till the captain crunch goes into the grocery bag is good and and it's the behavior you\nKind of expect from some kids who are poorly raised is not the kind of

from top members of the Democratic party saying we're gonna continue to be ... in civil I'm not sure which one is probably an civil or until you give us power back\nAnd we're going to scream and yell and and probably hurt some people do they understand that the next time God Forbid but we could it almost seems inevitable that someone does get hurt or somebody does carry out a real active of violence\nThat they're going to catch the blame on this\nI think so and I I think they're they're playing their cars in a way that they're hoping will engage their\nFaith and turn them out and do the anger in division I mean listen Democrats for an occupation for a long time but this is a new low for their party and it's frightening for our country we've already seen some instances that are frightening with these college we've seen our senator having had security detail this is not something we want long term\nFor our country and the Democrats need to be called out and I'm saying is that you're on the Republican Party I don't want you to go get Democrats face is I don't want you to go interrupt their family dinners or crate mobs around them what you should do is go out\nGo get involved make a difference volunteer stand up for the things people you know but we can do it in a civil way and that is the greatness of our country and Democrat leaders need to be called out and I hope\nThat the voters are looking at this because the only way we show the Democrats that they lose that this message is by them living in these like or I was the only way we bring back stability to Washington is ... Jack\nThe playbook that they've been riding on his temper tantrum that tape and drive for two years now\nROTC and I I Want to suggest something do I do this every time you're on I'd put a bug in Europe and I I don't know if it's you know if you if it's worth what it costs you let's put it that way\nBut I Would love to see since I Know the mainstream media will not do the thing they should do which is go to democratic leaders leaders in say will you condemn these calls for violence now\nI compared the other night I was in Seattle for a form of a panel with a bunch of other talk coast from one of my ... and somebody said you know should we go out and let's go out and have some big protests I said it's never been the style of Republicans or conservatives especially to do that you have\nNice family friendly gatherings like the Tea Party the leaves the landscape cleaner than when they arrived we just don't do things that way they do and that's not just\nNice family friendly gatherings like the Tea Party believe the landscape cleaner than when they arrived we just don't do things that way they do and that's not just one of these where I'm trying to say on our side doesn't we don't you know I as you can name any number of instances of left wing violence you don't see it from the right\nBut because the media won't call them out and I'm Talking about individual reporters can we get Republican officeholders and Republican office seekers to start demanding I mean the president\nIs is you know understands that when you push the buttons of media\nIf we saw some Republicans stand up in front of a crowd of reporters whenever they're holding a an event of some kind words covered and say why aren't you folks asking for condemnation of this because I Will condemn it tonight\nAnd if if the Republican men and women are in office and seeking office would start demanding that\nI think the media can only ... ignore it so long and then they'll have to acknowledge\nWell maybe we do need to go to Hillary Clinton and say you just you just try to incentivize violence why are you not condemning violence because ordinarily that sort of the you know the go to for the Democrats in this case they should be uh I I think we should hold their feet to the fire\nI agree and and we just put together a video that was released today shelling some of these markets that have been created a along with the words of the Democrat leader as we are definitely trying to hold Democrats accountable and you're right immediate need to do it and we need to help\nPush the media to act in a way that they don't always do because we know if it were a Republican who is that these things they'd be all over us so\nWe are going to continue to set an example of stability we are going to continue to run out of the issues that results that have happened to the ministry and that has made life better for millions of Americans straight quite set up ... percent five\nMillion new jobs ... is that so many great things are happening across this country and we will contrast that with the resistance and the vision and the destructive nature of the Democratic party and hopefully on November ...\nThe voters will re jak this terrible terrible a message that Democrats continue to\nDo you remember back to the beginning of the campaign when President Trump then candidate Trump would go to various Venus and he was he in generating gigantic crowds\nAnd I can't remember who was Cleveland or another city where they literally had to shut the event down because of the folks who came in as interlopers intending only to cause trouble and and when the ...\nWhat do you blend or another city where they literally had to shut the event down because of the folks who came in as interlopers intending only to cause trouble and and when the president responded I didn't give her a couple of times when it was a candidate\nYou should throw that guy out or punch him or you know things like that and they were at the media was all over oh my God are you in are you inciting violence or you endorsing violence\nBig that you know they will do that as you say if it's a Republican\nWho does that are conservative who says something if I took to the air and said let's go out in the streets and burns and things like antifa does which I Would never do\nOr you know that that that would be condemned quickly so if the media won't if individual reporters won't do it on their own\nI think we should get our candidates to search shaming them into it\nWhy aren't you asking the other side to ask you folks who are seeking reelection governor Kate Brown and the state where I broadcast ask her are you willing to condemn these kinds of tactics and the statements of Eric Holder when they go low let's kick up would you condemn that and if you want why not I think it might be effective run\nAnd also our our voters can get out of their account how they go to these meetings like Democrats and asked them face to face you know why aren't you can get I mean that's it's like you're fighting against or that the cell\nPhone as it is a great tool now and recording

I literally didn't taking notes of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered baby\nPeople but it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered baby alive and then cut the next with scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yes she is actually but I ... we had never thought of I mean and I'm telling you the God's honest truth my husband and I neither of us\nNotice that he was

he sang to me twice in the middle of this yeah because he was talking about music and then he said you know all you know when I started listening to ... you know ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do this brand free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name\nAnd I love ... by the way the Belgian crude or who died I bet a lot of your listeners would know him again

the doctor with my wife by the way will uh when we were we were married been married thirty two years we've been together thirty seven we have ... plus one and kidnapped and another one on the way\nBut when we first we're going to the doctor because of our first child\nThe doctor says to me he goes let me explain it like this about you and your wife he said you know you're a dump truck you can eat whatever you want you can go anywhere you want you can do whatever you want and you're fine he goes your wife on the other hand\nHe goes you know you like cars don't you and I said yes I Do he said well let's put it like this your wife is a Ferrari and she's got to be taking care of and tune up and kept warm and you know and I when I get it you know some people are just more\nFragile but they're beautiful you know it's like my wife is a beautiful woman but she's fragile island me I'm a dump truck I can I could eat a car and I would probably poop out three three months later but in my body would digest it you know what I mean\nSo there are people out there that need the products that safe and fair food company makes but also there are people out there that are like me that need the advice that you're about to give of what is the secret sauce of will halls worth and the safe unfair food company I also want to note for those listening that\nWill was also the former president of a company called muscle milk and Sam is on\nAnd he worked at pepsico Pepsi America's and uh he was the head of global strategy Gatorade over at pepsico\nAnd graduated from a Wake Forest university\nSo you haven't been through you know a lot of education in in business in what you called big food and now here you are you're taking the road less traveled which I Love but let me let's drill down to ... maybe the three principles that a U.S now live your life\nAnd you are applying these principles so the entrepreneurs can learn from your lifetime\nOf business experience\nHas probably three or four thing that I think about all the time whether to go to meetings and we try to equate it to like one of the world's great acting\nYou can't get what you don't have they show and I think about which I'd had incredibly good fortune to work for the great people by the way along the way it is and we're in great that's a really really wonderful people walk one\nWhich I can get your name ... documenting it would be much greater part much it's just so much worse than it really matter like\nWas really really wonderful people walk Kwame which I could give you name after ... after man that would really be much greater part of my success them myself personally and so I think there's things that really matter like for spot and you want to be a purpose for one of a sense that there's things that are bigger than you out there and they matter more like by the way the people that work for you gotta keep responsibility to them and their families right\nIf you have to be working in a big company you have a responsibility to try to help those people move and pay for their kids colleges and promote people at the service\nAnd you work for a small company you have a responsibility to keep that business going and make sure that the people would have chosen to come work for us we have a contract with a really good team but these people have chosen to be here with us\nIn spite of the possibility and explain to them and their families as well as to the community that we share that Jason fair setting being purposeful and there's Turkish and then he didn't read it for this purpose of pepsico\nAnd there's purpose here taking care we might have a little bit of a different sense of that just because we're small the interesting thing about our business is a better we are and making great food for people to desperately need it the better business would\nBe too late and wonderful conflicts and say this to 'em\nAny more about attending church who really want to be three things we want to be smart meaning that we just happened to us and things that other people don't know because of the place that we said\nTo me we talk to us we want you to go oh that was smart and right and I was interested and we want to be relevant meeting that were saying things that matter to you right well and we don't want to ... sometimes you see people in the food business you know particularly in organic or natural food they kind of ... but that's not what we're here to do want to be relevant\nTo the thing that happened in your life every day and then we want to be inspired and not simply means that after we talk to you that you'd like to talk to us again you know when you think about people like out in their life they're very nice people to be around right\nAnd so it's important trust you know actions are binary people don't always think that's the way they're gonna think better off or worse of the stadiums are food company with each conversation that we have\nSo I think it's very important for us to always be mindful of the purpose that we serve\nIt's important for us to be smart and so we have to work at that rate we have a relationship at Stanford University and some other credibly brilliant food allergy people in America today and some folks on our board we want to be relevant to want to make good food for people write stuff that really matters in their lives up stuff with that I think they should be reading the stuff they think that they want to eat\nAnd then we want to do that in a way that inspires people to do more and better and hopefully walking say they're into their lives\nYou know I thought about those things a lot throughout my whole career whether it's been you know working with pepsico and having a really good fortune ... teams that works for me were troops and great executives are being at a company like ... really are the ... brilliant guy who created really first got ready to drink ... haircut tasted good we watch that all over the world\nAnd you know today at saving fair either\nA hundred and ... is really a guy who created really first got ready to drink tied to any taste that good we watch that all over the world\nAnd then you go to the care are incredibly good fortune to work for a company also that my kids are proud of it's a very good ones for me to think about my life right and you have Chuck kitty a jacket proud of what I Do\nOh so that's why I think about what we do Richard Gere to\nLove it man absolutely love it I Love the best part about it uh is what you just said right at the end\nDo something that your

of like a embraced by the the college lifestyle but we're really finding a lot of businesses are baseball moms buying for their sons and buying for their husbands that are avid baseball fans\nAnd ah it it's going extremely well we're in our second full year business and we're project to do about three million dollars in sales this year [noise] good lord\nI Would honestly what I Would never

dollars in sales\nSo give us some of the er which I like to hear because to me these are the gross you know the most important things are the the problems you had and how you grew from them so what was your biggest problem\nWell we we grew too fast at one point um and that that was a big that turned into a big problem but we quickly found the solution for it and we started building the business to where it was going rather than where it was\nAnd as soon as we kind of transition to remind mindset into that kind of realm\nWe're now in a position that whatever comes our way we're ready for it we're able to scale with it and uh and and it's making our businesses explode even more\nSo now when you were in college what was your degree I'm just curious\nI was a business administration major focus in marketing but I really baseball was my was my\nMajor right\nSo now you're here at this a mastermind with Gadhafi and uh [noise] what breakthrough have you had 'cause that's what he's calling this laughter his book breakthrough what breakthrough of you had\nThere's a ton of resources that aren't too too far out of your each one of the things that Brennan Center brought up yesterday that I have a really difficult time with is asking and ah just hearing that from somebody that's had a ton of success in in a somewhat of a similar vertical hearing him just\nThat I have a really difficult time with is asking and ah just hearing that from somebody that's had a ton of success in in a somewhat of a similar vertical hearing him just say you know sometimes you just got to ask and asked politely I Would say that's probably\nOne of my biggest takeaways from this experience thus far\nIt seems like you're kind of a low key kind of guy and you probably have a certain amount of pride like I can do this on my on what a bootstrap this thing\nBut they ask is the most important thing I was just talking to a buddy this morning I said your biggest problem and it wasn't you\nBut this is a very dear friend of mine said your biggest problem is you don't know how to ask\nThe ask is the most important in part because without that you're just going to continue along at that status quo you're never going to be able to grow up to the next level even if it's asking for a little bit of advice advice is fantastic you never know what's going to come out of that that's why these mastermind just so important\nBecause we get together as men friends men and women\nAnd we talk about our problems and a lot of times in business entrepreneur is I think\nFeel like they're kind of the man on the on the moon ... they're all alone they don't have resources that they need they don't know how to get them they don't know how to ask for I'm like you but your breakthrough is you figured out you need to have your ask ready\nThat's absolutely correct ya at times I Do feel like I'm On Randall island and uh yeah absolutely it's a maybe it's a a bit of pride but yeah for sure if it's\nHave to do that so what is the asking to be moving forward whereas you're weak spot what do you need help with I'm just curious because you never know who's listening and you never know just trying to articulate it may help you with that ask\nYeah we're we're coming into a very interesting a licensing agreement and uh it's gonna cause our business I think to\nTo go even crazier and just

[noise] well it's\nThe ties with them and my I mean it's wrong I like it steam awkward for them but they have nowhere I've taken it out on on and\n[noise] well it certainly is not a a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were just say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nWell of course everybody would put down that notion of what are you saying all women are liars\nAgreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nIn which a there are charges against men and assuming all men are pigs I'm Sorry that doesn't hold up either every case is different every case is different and has to be judged on its own circumstances in that I think is the message that we should be getting across your along with the notion\nOf tried to put your outrage or indignation and some perspective\nA Steve in ...

just heard a classic message from Dr Oswald Hoffman talking about the connection between faith and fear joining me here now to discuss that is Dr Tony cook\nDirector of us ministries here at Lutheran our ministries Tony ... let's talk about fear in our lives and how face interact in intersects with that\nSure ah thanks for having me again this is a topic that\nI can get in the way back machine and go back to um I think if I'm remembering correctly about when I was seven ... and um I was going through some rough times uh in my life\nAnd I started to have night terrors ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you couldn't get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream that that happened\nAnd when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you couldn't get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream that that happened every time\nAnd when I Would uh when I Would wake up from this dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half awake and half asleep and I would see\nThe shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was a I had a closet that didn't have a door\nSo dark um and I had a a Barney Rubble nightly mounted out of the ... yeah I had a night light and that was the only light in the room and sometimes it help and sometimes it cast odd you know shadows and the wall but\nWhat happened is I was going through this period of when I went to sleep I Would have this dream\nAnd I would wake up with this tremendous sense of fear and for boating\nAnd I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things away [laughter] and um I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now and lay me down to sleep\nAnd I knew the Lord's Prayer\nAnd so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes and in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers they would make a brick\nAnd I would\nTake these bricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it's like a pillar you know ... and I was inside of this pillar of brick of prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was\nProtecting me if you will from the fears that came in the night and eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear\nAs well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see a childish technique because now that I think about it actually probably wasn't that bad that the better thing to do but ah that was a time in my life that I had these kind of foreboding fears and and how I handled it\nAs you look back on that as an adult do you continue to use prayer as a shield and as a protector yeah for me it's interesting with prayer it as a\nAs a Lutheran a lot of times we'll say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and uh\nYeah for me it's interesting with prayer it as a as a Lutheran\nA lot of times we'll say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a and a lot of times that's a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realized is that prayer has\nPower and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that [noise]\nMost of the times still oddly enough I I use prayer\nWhen I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off those worries and those concerns especially when I'm trying to sleep\nPrayers about the only effective way for me to to do that so it it's carried along with me this this whole time so it's it's more than just apply attitude [laughter] in it actually is is is powerful yeah\nWhat'd you say fear is a bad thing well I guess you know it's what kind of fear is it and who you ask\nProbably so when I was a little kid I felt that that fear was bad and maybe a it was my subconscious working out the issues that I was going through so maybe it was good but as an adult\nI I've found that that fear actually can be good obviously fear helps to protect us from things so you have that that a fight or flight syndrome that we get a hill and fair exactly sort of healthy fear of of things that would do damage to you I also think that when it comes to fear that\nIt is something that can set of hedge or a boundary so that we remain faithful to God and then there is I'm not like a horrifying kind of fear but a fear when we look at God\nIn who he is honoring him and that's a kind of fear too and I would say that's a that's a positive fear as well\nYeah actually the first use of the law would be an example of a healthy fear the fear of running afoul of the authorities that God has put in place\nThe curb that yeah restrained you from acting out on whatever sinful impulse you might have that might be against the law so in that case that would be a healthy of fear and a half\nYou're correct so like the the first use of the law um why do people obey the law in in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment you know [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm I'm not going to do this because I don't wanna go to jail so you're not really\nIn in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment you know [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm I'm not going to do this because I Want to go to jail so you're not really a doing things for\nA wonderful virtuous reasons but because you're fearful of the\nPenalty but at the same time it's not like the man's trying to keep you down you know I mean it's it's really about protecting you as well as a maintaining stable society so while there's fear involved the overall goal isn't simply tear\nThe overall goal is to Maine taint peace and to keep us protected and to keep us healthy\nIn the sermon Dr Hoffman said that all fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of death would you agree with that\nI agree with that I might put it a little bit differently to me to death is one kind of loss okay and at least for me personally I think that a lot of my fear is connected to loss a death being probably the largest one but yeah\nI I Would say that the death as a former Lawson and if you think about it that way that many of our\nFears are connected so uh we're fearful if we're gonna lose our job or if we're going to lose a relationship with someone that we love or if we lose someone in in death or if we're going to lose part of our identity you know or part of our freedom\nUm all of those I think go back to loss for me and maybe it made it tells you a little too much about who I Am I'm but fear of loss of of of many kinds has has been something that that I've dealt with over my life uh it it also I think it exposes the fact that\nMaybe we think that the things that we provide for ourselves are the only way that we make it through this world\nAnd if we if we lose those things we're not going to be able to go on\nSo I think it probably also says something about my understanding of my of my trust and and my relationship with God and those kinds of fear\nAnd had never really hurt the gospel ... no one had ever asked me if I was saved or knew Jesus Christ as my personal lord and savior I knew that I wanted to be involved with what I thought then we're Christians they were you know that we are good people they were friends\nA ... or knew Jesus Christ is my personal lord and savior I knew that I wanted to be involved with what I thought then we're Christians they were you know that we are good people they were friends they were what I thought of the Protestant faith which is what I was raised in\nA remember a starting Embry riddle and being in the first couple of weeks a class in September of Nineteen Seventy eight and riding on the van or going out to the airport they had a shuttle van I Believe they still do that takes students at the airport do flying lessons\nAnd uh I remember the driver was sharing his testimony with a couple of other students and I sort of jumped in unbeknownst to me and and uh the driver said oh are you a Christian and I said well yeah I Am because I thought I was ... I remember getting just one night out walking looking up at the stars asking God\nTo get me into a good church and little did I Know\nWhat God hadn't store for me\nSo on an imitation and talking to this driver someone came out and pick me up and brought me to what was then the foursquare gospel church\nAnd I had never heard in imitation for salvation before I'd kind of come in on the tail end of a couple of things and didn't know what was going on I never put a two and two together so I attended the service and at the end of the service was an imitation\nFor salvation early ah actually the pastor said you're living in sin you're not say have been here since have not been washed away by the blood of Jesus and\nFeel I I was not I didn't have a bad life growing up I had good parents or you know my my both my siblings are a little bit older than I Am so I was for the most part in the house my the last probably\nUh ten or eleven years I was in the house I had nobody but my parents and and I was I tend to church or either it was a Protestant Church either as an ... over at the uh the ... where I grew up in West Point New York or to get that job or my father was actually the organist and choir master\nSo I heard a lot of Protestant Church services and attended a lot of products in church services when I was young but again as I said the biggest thing that impacted me was I never heard of the gospel I never heard that I was last\nAh regardless of what I did I was lost because I had not accepted Jesus Christ as my purse lord and savior and that's exactly what this imitation was was that you know in your heart that you're not said that you're not forgiven if your sins because you've never never made up for public profession of your faith\nAnd so it wasn't fire\nIn your heart that you're not said that you're not forgiven if your sins because you've never never made a ... public profession of your faith\nAnd so it wasn't fireworks it wasn't bells and whistles it was just something rang true in my heart that I don't have that I don't have that assurance that he's talking about\nI raised my hand I said yeah I'm I'm guilty\nAnd so I went down somewhat lend being a prayer of salvation asking Jesus Christ in my heart and ask him to forgive me and my ... and and also declaring that I was going to live for him for the rest of my life and so that's how I became a Christian it will be\nA thirty two years ago this September two thousand ten that I asked Jesus Christ and to my heart\nAnd had been living for him ever since I did go on to graduate from memory rental in Nineteen eighty four and flight instructor there for a while\nUh I moved to Atlanta to try to get on with the company that I'm with now which is Atlantic southeast airlines it's part of the delta connection program it's it's a good company on God's bless me in the career that I have but\nUh there's not a day that goes by that I don't look at things with an eternal perspective knowing that at some point\nAh I'll retire if a Jesus doesn't come back and the rapture before them\nAnd at some point I'll probably pass into eternity if the rapture hasn't happened and knowing that I have an assurance of salvation but also\nIn a daily perspective I can carry things to God in prayer I have a beautiful wife I married my wife is my best friend is but we also have a best friend uh that we look at which is Jesus and our heavenly father\nFrom a spiritual perspective if we can carry things to God in prayer that that uh you know we know sure certainly here to tell you this morning that a life does habits potholes just like turbulence when you fly not every flight is absolutely glassy smooth from takeoff touchdown\nAnd you're going to have a few bumps in the road and some of them you may cry some of them you may laugh but\nThroughout at all God can help you through those things are a lot easier than the things of man I don't say that to cast dispersion on things in life that help us a such as doctors or or are people that you can go to for help in in our secular life but\nA God being our heavenly father and having the creator certainly knows is probably better than anyone on this earth so he's in a position to to probably help is the best and I can certainly a testify that\nIs probably the best life decision that I've ever made a especially looking\nPosition to to probably help us the best and I can certainly a testify that is probably the best life decision that I've ever made a especially looking back in the last I'm\nThirty two years of my life how things happen now that you never would have thought would have happened in society either through people that you've known or even in your own direct family you never would have thought would have happened Thirty years ago or Twenty years ago looking and thinking about these things got is always there and the Bible says you know\nThat are having a nurse or pass away but my word show not\nReferring to the Bible you know there's many things in the Bible Jesus as a friend that will stick closer than a brother\nAnd there's things that just combat that are always reference point that you have the you know from the Bible that they're true and that you live with them and you see them come to pass and they get reinforced through your life experiences\nSo you can fall back on them knowing while I Know that the word of God is true because I've I remember this life experience and yet this thing worked out and I know it in my heart of hearts that was the hand of God just like I knew that I needed to be down and as Jesus Christ in my heart and receive that forgiveness\nAnd so it's it's been great a great thirty two years and I'm looking forward to another\nThirty or forty years or if not more and I as I said I was born in the state of New York and I grew up for the most part at West point my father was work there is a civilian\nWhich for those who don't know West Point is the United states military academy were a kid that's West Point go into the army just as there was a Naval Academy and air force academy that's where I grew up there are a lot of opportunities there\nAre one of which as was learning initially how to fly and then I came and finished my flying at Embry riddle and even that I Believe was the hand of God because when I applied to the main campus in Daytona Beach Florida\nThey couldn't offer me flight right away yet they said hey we can offer you a flying slot right away at our brand new campus in Prescott, Arizona I didn't know much about it I knew it wasn't all desert like everybody thinks that is at least back east\nAnd so I again I took a step of faith not knowing and yet I remember looking up at the heavens and looking back on it now not realizing the impact of my words asking God to get me into a good church and not realizing you know how much he was going to move in my life very shortly thereafter\nAnd I really believe that God move in the circumstances of my life now he did not forced me or I chose to do that on my own free will\nAnd I do remember probably before I left West Point\n... and the circumstances of my life now he did not forced me or I chose to do that on my own free will\nAnd I do remember probably before I left West Point to come out from New York\nI Do remember walking down a near my in my neighborhood there was a reservoir there saying I I didn't know if there was a God and I remember\nJust really struggling trying to understand what the whole meaning life was I was trying to figure out why did we go to Sunday school wide we go to church [noise] what was this whole point of Jesus dying on the cross because in my heart that it's I Believe it's because no one had ever really share the true gospel with me\nAnd that's part of why we do these testimony a is to get the word out to people a lot of times that's the best way to share with people is look I've had this experience\nI don't know what else to tell you at ... you're going to have to check it out yourself you're going to have to take that step of faith just like I did\nIt for anyone that's out there thinking this morning about this it is a step of the my personal life was I was not what I Would consider you know heavily involved in sin was I was I center absolutely guilty as charged because I had not had my sins forgiven\nI have not accepted Jesus Christ is my personal lord and savior I was blessed I I Know there's a lot of heartache with families being torn apart today with\nA you know adultery and divorce and and child abuse and all kinds of things that I was blessed\nNot to have to experience I had a very you know stable family you know today in today's society I really feel for the people that go through that but\nTo anyone that that maybe can't relate\nTo because they've never had a real bad life growing up the gospel is just as a political\nSalvation as justice necessary to someone like myself as the person who's at a really rough go of it and been dealt a bad hand in life what I heard from that imitation was what rank through my heart is you know\nI've never been forgiven\nAnd now it all makes sense now I understand yes Jesus died on the cross this is what I Need to do I it rang true in my heart the Bible does talk about the miracle of salvation\nAnd I believe that's when somebody comes to the realization not because of any one event or thing I had done in my life growing up I had robbed a bank I hadn't killed anyone I hadn't yes I'd I'm done things like any I'd you know stolen I'd lied cheated it was\nI hadn't robbed a bank I hadn't killed anyone I hadn't yes I'd I'm done things like any I'd you know stolen I'd lied cheated it was more of a general that I was a center because I had not been forgiven I was I I understood that I'd been born into send because of Adam and Eve\nI'm Dr David ... and I approve this message\nPaid for by Brill for Congress this is good news fourteen
