seeing\nDoes a congressman in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump's side comment I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Leslie soul which we we decompose do er during a demystify that interview written decompose that we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show\nAnd Lesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media and I think when when the media begins its echo\nAnd they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tunes them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term or will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think ... what move do you what is moving new to the polls what's the issue\nWhat did you move to the polls is that the Democrats I Believe are behind this march\nAnd I think it all you're talking heads should find out who's paying for their bass range who's trying to treat them coming north and you're going to find those Democrats and publish it total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into it in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nLet's put it that way\nHe has a yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nEcosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan\nIndividuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only that Caribbean but more\nI don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as ah the Catholic migration refugees services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers serve emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this\nAnd it's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way\nApart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals' it's families because they know that's their ticket in if you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names are releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you

going to do more than they are going to do so that's the only I was thinking that I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and I'm ... now you're seeing\nThis campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and uh now you're seeing some pollster saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are are surging\nAnd that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens next year look like ...

of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you wanted if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you know I hadn't announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment and the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to bed or three games a beta Rourke um who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did at town hall meeting and he had this to say\nAnd he's dead in July that you would as a member of the house right now about to impeach hadn't changed your

according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime that tree than primary primary or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in the impeachment to an indictment there there was nothing there to proceed with a trial for a whole vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the

that help no it doesn't help better over and it was a man and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten born down with sixty two million and the bank I thing but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think what\nFederal rocket changed me he's running sort of hard left or very far left protects us of course in Harlem for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from heights and there's very little commonality there that I think you I I don't remember honest on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chapter you'll find a laundromat put him into a corner you and put you on the record year do you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate\nGoing into these midterms where do you think the populist is right now you know the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take a house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've gotta lose a number of races where there are a hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nominees and appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over as but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have

that people never made it back to the beach to know that\nAn incident occurred and the other thing is we actually do refer to these two shark attacks anymore because we don't know the motivation of

shark didn't know what it was a thought it was a\nFood item it bit into it and it decided and we just don't taste good\nSo that really isn't an attack that's I'm a sampling if you will but nonetheless

about him\nGetting John thanks for having me get to be back with you I think this uh armada of Iranian oil I think has been termed a is one very powerful way in the run up to sanctions that the

course there's always the discussion of the case by case exemptions and I think that\nThe real trick is is how to use us sanctions to their maximum effect without ruptured oil markets it is absolutely

number of issues at the table\nRanging from Turkey's purchase of Russian as four hundred batteries\nOr to the men beach issue or to Iran sanctions and to others us hostages including three State

I wanted to smack him upside the head and I kind of agree you know some of the national snow question because they get with it had to go there and they had a ... or their families a lot of them\nAnd it was therefore jerks I mean I just I mean to eat a lot of astronauts admitted but a lot of 'em really tried to make up for it and a lot of ways this film didn't give that impression it just showed on strong as a jerk and and why would anyone want to see a film about this\nYou know there's a great epic tale here and if you just focus on a person's floors in this epic tale you lose it and I think that's what's happened with this film\nJob above the detail about Armstrong I give a speech once said one of my at my brothers graduation he he he became an inspirational speaker\nAnd um the the the event I remember I recall vividly was because\nOf the Nineteen eighty election or right before the election this spring election when there was great anxiety about the United states and its strength in the world and he ... he made an inspirational speech and the crowd was thrilled\nHere and so he was translating was a war hero to many fought yeah in Korea he was translating a view of America that really isn't something Hollywood's Tamil you're with these days I'm trying to be generous here [laughter] I Know you are\nI I'm I'm really not to be generous I think my original ... penguins were correct that\nThis is Hollywood and the modern intellectual communities refusal and disdain almost of of of the America that makes it possible the free America's next impossible to have their opinions and they just don't want to do it you know Neil Armstrong landed on the moon ... he was on the first words\nFrom landing tranquility base here the ego has landed and I heard him say it and you can listen to the tapes and hear him say it\nHe said that with joy and enthusiasm\nBecause he knew he had just accomplish something grand for this country needs country\nWhich is with equal represented well I'm Ryan Gosling when he says those words he says the eagle landed almost as it is\nCountry needs country which is what the eagle represented well I'm Ryan Gosling when he says those words he says the eagle landed almost an afterthought almost for luck that lead like he's uncomfortable saying it\nAs a Canadian lie I think it's as an actor and the intellectual community is want to be upper out unabashed American which there's no question Neal Armstrong was\nWell for heaven sakes Bob that was a day of days I mean I'm not going to see a movie maybe I'll have glimpses of it you know when it's on Amazon Prime in two years something like that but for heaven's sakes those those last moment Bob before he settled down do they do do do do they do those adequately I mean that was that was that you know\nWhat they don't do it as well as they could they because they make the landing they they they insert you're looking at the lunar surface with this giant deadly looking crater which was there and then they show the surface flying by super fast which wasn't true he was he was descending almost vertically\nRight any word on rocky exaggerate the reality instead of really ... they tried to show how he's running out of fuel and he's really but they didn't do it as well as they could if they only did he ... he was searching\nFor a landing site and they didn't really showed that and that's\nUnfortunate he flew down by himself that was the pan plan yes\nThey do say I'm going to go to Manuel here yeah and you do have the quote from um\nUltra and ah this is a Boulder field um but once again what happened is he went to Manuel and he's hoping ... over the surface looking for a place to land and instead they show it as he's it's like a plane coming into a bowl to feel like a plane literally the ground shooting passed and he\nSuddenly he brings it down and that's it just wasn't correct\nThat I Know I wasn't going to make a big deal about the minor trivial areas in the film because as general they tried very hard to get the facts right but there are so focused on the facts that completely\n... let's go to the task of NAFTA Bob which is ... and ... and blue origin and

talk about what I wanted out of the star or a tech has a Falcon Heavy contract from home\nUm they got it from a Swedish commercial company that wants to build a geosynchronous communication satellites and it's just one of now it looks like six different contracts on the Falcon Heavy um\nThey're building up a manifest for this rocket right now this launch is going to be in twenty twenty if all goes well what's really significant about this is that they they have\nThey have almost as many books flights now as the proton has and they have more commercial flights maybe than the apple is fine\nWith the Falcon Heavy this is a big deal because they're proving that this rocket is beginning to develop a customer base now obviously they've got to do some more launches I think once that happens in the ... and the they realized this is a reliable rocket\nThey're going to see more signed contracts come in and that's a big deal this basics here is demonstrating that they're very inexpensive heavy lift rocket can bring your business\nTax also has looking to chat faring drop now reminded faring is\nThe thing is the cover they put over the payloads on any launch\nYeah in other words just to protect the space the payload when it's going through the atmosphere is exerted is faced with the greatest a dynamic range of pressures and they get rid of the ferry once they're above the atmosphere is they don't need it anymore and so there's generally you know to shield so\nMost companies just let him drop the ocean and that's the end of it was basic says you know we still several million dollars building those if we can recover and we can save money and so they've been on an unending test ... program trying to get them back\nAnd they've been trying to get them back during launches and they haven't succeeded they have a space ship called Mr Stephens it goes out and actually tries to\nPosition itself below the fair and since coming down on a parents tell one hasn't succeeded yet so they're actually now doing helicopter dropped test with a ferry and they go up to eleven thousand feet above ...

now the economy's doing very well if there was more inventory would be even better\nI see So Peter let's talk about investing with the goal of setting us up with a steady income in our senior years now you said a great example there because I understand you own fifty two apartments in Massachusetts and fifty properties in Florida Peter that's a lot\nWell I've always been in the old and investment in commercial real estate and I really like numbers and calculating and it's one of the fastest a real estate that you can get to do that and being able to calculate numbers and whatnot you look at some of the deals\nAnd they realize that this is how you can make money and you're really using\nTennis and what not to pay the bills whether things work out properly\nOh I Love that because you have a mortgage on the place might as well let someone else pay it\nSo what happens is that you got a property let's rent it out and you know you do have expenses\nBecause you have a mortgage on the place might as well let someone else paying\nIs so what happens is is that you've got a property and its rent it out and you know you do have expenses and whatnot but if you buy properly or you're going to come back seats are expenses but because of the tax code you can get pretty she ate the property which helps self employed people on their tax returns\nSo having said that you get to appreciate\nOn your tax returns now which again help self employed people and then you get to use the property\nThat attached shelter and then you have in common as retirement so if the property is strategically done that's paid for by retirement or during wartime and then it's just income less expenses equals profit\nYou don't need to own something on Madison Avenue or city\nA lot to do this and to do it well maybe it's a rental property Cape Cod at the age of San Francisco places like that but you like to go visit it should only be calm\nAnd a good place when an investment\nThat is such

earlier in life and then it's paid off the ... you retire\nThat's the ideal planned and when I have a new raging there somebody comes into a real estate school and asks us you know what to do part of

A. R. E. S.\nBasically means that you take an education and the training to work with seniors at different ages and nobody wants to be called older except for like the four year old or\nWishes he was five years old [laughter] but so the designation kind of runs from baby boomers and eat a\nLittle bit earlier people who were just thinking about things like downsizing all the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old there's a lot lower planning family conference saying things like that that go on them when the typical sale and there's a big need because sometimes people are taking advantage of\nBy sea now according to its very definition the seniors real estate specialists designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate needs as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is that a smart idea or is not something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nOpinion is is better off starting it early\nBecause that's the real estate basically as four different areas of possible gain\nThe first is appreciation hundred property obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well second profit center is that the tenant increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage down three as cash flow rent better\nBigger than al flow in depreciation so in order to put all for those two words you really want to get started early mhm to be a first time it duster in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps a look at things like retail\nThose two words you really want to get started early ... to be a first time a doctor in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps a look at things like we each real estate investment trust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchase itself\nYou know that makes a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have vacancies you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that if she believed that real estate\nBoast appreciation generates cash flow\nWhich it has historically done that's a great way not to be the only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate is is kind of a you know you're the person in a ... year spread out with hundreds of other people buying larger blocks of the investment property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that it can ... great benefits in the years ahead\nAbsolutely interesting fact in the last forty years appreciation and least January has averaged about three percent per year coincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area\nThree percent a year so if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage growth unemployment on track there is no reason that real estate pricing at least closer in shouldn't keep pace with wage increases\nPeter we still have so much more to talk about and I'd like to really drill in on your four ways real estate can generate income can you join us again in the next hour of real estate today\nAbsolutely more than happy to join you\nThank you Peter Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with Macedonia associates incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia\nComing up on real estate today when you style a property have you ever thought about holding the note that strategy and much more straight ahead on our national show retiring wealth\nYou have been listening to highlights of the central highlands from the news for gene idea and one oh three point five FM case why see a this was the news fourteen idea and one oh three point five FM K Y.

including the certified commercial investment member designation Peter thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's my pleasure to be back thank you for having me\nWell beer I appreciate you coming back when we left you in our first our we had just finished talking about a tried and true real estate investment strategy in which you buy another house but you keep the one you're in and rent it out that seems like a great way to start\nEspecially if there's a rental market for example where we are in Venice, Florida right now there's a terrific went to them yet because the air being the murder is so strong in top dollar\nBy renting on the air B. and B. is a weekly or monthly rental and has a ... rental ... but an annual rental is slow and steady slow and steady wins the race\n[laughter] that's always going to have to beat her if someone's leaning forward and listening to this and they're fascinated by it how would you advise that they find a good property that will continue to generate a good amount of rent\nThe first thing that you need is a good realtor that knows the market that not somebody that you know from the gym or the country club that's nice to you\nA realtor that specializes in investment property and understand somebody that's willing to sit down and go through the course of explained the pros and cons some states it's easier to residential rental property than others\nI hate to look at regulation and what the landlord businesses but the next biggest critical piece of advice as we invade into real estate investment leather residential\nEducation rental office retail industrial you got to know what you're doing what I mean by that is you need to know the landlord tenant laws in that state\nAs how it pertains if you understand that part of the business of lentils new will be on top of his game over already Seventy five percent on their way to success success\nAnd that part of the business of lentils new will be on top of his game over already Seventy five percent on their way south the successes understanding the rules\nThat is such great advice and you know we already mentioned [noise] buying a new house in keeping the when you already have [noise] but if you want to stay in your house and you're not going to move how would you recommend one of our listeners pays for property they find\nWell you know you if you have equity in your current how it could refinance your home and take equity or you get a bridge loan between the two properties there are a lot of private investors out there\nOh is that what they call hard money yeah absolutely could be called hard money\nPrivate equity investors but with a lot of folks can do you can't buy it yourself but you can invest\nIf you have a IRA you can take it to be a self directed IRA\nSome banks do it some national come next to it and you invest the money you direct where it goes so for example somebody looking for money for a down payment on the alert to finance a flip property or take it into something needs\nFifty Seventy five a hundred thousand a good source of self directed IRAs because that person is going to get more in a real estate investment based on interest in return than they would if they were to um just have it with a institutional lie or a company that Spain\nProbably two percent today stock markets good maybe it's thirty percent\nYou know Peter that is fascinating now let me ask another question about all this you know you have more than one hundred properties if you combine Florida in Massachusetts\nDid you just kind of end up there or was not part of your plan to have one hundred one properties by this time in your life that\nWas kind of planned out the Massachusetts as were my home and I raised my son as it turned out that yes it was in the play in Venice, Florida is the right\nSpot has a lot of desire ability and therefore it gives me a base on the Gulf Coast where I can go up and down and do what I Need to do so that was definitely in play on\nThat is wonderful one more question for you my friend tell our listeners if you will that if they retire and they have\nIs wonderful one more question for you my friend tell our listeners if you will that if they retire and they have anywhere from\nA handful of properties to a whole lot of properties what will their life be like\nI wouldn't know what we're from it is and that's that's a nervous word for bay but I can assure you that\nIt will be able to live the lifestyle that you're looking to live without worrying about it because you're controlling your own destiny\nPeter that is just such great perspective and thank you for all the insights and the advice\nWonderful job my friend and I really appreciate you being on the show thank you it's my pleasure you're very welcome Peter West real tour with bishop west real estate license didn't Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida\nComing up on real estate today\nSelling your great

smart home technology report\nToday big questions\nAre smart speakers on the way\nPossibly pushed aside by smart displays let's talk about that up to now there have been three main players and the smart home arena Amazon\nEcho Google Home an apple home pod they all started as just smart speakers really smart speakers which you could ask anything and the speaker would answer by talking to you\nKnow that was the status quo until Amazon added video screens their big echo show and they're cute little echo spot were game changers because they're bright colorful screens you could watch the news watch the forecast and watch the steps in a recipe\nFor more than a year Amazon owned that space until last July when Lenovo launched a smart display with built in Google Assistant it was followed closely by another Google display from J. B. L. but just this month Google announced it their own version in there\nGo assistant it was followed closely by another Google display from J. B. L. but just this month Google announced it their own version in their biggest development yet\nThe Google hub the replacement for its original Google Home the hub has a seven inch video screen and premium speakers built in\nAnd when it comes everything Google is known for from Youtube videos to step by step map directions to your personal calendar but now you can see all those things not just hear about them\nNow the Google hub is a smaller device which would fit justice comfortably on a night stand is in the kitchen and perhaps because it would make such a good smart alarm clock nestled right next to your bed the Google hub does not come with a camera\nNow the pet store shelves this Monday October twenty second and\nIts entering the market at a lower price point one hundred fifty dollars compared to two hundred and thirty dollars for the second generation Amazon show ... how about apple\nWell so far it's excellent smart speaker the home pod well that's all they have there's no talk of an apple smart display not even a rumor so what if you already have a smart speaker without a display like the Amazon Echo or dot or the Google Home max or many\nWell no worries because every one of those will still work just fine\nBut even so you can see where all this is headed right now the two major players in smart home to Amazon and Google has the upright\nThat is such a great strategy Peter\nYears shell that walking capital of ... street forever but condo\nThat is such a great strategy Peter\nSo for example I'm In my early sixties and I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in that equity I no longer on a lawn mowers\nI can go fishing whatever I Want [laughter]\n[noise] oh my gosh and you know it just comes to mind that real estate can help you in

the station this morning I'm a you know Chino Valley High school has a wonderful soccer tradition or can you in a very quick summary what causes Chino valley to always have good soccer teams\nOr you know what it's it's a great question um you know I I like to say and I like to tell\nKnow valley to always have good soccer teams\nOr you know what it's it's a great question um you know I I like to say and I like to tell people that the but the boy did we get in every single year um are passionate about soccer um it seems like every year we get we get a great handful of kids in that\nUh are are very um they're\nAlready well trained they're already ready to go there very passionate they love winning they're they're very competitive I think are\nAre you spirits program Ari wise so program and and uh the men and women there that put together um the travel teams do a a phenomenal job of of getting these boys ready keep it I'm\nLoving the game I'm keeping them playing and and they're already I've got a freshman group this year that that is that is terrific they're real seasons already I don't have to go over the basics with them and and teach them kind of the the easy stuff they've they've played in some big games\nEven before they come in to a high school program\nIn and I'm so thankful for that and the fact that uh they do is they're they're kinda winters already and before they even come into the program so I I've always been real think our\nOur youth sports are people that take their time and effort in and um and really really train these kids to to where it sure does make my job a lot easier\nNow and I know are gone back going back to last year you graduated a very talented a senior class a you know Matthew Rios Jake way it was one of those guys conferences offensive player of the year you analyze your Desmond or think about twenty five goals for you\nHire a Herrera did a great job pointing it was an all conference defender or some some big losses for your last year about looks like you've made up for quite a bit especially in the sense inside when you got to Sanchez boys Jordan an angel who've racked up even know how many goals for you this year\nYeah you know I'm I sure do miss those boys from last year there was a it was a terrific terrific senior class last year and and you know what I I'm learning is is every year I think that the senior\nClass the next group of guys it's kinda like that next man up the next group of guys kind of step up and and they they have that mentality that hey we're we're not going to lose we're going to they're going to put it in the past\nThis is kind of like that next man up the next group of guys kind of step up and and they they have that mentality that hey we're we're not going to lose we're going to they're going to put it in the time are going to put in the effort and uh\nNow we're going to be a good soccer team you know there was a lot of questions right at the beginning of the season because we did we did lose a lot last year we had some really talented really good\nUm seniors but this year ...\nSenior class and and I know angel Sanchez is a senior and ... but he sure stepped up quite a bit this year and and there's there's just a a lot of chemistry on the field with the with the movies that are there um seniors juniors freshmen all of them there there's there's chemistry and are still learning of the season goes on about\nI'm playing with each other and so I think that helps a lot of these boys hanging out with the with each other on and off the\nField they stab a lot of bonding relationships in and they just have a lot of trust in each other and it's it's really fun to sit back and just kind of watch 'em play and watch them learn and\nAnd and watch him develop\nWell when you have a good culture in the program which you are just describing and then you have a good feeder system it keeps the cupboard a stocked very well does it ...\nIt it sure does yeah he I I've heard some stories or before\nThe season started about you know this freshman class coming in and and then when they come in and it's like wow you know these guys are are good they're prepared they've they've been coached a really well and and it it sure does it makes for looking in the future you know I I sure do think the future is is\nIs brighter than it it could even be right now so I I'm I'm I'm sure thankful for that\nYou know sure well you know a culture we mentioned the Sanchez boys are angel and Jordan but if you had to pick you know a few other guys you ... you know really been key to the cougars successes here who would they be\nUh you know and that the\nEvery time we play a game you know we say we we have for now and then and the first question people ask are usually you know

I'm delighted\nThat Democrats have poured thirty eight million dollars into the race and award says he will not share it with other candidates so that's money that could have gone much more competitive races and in places like North Dakota\nSo um I think it's it's crucial for America's safety\nThat the Republicans keep both houses of Congress so that the ... the house of representatives doesn't become a nonstop impeachment show trial but um I I don't think\nA cruise is going to lose to to Iraq I think part of the reason the polls showed cruises vulnerable for a while was because the bad blood from the presidential race I was a Cruz supporter through the convention my girlfriend\nHated what he did at the convention I kind of liked it I rallied to ... you know during the general election but still there's still some bad blood because there's a lot of support for Trump in Texas and a lot of people were irritated with\nHis dog and fight against the president I don't agree with that but you know that was one of the things suppressing ... true crews that support Trump has come to Texas and done rallies and its Cruz has worked well with President Trump\nIt's funny in the last debate\nOr work was trying to run away from the rest of the Democratic party he was talking about how he could work with the president uh you know he's worked with ... with Republicans in Congress but his saying that he could work with Trump better than cruise cruise pointed out you have called for President Trump's impeachment\nSomebody Donald Trump was\nActually I mean if if work or elected in Texas it'd be like we didn't have a senator senator had died and we just decided to leave the seat open because that's how little impact he would have\nMore on the other hand drawn he's he's real ... dress to twenty twenty and so I mean we've seen\nAnd we just decided to leave the seat open because that's how little impact he would have\nLooked on the other hand drawn is his real name just to twenty twenty as though I mean we've seen people sort of short changed the\nThe process I've always thought that a lot of people had to go through to become president you expected them to perhaps run for the house the Senate maybe become a governor run a state for a while to get some real experience so we saw Obama short cut that by saying oh I don't yeah that\nI can be in the state legislature in Illinois I'll hop right to the Senate all immediately start running for president I'll spend very little time and accomplish almost nothing in the Senate never having run a big organization of any kind never signed the front of a paycheck\nThe short cut all that is better or thinking well run for Senate I'll get some name familiar earning a raise a bunch of money and then in twenty twenty\nI'll run on my good looks and charm\n[noise] yeah I think you know somebody to sit down with Robert Francis a walk and say just because you drive a truck is he an accident doesn't make you a Kennedy\n[laughter] that is a great line I Hope I Hope you've already said that one out\nBut now it's all auditioning for for\nYou know I Want you to put that went on Twitter because I'm so tempted to steal it that if you don't put it on a ... I'm going to put it on Twitter and\nOut here alone I already have in the article with twenty million dollars my hope is that race in refugee from New York City to Dallas I Hope or illnesses that twenty million to pay for the rest of his life so we never had to drive again that will make me feel safer on the road\nNo kidding well I just I I look at this and I understand that there were people who said that the slam on Trump was well this guy's just a reality stars well no he's not because in addition to having a very popular TV show he actually did a lot of things in business\nAnd they say oh you know the only current you know he even if you took his worst critics in New York Times and said he inherited a lot of property from his dad great\nJohn I Wish somebody like you would write the piece that says how many people in America have inherited\nA million bucks from their parents I didn't uh but how many of ... million or ten million or a hundred million and they have quickly turned it into half that amount or attempt of though yeah but it's rarely and go ahead\nI Know I Know someone he is one of the grand ... great grandchildren of John Rockefeller are you telling me about going to Rockefeller family gatherings\nGo ahead I I Know I Know someone he's one of the grand ... great grandchildren of John Rockefeller are you telling me about going to Rockefeller family gatherings and he said like forty percent of them don't even have jobs\nThey just sort of gather around going to fund raisers inch and then they take their private jets to environmental events to save the planet\nAnd [laughter] you know Trump ... something he he he he didn't he didn't get lemons he got apples but he ... he made the apple cider factory created lots of jobs you know ...\nAnd look he's done a great job and the American economy is doing great on foreign policy is a lot better president than I ever thought he would be back when I was cheering for Ted\nCruz I Know and I always back Trump but I ... I've said to people we all say well he only made a few billion dollars I said that's very hard to do ask anybody who's inherited a giant amount of money how hard it is to turn it into a really large amount of money and I said and then go back and ask yourself if you inherited\nA modest some by comparison from say you inherited fifty million dollars\nAnd you went down to your best and financial advisors said well what can I Do with this and he said well fifty million times five four or five percent\nYou can sit back and collect two and a half million dollars a year you know two hundred thousand dollars a month\nAnd you'll never put your money at risk and you can sit on the beach with two fifty thousand dollars a week you can check into the nicest hotel in Haiti and sit there for the rest of your life or a hop on a plane every week and go somewhere else and you could do that and Donald Trump didn't do that\nHe didn't say I'm going to take all this money and I'm going to camp on the beach and have parties and\nHe said I'm going to put all the money at risk and at one point\nYou know they they don't they like the slamming by saying he almost lost it all yes and then he made it back and and that's really hard so why not admire the\nGuy for having taken some and made a lost lost it all made a lot again that's the kind of guy I think we want running the country John's America is the author of the politically incorrect guide to immigration and senior editor of the stream and this Lars Larson\n[noise] close to it about a little less than that but yeah\nClose to ask but you want your fellow spare hold on you want your fellow taxpayers to help you pay your bills why\nWell well here's a here's where it is you know I was paying all my bills I'm not I don't have any like extra curricular things I'm spending money on I was doing the average life now I Try to get a car payment I got I got on paying\nYeah but why why do you think of the moral for you to ask your fellow taxpayers to to help pay your bills why don't how about this make more money\nHow can that can help them out to people who are working you get this out and I do when I Am working towards the the\nLooming around I'm the first guy you're going to talk to who's going to say if somebody is able bodied ended up working age they need to have a job and we need to start having these work requirements the president is pushing their Kris Kobach is pushing it in Kansas\nWe need to have people in office who will say if you're capable of working and there are seven million open jobs you need to go get one of them and if you can't live within the paycheck yearning now\nI've got two suggestions either reduce your spending or increase your work activities find something you can do for your work is worth more\nSo and and that's almost every I can you name me a job anywhere in America where somebody cannot learn how to do an additional skill that makes them worth another two or five or ten dollars an hour named the job is owned by\nI I couldn't I couldn't and and I I mostly agree with you I used to work two jobs that they don't have two and three jobs my whole entire life me too we got kids now we've got kids now and uh I don't I'm not really a big avid fan of you know kids going to ...\nTo they're they're really expensive nowadays they're\nThey want how much like an hour\nSo okay I I got out and can I Do is let me do a test with you here's an idea live next to people there are other people in your neighborhood right\n\nHow about that on tonight when you get home from work or tomorrow when you're off go around and knock on doors in the neighborhood and say I don't make enough money to live the way I'd like to live would you give me\nHow about that on tonight when you get home from work or tomorrow when you're off\nGo around and knock on doors in the neighborhood and say I don't make enough money to live the way I'd like to live would you give me a thousand bucks and and maybe even make it easy to give me a thousand bucks this year would you give me eighty bucks a month or would you feel comfortable asking your neighbors for some extra income\n\nHe [noise] I wouldn't personally\nOkay and that and yet tell you if you want the government to go collect the money from the people and then give it to you what's the difference between you asking your next door neighbor they could just spare me an extra hundred bucks a month for doing nothing for you\nYou you won't ask your neighbor for it but you want the government to come take it from your neighbor the point of a gun and give it to you is there any moral difference between those\nPlayers under the impression that I'm already paying for this service what service not doing a lot with the flow of taking the money for me since I was ...\nThey are but in theory what we should be\nI Can't have how can they can how can they don't take that money and just keep it it's a well I don't want to pay for somebody else they\nDid it hurting did about a year ago the U.S or what they know about a year ago\nThe Congress changed the law and said you get to keep more of your paycheck they cut the tax rate and they let you keep more of the money you earned so you don't have to ask your next door neighbor for the money but what I'm asking is you're asking for government assistance and you say well I'm paying for why don't I get it\nWell in theory we shouldn't be supporting any body through social programs other than those who are in capable of doing for themselves so you have somebody who's quite old and and you know they they don't have any money\nWe're not going to let them die we're not going to let them let them live in the street if you've got a kid who has no family to take care of him or her\nThen we're going to take care of them but right now I Would agree with you did an awful lot of those social programs like welfare food stamps ten of section eight and all that is going to people who can get up off their backsides and go out and get a job there seven million open jobs available we should tell them to go work\nBut I don't for the life of me understand ... why you would want to become dependent on the government's welfare\nBecause dependency on welfare is one of those ... things you can do to people you tell people don't we're we'll give you money\nThere are too many people will say yes to that\nHe ... things you can do to people you tell people don't work and\nThere are too many people say yes to that\nHave no pride they had tried to get up and say give me a job
