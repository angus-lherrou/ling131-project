made pursuing her first career as a chef impossible\nWhoever trained as a jewelry jeweler or jewelry or whatever [laughter] were you ever trained in Missouri was just something you picked up as a hobby\nI ... it had been a hobby since I was a little girl and Wendy craft of cooking I left my life over time I mean I still enjoy it but we do it at home it's not the scale I needed to keep my hands busy and so I Am completely self taught amazing what you can find on YouTube now a days and uh\nJust asking questions and seeking out mentors is how it succeeded\nHow did it happen you decided to use as business because it's a big leap going from a hobby that you enjoy to actually making it your profession when was that decision made and how did it come about\nSo [noise] my youngest son was three weeks old and I'm sure it was a at sleep deprived days that I looked at my husband said I'm so I have this idea and I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna bar a little bit of money I'm going to start the business and uh it's it's an ongoing joke between us they said I\nThink that's such a good idea [laughter] but\nAnd I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna bar a little bit of money I'm going to start this business and uh it's it's an ongoing joke between us they said I\nThink that's such a good idea [laughter] but humor me good man for it and uh the joke to this day is is whatever his gut instinct is about the jewelry business I just go completely against the grain and it works at incredibly well so he has the best business partner I could ever have\nWhen it came to producing a product how did you pick a you know like the military themed unpatriotic themed a jewelry that you do the or the ... route your broach broach Roche I never that's all right I never wear one so how would we know what when you decide well how did you decide on that particular design was it something that\nFriends had seen before that you would made and they asked about or how did you come up with the idea to focus on that specifically\nSo the tradition of approaching the military is actually generations deep um I've been working with the gal Charlene rushed in for her she did it for over Thirty years and um I ended up um purchasing her business and carrying it on and\nSo the the way the bridges got started for me as my husband taught military history\nAt the United states military academy and so he and his friends are heavily into military history makes sense and and the collectors world the pieces when they break lady the insignia ah unfortunately they're scrap in that world and so they started collecting for me\nAnd that's how I came across all these amazing center pieces for the roaches was giving history new life\nThe roaches you maybe that's not the only thing that you may be but that's what you started out doing was the ...\nThat's when I started doing and it um it was a very steady snowball from there and so we've gone everything where I'm now license you mentioned from Connecticut or the Waterbury button company all of a uniform buttons in Connecticut and they were just tickled to death with the jewelry so they've open an account for me now\nAnd so I work with both knew and vintage buttons all the way back to the civil war ... right and I get to travel and collect all these things now in all the different places I go and I'm\nNecklaces bracelets syringe but I also take care of the guys to we've got the cufflinks the tide tax lapel pins\nHave you found that that's the main audience for your products as those who want something a little bit more upscale I Would say and just you know the the maybe a ... and you're going to buy a gift shop or something like that\nWell some might and jewelry tends to be one in two places yes the upscale to military ball the the the founders dinner the something of that sort but also game day I mean you know I I did come from the land of army so the Army Navy air force so everybody likes again to gear so\nYou know have added a whole bunch more products didn't want to vote you bracelets necklaces as you mentioned the ...\nIt comes from the land of army so the Army Navy air force so everybody likes the game to gear so\nYou know have added a whole bunch more products didn't want and what you bracelets necklaces as you mentioned the ... ... ... how did you know as a small business owner when it was the right time to expand what you were doing\nWell I've always been told that an overnight success is Fifteen Years in the making and I'm only about five years in on all this so it really was a very gradual grow and every time a client made a request it's like why I Do have the supplies to do that like I said that to the lineup\nAnd um it started with the west point spouses gift shop I'm reaching out and saying hey we like your product we'd like to carry that and so one gift shop led to another which led to an expansion line it was just a very organic grows\nAs a business owner and a parent and an army spouse wasn't really three separate jobs ... separate sets of requirements I think a lot of people that's when do you find time to do that I mean you're and making all of these when and how do you get that done\nI threw dedication in love I also don't watch that much t._v. sadly but yeah but you know it's it it's what keeps me going it's it's my conversation piece when my friends come over I'm Still working and making or if the kids are at the park I have I have pieces with me it's just part of my life\nIf there are no military spouses out there who hear your stories see your product and go wow that's that's the kind of thing that I'd like to find for myself what do you think the first step that they should take is when exploring the possibility of starting their own small business\nWell I'm being honest going to shop military dot org is this beautiful tool and creating to help network to the people who want to start and\nI've been in business for five years filling and I'm only now discovering all these amazing resources that are out there that I Wish were out there five years ago when they were out there I didn't know they were out there\nAnd so my goal is to help people who are just starting to get that boost to find the resources that they need in addition to getting their business out there in front of people who can support them\nOf course getting the product the right product finding the right product finding the audience a marketing that's a difficult thing to do you though just got some uh some pretty good marketing in the form of the second the lady of the United states of America is Karen parents who was seen at Fort Carson Colorado wearing one of your approach is\nHow did that come to be I mean you can't pay the second or something that goes against all sorts of rules but how did it come to be that she was wearing a hope designs broach\nWell um\nCome to be I mean you can't pay the second week or something that goes against all sorts of rules what how did it come to be that she was wearing a hope designs broach\nOh I'm\nSo I have a relationship with the armed forces insurance military spouse of the year program ... I was the United states military academy to thousands Seventeen spouses here\nAnd through that I'm through that award I met so many amazing people to include the they they have branch winners each year so the top Army Navy air force marine and coast guard spouses right and I'm\nCollectively the branch winters that year were meeting with Mrs pen somewhat to present her with a meaningful gift and so they selected one of my approach is asked that gift and when they went to the White House they presented Mrs Pence with\nApproach and so that happened in may earlier in the year and I never know if something's going to come for not it's a compliment enough for someone to think that my job where it was worthy ... and and here comes Mrs Pence announcing her new military spouse under an unemployment initiative and she is wearing my jewelry and\nThat was a real moment in my life um\nI had a friend call me I was actually getting ready to drive on post and she said are are you watching Fox and friends right now and do you see this\nOn national television wearing a jewelry and\nUm I was speechless at first um\nBut much to the dismay of the gate guard that I've been met right after being given this news I Believe you might have ... for me [laughter] I had the happiest grades I was so excited I had to shout it to the world\nSo um it was\nIt was something special knots not everyone gets to have that experience\nUm\nBut through that I realized what a compliment this lost my business and how I Would give me such visibility in the world um wouldn't it be nice if I could share that same visibility with other military spouses\nAnd that's what you're doing ... can you give the website again\nYes it's shot military dot org\nAnd it's an organization move would bring together people were in a similar situation would you small business owners veteran spouses and so on to have a kind of like a a more to a place where they can what people know about other stuff here and that was as though the the vice president's wife wearing your broach shows those connections can be amazing and they can do amazing things like a great moment in your life\nAbsolutely and so ... military doubt or what it is is a free directory we would like to introduce America to all these hardworking military spouse and veteran own businesses people are welcome to comment list their military base\nOut or what it is a free directory\nWe would like to introduce America to all these hardworking military spouse and veteran on businesses people are welcome to comment list their military businesses with us for free there is no charge for it and then we're working on a monthly newsletter to send out to America so anybody that would like to support the military you know the yard signs are great it's a lovely sentiment\nBut this is a truly tangible way that you can support the military by supporting the military spouse it happy wife happy life right now there's truth and that is right or if there is I I mean this really is a matter of um mission readiness because the military put so much money into training their troops\nBut yet this was a grueling lifestyle it's not for everybody and I know how it just I felt like a hollow shell of the person I used to be at many times and I know I'm not alone in that feeling and yet entrepreneur ship is watch put me back on my feet\nAnd gave him my spark again and it is what has allowed our family to continue in the military [noise]\nTo come on CBS high on veterans to exercise now provided veterans and military members over five million tickets to events recruiting concerts professional sports and more and now they're expanding their services to include another group that wear uniforms which is that\nOr either as

no shortage of events in fact\nI remember a just a earlier this year during the college football national championship\nA season as we were getting closer and closer to that game there were actually tickets to that event available through vet tech so you know this this isn't just a small local events or say a baseball game at the end of the season when the team is having trouble filling the fans there is a really major events aren't there Steve\nYeah absolutely I mean we had um we had two tickets donated to us by that picture or to the super bowl\nIn Minneapolis this past season so there you you just never know what you're going to get um this this that ticks are huge biking span bought bought the tickets or early in the season in hopes that the Vikings were going to go when the when the

tickets for for Fifteen dollars so sometimes these tickets they might be up in the nose bleed or they might be courtside or\nBehind the dog out of the New York Yankees so you just never know what kind of take it you're gonna get\nStephen as I understand it you guys are growing significantly I mean there there's a lot of people signing up every day for the program that's going to be expanding even more because you guys recently I think just in the last couple of months to now you're going to include first responders and this is well is that right\nAbsolutely yeah spot on and so what\nWe've done is when you open this up to first responders so that includes a police firefighters and EMTs and um and there's\nThere's the eligibility requirements there as well and that's through ID me or you get

veterans you'd be hard pressed to find any group doing more than disabled American veterans better known as the a V. they're working every day to make sure are disabled vets get the benefits and

with Jeff Hall ... national employment director about their jobs programs and their new guide for companies looking to hire and retain disabled vets [noise]\nMaybe you know we provide a ... a lot of different services free to veterans and their families but to have a program dedicated to the employment was just a part of the equation so as we kind of moved through the process we were\nYou know sponsoring career fairs we started out slow but we work with recruit military and we sponsor nearly a hundred and fifty career fairs each year and that's a lot of dialogue with\nBoth on both sides of the table both with veterans what they're looking for how we can help them as well as on the employers' side of the table what they're looking for and the challenges that they may be encountering especially when it comes to disable veterans and what we learned very quickly was companies there's so many that are excited to hire and not just veterans but\nVeterans disability because of a whole host of things that they represent\nFrom everything from tax tax incentive ... tax incentives to uh just the fact that these men and women have had to overcome um\nYou know in many cases

fifty nine thank you\nNow with CBS eye on veterans powered by connecting that's dot com I may be that Eric day [noise]\nAccording to the autism society over three point five million Americans for about one percent of our total population\nAre living with autism\nWhat you might not think about is it their families are living with it to\nFamilies like the ... maybe that Sean and his wife she'll let us live in Minnesota with they're beautiful family\nA family that includes for children free of which have autism\nAfter seeing the devastatingly sad story of medics rich a young boy with autism and wandered away from his father and was later found dead the brunt of just reached out to be wanting to share their story in hopes that it would help other families dealing with autism and just as important we help the community at large understand how they might be able to help those family\nThree children that have autism when people come up to you or you come up to someone what's the first thing you think that people should know in ...\nPeople to help those family\nThree children that have autism when people come up to you or you come up to someone what's the first thing you think that people should know and understand about what it's like to raise children who have autism\nUm it would be nice if they understood that every child has a different\nUm even though we have three children with autism each one is on a different level of the spectrum and that's why they call it a spectrum so our six year old Brandon he's in regular classroom with you know his his kids his age he's not in special education he talks looks exactly like you know his\nPeers there's nothing that if you talk to him for about five minutes you wouldn't even be able to tell that he um has been diagnosed with autism um our daughter Cameron has a little social anxiety but she's five years old and she's also on a regular classroom but our son Daniel um he's three years old and he um\nIs not talking he\nHas to be prompted to say words\nUm if his tell me it's hurting or if his foot hurts um he's not able to tell me that and like medics rich in North Carolina he is a wand or\nIf you let go of his hand he'll run off and even if you call his name he won't respond now the other children they will if you call their name just like any other mom they'll\nRespond by either being scared or they'll stop but not this one he has no sense of fear danger and he's a very attracted to water and so it's people come up to us and they look at the kids they say well this kid um\nNeeds to have autism and their final what what's wrong with this one well that's why it's called a spectrum and it's so important for people to understand that each child on the spectrum is different\nSean when you think about uh you know the years that you spend with three of your children being diagnosed with autism are the two older ones who have been\nOr normal a regular school classrooms I should say not normal uh your your youngest Daniel or what would you like people to know about the difficulties that families can face when dealing with someone who is not as high functioning on the autism spectrum\nPatience is a first and foremost you have to be patient with with all children on the spectrum because each child manifests the autism differently um\nBranding and Cameron though they're high functioning now we're not always high functioning and it's a direct result of some of the therapy that they receive through the ... Institute\nAnd this therapy is behavioral modification therapy or were you reinforce good behaviors um it takes years to\nThe ... Institute and this therapy use behavior modification therapy or were you reinforce good behaviors um it takes years to show improvement I mean we we have a six month assessment\nI'm all in twice a year to see how their progressing and very scripted programs to address the behaviors\nOr to get them to um function within normal behavior limits so they can go to a regular classroom um this therapy is intense and and can be up to forty hours per week per child and that there is in our home\nOh so if a child who's on the spectrum and does not receive any of that therapy\nUm parents are probably going to be pulling their hair out as well as other parents that are looking at them respond to their children so you have to have patience um and and meet each kid where they're at 'em it's our desire that every child who's on the spectrum receive some kind of therapy whether it be through and institutional\nSetting or I'm seriously in the home or as long as they get something that's going to help them but you have to recognize that it's not like taking a pill where two days later you feel better this is therapy that takes years to develop the right behavior ...\nSo that they can function independently\nAnd and and the thing about that too is that it's all about access and information and that's where my husband and I are talking to you know because we want to encourage and inform other parents who have special needs\nChildren are people even who know parents who they think may have special needs children about the information that we can share and how they can access\nIt I'm In one of the things that we saw with mathematics is it a people were judging the dad well how could he let that kid get away from him and you know why didn't he run after him or why didn't he um stop him from getting away and our son Daniel again is a wander and we every day or one moment away from an Amber Alert\nUm if we want to go to the park we have to have 'em volunteers\nTo come and help because we don't have family here in Minnesota and we don't have volunteers a lot of times we just stay home um and we play in the back yard and we watch a movie because it's just not safe for us to take him anywhere with with four children into adults they they have a\nPretty out numbered and so we looked down at a kid we take one child to the restroom and close the door we wash our hands and he runs off and every day I'm you know we're just moments away\nDown at a kid we take one child to the restroom and close the door we wash our hands and he runs off and every day I'm you know we're just moments away or one text message away at one Facebook post away from losing our child and it is very difficult for people who don't have children on the autism\nSpectrum to understand why didn't that debt run after his child how could he get away it happens to us every day and if you don't have a child with autism you don't understand how difficult it is to keep them safe\nIt is something that uh you know I I Know with I have a five year old he's almost six\nAnd you know he's fully able to communicate with me and even so keeping tabs on just him just won\nBy you know he's incredibly difficult but the magic of what it's like with four children and then with children who have difficulties communicating and as you said with your youngest Daniel uh being wander someone who would wander off\nWhat do you think we can do to make sure that that people are more aware of the issues that come with autism and don't judge people liked Maddox riches father who is clearly devastated by what happened I mean who would be\nA what do you think we can do to address that and make sure that people are aware of that raising children with autism\nComes with very very special circumstances\nI think it's important to just to raise the awareness um the more we can talk about\nAutism and the more you can get a your listeners engaged in talking to people who have kids on the spectrum\nI'm to understand what life is like um you know the Internet is a great resource autism speaks as a a a website that people can go to just to understand you know the challenges that people face um\nThe autism society of Minnesota is another one um yellow Ross Institute that provides behavioral therapy to\nThe Frasier school all of these uh resources are out there um but unless you have a child on the spectrum you may not know about it um you have to talk to about pediatricians and get the medical community engaged um [noise]\nWhen we were first diagnosed with a brand and you know our pediatrician was really kind of in denial I Know he'll he'll come around he'll come around he'll be found is given sometimes you let it kept pushing we kept pushing we finally get the testing and it's a battery of tests that have to be done to diagnose autism\nAlthough we did it in Houston at the university um and you know we we got the diagnosis but you can't get any services unless you get the diagnosis and it's so important\nIt is in Houston at the university um and you know we we got the diagnosis but you can't get any services unless you get the diagnosis\nAnd it's so important for people not to be in denial if they see any signs and their children if they're wringing their hands if they're\nYou know spinning around in circles or they're lining up their food and not eating it um if they're playing with imaginary butterflies it doesn't have anything to do with your parenting your great mom are great dad but it's really important that you go to\nUm your pediatrician and ask them to refer you to get a test and if they say that the child doesn't have autism then that's fine but go ahead and get a\nTest and don't worry about what the labels are and don't be afraid of what may happen if you do get the test because if you get the\nTest and it comes back that your child has autism and guess what the world opens up to a bunch of services that can help them and early intervention is the key our kids have been getting services because they got diagnosed at Eighteen months or two years old and they've been getting the services and that's why now there and\nYou know a classroom with her normally developing peers but so many times parents are in denial that they want to wait to see how it's going to play out or if they're going to\nThe kids are going to take a turn for the better and then they've lost one two three years of good autism therapy\nAnd so now the kids are at a disadvantage and there are two or three years behind their peers and it's so important that you see those warning signs that you make note of it that you talk to your doctor that you are not afraid or ashamed to get a diagnosis and then go out and get the therapy\nAll their lives but it's about\nAccess and information and the information that I that was through this applied behavior therapy or a BA therapy that my kids could do better and live better and they came into our home and like my husband say they work with the kids forty hours a week um each child gets that much therapy\nAnd we saw great improvements after just two years and now my kids are in regular classrooms my son Daniel the wander\nUm each child gets that much therapy\nAnd we saw great improvements after just two years and now my kids are in regular classrooms my son Daniel the wander who can't speak\nAs much as he would like and understand simple commands can actually read a book he can read words that he's never seen before we couldn't believe it we just found this out a couple of weeks ago so now we know we can communicate with him through language the written word and that's amazing it would\nNever have happened had we not gotten to early diagnosis have we been in denial and tried to put it off had we not want it to put labels on him and had we not gotten the services early enough to make a difference before school starts and so now I Know that my kids can graduate from college they can get married they can make me a grandma when the time is right because\nWe got the services early enough to make a difference in their lives\nWere some of the national organizations that you're aware of that you think would be most beneficial to families who are dealing with all his\nUm like my husband said um the autism society or in their local state um each state has an autism society um autism speak is another a great organization I'm ever university has um a pediatric um department and they have researchers\nIn the neurological department and a lot of times they are the ones who um do the autism diagnoses\nAnd just connecting with the developmental pediatrician and a developmental psychologist um who can put you in touch with organizations but you know we have talked to our regular therapists are speech therapist an occupational therapist in our school professionals to say hey who do we contact how can we get in touch with people because we're up in Minnesota\nWith no family and friends and we don't know who to go to because we don't\nYou know all of our friends have older children who have graduated from college ... how do we get in touch with someone and you know once they put us in touch with one organization then we can go\nTo a group meeting and talk to other parents it's about connecting with the parents and getting the information they have access to those services\nUm but you got to get yourself into those communities and those group meetings and and and then you can find out about what's going on and who the best speech therapist is in town and who the best of who who's the volunteer organization in town and you know what's coming up next the fund raiser the runs the racist the walks\nUm the you know the the the you know camps all that happens when you get out there and you start connecting with people just like you connect to veterans you know the the autism\nUm the you know the the the you know camps all that happens when you get out there and you start connecting with people just like you connect to veterans you know the the autism moms and dads they have to connect with one another because every piece of information I found out\nCame from another mom or another day of a child who had autism who had been in the fight a little bit longer than me and that's why my husband and I always reach back to try to pull up another parent who just got recently diagnosed with their child with autism or\nYou know who suspect that there may be a diagnosis coming so that we can get them every ounce of information and support that we had um given to us\nA show and I wanted to ask you if there's a message that you could give to the parents out there who might have just recently received a diagnosis of autism with their child what was your message to them be\nTake action um yes you've got the diagnosis that opens up a whole world of services be active and\nCurious ask a lot of questions or you don't get the services unless you have the diagnosis and make sure you always advocate for your children\nStill become somewhere between one hundred and three hundred thousand veterans going to school and the

sometimes called science or talks\nGained popularity and juicing is a term that refers to combining fruits and vegetables in a juice or or juicing machine and you grind that stuff all up into something you can actually during\nWhile juicing may help you get the five to nine recommended servings of fruits and vegetables each day that alone is not a balanced diet and I don't think that that even really counts as we'll talk about that\nTo certain foods like any I you know we want to respect that and we would want to become systematic about our approach to removing foods from one's diet but you know what a sensitivity to elect in ... is like\nI truly haven't had many people come to me and say that they have elected in sensitivity and I think it it would present probably like most other GI symptoms or there might be some um discomfort floating and maybe some bowel issues for them you know along with it um\nThat said I think um it's a it's maybe\nNot as much of a concern as it's made out to be because most foods that are higher and let them like beans um are generally cooked and when they're cooked that leptin is broken down and so it's really not in an issue\nUm and truly does the benefits to eating beans is is is a known and in quite good for us so I Would I Would recommend people\nAn issue um and truly than the benefits to eating beans as is is known and and quite good for us so I Would I Would recommend people to eat beans\nFor there are a lot of people do who think electrons are a problem\nAnd there is a or a best selling book on uh I saw it on Amazon I looked it up when he started talking about when I knew we were going to talk about lessons 'cause I'd never heard of him [laughter]\nAnd it's called the plant paradox the hidden dangers in healthy foods is cause disease in a way to gauge how to fire a cardio vascular surgeon okay um and he says you got to avoid the collective they're ready for\nIt and doing this or sell a book and the remember ever races and simple and daunting factor is electrons are everywhere thankfully Dr ... offers simple\nWe easily can employ to avoid them including peculiar veggies oh ... you ever heard of that\nI Would recommend not doing it if you don't have to\nPower I shop for fruit in season I guess that makes sense because he says the a fruit when it's not a completely ripe can that contains a more electrons and you want to avoid the swap you're brown rice for your white rice I guess that's probably okay\nWell and if I Would say if someone surely doesn't think they have an issue or sensitivity to my again which I don't know that we can quantify if anyone would um in fact having brown rice having a whole grain\nWould actually be preferred unless you have a reason um and hopefully medical reason not to\nTo have that so we were in unless indicated otherwise I Would say people should have their whole grains I'm so I Would prefer that people would eat their brown rice over their white rice most of the time\nYou didn't buy this book didn't know I didn't but there's all sorts of cookbooks\nTo or the will avoid like where is your diet it sounds I actually like it's impossible but they're out there and us Kelly Clarkson says I read this joke at work his shoes singer and she said my auto immune disease is gone and I am thirty seven pounds lighter\nBecause if she's been on this low intellect and\nIt's another fad I type of fat diets that if you limit some foods that you we are going to lose weight\nRight and I think if if you are to look at the computer to look this up and looking at it like many fad diets and is restrictive nature and so there are many foods that\nAnd I think if if you are to look at if you were to look this up and looking at it like many fad diets it is restrictive in nature and so there are many foods that are eliminated and so when you start eliminating many foods\nThe likelihood of someone losing weight is you know ... is probable and unlikely to happen and oftentimes when people lose weight and their their body responds differently they do feel better uh so\nThat said a lot of the foods that are suggested that be eliminated in this election free diet are very healthy nutritious foods and actually our foods that\nAre thought to be anti inflammatory and and that it's kind of a counter argument that that they some will say they're inflammatory but there's other substances in that food that are actually known to be anti inflammatory if we are so bad I I Would say it's a fad or\nDo you do think there's any good evidence to suggest that you ought to be on a low locked or lower to diet [noise]\nNo I don't think anyone should be on a a low ... diet absolutely because I I don't I don't think it's possible\nTo eliminate license because they're in all plants and we want people to eat plants now within the plant family there are certain types of plants that people may have sensitivities to and I think if that's the case again we'd probably want to take a systematic approach to looking at one's diet and and trying to eliminate foods\nI'm In a way that doesn't eliminate all and so and there would be a re introduction of it's because we don't want people to be an overly restricted diets\nUm because that's not um an easy way to live life in in terms of the long term healthy diet and so we want people eat as as many healthy foods as they can and to avoid the ones that truly give them problems and it to for some people it you know just in terms of food sensitivity that might just be\nHow it it might be how it's cooked it might be the dos and the amount that you eat at any one time so often times there's there's ways around to include foods but maybe just within a reasonable way of doing it\nAll right so now we have to talk about probiotics that her last few minutes because as long as we're just rolling around at a phrase that she's going to die because of all the probiotics for what she heard on the news this morning and so again when you talk about fads but circling back around that probiotics are bad or is that what the message messages\nAnd I think that the messages that it's an emerging science and I think\nWhen you talk about fads but circling back around the probiotics are bad or is that what the message messages\nAnd I think that the messages that it's an emerging science and I think as well as more and more research is done in this area where we're seeing maybe a study that is showing benefits and then we may see a a study that shows the opposite and and and does not show those benefits and so I think\nThere's much to be learned um about up and got micro biome that's the the bacteria that naturally live within us and and its role um in our health and disease states and so I think more to come\nUm that said when we talk about probiotics as being a dietitian and I I Will bring the conversation back to food and ... and you're there and yogurt and there's this one is that made me naturally have some ... and then there's foods that are considered pre by addicts that may or help the set up the environment within your got\n'em to be healthier place to maybe promote a gut Flora that may be healthy healthier beneficial\nSo the story that your friend her this morning and found that were referring to there's taking the capsules pills that are labeled as probiotics that's one thing and then there's eating a serving of come outta or sauerkraut and isn't that line getting blurred\nRight and I think when we step into that arena of taking a probe a probiotic or even having a drink\nRecognizing that this is an unregulated industry and so you can say that you have this strain of of bacteria or this much of this bacteria but quite honestly\nWe don't know that that's absolutely true and we can't say with certainty that that's the best thing or that's going to be an benefit you and I again we've just I don't think we have that science yet and so I think it comes back to\nBuyer beware um and there are some people that report that they feel very well when they take a pro by addict capsule or that they may have a drink that contains a pro buyout it\nNow whether that's a true a factor if that's a placebo effect and we don't know um I think if it if they're an otherwise healthy person they can they could they can probably practice that safely but that's not to say that that's the case for everyone guard will let me tell our listeners\nI guess ... if they're an otherwise healthy person they can they could they can probably Pakistan safely but that's not to say that that's the case for everyone\nAll right well let me tell our listeners what we're referring to and it's two reports that came out recently in the journal cell which is a peer reviewed journal by the way\nAnd it says quote a cast further doubt on the benefits of the highly commercialized pro by addict products\nBecause they are marketed as dietary supplements not drugs protests by addicts do not need to be approved by the FDA for claims that they\nPrevent or treat any health conditions are basically these two studies said they did not like most of the patients who took them they all went they went in one and then came out the other than the other was a concern that your friend referred to was the fact that if you have taken an antibiotic\nIt may actually daycare got longer to recover if you take broke probiotics\nUm versus letting Mother Nature hammer away but do it that way\nThough I suspect get food yeah I think that's exactly right\nAnd and eating nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and whole grains allow your body to have their ... the proper environment you can play with the ph or how that foods you know the fibers and and how things are digesting data set up an environment that's going to promote media house yes Laura are juicing as good\nWill decide that they were you know [laughter] All right for them they're good winter seldom is about probiotics are certainly some question about whether or not or the claims are true and like there is that probably not to worry about having to it and I said it's in your diet\nKatie raspy dietitian Mayo Clinic thanks so much for being with\nThank you feel like I'm On a Mayo Clinic radio and learn more about poly cystic kidney disease and later on in the program common diseases hair [noise] yeah the health related question you'd like to answer a topic you'd like to cover [noise] completed anytime that has\nOr so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years or there's not a big uh\nI Would say the the need for the U.S is by one year or so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years or there's not a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that means many years to study but so far this is kind of expectation that's how it's gonna\nIt's got to believe that this loud fantastic do how do most patients find out that they have this disease and if you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history [noise]\nAh so mostly the majority of the patients will have someone in the family that has been cities and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnosed by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the news we see this this and we have kind of criteria is and how many sewers and depending on the age because the older you are the more you have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by alter sound and then we can do as teams can order them or not to look more at that kind of the the kidney system because the kidney and on weekends um give a prognosis or how the patient would do depending on how the system are\nAt the Beijing wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and see yeah there's about\nFive to ten percent of the patients that don't have a family history so that could be either a new patient so new defect in the gene that just happened in these patients and usually the first sign of either high blood pressure or they get some kind of beating from the ... so they see blood and urine and they get pain and the ... and they're back\nOr or sometimes an infection in the system and they get a fever and then the pain and then uh they get the imaging and that you are probably and then they get a CAT scan or some kind of image and there's the ... and they were\nDiagnosed him with do high blood pressure or blood in the yard for people who have poly cystic kidney disease or there's a whole family history and um what is the takeaway what are those patients need to know\nSo it's really an exciting news for all these patients for example yesterday I offered the treatment for one of the patients who ... who kind of told me the story that even in the Eighteen hundreds\nThey know that they had some kind of ... or some kind of kidney disease and actually when she knew that there's an FDA approved drug she started crying actually for several minutes it was very exciting you're still for these patients first they need to make sure that they're getting good health care so [noise]\nUh in terms of blood pressure and then see if they are eligible for this medication\nOr so not all the patients would need to be treated in fact so some are slow progress or sold their system\nUh in terms of blood pressure and then see if they are eligible for this medication\nSo not all the patients would need to be treated in fact so some are slow progress or so\nThere are some small enough and small number that they don't need to be on any treatment except just being healthy and ... a treat the blood pressure but some patients will progressed very fast and they wouldn't need a the houses in their forties fifties at least patient would benefit most from the treatment so it's important for these patients to be checked\nTo know where they kind of are\nAre they slower fast progressing and then uh probably screen their kids as well now that there's a treatment we're recommending that to be checked for for this disease because there's something to do about it in a drug widely available\nIt's very unusual just got approved in may there's many logistics around this medication it's regulated by the FDA and we need a lot of blood testing every month for the first year and a half it is available it's kind of expensive trucks oh probably than you and how the insurance would cover and\nSo forth but we're working with all the patients who are asking about it and we're kind of doing something that we're in is the kind of these patients come to their uh can you doctors be checked and also check their kids and what's next in the research\nA lot of things are exciting actually a male so we have well great tomato became the center and we do a lot of translation research in a way that we do research in the lab and try to translate it to the patience to to get treatment so we have a new targets actually we were very excited about\nAnd a couple of drugs or medications that could be effective so hopefully that would be the next to the treatment for ... um to help not only slow down to tofu cure the disease and not have any ... century while so that would be fabulous what's already knew
