deployments to helping with hurricane recovery the citizen soldiers and airmen of the guard are taking care of business worldwide also having to take care of business in their civilian lives\nIn a way guard members have both an active and veteran type status with a foot in both worlds their boss has got both feet in the world of the guard\nAir force General Joseph ... is the twenty eighth chief of the national guard bureau I had a chance to speak to the general about his thirty plus year career the present issues he's focused on as the top guardsman and what the future holds for our National Guard [noise]\nMy job is the chief for the national guard bureau is to essentially um you know do a do several things one is\nUm we are the channel of communications from the department of defense to the fifty four states territory's in a district of Columbia a National Guards and as you know those are a non federal entity that reside under command and control of the governors that's that's what makes our piece\nOf of the military a little bit different as we can be mobilized both by the ... United States in by the governors ah from which states we come and are just much like there are four thousand five hundred Florida and Georgia national guardsmen who are mobilized today in response to hurricane Michael that just went through the panhandle of Florida in southern Georgia\nAnd then so that's a kinda unique thing so first thing is I I I convert what the Pentagon needs them to do and to state and and and the non federal uh policies and guidance that that worked for the fifty four\nAnd said that's kind of the first thing second thing I Do is because I make sure that they spend the federal dollars 'cause the first thing\nOn federal policies and guidance that that worked for the fifty four\nAnd said that's kind of the first thing second thing I Do is\nThat I make sure that they spend the federal dollars 'cause the first thing we do in the national guard as as we train a for our wartime mission sets the aren't yet as part of United States army and party United States air force\nIs important that uh our training is focused on delivering the combat capabilities that our services require when they when the president ... says us and sends us to war and\nIf you were somewhere that doesn't carry PBC their request they do in the meantime support our state wide local businesses and she was Arizona beers whenever you get a chance that can bring company the most awarded burying Arizona since Nineteen Ninety four in the heart of downtown Prescott\nYou are listening to CBS I on veterans powered by connecting that's dot com I may be better Eric day\nNo back to our talk with general Josef ... twenty eighth chief of the national guard bureau and member of the joint chiefs of staff\nGeneral you and I both know that the soldiers airmen sailors Marines they see someone with stars on their shoulder and they are a little bit reticent at times to address the issues they're facing bring up their complaints their concerns\nMilitary families usually do not have the same reticent so what are the military families in particular telling you about the difficulties that they're facing or what they'd like to see addressed when it comes to the guard\n[noise] well in terms of families telling us or you know issues it's\nThey they they want a you know they would prefer to have a a more stable um access to health care I think one of their top issues is\nFinding a way if we can to find you know try care or you know reserves select being able to be available and perhaps evenly even funded for\nUm you know the reserve components in\nAcross the board and of course it's that's a there's a bill that goes with that I mean the good news is luckily most the members serving in the military relatively healthy\nBut in a a across the board and of course that's that's a there's a bill that goes with that I mean the good news is luckily most are members serving in the military relatively healthy\nUm but ah you know access to a continuous healthcare so you don't have to trust the transition from one to another is is a constant ask\n'em you know from our from our ah our families out there another one might be um you know is a you know there are some clearly that ah that question the hey this this is the reserve commitment and and sometimes\nYou know family members are serving in the military tend to want to volunteer and deployed to go someplace and and uh they're doing deployments and they're doing very important things around the world for instance up a president's mission in the in the\nUh in the Pacific whether you're deployed to Thailand or whether you're deployed to the Philippines or whether you are deployed over there so that you can work with our allies and partners which is one of Secretary Mattis is\nPrime lines of effort inside the national defense\nStrategy is uh sometimes they don't see the connection between the importance of that strategic presidents mission\nOr that might not be a in Afghanistan or Iraq so it's conveying to them the importance of what the rule we play now is is operational force across all mission sets I'm not just engaged can ethically perhaps in in Afghanistan and Iraq\nThe military is having recruiting issues this is something that has been acknowledged by each branch of the service it has to do with\nA number of factors the stress put on by multiple deployments you've got a lack of physical fitness among the recruiting pool or how is the guard at dealing with the military recruiting issue that that I assume is facing you just because it's facing each other branch of the service\n... Eric gr recruiting is a is really one of our top priorities are right now and and that leads directly to renting is if you can't\nFill out your formations and find appropriate people who were fit and qualified and trained and ready to go\nThen you aren't part of the United States Army and printing I nice states or force that they need and and so on the air side on the Air National guard this year we we exceeded are recruiting goals and we made the end strength the allocated to us by the air force\nOr on the army's side and like all of the army components the active the reserves and and the national guard we fail to recruit the number of people we needed\nUm and that's a problem so I think uh we are uh\nTones the active the reserves and and the national guard we failed to recruit the number of people we needed\nUm and that's a problem so I I think uh we are uh you know trying to get our brand out there we feel like we need to make sure people understand exactly what it is that there are signing up for that to have an opportunity to serve and the guard not only at home\nUh but around the world and I'll tell ya you know the the homeland mission is is something that is unique to us well when we have a devastating emergencies everybody pitches in all components all services everyone but as I was down there and panel Florida last week and I saw\nThe national guard delivering food and delivering water and doing the delivering supplies\nThat these folks who are just absolutely devastated by hurricane Michael I mean there was a real sense of service to the community that is meaningful it's meaningful to a lot of people as meaningful to the people that community you appreciate it at\nA very very much that you know in this devastation there is someone out there that has a capacity and the capabilities still to make sure that we're doing OK and a lot of people want to be part of that\nAs you mentioned the domestic front is one that the national guard is unique in the military and how they respond to issues like hurricanes Michael of course feeding Florida just this past week before that we had Florence in the Carolinas and actually that the loan a guard member on our staff Kayla Jackson she was activated to go down to North Carolina for that\nAh it's been a busy couple of years since uh since uh since we started here connecting that's on the domestic front or how is that going for the guard is that something that we've been able to deal with positively as far as what seems to be an increase in these events that we need to mobilize the guard for\n[noise] um yeah ... you know it is it is something that ah we plan for we do it's it it is let me stress first that you know the response to any domestic response is always a a team effort and it's a team effort to bomb the the first in local responders who owned the immediate response peace\nOr augmented by the national guard augmented by all of the you know federal installations that happened to be around who come out of their gates and save people's lives and and do things regardless of what service there and um you know combined with a a really well coordinated in synchronized effort by us northern command\nWho's charges to synchronize all the military activity DOD activity or a port of FEMA and da and the first responders and and I think that we really have gone a long way towards refining that process and and it's\nOh Dee activity or a port of FEMA and da and the first responders and and I think that\nWe really have gone a long way towards refining that process and and it's played out very very well in this last Hurricane Florence and current hurricane Michael was really really seamless so you know my thanks to Kayla for deploying down to a disservice or governors states like\nShe was with a in North Carolina about seven thousand other guardsmen are in North Carolina South Carolina that their responded to that and\nYou know I think it's a it is a unique piece of what we do we we planned for a we're in the communities I as I was in the\nPanhandle of Florida this past week I went to several our Marines who there were guardsmen posture it inside those armor as\nA right there in Panama City Florida waiting for passage of the hurricane so they could run out the doors and and help police officers and firefighters and communicators and first responders and rescue people\nAnd their own facilities in their own homes were uh in fact demolished by that hurricane so um you know we we are there that our presence across all of the nation and twenty six hundred communities\nAllows us to be there at the point of impact from any disaster what what whatever it is whether it's a fire or a tornado a hurricane you know we're in the response business and we coordinate\nWith first responders the people who are charged with making sure that you have an organized response on the ground at the scene and they know us and they know what capabilities we bring and a really a a thing of beauty to watch inside an emergency operations center\nAnywhere you go at any kind of emergency you'll see these people know each other they partner they're integrated and um it is a a a great way to speed or the saving of lives and and and mitigate a the suffering of people want to bet when these kinds of events happen\nWe're speaking with General Joseph one gal United States air force the twenty eighth chief of the national guard bureau you mentioned it earlier you sit on the joint chiefs of staff the chief of the national guard bureau is a fairly recent addition to the joint chiefs\nTell us exactly what you do uh on the ... the joint chiefs of staff and also what's it like a chief of staff something that I Can't imagine you could have predicted earlier on in your career now I certainly\nCouldn't predicted it and um you know I think uh it is a it's it's a great honor for me to be part of that group that I'm you know advise is the most senior civilian leaders in our in our nation and um you know that is uh in\nIs a it's it's a great honor for me to be part of that group that I'm you know advise is the most senior civilian leaders in our in our nation\nAnd um you know that is in effect what members of the joint chiefs do is they provide best military advice so that civilian leaders in our nation can make decisions on on what they believe is the is the best option and the best uh um thing for the nation's do for our national security and\nAnd so all members of the joint chiefs do that they're a bunch of really smart or vigils that I work with representing the joint chiefs from all the services\nAnd um you know like you say it is new and uh you know I think we're still in the process inside the national guard bureau of\nDeveloping a staff that can ... that can support to and and develop the knowledge and um you know so you can add value you want to be an an added value peace the piece that I bring this different from the other members is that that connection to a non federalized piece of the force\nWhich is a big piece I mean we have two million folks about serving in the military us all the services all the reserve components\nAs you mentioned in your opening remarks the national guard is more than twenty percent of that ad four hundred and fifty thousand people so for me to be able to invade the impact the availability of the issues with readiness of the force um is a is quite an honor for me to do and I enjoyed it very much\nMilitary operations have changed um it's kind of like ... you know you you may think you're not in the cyber world but we always sit there and we use cyber and networks and the like every single day so it's an impossibility that our future force structure in the national guard whatever\nThat looks like whatever services in is not somehow connected and utilizing or the ... the components of space force\nUm we have currently a in the national guard um you know ... a relatively small amount of space but space across the department is not hugely big in terms of structure so we have about a thousand people inside the national guard to do everything from you know space control a you work as\nDepartment is not hugely big in terms of structure so we have about a thousand people inside the national guard to do everything from you know space control a you work as augment teas and launch operations or or\nUm you know eat as much as considered spaces sitting in a ground based midcourse defense missile silos in the center of Alaska to protect us from incoming a ICBM threats to all of that kind of considered space folks\nUm you know what the ultimate space force looks like where it's located um has not been determined and there's a there's a way to go and what that is but you know I think that our missions that's for sure I Will definitely be connected to the space force and so innovation you know it's it's part of everything we do as as part of the chief where\nAs part of my priorities as is try to find um you know some new new ways to use old things how is it that we can adapt and transform ourselves to be a more ready for some more lethal force be a better contributor\nTo the army into the air force and now we've looked inside our our staff in some of that as an recruiting and how can we train more innovative Lee and we've looked at training models that states have options to is\nYou know should we moved to something different than a weekend a month and two weeks a year would would for ten day blocks be better kind of a training model for us to look at it so we're trying to look across the enterprise to say how can we take the most precious commodity our our guardsmen have which is time their access to them to train them to integrate with them\nAnd make a more ready lethal force and and so we have a lot of lot of people working on that and it's a it's a lot of time takes a lot a lot of our on our thoughts and when we do a National Guard were these days\nAs far as where space forces located seems simple to me we need a base on the moon obviously that's where the space where should be paid status and we've been speaking with General Joseph ... chief of the national guard bureau generally you just mentioned recruiting again\nLet me ask you as we finish shop here Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen year old comes up to you and says hey why should I joined the national guard what do you tell that person\n[noise] well I tell them or you know first of all the him part of the military has been the most satisfying a thing in my in my life I mean you will do more see more and I feel like you've accomplished more given the opportunity to achieve more than any other program out there that that I can think of it it's enormously\nA satisfying to work in this environment on such a such a competent dedicated motivated team\nBut there's lots of reasons to do it if you if your\nA satisfying to work in this environment

community we provide we provide training in cyber we provide training in space we provide training in aviation if you want to be a pilot that's it's a good way to do it\nUm you know sometimes many many states have tuition reimbursement for if you want to go to college and you're willing to trade some of your time and serve in the national guard you know you can go to college for free and so long as you decide to ah serve inside a you know your National Guard in your state states will pay your tuition\nI'm for you to to go to uh be a member of the national guard and then it is just it is so much\nFun to be a part of this team it's been really is a huge joy in my life\nWhen CBS Iowa veterans returns will learn about a partnership between the VFW hand the national barber franchise for

we talk to connecting bets dot com reporter\nOrganizations will cold call or cold email veterans and no charge money while claimed to assist phrase veep pension claim dental took your credit card information over the phone that is a huge red flag\nProbably didn't know this past friday was the national day of the deployed\nOfficially designated day to recognize the sacrifices made by our military and their families during deployment but we'll friday was the official day on any given day tens of thousands of our service members are deployed\nNow there are differences in deployments from the links to whether they're stationed overseas out on a ship or operating in a war zone but whatever the differences are the service members and their families are all going through some similar issues\nThat something basketball I'm a retired army judge knows very well having herself gone through the difficulty deployment can cause for a family\nThat is now the senior director of programs and services at Syracuse university's Institute for veterans and military families or I. B. M. F. she joined me from the Syracuse campus to talk about deployment issues specifically as they relate to families\nHow did you come to be a part of the IBM F. up there at Syracuse it doesn't seem like maybe a a natural progression for someone who was a judge and a lawyer while serving in the military\nRight it was a little something unexpected but I learned all about the IV and that's sad because we lived here in the community and we are very involved with the university and what the universe the ROTC program\nI met the folks who had comprise the staff members of the ivy enough I learned what they were all about and I thought you know what this is exactly what I Want to do after I serve and the arts\nMet the folks who uh comprise the staff members of the ivy enough I learned what they were all about and I thought you know what this is exactly what I Want to do after I serve in the army I Want to take off that uniform but I Want to continue serving those who served\nIn for those who are familiar with IBM ethic someone who you served with walks up to you and says what exactly does the Institute for veterans and military families in Syracuse do what you told that person [noise]\nIt's very exciting the IBM eh friend the number of programs across entrepreneurship career preparation unemployment and community engagement initiatives we provide actionable of research and we do it all to better ... those who are transitioning out of the uniform back into their communities\nOwn landscape company that does it all more a proud member of the better Business Bureau or the loop plus rooting license bonded insured in gear\nFree after months please call ... seven seven eight Thirteen fifty nine thank you\nBack now with CBS I on veterans power by connecting best dot com on maybe veteran Eric day\nBack to our conversation about the effects of deployments on military families with Beth ... she's the director of programs and services at Syracuse university's Institute for veterans and military families [noise]\nHave you talked about some of the programs that you're aware of that are available for those families and for those military members during a deployment\nSure let me talk about some of the program's first and then we can switch to protections um [noise]\nThe IV and that has a community based program right now it's called America's serves and what it does it helps integrate I'm a number of support organizations that are already existing in your community and it helps veterans service members and their family members\nNet better navigate those resources so say you're a things are tight you need a little extra help financially or maybe your spouse's deployed and that's the time you think you know I I don't have any\nAre things are tight you need a little extra help financially or maybe your spouse's deployed and that's the time you think you know I I don't have any kids right now I'm going to look at you know getting a job\nUh America's serves finds a way to bring all of those resources together in a comprehensive way so that you don't have to go out in search of them it pulls them all together for you\nBut certainly a good thing to be able to have those kind of one stop shop for him to be brought together and when it comes to the protections that are available for families out there whether their financial or otherwise what are some of the things you're aware of that you think a more family should know about\nSure um there's federal laws that protect family members there is a uniformed services employment and re employment Rights Act and in general\nThat was a enacted to help eliminate employment discrimination because of someone service in the military so it's not uncommon at all that if someone is call to duty to serve you know for a\nPeriod of a year that they might fear that their job might not be available when they come back there's laws and protections that are out there and those are good to know about in advance so that service members can set them up to return and ease back into their life before the deployment\nOf seamless manner\nAnd of course there are other protections out there that\nPeople can undertake themselves I think back to watching a F ing commercials about power of attorney and that's an important thing for someone who's deployed isn't it and even though those commercials were put out their ad ... everybody overseas\nHow many people really pay attention to the difference between a general and special power of attorney where can people go to find out about more things like that you being a bit of a legal expert\nOh absolutely so every installation has a legal assistance office usually you can go in on a walk in basis and request the power of attorney and they can talk to you about what type of power of attorney you might need depending on the situation you want to prepare yourself for\nAnd for those who are listening and you you being a lawyer and a judge the difference between power of attorney as I understand them as a way in and basically from what I remember of commercials special power of attorney is for specific items in general power of attorney is essentially to run everything is that correct\nExactly Gerald powers of attorney or a little more abroad and although\nIf it's items in general power of attorney is essentially to run everything is that correct\nExactly Gerald powers of attorney or a little more abroad and although the term general is used they may not be helpful if you wish to make a significant financial decision on selling item like a car or make decisions involving the kids\nSo you might need to get a special power of attorney that specifically says you know I give permission for my spouse to sell my car while I'm gone because both of your names are on\nThe title to that car you might also need special power of attorney for certain types of care for the children ah when my husband and I were both active duty we had to have a family care plan ready which should both of us be deployed at the same time\nA designated responsibilities to one of our parents to take care of the kids and that required special power of attorney but all those questions can be asked by a folks who are manning the legal assistance office at your local installation\nIf people are looking for more information on resources like this is I've EMS have anything available to them or is there someplace else that you would direct them to find a all about all these sorts of resources and information\nI Would recommend the ivy meth website for a host of a number of programs and resources that are available during deployment during peacetime you know during times of peace crisis or war ah also E. S. G. R. dot Neal is a great resources resource should folks have questions about\nA status of their uh ... employment before during or after a deployment\nAlso local installations a if folks are stationed at at an active duty military base those faces have excellent resources\nFor those family members and often even if someone's in the guard and reserve if their family member is activated they generally have access to their resources on an installation like any other active duty soldier would\nOf course the do the deployed is friday October twenty six but every day of the year there are tens of thousands of American military members\nOn deployment on any given day walking the supporters and allies of the military do to get involved in show support not just on the day of the deployed throughout the year\nOn any given day what can the supporters and allies of the military do to get involved in show support not just on the day of the deployed throughout the year\nShore you know it's funny we just got a I just got an email this weekend from a local member of the Syracuse community who in his spare time as a master sergeant in the civil affairs unit and he reached out his unit has been deployed to hide the horn of Africa\nSo not the normal type of deployment that folks think of when they think either Baghdad or Afghanistan but there's a units that are deployed all around the world\nAnd you know what Eric he asked for too simple things\nHe asked for and that's due flag to send to hang on the wall to remind them of the soldiers that he's with back to remind them of home\nAnd then he also asked if we could not forget about the spouses and the families that are selling the Syracuse area and if we can arrange for a little something special here at the university during that deployment\nWow that's a great story on there of course so many stories like that but there are so many people deployed who just use a little bit of assistance from organizations individuals if you if you know someone who's over there\nI can tell you when I was in Afghanistan and a buddy of mine sent me over some food but his family and marriage and and my dad's in over a whole thing of Dunkin' Donuts coffee certainly make a difference while you're over there knowing that people back home are thinking about you\nWrite care packages are always appreciated a while on deployment\nAnd then I remember you know you often hear folks who said don't worry about me do something for my family and something as simple as bringing a crock pot over that's full of Chile to kind of take care of dinner for a couple of nights for a mom who's busy with kids or an offer\nTo baby sit to let that parent gets some time off while uh those kids are taken care of by a friend or relative those simple gestures really make a world of difference\nWe've been speaking with basketball from\nSyracuse University and other people are interested in finding out more about ivy I'm

biggest piece of advice that you would give to those aspiring entrepreneur is out there looking to to start up their own organization like canine flew\nAgain we're so lucky right now I mean even in just a few years I've been out of the military there's so many great programs that are popping up around the country in every state and around most major cities so you just have to find that local networks that local groups\nAnd whether it's bunker labs or on you know I have also used to store which is a national organization and I even want to business competition through to them earlier this year to score and Sam's Club\nBut all of their services are free on and you don't even have to find a mentor within your own state if there's a mentor to that\nYou know you just need maybe help with\nDistribution and there's a mentor and another state than you know you can partner with friends so I I highly recommend them as an organization and\nYeah and it's best I think to just be involved in any type of of local veteran entrepreneur group is that something that you want to do and and my experience with all of these groups as\nThey're just they're very positive everyone's coming

veterans have a pension coming in or disability benefits or something like that apparently the VA has taken notice of bison you recently did a story focusing on what the VA is going to try to do to stop these scam artist from targeting or elderly bad so what can you tell us about the story in general\nSo the VA pension is intended to help financially distressed wartime veterans and their families\nAre but veterans looking for a pension should be aware of anyone who offers to move their financial assets around\nIn order to qualify so basically the scam is targeted at people who actually do not qualify for a pension right but these would be basically fake financial planners coming convince them to move money into an era vocal trust or to insurance products are in charge an exorbitant fees along the way\nSo essentially they're coming in and maybe not even doing anything illegal but certainly doing something shady in convincing these elderly veterans to move their funds

men's stays high but it leveled off [laughter]\nSo it is a time in life that is both a change related to changes in hormones but I think pointing out it's not an abrupt change and abrupt uptick but think about other things that happened to women around the uh at age fifty fifty one which is the average age of ... us\nOff and they become empty nesters they have changes in jobs changes of physical activity to get a bomb near ... and they get less active there a lot of things that come around that time that can confound and worse than an increased risk for cardiovascular disease has a special time\nShe's a three and I just feel does estrogen I'll protect the heart [noise]\nSo complicated question [noise] um we believe so\nOh really is I just feel sorry [laughter] does estrogen help protect the heart [noise] so complicated question [noise]\nUm we believe so um the endogenous or the estrogen that is in our bodies in during the pre menopausal state we think that that it because they're estrogen receptors on every blood vessel in the body and it keeps women's blood vessels um elastic and healthier\nGets more complicated though in terms of and I don't want any of the listeners to hear that yes oh that means I should add estrogen back\nTo protect my heart after menopause so the women's health initiative showed that at least in older women who were a few years past menopause adding estrogen back\nDidn't help them didn't help their hearts it may be and this is the the the question that continuing it at a low dose if you're gotta already healthy heart I'm early after menopause might be something but the general rule is we don't recommend\nAdding estrogen back after menopause laws to protect the heart at this point [noise]\nSo let's talk about the distribute the risk factors are determined to do the same for for men and women under the same risk factors essentially for erectile dysfunction and outs armor Sudanese interestingly but so diabetes obesity\nHigh blood pressure smoking smoking a sedentary lifestyle lack of activity cholesterol\nGot cholesterol triglycerides and women so lip is as a whole um it [noise] um the standard total cholesterol we've kind of moved away from and just saying well over two hundred you have ... high cholesterol because you can have other factors in your uh cholesterol that puts you at higher risk\nUm particularly for women elevated triglycerides um which is another fat in the blood that is more influenced by dietary sugars 'em and carbohydrates as opposed to fats and genetics [noise]\nThe other is where you put on your fat and\nSo in this part [laughter]\nSo you can be normal weight but if you have a ... distribution that is mainly in your middle and your waistline as opposed and your hips and buys for women and for men that conveys an increased risk\nAnd so when you start gaining weight I'm even going from normal weight to higher weight which often happens is we get older I'm puts women it even higher risk\nHow important does activity especially postman apart so\nWhich often happens is we get older I'm puts women it even higher risk\nHow important does activity especially post menopausal\nSo when people ask me what's the most important thing I can do to prevent heart disease if they're a smoker that's number one number two is physical activity and the reason I say that is this such\nUm deep and broad strong evidence that it makes an impact not only for cardiovascular disease but for Alzheimer's and for bones and for osteoporosis and for preventing falls and being strong so physical activity is great [noise]\nThe other part is it's never too late to start physical activity we actually have scientific studies that say that women who start out and walking program over the age of sixty five actually reduce the risk of heart disease from the nurses how study so it's free\nIt's not sexy however and it's a hard habit to adopt if you hate exercise as some of my patients do you feel like your patients are getting that message and are trying to become more active in mid life so I think\nWomen are so busy and one of the things so that the answer is yes but okay but I think getting back to why I'm women don't take time to take care of themselves\nWomen are raised in a culture ate it to be caregivers their moms they are [noise] you know they're the group's leaders there often even if they're in the workforce there the moms at work\nAnd and so often when we ask women even who had a heart attack why don't you make this change or eat healthy or exercise\nI don't have time 'cause I'm driving my kids um my husband wouldn't eat that healthy food so I'm just going to make it\nAnd so flipping it so that they know that if they can do those things they will accomplish those other goals I eat caregiving and making an altruistic thing which can be very helpful and that's been my biggest success in helping people frame it when I don't have time because none of us have spent enough time to do those things its priorities and\nWe've talked about uh the the major risk factors and how important it is to keep all of those under control and exercise is extremely important let me ask you about a couple of other things with regard to heart disease prevention\nUh there's been some recent controversy a baby aspirin a day what's your feeling about that in women who don't have a history of heart disease\nSo that's an important distinction to make because nothing has changed in terms of our recommendations if you've had a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise\nNothing has changed in terms of our recommendations if you've had a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise [noise]\nFor individuals male and female particularly older individuals who are otherwise healthy don't have diabetes don't have other things\nThe risk of taking aspirin and people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription\nOr actually grader or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefits at one has a much stomach bleeding mainly young stomach and other types of bleeding because it it irritates the stomach but also you can get bleeding into your brain and women and everything we do\nAnd every medication and every intervention and cardiology women bleed more so it's a risk for men it's a bigger risk for women [noise] alright fish oil\nA fish or it was very popular I'm a five or six years ago until we started actually having data from randomized clinical trials [noise]\nSo I I asked if I have somebody come into my office in their own fish will ask why you're taking them 'cause there are other reasons and heart disease you might take fish oil\nBut I tell them to stop it yet because it's really not been shown to have any primary prevention benefits are really even secondary prevent what if they don't like fish and they think I don't like fish while this take Fishell tablets so probably doesn't help because of the recommendations is eat fish a couple of times a week\nIt's not harmful race but people who are also on blood dinners it ... if you take high dose fish oil it actually can than your blood more than I Am a less is more I go through every patient list I say why are taken it while you're taking it while you're taking it and they say I don't know I said then asked the doctor who prescribed it for why are you buying it and spending your money out of its over the counter\n[noise] All right we've been talking about heart healthy and women both are in the reproductive years and after ... with a specialist cardio cardiologist Dr sure are going to have so much\nAbility or a colleague however can then Rick or if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention a small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious\nOr if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention a small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious complications of ... where the pain per se is\nThe goal butter is very inflamed and removing it is I'm less selective in March and\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gallstones when I was in medical school it was a female back forty and fertile now I don't know whether you can still say that maybe they changed the words but is that still true\nThat still true women developed gallstones twice as often as men because of their millions of estrogen and pro Justin's in the bloodstream we know that a certain ethnic groups develop a gallstones much more often American Indians Native Americans are\nThe probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high Caucasians below that and and African Americans are less than that even so I'm uh ethnicity is important family history is very important probably a twofold are threefold increase in the likelihood of farming stones\nAre overweight states especially with the BMI over thirty the risk of gallstones is quite a bit higher\nUm and multiple others that are gradually less important fertility though the fertile part or having a pregnancy is a a high risk factor for developing stones or gall bladder sludge a precursor to stones\nA Sledge often resolves after a pregnancy and stones tend to stick around so if someone's had multiple pregnancies their likelihood of stones as much higher\nIs mostly diagnosed because there's pain present that would bring patients in\nSome most gallstones probably go undiagnosed um but the ... of\nPatients have a variety of symptoms that may or may not be related to stones\nAnd then they're usually fairly easily diagnosed by ultrasound so identification of stone's is generally straightforward except a small proportion of tiny tiny stones [noise] um but then the attribution of symptoms to the stones is sometimes a much more difficult issue\nI can tell you that there are outliers and I am one of them in the mail that forty and fertile none of them and I had my gallbladder out and that's the pain is extreme I in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar pain and since I don't fit the bill ... bladder diseases took them a while to figure that out\nPain is extreme in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar pain and since I don't but the bill preamble go butter diseases took them a while to figure that out\nBut the good thing is you can take it out through the laparoscopic dance when relatively simple straightforward surgery or in what overnight and I'm really I didn't have to change my diet at all so that the surgery has absolutely remarkable are there other treatment options beside surgery\nWell other options have been developed over many many years but with the advent of laparoscopic approaches to surgery um many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective less they're less effective uh themselves so\nClosest to me is really the only realistic option for the patient who can undergo surgery has a surgical\nCandidate [noise] All right Dr Brad Peterson gastroenterologist talking about gall bladder disease thanks so much for being with us here

upon time constitution can mean straining to have a stool and frequent stools hard stools it can mean a sense it incomplete evacuation\nSo a lot of times when visiting with patient I tried to get right to what they're experiencing rather than using the broad term and what is the cause of consternation\nWell there are lots of different causes one of the most common cause is can the diet\nEither you know eating a very low residue diet are very processed diet do you mean by the residue some more processed foods kind of ... fast foods um you know that white squishy bread that we all loved his children they wonder where it really yeah that's not so good for our digestive system\nThe other thing is skipping meals so people who are skipping meals don't experience at what we call a gastric colic reflex which is a reflex where when your stomach gets distended buy food you're colon contracts and that makes the Colin one to empty so people who are frequently skipping meals\nCan have issues with comes to patients well\nAnother real big one is not drinking fluids were not drinking the rights fluids\nAnd sometimes I'm particularly with my older male patients who may not want to
