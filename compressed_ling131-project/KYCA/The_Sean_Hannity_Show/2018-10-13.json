for having me calling\nSo you stay as that it has to do the museum\nUnlike any other I'd tell a little bit about that I don't know anything about the city museum and I'm embarrassed to say that because ... years ago when I was an actor I actually spent a couple of months in St Louis performing at the wonderful munitions summer theater there yeah yeah which is the largest theater in the United states actually\nAbout them in the piece yeah\nBut the museum is it's good to me that I Can't say enough good things about it it is it a little bit Willie Walker it's a little bit ... a little bit on house and you go\nAnd it doesn't sound like a museum [laughter] it's kinda like a a an award Korea as well and I'm like in an office go\nWell with all these reclaimed items from ... from St Louis ... around the country\nThere's a couple of airplanes you can climb through\nTheir tunnel or fly into their rooftop as a Ferris wheel and the kind of hamster habit trail like series of of tunnel but you can climb over and look out on the study and I remember the last time I went there and my husband to prepare for a couple of hours and then when I found him again he would drenched in sweat and had a smile or what\nBut you can climb over and look out on the study and I remember the last time I went there and my husband to prepare for a couple of hours and then when I found him again he would drenched in sweat and had a big smile of like a six year old because he'd just come down from all those tunnels will\nAnd you're gonna be six year old kids there I can just mostly a family attraction or no\nActually the on a roof there is a campaign or you can join a margarita before\nAfter ... or ... or all through the tunnel okay\n[laughter] that's funny wow All right well that sounds like fun then of course the most famous attraction in St Louis is the gateway arch and that just got a major overhaul right\nIt did yes it's a it just went through a three hundred and eighty million dollar renovation and the biggest change with to the area surrounding the art so in the past you might recall the when they're when you were living there um it was really a big parking lot outside and it wasn't really it's very close to downtown I'm right on the river but not connected to downtown\nSo now the whole area is a green space that landscape third benches picnic areas and it's connected to downtown by it but after and bridge so it's not just for cars out actually feel a part of the city and it's kind of a front yard to the to the to the river\nAnd they also added a new museum right\nThey they tend they did something change it to their visitor center there um so you can go and see some new things and that and instead of actually free and then you can ride up and the art I'm to the top and look out\nWe're sticking with the cake silver who is the author of a terrific new article in the Washington Post called\nSt Louis with quirky food creation sprawling green park city museum unlike any other and of course that arch the gateway city is a fun place to play you know the last time I was in St Louis I was there to look at George Washington university for my daughter\nAnd uh we went to the family and my younger daughter was pretty bored looking at colleges so we ran around and played\nAnd some amazing sued in fact we ... I I Wish I had thought of it but you suggest doing a toast did ravioli a pub hop kind of a ... I'm not saying this well tell us what that idea is\nSo you've heard of a bar crawl we add more of a toasted ravioli crawl so we'll go there and either my my cousin will sometimes have her third

explain what toasted ravioli yeah\nSo ... is a St Louis creation that it basically fried ravioli so it's thought to have been created by a chef by accident who dropped them ravioli ended up friar\nAnd they realize that were they happy mistake and it's become a St Louis table that you can find filled with me she sometimes even a barbecue 'em all around town\nWow and so you would say go to the Italian neighborhood to try\nTo hell and then in the piece I talked about Anthony nose to burn out what are the Greek and Italian Restaurant that constantly when stuff for toasted ravioli in town\nThere is also great barbeque in St Louis at least I found that when I was there\nYeah there is a great barbecue um I didn't get into that much in this case because I was so distracted by the toasted ravioli ... option\nOf and then there's also this did you ever have gooey butter coffee cake when you were there or do we better get when you were there no it is this kind of custard topped

there we will be talking with Liz Weston who is a personal finance columnist for nerd wallet she's also the author of the book your credit score\nAnd we always hear nightmares about this type of travel but you found people who are ... being timeshare owners\nExactly I have to say for decades I only heard the other side of the story which with people who were desperate to get rid of their timeshare they bought something and they realized afterwards that they couldn't use it or they tried to exchange it and they couldn't\nAnd they were just incredibly unhappy so when an editor suggested that you know I could find happy people are skeptical but when I started looking they're out there and they tend to have a few things in common one of which is they don't tend to buy time shares at those high pressure sales presentations that we all get invited to when we travel\nYeah and those are really high pressure a lot of people go to them to get the freebie that at the end not realizing that I think it's something massive like a quarter of all people who can those things end up saying\nOh yeah because they are so much better at selling than you are at resisting they sell twenty four seven and you're on vacation you're relaxed or having a great time you're in no state of mind to be looking at a contract figuring out how you can get you know messed with what the\nAh fees are going to be how the exchange possibilities are going to work uh one of the worst time to buy one of these is by by the way it's on a cruise because you can't even do the research you need to do how to get on line and really scour the the forums and find out about these thanks so the last time you want to buy it from a presentation let's\nTalk a little bit about the gotcha involved in buying it just so we you know we we laid the groundwork the gotcha is our age not assigning\nThe last time you want to buy it from a presentation let's talk a little bit\nAbout the gotcha involved in buying it just so we you know we we laid the groundwork the gotcha czar it's not a financial investment it isn't something that should be done in the hopes of selling for more money down the line right\nNever never never never the best of the time shares hold their value a little better than the worst but you're still looking at maybe five or ten percent of the value in terms of resale that you pay when you buy it retail in other words at one of those presentations so no\nDefinitely not an investment even when the when the salesman says oh time shares have gone up over time they mean the new ones the ones that you're going to be trying to solve or you're going to be in competition with a whole lot of other people\nAnd it's not a one time cost you have to pay maintenance over the years correct\nZach Lee and those maintenance fees goes up every year so it's something that you're basically locking ourselves into for life and some people who try to get rid of their time shares literally cannot even give them away so this is something you really need to think hard about is this an expense or not only comfortable taking on now but perhaps for decades in the future\nSo those folks who are happy with with their timeshare how did the boy these pit bull\nMost of them bought used in other words they bought from other owners so they bought the significant discount as I said Ninety to Ninety five percent off retail\nYou talked to a retired couple who paid fifty cents for a time share\nThey actually went for one that was a dollar and they were offered a two for one deal so they got ...\nTimes are different places where you absolutely can do that\nAnd so they paid not too too little too much to get into it and I guess they must have gone into time shares that didn't have has ski maintenance the\nYeah I think all the ... all the fees were fairly reasonable she outlined I think they're paying thirty five hundred dollars a year somewhere around that neighborhood and that seems like a lot but they are retired and they travel a lot so they get five or six weeks of travel every year out of these time shares\nAnd they also bought and this is important in attractive locations that would seem to be a no brainer but not everybody does why is that is so important for would be timeshare owners\nYou didn't home mortgage court and an L.
