surprise in the article is in a place that may be the the plate that Americans complain about the most I'm Talking about airport terminal people are finding the love of their lives\nIt's true and you know what to tell you about that I don't think people really do hate aviation I think they just like to pretend they hate aviation because when you take a look at the numbers of people and getting on an airplane multiple times a year it's just growing growing growing so I think that's a lot of you know a lot of the fact is\nPeople love to travel a lot to be going from place to place and when you get an airplane and find someone else do you feel the same way\nYou got one big hurdle strike you at that time you love to travel so if you love to travel on someone else does too I used to be on an

control tower\nThose are sort of special events can they book them out and you know and they clear a place for them there's a limited number of people who can do it\nOn those that are conducted in the airport itself sometimes happen at the airport hotel or an area in which they know they said please luggage and someone was done in in baggage in the baggage claim area\nThey also sort of you know

know the control center where you know what you're seeing the\nAirplanes living on the tarmac you're seeing the controllers telling the planes you know where to go and what to do that sort of thing it's a very I think that's very exciting I can see why people would want to do with their where's my favorite my\nFavorite I shouldn't be a nice hotel went to the airport because you get all the services of a hotel song and then you know and the view of the airport and the big airliners checking around the number of being on the big airport than I've written stories for the New York times
