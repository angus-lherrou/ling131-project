I it took me Fifteen Years of writing I'm a ... nights and weekends of really I I wrote I think we're complete novels before I finally sold one and\nI I did tons of research I found the age and I want to represent me I Would get stopped him at a party [laughter]\nUm and then we hung out in the lobby of a hotel room a hell of a hotel in Philly until three\nIn the morning with me talking to him about anything but writing just trying to make friends with the guy um and luckily it worked off even a even a workout but even after that um\nYou know he's still rejected another you know two three manuscripts of mind before I finally gave them something that he could use ironically I gave him my\nFourth novel ... novel the novel that would become control when I first novel that so and then I went to Iraq and I told them not only one thought because\nMy head in the game and if he liked it it would you know I Do to Jack up because he liked it and if he didn't like it I'd be too dumb because he didn't like it it turns out he loved it and he called my friend Pete a pure bred and super sledgehammer fantasy author your um\nI could I be to bomb because he didn't like it it turns out he loved it and he called my friend Pete a ... brat who isn't super sledgehammer fantasy author your listeners haven't um\nRead his demons cycle series or demand first one that is amazing um but my agent call him was like a ... you know ready to take it to market and the it was like a light so I sent for most of my life or in Iraq or\nYou know not knowing that [laughter]\nThat I had a book that I was ready to take out and even then when he took it to market it was still a year and a half of it getting rejected by every\nMajor publisher I'm In the English speaking language and finally ace rock um said they would consider it on a fifty percent rewrite its rock being the main fantasy and science fiction imprint of payment Random House\nAnd uh I'll tell you I once I had gotten after all those years of trying and after getting the superstar agent my agent represents I'm Brandon Sanderson he represents Charlotte Harris schooling whose books became the True Blood series on HBO so I really had major back in with this guy\nAnd still be rejected by all the publishers and only have one publisher considered a fifty percent I Can't tell you\nHow depressing that was I turned into a mosque or I was just a miserable human being and uh but I did it and are amazingly enough um that's just ... percent rewrite got me over the hump and and uh and got the book published but yeah getting my first book deal\nI'm is one of the hardest things if not the hardest thing I've ever done and I would also say that each subsequent book deal you you have to go get\nMaybe a little bit easier than if you've never published before\nBut not much I mean it's unless you are power office or random standards and one of these writers who you know they could publish their grocery list and millions of people are going to buy it um it's always always always enough they'll struggle and that kind of not\nYou know getting a drawn out of the way of getting the lowest me out a way and focusing on the work that's something I absolutely learned in the United states coast guard and incredibly grateful for\nTalked to several other authors musicians people involved in the arts and one recurring theme with them is is the difficulty these days in particular in the music industry and in the literature industry of getting to that point they all have different recommendations or remember one telling us\nYou know don't count on it to be your job make sure that you have a backup plan keep doing what you love work on it but also have a plan B have another route that you can go what would you recommend to the aspiring veteran authors out there\nMake sure that you have a backup plan keep doing what you love work on it but also have a plan B have another route that you can go what would you recommend to the aspiring veteran authors out there\nSome do work uh I mean you have to obviously have a day job stuff like that but um but it's really this um\nIt is to work if nothing else on don't worry about marketing don't worry about who you know don't worry about any of that worried about writing a dynamite book you write a fantastic book it we'll find 'em and I know people will say rules so much junk is published in so many good books get passed over yeah that's true but\nThose are outliers outliers in general when you write fantastic work work that releasing work that is amazing you know publishers are not stupid they're going to see that and they're going to and they're going to walk by it because they they are going to do it will make them money I'm so there's a lot of\nMystery around being a success in the arts and a lot of alchemy and people trying to figure it out you know the right look the right\nTo be the right place maker I see no no no no no\nIt is the quality of the work focused on writing an amazing book when you read your own manuscript and you say this is as good as anything you know George R Martin has ever written this is as good as anything I only know that has ever written this was as good as anything Ursula Caitlin has ever written\nWhen you feel that uh and when you're ... your friends who are looking at it for you feel that then you're ready to start finding a nation but before that you focus on crap\nAnd how do you focus on crap you read the book of the great right and you\nPick apart what they're doing read like a boxer watches a fight that he ... an opponent um you take riding horses you um and most of all your practice you sit on your butt in a chair and you're right and you're right and you're right and you read what you wrote and throw it away and you're right um but yeah\nThat is my number one piece if I\nWere speaking with Mike coal miner renaissance man an author or a TV star in of course a coast guard veteran having served in the United states coast guard until well a few years ago as he told us one of the most difficult decisions he's ever made in his life\nHis most recent series of the sacred thrown series book to the queen of prose coming out this month or a question for your mind about the literary community is there much of a veteran presence in the literature community or is there in a group of veterans you know of who are writing that you maybe keep in touch with or anything like that\nAlso you have to keep in mind that the literature community isn't knowledge it's um it tends to aggregate by Sean\nYou know of who are writing the maybe keep in touch with or anything like that\nAlso you're even minor literature community isn't all it is um tennis to aggregate by Sean live from unity science fiction and fantasy um and there are there are a few veterans but very few what's\nNext for you I Know you've got a book that just came out you've got books three in that series coming out soon what's next for Michael so um\nI've got a third book in a sacred grocers chilling light which I Am doing my song she'll be turning that in\nTo my agent about ten days I have a new series which is out your unsettled I'm with a robot which is um about the future of ghosts are about to start mission when the U.S a call in on the mood I'm so I'm really excited about that a few books under contract there\nUm and then I have a I can reveal anything but I have some more TV negotiations going on and I'm really a lot with Hollywood you never know so I'm not expectations but I'm hoping that'll up something you enough for the next few months on that front\nYou can find out more it Mike that's why the the coal\nStill to come John Burke is known for the TV show American grid his massive social media following and an online personality that some have described as abrasive or worse with the former drill sergeant and showing a kinder gentler side as the founder of a nonprofit that revolves around a video game\nAnd things are positive messages and you get guys in there like I I I had a guy like three nights ago a navy veteran suicide a survivor talked about you know watching the gaming stop watching this stuff that we do has been selling tackled that it's given him something to look forward to and\nThat right there is what makes it all worth it that's what makes the drive worth you know because there are times that like I just want to give it up as they can do this but you know but then you get that message\nOf empowerment of the damn that's that's amazing that's incredible and it just it feels you'd want to do more goodness because to be perfectly open it up this these last three years two years stepping out there's been a lot of anger\nA lot of anger inside of me and I didn't know where to curate towards\nAnd I didn't know what the cause of it was ...\nThese last three years two years stepping out there's been a lot of anger a lot of anger inside of me and I didn't know where to ...\nAnd I didn't know what the cause of it was it was just anger of having been through four and a half years of Iraq and Afghanistan from solution to the ... river valleys and stuff like that of the worst fighting out there and there's just a lot of internalized anger and I could figure out why and maybe it's because\nYou come back to America and you see it and the state of affairs that it is and now it's like this is not what we thought for we fought for America to be America to be United in a sense but we're not\nWhich you know in a sense is the Democratic process that democracy you know we don't we don't have United we we're able to disagree and stuff but over the last two years it's been trying to find that anger in channel in a positive direction\nAnd kind of go through this transition on the stage and let other people see into my life of people that are followed me for years that have told me that you know I remember when you were pursuing this remember when you were doing this to see where you are now and it's nice to see you're actually finally trying to come up through that that whole in the ground\nAnd understand that life is worth living and it's worth living happy\nDon't we don't let the let the anchor consumed un side for the longest time\nIt's just very easy to laugh at that that that inner demon control\nYour mind how you look at things had to talk to people I Do various things now I still\nGet on the YouTube and do my my funny comedic thing sometimes those are the drill start sometimes if there's a comedic thing it's all about flying around and you know at work but the biggest advice I can give anyone transitioning out of the military man it's fine something's going to make you happy\nKeep your hands busy with a hobby and uh I I'd go that direction don't get out of the military without a direction because we'd been trained\nTo always have a mission you know when you're coming back from deployment you're immediately go to reset and you're going back into team or a fire squad life fire company live fire you got something you're training for you know that you're on the past ... you're about to deploy in six months you're training for something then when you get out man I'm telling you\nYou are so much more than that uniform you are so much more than that uniform and I'm not I'm not criticizing the uniform on that the meeting it\nBut what I Am saying is the reason more depth to you in any one of the things that they are just a uniform it intellectually shallow\nYou need to delve deeper into who\nBut what I Am saying is the reason for that to you at any one of the things that they are just a uniform it intellectually shallow unique or delve deeper into who it is that you are as an individual and understand that individuality as what you bring to the art\nAnd then once you leave the army you take the individuality with you and you expand upon and then you would or new avenues things that you ever seen or down your entire life grow your hair long grow up here they'll listen to a new type of music do take an art class go through an acting class write poetry do video game\nTry things that you will always afraid to try before okay let's be honest and a warrior culture\nWhere you're taught to think and feel a certain way you've got to be hard to talk and I agree that it does exist because that's what's needed for war fighters but once you're out of that environment\nBy something that makes you happy\nAnd don't let that inner anger consume your because that's just not a life worth living and the guy that we left over there would not want you were living a life like that\nWhen we return we'll have more with TV star social media ... and founder of alpha nerds Gil John ...

C. E. O. of blue star families about what you and I can do to help support our military families and why it's important that we do so\nThey can really extend their mission to the country by by helping to be that understanding support to the people who are currently serving\nAnd we'll find out why Marilyn congressional candidate thinks veterans are the key to changing the toxic environment in our nation's capital\nParty bosses want everyone to vote down at our respective party line they're counting on us to wash to stand up and speak truth to power and and now you can put us in a room and will come out and buy a part of\nWorld War one changed the socio political landscape of the world unlike any other conflict it ushered out the era of monarchs in empires all introducing modern warfare in all of it's terrifying glory\nIt's also widely viewed as the emergence of the United states is a global player and considering the historical importance of the great war to our country and that November eleventh from work one hundred years since hostilities were seized it might surprise you to learn that there's no monument to the war in our nation's capital\nThere is a World War one memorial and museum located in Kansas City and it is in awe inspiring beautiful tribute to those who gave their lives and those who served\nStill to many it just doesn't seem right that there's nothing in DC paying tribute to those who served in the war and the one hundred and sixteen thousand who made the ultimate sacrifice\nBut that might be changing suit\nThere is a monument designed to end it location chosen for that monument but as with most things on Capitol Hill the process of getting that monument into that location is confusing and slow\nI recently checked in with saving Howard the world renowned sculptor selected to create the monument for an update on the status but first for some background on how to design was chosen and how Howard himself gotten involved [noise]\nAnd twenty ... there was a global competition and out of three hundred and fifty teams are chosen for sure my partner the architect in training\nThere was a global competition and out of three hundred and fifty teams uh chose a fly sharp my partner the architect in training\nWho is twenty five I'm made it to the finals the final five and from there he looked around for a classical sculptors and they're really not that many of us out there\nUm I got a call and accepted and that that started things going um we finished in the process of actually being looked at again\nBy the centennial commission I'm In the fall twenty Fifteen in January twenty sixteen we were um handed the commission to create this a monument and park\nOwn landscape company that does it all we're a proud member of the better

veterans powered by connecting that's dot com\nNavy vet Eric day\nBack to our conversation with saving Howard a world renowned sculptor who was chosen to scope the monument to the men and women who served in World War one in our nation's capital [noise]\nWas it surprising to you when you first learned that there was no World War one memorial a true World War memorial in our nation's capital considering the importance of that period of time\nYes yes and no it was surprising that sort of a war that was so large and change the world is such a dramatic level that was that was\nThat was odd to me that the thing is I'm I'm bicultural so I grew up in Europe so I would've expected something like that but\nUh America is also a very modern and forward thinking country so I think one of the reasons that it was not in place was because we don't look at history and the same way as Europeans do and I think that so that's something that's actually changing now is our our country and the ...\nThat it was not in place was because we don't look at history and the same way as Europeans do and I think that's something that's something that's actually changing now is our our country and the rest of the world becomes more global an inter digitized um\nI I don't think that it's something that you can bypass and I think it was bypassed by other events in the United states such as the great depression and so\nIf you if you do look at history World War one is where\nYou move into maternity where\nThe the United States changes the way that a human being solved themselves into you know how to de relate to\nThe greater universe or ... or where they alone\nAnd World War one did something that really began my maternity and it's this um the beginning of where ... ... more alone I mean you have to think twenty two million people died in this global ethics war it's it's a comprehensible those numbers today\nIt certainly is a the birth of modern warfare but modern warfare is or has changed quite a bit since World War one\nI really just a when you go back and learn about it read about it look at a pieces of art about it on a terrifying horrifying time for anyone who was involved in World War one\nOf course the lack of a memorial there and say were you surprised of course you've still got to be surprised 'cause it's not in place yet so same and I wanted to ask you where does it still now at what point in the process are we and how close are we seeing your sculpture in purchasing park\nHuh [laughter] well this is an epic war correct [laughter] well it should be fitting that it's an ethics process to make a memorial to represent an uptick war so we had a a huge\nA breakthrough moment of last month where we pass through the commission of fine arts and the sculpture has now been approved that means that it will happen and that there are now a\nLet's I've I'm there are details that need to be looked at like how the sculpture fits within the park how you have a pool reflecting pool in front of it how that will have um the visitors entering in to the park and walking through\nThe park entering into the uh I guess you would call it the viewing area and then how you um exit the park so how'd you makes this\nThe part entering into the uh I guess you would call it the viewing area\nAnd then how you um exit the park so how'd you makes this something that's a\nExperiential experience not only to as a sculpture but have the environment that it fits\nWithin so that those are the things that are really look being looked at carefully and I don't think there's\nAn eye on the go knock on wood I really hope this is correct I don't see any really large hurdles anymore this is we used to be fans in quotation marks green lighted to proceed forward and so the next ... with the commission of fine arts or more detail oriented\nWell that's a good thing if if if the big picture items are out of the way that's a positive if it's the smaller things you would hope they can be dealt with after\nHowever in our nation's capital as we all know that's often not they can do you have any sort of timeline when you expect the peace to start being installed door or where what where does this put you at what at what point are you able to get started on on doing what you need to do to get this done\nThe actual sculpting All right so we're looking right now it's a fundraising I'm year and and to finish the fundraising by the end of year and a fundraising is a forty million dollar mark that we need to to reach because this is paid all by a private owner\nMoney and so that we're in a big fundraising a moment\nUm I Would expect by January that that that will be taken care of and then I began sculpting and I will be doing this in New York City with a crew of three to four I'm very I'm experienced sculptors of Twenty years or plus um experience uh\nEach section there's three sections is a beginning middle and there's an end and\nSo I'm looking at approximately a year and a half on each section so a total time\nUm before insulation each each one going and that's it's finished but a total time completion maybe around four and a half four years I'm the first section will probably appeared within two years the next one a year and a half to two years after that in the last one I'm\nAbout half a year after that so it's but it's this is all still to be you know established and but it's it's I'm very optimistic at this point because of uh for for us\nSo but if this is all still to be you know established and but it's it's I'm very optimistic at this point because of uh\nFor for a couple of reasons um it's been received with great acclaim 'em by many many different communities and groups for example says that only the art community because it is a piece of art\nAlso by a monuments by civic leaders in Washington I'm\nBy that says well it's it's something that people understand or when they look at it and I think that's really critical today that should make something that can tell a story that that it's not and so ... and it\nYou know what is that you need that you need a book to explain that you need something that's dish will and that that's why this is really a visual narrative that that that universal that everybody's gonna be ... you know affected when they look at it in a visceral way when they visit that site\nAnd that side of course is an amazing sight and it's kind of a a bit of\nI guess good karma that there was in fact a park dedicated to general person who for those who don't know the general\nWho led the American expeditionary forces that took part in World War one it's on the national mall it was dedicated to him you know a hundred years ago or so and and it's kind of fallen into disrepair it's not it's not a hot spot but it is a perfect location\nHow happy are you with the location of purging park where it is and and just the fit for the memorial being already tied to World War one or the park itself\nOut there a couple of answers to that any real estate in Washington is highly sought after to get a place that's a block and a half from the White House that would have two thousand visitors on average a day is incredible this park\nTo me is a gift that\nI Hope people when they come to it are really transformed but have a reaction it's I think that the park is it right now in disrepair it's something that was very vibrant\nIn the eighties but at this point it's really falling apart and it it's sad that\nYou know your visitors\nFrom all over the world and a block and a half from the White House that they all they do go by this this park has fallen by the wayside\nAnd you have garbage strewn in the middle there's a lot of homelessness that that that that is is used\nJust fallen by the wayside and you have garbage strewn in the middle there's a lot of homelessness that that that that is is used as as a place to hang out a lot of skate boarders in young kids that hang out you do it young teenagers do it so that's\nSomething that really needs to be rectified so it's like I think if you put a sculpture in a place like\nPushing park and you give it a breath of vibrant new life it's not only going to transform the space but it's going to transform the amount of visitors that come to the states so\nAs the park stance today it it it it's fallen away its energy has fallen away what we're doing is we're ... viewing it with a new energy that is traditional that speaks of the history of our country and for me this is this is one of those things that\nI Hope some day to to to go back there when when I'm older and to watch the visitors and see their excitement as they walk from left to right along that relief and point to that there is the father areas again that's what I'm that's what that's my dream and so I'm\nI'm really I'm cautiously optimistic but I'm also I'm also incredibly excited by that\nYou can view the design and mark ups and also keep tabs on saving Howard's progress with a memorial by visiting saving Howard dot com still to come military families face tremendous difficulty we all know that\nYou know sort of investment income or some of the other ideas so if we can connect the neighbors who have this feeling of goodwill towards the military but they don't know what to do if we can make it easy and fun for them to connect to them that currently serving in transitioning military their community and not only do we help the military but we really help the neighbor too\nIf we can make it easy and fun for them to connect to them that currently serving in transitioning military they're cheap energy then not only did we have the military but we really help\nThe neighbor to what we find for the people who participate with us as blue star neighbors is it they feel they get much more out of the program then they give just from getting to be part of the mission of serving the country that they feel they're part of one day\nConnect through our community so that's the blue star ... program and it's on our website anyone veteran or non veteran can participate in it\nThat sounds like something that we need more of you know building these bridges of understanding between the military a veteran communities and the civilian community is that a big part of what blue star families are particularly this neighbors program is about kind of\nNormalizing those military families and ordering people realize hey they're just like you and I just happened to do a slightly different job than we do\nThat is exactly right you know it it it is normalizing and I love that word it saying this is this is a normal part of our country and we need to be connected into it um both for their sake and for our sake so that we understand that this is what we do is at countries\nYou know the ... we send folks on not only will it help that our communities and not only will it help the individual families who are doing better but it'll it'll help the country as a whole because we'll make people smarter about this work that we do that after all civilians need to\nControl the military and they can't control something they don't know or understand\nHow the as you mentioned your chapter based organization if people are hearing this and they're interested in it and they're they're saying like hey I'm going to find one of these blue star families chapters where do they go to find out that information and find the closest one to them\nYeah come to our website blue star families that or or just do a little blue star

... and I'm Tracy McCray we're which I Believe he is a neurosurgeon the Mayo Clinic and we've been hearing about is deep brain stimulation\nTechniques including the patients that had the problem playing the violin but can do it now even better than anybody a great story it's actually\nNow I Want to ask you we needed update on would like it up to eight or on the stimulation of the spinal cord and patients who have been been paralyzed and potentially a can get some return a function\n[noise] yes you know this is another technology that we've been working on here at the Mayo Clinic for about four years now I Would have been growing this ... program slowly and I'm I'm very happy to report that this is another technology that is emerging to be very powerful\nIn addition it has also allowing us some interesting understanding of how ... control of movement happens that what that means is how does the brain control our lens voluntarily so this is a finding that was just reported in nature medicine\nYes that that that's correct so maybe I can tell you a little bit of background on this so\nAbout four years ago that the Reggie accurate ten and I try to see how come I had 'em published a paper very interesting paper\nWhere they implanted patients at that time about four patients where at the door oh stimulation below the level of the spinal cord injury could cause voluntary movement back in the lower extremities an epidural means uh above the door or soda sold\n... the outer coating around the spinal\nThat's correct yeah so this is technology that is essentially the same as what we use for our pain patients under the skin but outside of the spinal cord outside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spoken word OK so these are actually surgical implants and what's\nBut outside of the spinal cord outside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spy okay okay so these are actually surgical implants and what's been demonstrated with these devices and pain patients\nIs that they can help with pain so this is already approved by the FDA for pain that what that are up ... and ... group did was to now apply this technology and spinal cord injury patients who've been paralyzed for example with a thoracic were\nUm childcare has level complete motor and censoring meaning they can move their legs or sense there is no sensation\nSo when that paper came out that you can get movements we were very excited about it because that's really changes our whole view of what we can do for our spinal cord injured patients\nSo we teamed up with Dr Reggie ... group and decided can we replicate those studies and so initially the all of this study which is male either be approved investigation all of review board approved as well as the U.S FDA to do this study\nAnd so we've implanted now true patience under this study and this paper that is um ... being reported in nature medicine\nDemonstrates that indeed but was found was true but we actually went beyond that replication\nSo the replication portion of it we actually already published and Mayo Clinic proceedings last year and this was really exciting because our results come from the findings of that pursuit of al ... and ...\nSo that was exciting the low we discovered is that we can actually go beyond that finding and in this paper with demonstrators that the patient it now is able to stand\nAnd take independence steps now she's still requires a Walker because he has no sensation still but he is strong enough now to to control his legs and make movements are stepping movement\nThat is an incredible story no when the word gets out as an every paraplegic in the country going to want this well\nKnow this is still very early stage research like I said this is only one patient that we have reported in nature medicine [laughter] and so what I Would say is this one study\nIs that this is only one patient that we have reported in nature and medicine and so what I Would say is this one study really challenges what we used to think what is possible for treatment of patients with spinal cord injury\nBut you know as a neurosurgeon I often see these patients and emergency room after the trauma\nAnd you can imagine how devastating such an injury is but I think what our study shows is that there is this tremendous hope and being able to regain some of that function [laughter] so you you're regaining function but you're not able to cure\nOr fix the fact that they are a paraplegic\nYes now what is really interesting about this study is that the patient is actually able to control his legs again\nWow and that's why this is such a powerful study and I believe why the reviewers and nature medicine which is one of the top journals in medicine I'm accepted this publication\nSo let me ask you if if someone comes into the emergency room and they have cut a nerve in the armor their leg we can show it back together and they get at least some return to function why is it the spinal cord seemed to have no ability whatever to repair\nSo you know that's an excellent question and we believe the reason is because while the nerve those are ... on the earth and we know that that was profound our skin wreak world but the spinal cord is our central nervous system and unfortunately what central nervous system when that system is caught them those nerves to not ...\nWhat we believe in this case though is that the question then is how does the information from the brain that wants to move the leg\nRegained that function mhm we do not believe that the nurse has grown I we do not think that's how this works but rather that during the trauma there's probably enough connections that are not functioning enough but that epidural stimulation allows the south that's dormant\nTo be able to once again we gain its ability to get the command from the brain\nIncredible ... do you a whole and suspect that some day people who are paraplegic or even quadrupled don't skip a paraplegic right now the lower extremities paralyzed will someday be able to walk\nThat's precisely what this patient did that we have reported in um in nature medicine\nBut he's paralyzed will someday be able to walk that's precisely what this patient did\nThat we have reported in um in nature medicine\nWhere his research headed you know I I think now this is opening up a whole new direction and research for spinal cord injury you know before\nThere's been tremendous amount of research effort and funding that went into trying to re grow those axons now what I think will happen is that the research will be in these type of new devices how do we now take this finding which used a device that wasn't even intended for this purpose\nNow all of the things that we have discovered in this study how then can we take that\nTake a step back and re engineered the device specifically for this purpose off ... animation and spinal cord injured patients because there have to be a different type of approval by the FDA for this absolutely okay and the\n... and that's why I think we are indeed very early infant stages of this technology incredible story [noise]\nAll right next scandal leave he is a neurosurgeon and director of Mayo clinic's neural engineering laboratory thanks so much for being with us thank you citing exciting stuff thanks a lot\nStill to come a Mayo Clinic radio will learn more about the spinal cord injury research from the rehabilitation point of view and later on in the program we'll hear about the important role

that has yet to be proven as well but um but we know physical therapy itself wasn't cancer so we had the implant and we\nGood if you don't have the therapy we that's our theory that has yet to be proven as well but um but we know physical therapy itself wasn't cancer so we had the implant and we added that therapy and assimilation together and we got these miraculous results [noise]\nUm what goes on from here is a little tricky\nBecause number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send this individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage to me later in conjunction with a therapy which we feel is really really valuable\nSo we're at the point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program by identifying activities have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with some minimal assisted devices\nAnd then let them do that stuff at home on their own um and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to implement into standard of care\nHow many patients who have had to stimulate her do it are presently going through the therapy and ... what are the things that they're actually able to do that they couldn't do before\nWe're on our second subject right now are patient so even wrote to 'em we have some research funding to hopefully continue into a new protocol that will be very similar but will allow us to enroll additional subjects [noise]\nUm right now the subject I'm the first subject is able to um [noise] you know stand alone for a long period of time he's able to um in wheelchair bound before yes\nHe's able to walk 'em or independently step on a treadmill and also over ground with a Walker so he has some assistance obviously to help him you know their weight on his legs but he's able to um [noise]\nAs Megan described volition ally and move his legs when he wants so on command so that's really the exciting part is is where ... where we can go from here now that would improve bladder and ball function forum\nWe've had some anecdotal improvements although um we didn't measure those things directly so I'm at this point um our next studies were going to do more um\nData collections which we hope will help inform whether there's actual return of of bowing bladder um but they do report I'm kind of a shorter\nBowel um time so that's a good thing and we just don't have evidence yet you were working with a second patient is it's very soon\nI'm kind of a shorter bell um time so that's a good thing and we just don't have evidence yet you were working with a second patient is it's very similar to what the first patient was or a note to patients the same [laughter] you know to these incidents\nSo how do we go from one or two individuals to millions because we know there's a war between five and six million people out there who have been spinal cord injuries maybe not complete but partial because we're out of wherever we go from here how can we get this\nTechnology the Missouri for five million yes [laughter] so I think Megan alluded to this earlier and we've probably both saluted too you know one thing we need is obviously\nTo gain additional research support and money to do this work and to keep this team moving forward but I think one of the other critical questions is you know which patients will respond to this therapy and which ones will not so can we come up with a way\nOf saying you know out of the millions of patience you know the these people will respond in these wall so that we don't try to deliver a therapy that's not going to be a successful\nFinally do you believe that someday paralysis won't be permanent for all patients\nWhile we're definitely making a term because we used to just talk about how do we compensate for the deficits that are existing for this population and now we're talking about how to recover and how do we end up making your parts of the occur in the central nervous system so\nWe're definitely making a change in the progress of how we're managing and dealing with spinal cord injuries but they're still a lot of work to be done\nFor you made so much progress old so far in this election citing ... both of such great work and we wish you the very best of luck thank you [noise]\nWe've been talking about spinal cord stimulation the role of rehabilitation without the Christians out from the Mayo Clinic assist everyone restores new technology laboratory the rest of the physical therapist nagging guilt and so much for being with us\nWe're
