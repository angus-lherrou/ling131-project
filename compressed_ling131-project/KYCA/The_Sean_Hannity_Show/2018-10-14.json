I. bill living style that\nEven to this day the VA has not come back to a school certifying official goes and told us folks here's what's happening\nWhen it comes to advocating for disabled veterans you'd be hard pressed to find any group doing more than disabled American veterans better known as the a V. they're working every day to make sure are disabled vets get the benefits in respect they deserve\nThey also do a lot to inform the public that the word disabled doesn't mean unable particularly when it comes to careers\nConnecting that's reporter Jonathan coat hanger talked with Jeff all the ... national employment director about their jobs programs and their new guy for companies looking to hire and retain disabled vets [noise]\nMaybe you know we provide of a lot of different services free to veterans and their families but to to have a program dedicated to the employment was just a part of the equation so as we kinda moved through the process we were\nYou know sponsoring career fairs we started out slow but we work with recruit military and we sponsor nearly a hundred and fifty career fairs each year and that's a lot of dialogue with\nBoth on both sides of the table both with veterans what they're looking for how we can help them as well as on the employers' side of the table what they're looking for and the challenges that they may be encountering especially when it comes to disable veterans in what we learned very quickly\nWas companies there's so many that are excited to hire and not just veterans but veterans with disability because of a whole host of things that they represent\nA bit from everything from tax tax incentive ... tax incentives to uh just the fact that these men and women have had to overcome um you know in many cases insurmountable\nAdversity ah dealing with their own disability and transitioning out of the military through the conversation and a lot of these conversations they just kept ringing a bell that ah these folks a lot of these companies need\nOn disability and transitioning out of the military through that conversation and a lot of these conversations it just kept ringing a bell that uh these folks a lot of these companies need help understanding what a disabled veteran is I'm most to look at it uh unfortunately\nBut a reality most look at it as if they can physically see a disability such as a you know a missing limb or or you know facial disfigurement or something like that that's easy obviously\nTo spot but the invisible type wounds um you know where that much more\nDifficult things for companies to kind of wrap themselves around so as part of our [noise] you know you know in the ... being a leader in helping veterans and you know received their VA compensation for disability or

Eric day\nTo the autism society over three point five million Americans or about one percent of our total population\nAre living with autism\nWhat you might not think about is that their families are living with it to\nFamilies like the ... maybe that Sean and his wife she'll let us live in Minnesota with they're beautiful family\nA family that includes for children free of which have autism\nAfter seeing that devastatingly sad story of medics rich a young boy with autism and wandered away from his father and was later found dead\nThe brunt of just reached out to be wanting to share their story in hopes that it would help other families dealing with autism and just as important we help the community at large understand how they might be able to help those family\nThree children that have autism when people come up to you or you come up to someone what's the first thing you think that people should know and understand about what it's like to raise\nWith three children that have autism when people come up to you where you come up to someone what's the first thing you think that people should know and understand about what it's like to raise children who have autism\nUm it would be nice if they understood that every child has a different\nUm even though we have three children with autism each one is on a different level of the spectrum and that's why they call it a spectrum so our six year old Brandon he's on a regular classroom with you know his his kids his age he's not in special education he talks looks exactly like you know his\nPeers there's nothing that if you talk to him for about five minutes you wouldn't even be able to tell that he um has been diagnosed with autism\nUm our daughter Cameron has a little social anxiety but she's five years old and she's also on a regular classroom but our son Daniel um he's three years old and he um is not talking\nHe has to be prompted to say words\nOut of his tell me it's hurting or if his foot hurts um he's not able to tell me that and like medics rich in North Carolina he is a wonder\nIf you let go of his hand he'll run off\nAnd even if you call his name he won't respond now the other children they will if you call their name just like any other mom they'll\nRespond by either being scared or they'll stop but not this one he has no sense of fear danger and he's a very attracted to water and so it's people come up to us and they look at the kids they say well this kid um nice to have autism and they're fine what what's wrong with this one well that's why it's called a spectrum\nAnd it's so important for people to understand that each child on the spectrum is different\nSean when you think about uh you know ... years you've been with three of your children being diagnosed with autism are the two older ones who have been\nOr a normal a regular school classrooms I should say not normal or your your youngest Daniel or what would you like people to know about the difficulties that families can face when dealing with someone who is not as high functioning on the autism spectrum\nPatience is a first and foremost you have to be patient with with all children on the spectrum because each child manifests the autism differently um\nBranding and Cameron though they're high functioning now we're not always high functioning and it's a direct result of some of the therapy that they receive through the ... Institute\nAnd this therapy is behavioral modification therapy or were you reinforce good behaviors um it takes years to show improvement I mean we we have a six months\nThere'll be use behavior modification therapy or were you reinforce good behaviors um it takes years to show improvement I mean we we have a six month assessment 'em all it twice a year to see how their progressing and\nVery scripted programs to address the behaviors\nOr to get them to\nUm function within normal behavior limits so they can go to a regular classroom of this therapy is intense and and can be up to forty hours per week per child and that there will be as in our home so if a child who's on the spectrum and does not receive any of that therapy\nUm parents are probably going to be pulling their hair out as well as other parents that are looking at them respond to their children so you have to have patience um and and meet each kid where they're at 'em it's our desire that every child who's on the spectrum receive some kind of therapy whether it be to witness to July\nSetting or um therapy in the home or as long as they get something that's going to help them with you have to recognize that it's not like taking a pill with two days later you feel\nBetter this is therapy that takes years to develop the right behaviors\nSo that they can function independently\nAnd and and the thing about that too is that it's all about access and information and that's why my husband and I are talking to you know because we want to encourage and inform other parents who have special needs children are people even who know parents who they think may have special needs children about the information that we can share and how they can access\nIt I'm In one of the things that we saw with mathematics is it a people would judging the dad well how could he let that kid get away from him and you know why didn't he run after him or why didn't he um stop him from getting away and our son Daniel again is a wander and we every day are one moment away from an Amber Alert\nUm if we want to go to the park we have to have 'em volunteers to come and help because we don't have family here in Minnesota\nAnd we don't have volunteers a lotta times we just stay home um and we play in the back yard and we watch a movie because there's just not safe for us to take him anywhere with with four children into adults they they have a\nPretty out number and so we looked down at a kid we take one child to the restroom and close the door we wash our hands and he runs off and every day I'm you know we are just moments away or one text message away a one Facebook\nAnd close the door we wash our hands and he runs off and every day\nI'm you know we're just moments away or one\nText message away a one Facebook post away from losing our child and it is very difficult for people who don't have children on the autism spectrum to understand why didn't they run after his child how could he get away it happens to us every day and if you don't have a child with autism you don't understand how difficult it is to keep them safe\nIt is something that uh you know I I Know with I I have a five year old he's almost six\nAnd you know he's fully able to communicate with me and even so keeping tabs on just him just won\nBy itself is incredibly difficult like magic what it's like with four children and then with children who have difficulties communicating and as you said with your youngest Daniel or being wander someone who would wander off\nWhat do you think we can do to make sure that that people are more aware of the issues that come with autism and don't judge people like Maddox ridges father who is clearly devastated by what happened to me who would be\nA what do you think we can do to address that and make sure that people are aware of that raising children with autism\nComes with very very special circumstances\nI think it's important to just raising the awareness um the more we can talk about\nAutism and the more you can get of your listeners engaged in talking to people who have kids on the spectrum\nI'm to understand what life is like um you know the Internet's a great resource autism speaks as a a a a website that people can go to just to understand you know the challenges that people face um\nAutism society of Minnesota is another one um ... Institute that provides behavioral therapy to\nThe Frasier school all of these uh resources are out there um but unless you have a child on the spectrum you may not know about it um you have to talk to\nAbout pediatricians and get the medical community engaged um [noise]\nWhen we were first diagnosed with Brandon you know our pediatrician was really kind of in denial I Know he'll he'll come around you'll come around he'll be than just give them some time to let it kept pushing kept pushing we finally get the testing and it's a battery of tests that have to be done to diagnose autism\nAlthough we did it in Houston at the university um and you know we we got the diagnosis but you can't get any services unless you get a diagnosis\nAnd it's so important for people not to be in denial if they see\nAnd you know we we got the diagnosis but you can't get any services unless you get the diagnosis\nAnd it's so important for people not to be in denial if they see any signs and their children if they're wringing their hands if they're\nYou know spinning around in circles or they're lining up their food and not eating it um if they're playing with imaginary butterflies it doesn't have anything to do with your parenting your great mom are great dad\nBut it's really important that you go to um your pediatrician and ask them to refer you to get a test and if they say that the child doesn't have autism then that's fine but go ahead and get a\nTest and don't worry about what the labels are and don't be afraid of what may happen if you do get the test because if you get the\nTest and it comes back that your child has autism and guess what the world opens up to a bunch of services that can help them in early intervention is the key our kids have been getting services because they got diagnosed at Eighteen months or two years old and they've been getting the services and that's why now there and\nYou know a classroom with their normally developing peers but so many times parents are in denial that they want to wait to see how it's going to play out or if they're going to\nThe kids are going to take a turn for the better and then they've lost one two three years of good autism therapy\nAnd so now the kids are at a disadvantage and their two or three years behind their peers and it's so important that you see those warning signs that you um make note of it that you talk to your doctor that you are not afraid or ashamed to get a diagnosis and then go out and get the therapy\nBut it's about accessing information and the information that I got was through this applied behavior therapy or a BA therapy that my kids could do better and live better and they came into our home and like my husband said they work with the kids\nForty hours a week um each child gets that much therapy and we saw great improvements after just two years and now my kids are in regular classrooms my son Daniel\nThe wander who can't speak as much as he would like and understand simple commands can actually read a book\nAnd now my kids are in regular classrooms my son Daniel\nThe wander who can't speak as much as he would like and understand simple commands can actually read a book he can read words that he's never seen before we couldn't believe it we just found this out a couple of weeks ago so now we know we can communicate with him through language the written word and that's amazing it would\nNever have happened had we not gotten to early diagnosis have we been in denial and tried to put it off had we not want it to put labels on him and had we not gotten the services early enough to make a difference before school starts and so now I Know that my kids can graduate from college they can get married they can make me a grandma when the time is right\nBecause we get the services early enough\nTo make a difference in their lives\nWere some of the national organizations that you're aware of you think would be most beneficial to families who are dealing with all his\nUm like my husband said um the autism society or in their local state I'm In each state has an autism society um autism speak\nIs another a great organization I'm ever university has um a pediatric um\nDepartment and they have researchers\nIn the neurological department and a lot of times they are the ones who um do the autism diagnoses\nAnd just connecting with the developmental\nPediatrician and a developmental psychologist who can put you in touch with organizations but you know we have talked to our\nRegular therapists are speech therapist an occupational therapist in our school professionals to say hey who do we contact how can we get in touch with people because we're up in Minnesota with no family and friends and we don't know who to go to because we don't\nYou know all of our friends have older children who have graduated from college ... how do we get in touch with someone and you know once they put us in touch with one organization then we can go\nTo a group meeting and talk to other parents is about connecting with the parents and getting the information they have access to those services um but you got to get yourself into those communities and those group meetings and\nAnd and then you can find out about what's going on and who the best speech therapist is in town who the best of who who's the best volunteer organization in

with people just like you connect to veterans you know the the autism moms and dads they have to connect with one another because every piece of information I found out\nCame from another mom or another day of a child who had autism who had been in the fight a little bit longer than me and that's why my husband and I always reach back to try to pull up another parent who just got recently diagnosed with their child with autism or\nYou know who suspect that there may be um a diagnosis coming so that we can give them every ounce of information and support that we had um given to us\nA show and I wanted to ask you if there's a message that you could give to the parents out there who might have just recently received a diagnosis of autism with their child what would your message to them be\nTake action um yes you've got the diagnosis that opens up a whole world of services be active and\nCurious ask a lot of questions uh you don't get the services unless you have the diagnosis 'em and make sure you always advocate for your children\nStill to come somewhere between one hundred and three hundred thousand veterans going to school on the GI Bill\nHave not received their living

guests are political expert on breast cancer drugs to go [noise]\nAlright myth or a matter of fact doctor goes being overweight increases your risk of developing breast cancer is that a myth or a fact\nThat is indeed a fact uh oh wait is we're not far breast cancer risk factors and so\nThe more we can do to keep a weight down the better it is so actual management off that are eating healthy with regular and regular exercise when we say eating healthy it's actually cutting down on fat intake I Would definitely be a risk factor reduction and regular exercise\nUm the other thing that will help but is the watching the alcohol intake um because access to alcohol intake is a risk factor for breast cancer also\nSo we we're both obesity family history obviously age or jihad older you're more likely to get ... alcohol sedentary lifestyle Richard me\nSounds like what a lot of our expert guess till after [laughter] for a lot of a yes or hourly [laughter] All right let's talk about the different types of breast cancer because I Know there are several different ones and the outlook for\nSure the breast cancer marker it's kind of help us identify what kind of cancer is these are so um we have what is based on the location off the abnormality we can call it breast cancer can be ... or ... cancers [noise]\nUm but in general what we're finding is that the biology matters and that tumors that are estrogen receptor positive\nEstrogen a project receptive positive or hurt too positive or negative for each of these markers kind of identified what type of tumor this is so an estrogen positive project ... her too negative for breast cancer\nDiffer from her too positive breast cancer and as different also from what it's called the triple negative breast cancer\nAnd the treatment for those is different than what we really loves words and board and\nThat's exactly right because now biology is what Dr cancer treatment so it's very individualized to the type of cancer the person hats so if a woman has an extradition positive cancer there are medications that go after the estrogen receptor\nThe patient has the hurt too positive breast cancer we have targeted therapy for her to positive ...\nDeath camps are there are medications that go after the estrogen receptor the patient has the hurt too positive breast cancer we have targeted therapy for her to positive to see\nWhat ... what are ways that has come I mean I'm not a breast cancer survivor but I Will meet women who are thirty or forty or cancer survivors and back then there was like one treatment and that was it is that right\nThat is exactly right I mean initially it was women with breast cancer had the option of mastectomy removal of all lymph nodes\nAnd when chemo came into being everybody got to have chemotherapy but now thanks to again the breast cancer researchers um\nWho have really advanced to understand number one is that what is the biology of these cancers and then based on the biology try to find targeted treatments that work well and so even conditions such as triple negative breast cancer at one point these with diseases which were hard to treat\nAnd now we're coming up with new or therapies um managed by our special oncologists who come and\nCreate a treatment that is very specific for the patient\nYou know what I forgot what are the worst burgers what he's a little bit ... radio show which includes you because you had little pool but when you were a kid\nTo very much so yeah that's why I bypass all those other things to go straight to the um All right\nThat's right I mean these kind of exposure to radiation therapy to the breast region ducked increased one future risk of breast cancer usually we say about eight years out from the radiation the woman should be you're having yearly screening mammography and MRIs alright genetic\nTesting confusing subject what tests are available and who are there be genetically tested so when\nWe talk about women with a family history of breast cancer um you're always trying to understand anybody who has a family history we're trying to understand based on the family history is there evidence to suggest that this family maybe a family of carrying a gene genetic abnormality that puts them at increased risk\nWhat we used to know it really was the are the one and we are the two two genes associated with very high risk of breast and ovarian cancer\nAs information has evolved as gene testing has become more available and knowledge has increased we have found that there are other genes also that maybe associated with breast cancer\nSo what does a woman do typically what we say is that if you have a family history discussed with your physician let's talk clinician let them know that that is what a family history it's and it's not only breast cancer if you have a family history of breast ovarian colon cancer a male\nLet's talk clinician let them know that this is what my family history it's and it's not only breast cancer if you have a family history of breast ovarian colon cancer males with prostate cancer melanoma\nI'm an even pancreatic cancer these me all the linked and really any cancer seek help from your clinician so that then we can say does this patient qualified to be sent for gene testing now usually what we prefer is that when there is a family history like that which they meet with a genetics counselor\nSpeak the expert opinion and then the can guide you as to what is your likelihood of carrying a gene mutation and that guy what kind of testing can be done and depending\nOn how you test and you can give a woman advice about what you out or do whatever frequently she ought to be tested et cetera\nThat's exactly right there are very clear guidelines that a woman who carries with the RCA why not to a gene mutation\nWould benefit from MRI in addition to mammography and the timing of initiating the treatment generally we start MRI at age twenty five foot bracket carriers and then at age thirty we add them all graffiti for these bracket carriers\nThen at some point when they finished their childbearing or in the area that is some around thirty five to forty years usually close to forty we start talking about risk producing surgery so again a very important for these patients to be in touch with experts\nTo tolerate it as breast cancer awareness month what's most important thing you want them to do [noise]\nBe aware [noise] be familiar with your breath seek medical attention if you haven't noticed any changes [noise]\nGet out to about going in for a mammogram can be an advocate for yourself\nBy Theresa [laughter] stuff because they go into the breast cancer effects for mayor political rhetoric was sort of Ecuador effects from it can be very [noise] thank you John and Tracy's from like the Mayo Clinic radio we'll discuss treatment for low back pain and later on in the ... the importance of sleep really new for the women [noise]\nNo we we uh we depend on extrapolating from a joint problems are joint injuries touches sprained ankles where we theoretically believe that we not directly I'll say we believe that that uh if we put ice on it\nJoining injuries such as sprained ankles where we've theoretically believe that we not theoretically I'll say we believe that\nThat uh if we put ice on at a reduced information from an injury [noise] well that's not necessarily going to help the low back because the the cold from the ice doesn't get deep enough to affect the physiology\nDown around the spine and the same way with heat the heat doesn't get down there far enough and so it's probably affecting the nerves in the muscles that it can penetrate more than anything else and affecting\nThe pain that way certainly ice or he can reduce or some pain and it can help with muscle spasm of you're having spasm\nBut I Can't tell you that there's a write in a wrong application of ice and heat in that situation if it's a cute I Would go with the ice first I Am I at first and when you were asked what do you mean by ... laid out her bed no arrest has relative rest\nAnd we know that if you lay in bed for three days it's going to be more damaging than helpful\nOr when we lay down we lose muscle mass really lose bone density and it doesn't take very long and not being active before those things can become measurable\nShow arrest is reducing your activities to the point that you're not making yourself miserable as the way I explained it to my patients\nIt's not likely you're going to do additional damage unless you have like pain medicine tingling down your leg where you probably have a pinched nerve if it's back pain I Would do whatever I can reasonably do without making myself miserable and I would expect things to get better\nOver a course of a week or maybe two weeks sometimes\nIt's a treatment and not be my favorite massage but what else there is evidence for many types of treatment for back pain\nNone of the evidence is strong ...\nWhether it be a the anti inflammatory medicines or spinal manipulation such as the chiropractor physical therapist might provide much Josh or acupuncture or tai chi or yoga there's some evidence for most of these things but the evidence is not strong for any of it\nAnd that's why we have so many different treatments that people get to choose from\nOf one of my my friend Scott Haldeman wrote an article a few years ago and they described it like going through the back pain supermarket you can just pick things off the shelves that you wanted to try and that's because none of them worked wonderfully show as far as what is best\nLike going through the back pain supermarket you can just pick things off the shelves that you wanted to try\nAnd that's because none of them worked wonderfully show as far as what is best in your case I Would say what's worked in the past ... what do you tolerate what are you willing to do but not only can you do those past things you have to do smacked things you have to keep moving with relative or a story\nAbout prevention a few hints about that and then we don't have to worry about all those options\nNow that would be wonderful if we could prevent all this from a half from occurring to begin with again we don't have good studies that tell us that we can prevent back pain we know that we can prevent episodes have back pain at times and the only thing it has strong evidence or as exercise none of the rest of the treatments we do\nCan really prevent pain\nAnd ah there are certain factors do risk factors that we can alter if you smoke stop smoking because smoking nicotine affects the blood supply to the desk that outside of the desk\nAnd uh the small poor is to go in and out into the disc from the the bone and it can increase just a generation if you're overweight if you lose weight it's probably going to help [noise]\nUh if you don't exercise that's a risk factor being sedentary is a risk factor in were more sedentary now in our society than we've probably ever been in the past\nAnd that's probably one of the run of the reasons that there's so many people who suffer from back pain yeah obesity problem yeah how many of us are thirty pounds overweight\nSo carry a thirty pound backpack around and see what the difference it makes it a little bit of course to a slow we don't think of it over time but if it occurs quickly then you become very aware that\nThis is a stress in my back doesn't need\nRight well a common problem low back pain unfortunately we don't have all the answers but they are some things that you can do to prevent it to a doctor out gay physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist\nHas another name for that takes so much for being with us [noise] very well we're going to
