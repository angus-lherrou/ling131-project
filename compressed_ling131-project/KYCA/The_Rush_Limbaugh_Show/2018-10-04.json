link [noise]\nThere's a one report how are we supposed to read at one report\nWell the reason there's only one copy of it is so that they can't get leaked this is raw data about people\nFolks we have gone to great lengths to explain to you what this FBI report is it is a series of former three oh two it's\nIt's like the FBI version of the forum ten forty three oh two is simply the results of an interview with people people of interest targets non targets neighbors passers by\nIrritate or whatever the FBI goes in talks to people\nThey've done this about Kevin ... now seven times\nOver the course of his judicial career and when he was in the White House staff secretary to George W. Bush he's carrying the nuclear codes in what's called the football he's got to have a top level of security has got to be worthy of it they've done background after background after background on Capitol and they just did another one and they wouldn't talk\nTo specific witnesses\nAs a result of the claims by ... Ford and Ramirez\nThey talked to mark judge for three hours they talked to revere as I talked to a bunch of people they produce the results of those interviews they don't tell anybody they think they're lying they don't report their their opinions they don't come to conclusions they simply filed with three ... and\nThey send them up to the Senate the White House the Senate gets one company you know why that is because Obama\nPatrick Leahy who was the chairman of the judiciary\nThe Senate gets one copy and you know why that is because Obama and Patrick Leahy who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee back during one of the of the Obama terms agreed to this\nThe Democrats the Republicans on Obama agreed that FBI reports like this would be submitted to the Senate only one copy so that senators can't walk out with it and the leak it they're going to leak it any way that's already started to happen\nBut the ... and the Democrats know this this is this is another example of how they just simply why this is not being just disingenuous they're lying\nAnd they're trying to make it look like Trump and Grassley are trying to hide something and it's not it's law hideous Senate law Senate rules\nWith the imprimatur any agreement a bronco saying oh and so now these Democrats\nSenators are just whining and moaning about the fairness of it and how hard it is to read it with only one copy that means we have to go up in group to we have to make it a point it was the same thing with the Trans Pacific partnership\nIt's all in the book ... I mean when I say it's all there it is I mean it's not a substitute for reading the Bible but it's the book of acts it's all there\nSo he uses the book of acts and six New Testament eat pistols as the introductory guide here to get people who want to read the Bible butter intimidated by it\nTo actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you finish this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start\nAnd you'll be more likely to stay with it\nIt\nThe suffering and the sorrow the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures\nIt details the suffering and the ... the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures\nIn Christianity following the death and the resurrection and the central Jesus Christ which if the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity\nDoes exist and and that's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that you can't physically\nPut your arms around that resurrection from the dead\nBut it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't\nEven imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any names liberal talk show host really ... you really believe that camp you that's why you people are not you can't really think that somebody died hey back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell for Christianity to be what it is that had to happen and my brother David is a devoted to helping people believe that has happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept ones in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this is it look it it's it's not simply a primer it's its own story it has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nTo be sort of like an introduction\nThe Bible into Christianity both tests limits but this focuses on the book of acts because that's where it all is not don't just read the book X. forget everything else but it's all there in the book actually that's why they chose the book of acts to start this so and I I again I I think you ever given me the time to mention as it would not\nBe a timely at any time in the next two or three days
