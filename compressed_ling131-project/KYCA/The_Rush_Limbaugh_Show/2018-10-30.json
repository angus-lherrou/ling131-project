make a quick point that's a hard left and the media and the especially Hollywood um I think it has been engaging in gas sliding or the right\nWould you explain what you define that are just so many people to use the word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending there'd be defined\nOkay gas lighting I'm the most common example is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this child in the family to take care of all of the chicken and burned\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about them they sneer at them um especially when people aren't looking\nAnd then if that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make up this entire narrative and what they believe Russia's at that person is an idiot they're not evil\nNow I'm not seeing it all that every I'm liberal person in like this I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both sides but I think that a left elevate people like this and I think the right try that shut them up\nUm and that's really all you can do I mean you can't always control who's on your side but you can control you elevate\nAnd I'm lying is perfectly fine if your guest sliding um and especially the a dog whistle because you just imagine what that person says oh well we'll clearly that was raised as well they use the word the oh why don't you don't want to beat the dog was always someone on the right uses that\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox\nThis and pushing back against that\nUh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris ... I gotta I gotta you know I'm On Fox News Sunday\nTwice a year during ratings month [noise] and\nChris Wallace is always very polite and exceedingly nice and asks me to make sure that tell you not to get mad at him for interrupting me because I mean doesn't he would never get a question and after we ask the first one\nSo I got a note from a golf buddy who watched this past Sunday man this guy wall as you say he's a good guy but disguised gone so far left I don't know if I don't know if I couldn't believe what you're telling me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happened\nWell it clearly wasn't this\nOn Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast in front page headlines from a Washington Post the day after Steve ... shots in Alexandria, Virginia by Bernie Sanders supporters\nWith the Washington Post headlines following the capture of the mail bomb mastermind\nAnd Trump supporters genius or say oc and not surprisingly the post made sure to emphasize that say ox political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shut up skull east was not mentioned\nPolitically at all and it's Chris Wallace holding needs to headlines up and pointing it out let's say a headline written bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump\nWallace said that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read something like suspect arrested\nA closer inspection of the article finds that it does not even mentioned that ... was the bombing suspect until the fourth paragraph instead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy talking about his support for Trump and all of stickers on his van\nBut on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings sadly congressman shot in Virginia you didn't mention his name he didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention um any ... in fact that foot noted\nHis support\nFor Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention um anything infected foot noted his support for Sanders and it barely like an asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump\nSo here's Chris Wallace holding up the obvious evidence of media bias here that he said surprised him\n\nAnd later on in the in the show Jason and Riley andme a Wall Street journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media this is why these two headlines or why ... play right\nYou folks it every day Donald Trump is the only Republican waving\nOr informing people about the success of his policies\nEveryday stock market and good Trump tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets it every day what ever the economic news is or whatever the successes that his agenda his administration is happening he tweets it\nAnd if it weren't for him in wouldn't be out there other than us of course here in so called alternative media but the but but the point is the Republican Party is not even touting the Trump administration's agenda successes Trump alone is doing it\n\nAnd that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it in and I hope we never does\nBut when I when I realized this that Trump is the only guy like today there are a couple of tweets from Trump tweeting ... consumer confidence\nAs being in a record high and and relating to how can people be voting Democrat when this kind of great economic news has been than the news of the day for two years\nThere's all\nKinds of Republicans are running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats thirty five thirty six Senate seats where is I don't ...
