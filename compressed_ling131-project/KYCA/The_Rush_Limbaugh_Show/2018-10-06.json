I'm anxious to see a little bit more of this defense are on display and I think a big key today will be in the sun devils continue to run the football\nAnd that was going to be my a last question for you before we go to the break or last thought\nThe devils were so successful running the ball last week against admittedly a defense that struggling in Oregon State right but if you are men were set it do it until they stop you and I have a feeling that that's going to be their mindset today we're going to run until Colorado proves they can stop the run\nAnd I think if her met words has his way for the next however many\nIn the first month of the season are running game and the defense travels well yeah and you know and I love it when he says you're on the ball quarterback get to the snap\nTurns around and ...\nNot very heavy you can pick up the ball around with it and and that is ... and he's right you know with all the\nPyrotechnics we've seen off as of late with spread off insistence does or through the years in college football I still maintain that if you can run the football and play solid defense you have a chance to win championships or as much as I Love to see some devils or beat Stanford if they ever play I'm I'm\nI admire the way Stanford plays because it's a classic we're going to line up\nWe know we're going to do and you know what we're gonna do\nSee that you can stop us right and I really think that's the kind of mentality that term wants to establish with an Arizona State often it's not only this year but in coming years the ability to dominate\nThe line of scrimmage run the football because money when you can run the ball you can impose our will on your opponent\nMan that's really important here today a reminder to earn points for Sandoval tickets and care with the a fan of the rewards programs he looked like Chevron\nVisit WWW dot a fan of the dot com today she program rules for details we come back we'll have a visit with the shoes record setting running back you know Benjamin that's next on count down to kick off from Boulder on the devil radio network\nApparently they send you for your yard and home and cross country by us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott", "day": "06"}
