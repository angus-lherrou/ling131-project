sexual assault then it was on the evidence for that there was no evidence there was no core operations so then it became that he wouldn't be fair he wouldn't be fair because of this whole experience because they're angry\nBecause of his extreme statements while he testified it would prove that he was only interested in revenge and therefore he became temperamental late on acceptable\nAnd then it became amplified ridge judicial temperament was just not\nPermitted he doesn't have the values that we want on the Supreme Court\n\nSo he was accused of partisanship he was accused of judicial in temper but he was accused of sexual harassment none of those things stuck so it basically boils down to the fact that he's not one of them and when you get right down to what that's what was all about
