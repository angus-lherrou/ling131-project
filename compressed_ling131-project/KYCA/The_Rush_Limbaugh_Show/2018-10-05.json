um I Believe it was during the male Gorsuch a earrings\nThat Murkowski one to the administration I eat Trump and bargain her votes for exploration writes in Anwar and I worked up and Trudeau I Know what that's like the revenue that that feel brings to the state\nIs correct that you're right I remember the you're exactly right and well I I think I Know where you're going this is a hell of a pay

right but that that means a lot for her and her state\nSo I don't know um\nThe other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately impeachment hearings which started against Trump\nBut it would most likely include Kavanaugh what does that do for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nThat can play you mean to be impeached is well\nAbsolutely sir\nNo no no ... they wouldn't buy that much off um get rid of capital I'm getting back off the bench or install Trump's next nominees when the White House and twenty twenty now I in fact I think my guess is\nThat they would go after capital first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings\nRefreshing everybody's minds go after him on her ... rainy\nAnd sexual harassment\nNot I mean serious serious things for which\nA conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capitals and they and all the other things on Trump this my gas that they would go after Kavanaugh first but that meant Gorsuch they would leave alone Gorsuch\n... and it was one of our fun it's nice to have my

faced yesterday and and why they know the cabinet was going to be confirmed up but you know our only hope that my family's only hope is that their hatred of cabin on means he really is that good\nOh
