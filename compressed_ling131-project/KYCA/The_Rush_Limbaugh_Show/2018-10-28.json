national editor for the cook Political Report Joshua ... and host of morning on NPR welcome to meet the press [noise]\nThat Sunday Morning as our colleague journalist an editor Keith brought on Twitter late yesterday the worst anti Semitic attack in us history took place today just days after the largest attempted assassination of political leaders in us history\nBut that thinking it's a deeply unsettling assessment that has the disturbing advantage of being accurate\nThis after a week of ethnic violence and political terror on friday a Florida Man Cesar ... was arrested in charge was sending as many as fourteen mail bombs to Democrats and other critics of President Trump and justice of the country tried to exhale as the male bombing danger seem to have passed\nWe learned yesterday the horror in Pittsburgh where\nA lot of people were shot and killed history of life congregation synagogue in the city is heavily Jewish world film they last night\nThere were numerous vigils around the city in the country including this one in Pittsburg near the synagogue remember them in our hyper partisan atmosphere\nWhere we will inevitably debate was the male bomber inspired in catalyzed by President Trump\nWho kept his political opponents enemies of the people or was he just alone are filled with anger and political resentments was the synagogue shooter\nA product of a toxic environment on the right that treats refugees and Americans who don't look and worship as they do as other\nOr with this type of hate filled mass murder we've seen too many times in this country before we got both of these stores covered plus we're going to look at the amped up political rhetoric that serves as the backdrop to this year's midterm elections just nine days away\nBut let's begin with my colleague NBC News justice correspondent Pete Williams will hopefully has updates force on both of these stories speak warning\nMorning Chuck will Bowers is now going to phase Robert Bauer is the uh the ... the alleged shooter in in Pittsburgh is going to face Seventy two counts now these been charged both by the federal government and by the state\nThat took place over correct well they they both filed charges so I think it's not clear who where he's going to go on trial first with the federal government was very eager to step in and say this was a hate crime\nAnd just as the ah Pennsylvania authorities have said\nCharges so I think it's not clear who where he's going to go on trial first with the federal government was very eager to step in and say this was a hate crime\nAnd just as the ah Pennsylvania authorities have said and there seems to be very little doubt that for three reasons basically one is that social media postings months and months of of a vial anti Semitic comments secondly the fact that he singled out a synagogue is speaks for itself and thirdly the police in Pittsburgh say\nAs he was being transport into the hospital as he was being treated for his wounds he said all Jews must must die because they are committing genocide against my people\nDenise who who does he referred to as is his people in the case who knows I mean that's that's what he told the police as they were treating him on the way to the hospital\nThere was that other than his whereabouts over the last year there's not much known about Mr powers\nFor that is there what what what profile or they\nWere able to drop so far no you're right and if you contrast the two here Caesar say Iraq are accused of the bombings of sending out the package bombs hidden had many run ins with police over the years he even made a bomb threat against Florida\nPower light over one of his power bills at one point on the other hand Bowers seems to have absolutely no contact with law enforcement they said he was never on their radar before he was a loner and neighbors say he never got out much he seemed to have his life seems to have been led on line and I think one question is\nHas he ever visited that synagogue before did he know the lay out of it because you know ultimately it ends on the third floor that's where the shootout with police says he's he's trying to hide from them\nAnd is there a is there any indication that he purchased any of his guns illegally or they'll purchased legally\nNo there's no indication that he bought anything illegally and I think one question about his weapons is this many of the witnesses said they thought there was automatic weapons fire well you have to assume that these are people who don't spend a lot of time listening to gunfire but the police say it sounded like automatic weapons fire so I think the question is\nDid he modify that semi automatic rifle it's possible to do it it's illegal but then he modified in a way that would shoot automatically or was it using a bump stock like was used in the Las Vegas shooting let's move\nTo a Caesar say are as of friday he was not talking a is a is there any update on whether he is yet to cooperate with a with officials [noise]\nNo and in their ability to question him now ah is is reduced he's going to have his first court appearance on Monday they the initial\nHe is yet to cooperate with a with officials [noise]\nNo and in their ability to question him now is is reduced he's going to have his first court appearance on Monday they they initially question him under an exception to the Miranda rule you know normally you have to buy some one of their rights before you can question them\nIf you want to use that evidence in the trial against them but there is a public safety exception and that's what they used tear basically saying are there any more bombs well he refused to say a whether he had anything to do with the ones that were already out there or be whether there were any other still waiting to be discovered it's been what thirty six hours now since they found and\nHey I was just going to say at this point\nI Can't say I noticed that the postal service won't say definitively yet at what point will they feel comfortable assuming that it's out of the ...\nAnother week maybe a you know they had been finding these closer and closer to the mail system or the last ones were discovered inside the mail system so they're all carefully looking for them and I think you have to assume that there aren't any more because this is the longest gap that we've had since they were to anywhere discovered\nAnd all the ... late once discovered or west coast so it sort of makes sense\nThat that might be so the assumption has got to be that\nRight the last two to senator sent to senator Kamala Harris and attempts dire\n... Pete Williams a than an awfully tough and busy week for you for all of us thanks very much for the day yesterday and at a vigil last night members of the community in Pittsburgh\nWere shocked and heartbroken\nWhen it is and think of the day and then combining that community whether you're Jewish or not\nI just could not believe in light of the other things going on across the nation she dish

us or them it's fine airing when you become an elected official suddenly become to print the United states the campaigning is supposed to stop for a while and you go into the mode of unifying this is the president who's never been interested in unifying he's it's been interested in keeping his base engaged and enraged and he's done an\nAmazing job of that but at any moment\nHe believes that it's still in the middle of the campaign the other thing I Want to bring up just with all of this writ large is you know let\nThe country's long history of division who's an American who's not\nSeems to me the time that we're in right now what I feel like is a new one is taking any responsibility\nFor any of this oh it's not the gun law it's not our fault with guns don't kill people killed right it's not our fault who posts on social media don't blame us in social media why can't blame someone else\nIt's not us political leaders ... you know people are doing these things with out that they just have a history of mental instability it's not about what we're saying to them no one at all is raising their hand to say you know\nWe played some role in this and we have to be able to fix it so it's always somebody else's fault and when that's the world we live in is never going to get better\nI I Know everybody everybody\nWe played some role in this and we have to be able to fix it so it's always somebody else's fault and that's the world we live in is never going to get better ...\nI I Know everybody everybody when you go to the president says what about this what about what what about this and I would say there's only one president\nThat's right there's a day in fact because\nThey don't the response within the White House and I spoke to a number of officials is look everyone bearish responsibility\nAnd when you put that question to them squarely look he is the president he has the loudest microphones doesn't he'd bear the largest responsibility they say look he has changed some of his rhetoric he has struck unifying but remember on friday check he was asked if he is going to tone down the rhetoric he said no he thinks he can actually counted up now that was prior to\nYesterday's tragic shooting but I think Amy really hits the nail on the head which is that White House officials say this\nYes he feels like he needs to have a unifying notes at the same time we are ten days out from the mid terms and so he knows what he needs to say to fire up his base and a lot of that rhetoric is divisive that's the bottom line\nTurks and David French wrote this and said you know what they'll call this person crazy referring to say he's an anger angry obsessive and that there's a difference and that the language didn't matter and he writes that not all listening years sober minded are entirely rational and when they hear a public figure they admire thunder against his political opponents with extreme language\nSometimes they they'll take extreme action in response was David French putting some of the burden on the part\nI I think so um I probably have more with putting the burden on the president is how much do you put on him I think a lot of people want to put a lot of the burden on him where it really does belong on the American people as a whole\nI'm the president is the American comments section of the White House\nAnd he used to president who does this we're not going to change this president what can we knew the changes that people if we're not going to change the president I don't I think aims right no one wants to change the fact of the matter is this just larger than the president society is crumbling around us\nPolitics has amplified at the present example find it but there's something going on in society as a whole ah that is translating into politics and the president is not the cause he's a symptom\nHe's the president Joshua she is only one\nThe president bears part of the responsibility of significant part of the authority for the tone of the country but I Will say I do have a fair amount of hope\nComing out of this and I know it seems very bleak but I find a lot of hope and younger people that montage she play in the first one of the program the girl with the ... future hair and she was one of the organizers of the desert and do an squirrel hill she got on Facebook\nA lot of hope in the younger people that montage she played in the first one of the program the girl with the ... future hair and she was one of the organizers of gathering data on squirrel hill she got on Facebook and helps bring people together to just come talk I got a tweet from a guy who I think is in Wisconsin who says Hi combat the heat of the world by coaching high school debate\nThey learn to see both sides of an issue and how current events relate to real life there was a poll that came out from two recently that found that the younger you are\nThe better you are able on line to discern factual statements same opinions and the older people generation thrown out the baby boomers blame them maybe ... frankly I Know I think it's it's the generations and I'm just a generation removed\nWho have grown up with the advent of social media who haven't been able to navigate it far kids having watched our example another question is whether we will be quizzing to them a nation that remains connected whether this is the beginning of another cultural civil war but\nI come out of this worried but also hopeful that there are people who are taking responsibility for this look what happened after Parkland look what's happening now after school ... there is a generation ready to leave but the question is will will they be leading I'll\nTell you somebody who's not helpful Charlie Sykes former talk radio host\nHe wrote this in the Weekly Standard the result of course it's familiar in a crossword refusal to engage in any meaningful self examination refusal to acknowledge the failures in your own tribe while insisting relentlessly on the malignancy of the other tribe it's hatred violence that apparently bottomless capacity perception of trickery so this will get worse\nSorry Joshua we live in a couple of times and the president is the arsonist in cheap but he's not alone this will get worse Amy Walter the by\nA I Would I Want to I Want to think about reality show but fortunately when\nWhen I get I get asked that question all the time right what is going to break the fever how where do we go from here and we know historically what breaks it usually is something really devastating right and we get we brought together by events that are so overwhelming and so tragic whether it's a war and ... something like that I don't want that can be the case\nI and I would like to say I'm proud of the way men responded when ... was shot I mean we didn't blame Bernie Sanders when Steve ... was shot we all came together I think we can all come together now or it may take us about nine days for that to happen but I think we can all come together now\nWell I Want to read something Dan ...\nStart today though it's David is an avid layered because\nToday well I Hope I Hope that the finger pointing will stop and we can come together I Believe we need to come together and then\nI have to tell you I actually think Dan ... is the perfect person to insert into this because he writes the following this is a time of the politics of the apocalypse\nAnd all or nothing new the difference between winning and losing an election and holding power or not holding it politicians say that it's time for the country to come together as you just did what on who's terms I think that is the issue constantly on\nWhat this coming together mean to the Democrats and then I'm going to ask the same question to Congress and diverse I'll start with him ...\nWell look it's making sure that we're able to reach across the island we can work in a bipartisan basis for Democrats have been clear about is if we're fortunate to win back the house which I Believe we will that we work immediately on lowering prescription drug prices for the American people\nThat we work on a bipartisan infrastructure package to make investments across the country and that we work together to clean up Washington DC\nTo find ways to overturn Citizens United to address gerrymandering to improve and increased transparency and disclosure across the government to restore faith in our political process those are all areas where we can work together and reach across the aisle and find some common ground\nCommon sense ... what does it mean to you why I think\nI Do because we need to come together or not on anyone's terms but on America's terms we're Americans first\nFiery within that infrastructure is something that we all need and we need to come together on lowering prescription drug costs I'm not sure why didn't talk about lowering healthcare costs we need to come together on lowering healthcare costs a and I think we can do that we need to listen to each other\nOr no matter who takes the majority and I think we're going to hold the majority but no matter who takes the majority it will be a razor thin majority and hopefully that will mean people will come together Republicans and Democrats\nAnd I think we're going to hold the majority but no matter who takes the majority it will be a razor thin majority and hopefully that will mean people will come together Republicans and Democrats to get things done\nBut I Do worry about of you know making sure that we do it in a way that we're focused on getting things done not on just abolishing ice\nOr and doing the things that are on the extreme\n... got ...
