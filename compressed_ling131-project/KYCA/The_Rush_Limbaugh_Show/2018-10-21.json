{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KYCA", "content": "\nThis is the news fourteen Ninety and one oh three point five FM K Y. C. A. Prescott and key to seven eight seed in Prescott it's\nAll about\nIs\nWill be the election capital the\nCuts dominance and\nRepublican candidates get the message\nWhile Democrats focus on healthcare protection\nSupreme mission and orange rain were getting out of the mainstream\nAnd joining me this morning democratic minority leader\nSenate campaign committee Tomcat looks up north Carolina fought in the Republican candidate on surgery or more are we just seeing a natural closing the mid term we have a brand new and be seen as Wall Street journal poll out this morning with some unusual\nResult that you're making more and more a little nervous\nShowing Marines I envy you want to\nAnd most of all it must be in Eugene Robinson\nWere inside NBC is going to\nMove columnist Eugene Robinson Peggy Noonan a columnist for the wall Street Journal David Rohde she'd political analyst for CBS News Sunday meeting the bronze\nGood Sunday morning and welcome to the choose your own adventure mid term elections is there a democratic wave coming we've got data support that as a surge oppose cabin on Tuesday hasn't for Republicans turn back the Democrats momentum\nThere's data to support that or could this be a typical midterm with Democrats making just ...\nThere's data to support that too and we have plenty of new data this morning cares what our brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters\nDemocrats only seven point lead and the generic ballot forty forty one that's down significantly from the twelve point lead Democrats held just a month ago pre Kevin ... when it was fifty two forty but wait there's more\nAmong likely voters the Democrats lean gross not shrinks cause to nine fifty to forty one here's why that's interesting\nIt's a first time ever in our polling that are likely voter model shows a better number for the Democrats than the registered voter number normally in midterms Republicans have the likely voter advantage so what's different this year it's the heightened enthusiasm for Democrats among millennials Latinos and younger women groups that historically\nHave had low turnout rates that are making it into a likely voter model to share asked for President Trump\nHe has his best numbers yet in our poll among registered voters forty seven percent approve of his performance in office or forty nine percent disapproved that substantially better than his numbers last month in our poll forty four fifty to approve disapproved\nBut again among those likely voters his numbers didn't get worse forty five percent approved fifty two percent disapproved\nThere are a lot of questions leading up to this year's midterms but here's what we do know there's a higher interest in this election than any my turn we'd ever measured turnouts can be through the roof and the divide between men and women is growing with the Democratic strength the result of unprecedented support among women\nNow will be enough to stop the Republicans post cabin album that's going to be the story of the next sixteen days\nDemocrat produce mops\nStop the Republicans post cabin album that's going to be the story of the next sixteen days\nDemocrats produce mops Republicans produced jobs\nPresident Trump's closing argument is all about the\nDemocrats won Israel your borders wide open to deadly sin ruthless gangs\nAnd Republican candidates are sending more and more like Mr Trump repeating dire warnings on immigration\nRemember it's going to be an election of the caravan\nThe caravan is coming from Central America because Margaret caravan\nAt times using violent language and the body slammed my\nCat [noise] but I'm going\nTo stop all over your face with golf spikes because candidates or even recycling Mr Trump's insult\nThese low energy person\nYou're dealing\nWith the fight for control of a sudden it playing out largely in states the president won this race first strategy banks on Mr Trump's ability to bring out voters in more rural areas where he is popular\nBut the president's rhetoric is unlikely to help Republicans in the suburban house districts where they are already at a demographic disadvantaged and for the first time ever\nIn two straight NBC News Wall Street journal polls women favored democratic control of Congress by a whopping twenty five points\nMy now we're going to hell in the hand that you know I I just can't believe some of the antics\nThat go on in the United\nSeventy Seventy five house seats the cook Political Report races competitive\nAre held by Republicans including twenty five and Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen Democrats me to flip just twenty three of those Seventy five to win back the house\nBut the Democratic enthusiasm advantage has narrowed after the cat but I'll Fight and the question is whether those fundamentals will be enough to produce not just the takeover away preexisting conditions Andy Green while Democrats are avoiding a broad national message remaining laser focused on a single issue\nProtections for pre existing conditions protections for preexisting conditions for pre existing conditions pre existing conditions preexisting health conditions\nAnd with President Obama largely absent from the campaign trail and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi unpopular with independents Democrats running in states Trump won or running away from the national party are you\nThe campaign trail and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi unpopular with independents Democrats running in states Trump won running away from the national party\nAre you a Democrat I Am proud Democrat gosh it's hard to figure out I don't know what I said if he has had a tiny thing anymore\nAnd even running away from the Democratic leaders changes layers makes some sense I think we had a chance to players joining me now from Chicago is the Senate Democratic whip Dick\nSenator Durbin welcome back to meet the press are\nGoing to be within ... I Know you couldn't see that package but you can hear it that last voice in there was the former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen who is running for the U.S Senate seat in Tennessee are calling for a quote change of players when it comes to the Democratic leadership\nOr you're a member of his Democratic leadership when you hear that is they're going to be a change of players being yourself Senator Schumer Nancy Pelosi or make your case for why it isn't necessary\nA truck that's tomorrow's newspaper today's newspapers election on November six\nAnd let me tell you what we're doing we're focusing on the issues that make a difference I Know that you probably have the preexisting condition phrase or a dozen times in that leader and\nThat's because the American people put that is the highest priority they want protection for their families they know the Republicans voted consistently to take away the protection and file lawsuits to end it\nThat's why it's such an important issue over and over in a local basis\nBut let me go back to the leadership issue you've heard that the other voice and there were scarce didn't send them out of the Democratic nominee in Arizona saying people don't like parties anymore and obviously that both parties are unpopular and our poll right now is that a problem for you that there are voters out there that you need to win over who don't like the Democratic party\nBut you're having to basically make the case hey you may not like us but don't you like the other side and we're a last\nIt gets down to this ... or more and more independent voters and I think ... correct in making that assertion [noise] but the bottom line is we are doing well with those independent voters take a look at what Mitch McConnell gave us this last week an insight into where the Republicans are going if they continue to control Congress\nIn order to deal with the deficits they created with a tax bill for the wealthy people and special interest they are going to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid those are fighting words for a lot of people not just Democrats but independents as well pre existing conditions making sure the Social Security and Medicare\nMedicare and Medicaid those are fighting words for a lot of people not just Democrats but independents as well pre existing conditions making sure that Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are strong for years to come that's a good basis to get a lot of people elected to Congress\nOn a plate figure it out that a Jacky Rosen she's the Democratic nominee running in Nevada and it's interesting and the message she's trying to send in Nevada voters which may surprise some newer stimulus\nJackie rose and rose legislation to improve veterans' health care and President Trump signed it into law Jackie stood up and that's below sing to reform\nThe being so here's a Democratic Senate candidate in Nevada talking about legislation that she got signed by President Trump and essentially trying to distance ourselves\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi\nWhat does that say about\nThe power of anti Trump message these days\nI can tell you a Jacky Rosen a obviously as it knows the pulse of Nevada and she has come forward with a message that plays across the United states\nAgree with the president when he was right to be prepared to fight him if necessary when he's wrong I'm working with the administration to disclose the cost of prescription drugs on the ads they put on television secretary aids or of the Trump Administration did not vote for and the cabinet\nI didn't have to do but in fairness you've had for years and the majority in the Senate to come up with an alternative and two years with full Republican controlled Washington\nYeah and I know you know how do you say words probably better than I Do you got to get sixty votes to make that happen we did reconciliation get rid of the individual mandate and take some of the underpinnings of the board will CARE Act out\nWe've got to replace it and the same way that we've got to make sure that shows were ... the Social Security and Medicare can be paid for and medicate over time\nWhat what the Democrats are not mentioning are widely publicized reports that say if we stay on the current trajectory we're going to have a crisis in funding and those programs\nNo one wants to take away Medicare Social security or Medicaid from people who need it but we have to have a sustainable solution and we need sixty votes to get that done\nMath is a funny thing here in Washington nobody seems to want to ever site it but we have a record breaking deficit\nA record breaking dead every day when you watch the debt clock but a record breaking deficit this year that may surpass the trillion dollars you now annually nevermind obviously a multi ... multiples of that in the debt the president yesterday is talking about a new tax cut you're talking about reforming Social Security and Medicare what\nWhere are you how you got to pay for this tax cuts that the president is apparently proposed\nWell we've got to make sure that it's at least a supported by facts round dynamic growth that has to pay for itself we can go further in debt I voted against the spending bill\nAnd and so we've got to we've got to get the American people to recognize that we had a powder keg of dynamite and the debt that continuing to grow what reaching a point where the service to our debt service could exceed\nOur contribution in our investment in the military we've got to make sure that the American people understand we've got to balance our our books we got to be on a budget just like the American people\nYou just said you wanted that any new tax cut to pay for itself up this current cat tax cuts clearly not paying for itself the depth increasing not decreasing and there's no sign that it's going to decrease but if you take a look at\nThe scoring for economic growth every time we can I I think that there is a way to\nRationalize that this tax cut will pay for itself through sustained economic growth and we don't make the numbers at wall but if we do and we're already seeing it early into this cycle than I Do believe that we create an incremental revenue is not going to be enough to come anywhere close to retiring are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt that's where we are going to have to look at\nTough choices so that we can balance our books\nCenter time tell us Republican from North Carolina I'm gonna leave it there thanks for coming on sharing could be as much per sank you when we come back\nMore on those mid term elections which is wrong or the Republicans\nAt the same democratic anger President Trump's allies as we go to brag about what I heard that we were

wall Street Journal NBC News correspondent and host of MSNBC Live my friend cater and David Modi she political analyst for CBS News welcome all so trying to figure out\nWhat this poll wish is showing us today in our new NBC Wall Street Journal poll and let's put this sort of his put it a little bit of historical context here presidential job approval\nConnected to states last and the first midterm we go back here's President Trump sitting at forty seven percent that seems to be an improvement for half what would forty seven percent job rating mean in the past when it comes to the term result well President Obama had exactly that at forty seven percent job approval rating in twenty ten\nHis party lost sixty three seats Bill Clinton in Nineteen Ninety four in the same period of time in October headache forty eight percent\nApproval rating and lost fifty four states so Peggy Noonan should Republicans feel better or worse this morning when they look at the end be seen as well\nI think they should feel as can be used for anybody else [laughter] goodness for Republicans is only six months ago I think we were all talking about a blue wave that we knew was coming and going to be very significant\nOne not quite talking that way anymore it looks kind of more interesting and complicated didn't state by state\nAnd the continuing mystery that is not a mystery is how a president and ended ministry ration can have\nWhat is essentially peace and prosperity for economic growth and wars and still be struggling to get to ... percent which\nA centrally peace and prosperity for economic growth and no new wars and still be struggling to get to ... percent which in the approval polls\nWhich you can't draw ran out of all of here people just is a central fact I think of the nation stats standard political gravity and I don't think you can do that with\nDonald Trump and I and I do think that there is an argument to be made for people telling pollsters one thing that believe and other things and I think that should be wary and that's going forward I mean it just feels a lot and I hate to be Debbie Downer for for Democrats or for any for Republicans have or anyone more for the standard messaging I shouldn't say but\nThat's a lot like twenty six teams it feels a lot like everyone was talking twenty six than the Democrats are going to win it's going to be a landslide Donald Trump's kind of pulled out all Republicans there's no way they're ever going to win and\nThey just don't you go out and talk to people on the road they talk about health care a lot they're also not necessarily talking about when you talked to a variety of people how much they hate Donald Trump\nWhile you know Claudia bring that let me bring up a me Walter because you you you sort of\nAnd the tri

records for turnover among staffers on the west wing just this week White House counsel Don McGahn left his job after months of speculation and after successfully shepherding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court already to White House is on a second cheapest at\nIts third national security adviser and its ... communications director the person with me\nMost no worthy and shorter step in the west wing is one of those five Anthony Scaramucci the White House shop protest eleven days he's out with a new book about his time though and President Trump's orbit particularly well before he became President Trump the blue collar president\nAnd he joins me now Mr ... press happy Sunday so the timing of your book are coming out comes as we get reports of a screaming match\nAnd he joins me now Mr Scott which can lead to press happy Sunday\nSo the timing of your book coming out comes as we get reports of a screaming match between a a former boss of yours John Kelly current cheapest at the national security adviser John Bolton was over the issue of immigration was clear it was it according to our sources it was over\nSome comments and national security visor made to the secretary of homeland security a former deputy to the chief of staff\nJohn Kelly apparently walked out furious there were rumors of a\nPotential resignations\nHow they are with that same thing for you\nWas there any profanity I mean that could have been re possibly possibly some profanity look seems really not that familiar to me and yet the remember my incident was on the phone with a reporter who I shouldn't have trust and and so that's my fault and I totally on that but I think the more relevant thing is\nYou know people are playing in the NFL verbal contacts and so people playing very hard for the president um I don't know what happened in that specific incident and um but you know I I Know that the west wing and the way the president set up the west wing it it's it's tough in there for\n... you were pretty tough though in General Kelly in your book I'm going to put up an extra pair of the general style\nWould be in direct conflict with the way Mr Trump had always conducted business President Trump doesn't work in a precise way right never has never will it's been over a year since John Kelly became White House chief of staff but my scouting report early on proved to be quite accurate his personal in security has proven to be a poor match\nWith the self confident gregarious president look I think\nThat's pretty self evident I mean just even this past week you know I applaud the generals service of the country I'm obviously forty years in the U.S Marine Corps but this is a very different jobs as a civilian based job and I think he's tried to apply\nMilitary like management style to a group of civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work and and and by the way you know the the president as a free wheeling style is very different from a a John Kelly's\nYou feel personally mistreated by John Kelly who seem pretty you seem pretty upset at him and his book well\nListen not you know she didn't need to fire me the way fire me and I had this conversation with the president you could have done it in different manner holy ... tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money\nOr didn't countless hours of media ... during the campaign and the transition and even after president was a Naga rated uh there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it said it was it was uh\nFor there was a Naga rated uh there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it said it was it was upsetting at the time I write about in the book\nUm what I thought was an honest assessment of him and I'm I stand by the wars in the book should the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work I think he needs the cheapest stab but he needs the cheapest David really likes him in and gets his personality you know John Kerry likes the president do you\nI mean I I I don't personally and I don't want to I don't want to ... let me say I travel around the country and I asked people that rhetorical question does it doesn't come across lady she does and and by the way the the Bob Woodward book I don't know he seems like a pretty accurate journalists to me and so\nUh I don't like John Kelly calling the president's things that just called them I think it's I think it's wrong and and so for me\nI have no problem standing up for myself or or telling you what I think about John Kelly or a situation where the president\nHaving said that I applaud the guy service but it's not just me ... you know she she hurt the morale inside the place and he ... he's hurt the president and so ... and he has his he fit you know he he left last week after the uh the report that he had with them ...\nThat's the personality of the good news is on being vindicated by that because he is demonstrating his personality now the way he really is from\nCarrie you've you've interacted with with President Trump as candidate Trump you weren't quite on board first with the idea of him president you had other candidates who were interested in first I think you would normally what Scott Walker the liquor and governor Wisconsin a toyed with going with Jeb Bush what finally convinced you that Donald Trump had what it took the Scott Walker did\nSo I actually you relate to send the book I met with the president the day after The Apprentice finale or we sat in his office and we were joking about him running for president I didn't believe him at the time and I was already hooked into Scott Walker\nBut what I liked about the president and he's a very loyal guy when I explained to him that my loyalties word of Scott Walker and Jeb Bush\nHe then said okay well after I clean their clocks when you come work for me and I said absolutely and so ah after the south Carolina primary I went to the president's office with Senator Scott brown\nWho was a friend of mine from tops you know we went up there together and we had a great conversation and we begin building blocks for the financing operation and then when he brought in Stephen, Stephen ... a things

try to go after him in different ways\nMichael ... someone who I think people have been trying to put the two of you together for some sort of talk show and he's been she's tried to go out um directly Elizabeth Warren responded to some of the criticism the crazy nickname stuff more formally\nOut what is the best way to go after President Trump what advice would you give a Democrat and how do you go after he had an adult book I\nYou know is is you know I really care for the president and I'm a big supporter so I don't like giving them advice but I think the big mistake that they're all making as they go right into the Trump insect Twitter light and so the minute he shoots at them they cannot help themselves\nAnd they drive themselves right into that light and then they get vaporized by him and so the incident with a Senator Warren she should really read my book so she can understand\nHow the president you think about the miracle what he did he hijacked the Republican Party to get the nomination and then he hijacked the base of the other party and moved over to the Republican Party and I tried to write about that in the book because I haven't experienced as a kid that grew up in a blue collar neighborhood with the blue collar family\nAnd I think I've seen the whole band whether this sort of stuff but my recommendation of people\nIs don't engage them in that area because you're
