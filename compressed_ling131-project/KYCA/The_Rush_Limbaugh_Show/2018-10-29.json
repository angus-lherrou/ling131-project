Virginia Hi\nHi rash of what a great honor and privilege as it is to speak with you today\nThank you very much I just wanted to make a couple additional observations about the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yeah now I\nI normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo on the ABC News reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they sat this neither my wife now where I can remember there ever recording this before even after the\nFarrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this went on with it and\nI couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were about armed security for these\nYou know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive may never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you if you do things that can give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can lay claim to then all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where does that mean it's absurd what are you whereas it hadn't\nYet my own thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our schools since that's obviously a very common target the safe\nWell except the ... the lessons you you we we have a gun free zones in schools now you can't put guns in their only people get it done to the bad guys you'll be ...\nHalf to win it\nHave to win it\nHave told everybody to the American people are tired at

out a bunch of bombs started showing up\nIn places that the media can say that they are being received by Trump targets I'm Sorry\nI didn't fall off the turnip truck ever and certainly not yesterday and the world of October surprises coupled with all the other realities I just expose them I think it only makes sense to be\nSuspicious and demanding of proof for whatever we're on we're going to be\nPrecisely because everything's so politicized everything now is being reported with in the context of how can it hurt Trump how does it hurt pro does it hurt and it\nHappened we obviously people

or anything that will assist them in creating an anti Trump sentiment heading into the midterms and that's how they first report these things like I say that this tragedy hit the synagogue and scroll hill\nSection of Pittsburgh [noise] I mean after reporting\nAs many of the details those were known men were often the races on how Trump was responsible and how Trump may benefit or may get hurt by
