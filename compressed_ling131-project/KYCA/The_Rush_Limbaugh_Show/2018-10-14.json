Mitchell\nOn the board of\nNews national political reporter Carol\nMore numbers correspondent Andrea Mitchell\nThe lord of\nThe new national political reporter Carol Lee\nAnn ... of Stanford University\nMore welcome to Sunday\nGood Sunday morning Tip O'Neill famously said all politics is local\nBuoyancy wrong now and the age of Trump all politics as national Republicans mostly in Senate races want to remind voters how much they love President Trump Democrats mostly in suburban house races want to remind voters how much they dislike President Trump\nAnd Mr Trump wants to remind everyone how much he loves to be at the center of it all flooding the zone with made for TV appearances all week long we've never seen one party take over a chamber of commerce a Congress while the opposing party gain seats in the other chamber\nThis year President Trump's popularity in rent America and its toxicity and blue America suggest Democrats could win back the house or Republicans actually picked up seats in the Senate\nMaking securing their majority for perhaps four more years in other words red is getting red or blue is getting bluer and then there's purple those independent voters with a blue tend to them\nThey could end up deciding this whole thing but the question what three weeks to go until the mid term election is this for the Republicans post Kavanaugh momentum continue\nGrabbing a lot of victories folks get President Trump eager to energize his base in Kickstarter is twenty twenty campaign has a message for Republican voters the mid term elections are all about him\n[noise] is it hard\nFor me I don't vote for Steve is a vote for me I don't vote for Sunday's vote for me I vote for Marcia is really a vote for me\nIt's an argument no democratic candidates are also making in the suburban house districts the party needs to win back control\nMargaret calming down my will be\nMy column and didn't stand up to Donald Trump\nAnd simple this week Mr Trump toured campaign battlegrounds from Council Bluffs Iowa to Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati, Ohio to Richmond, Kentucky called in to Fox News and answered questions from reporters taking advantage of a lull in stories about the special counsel probe to town Republican momentum\nKentucky called in to Fox News and answered questions from reporters taking advantage of a lull in stories about the special counsel probe to town Republican momentum we are more energized those Republicans\nThan ever\nWe just got home numbers for some of the senators\nAnd many of those Senate races Republican candidates are hoping to sustain energy among Mr Trump's core supporters without alienating independent voter with\nThan a Republican and I'd say that Mitt Romney Republican maybe a George Romney Republicans as well and I'm kind of Martha McSally republic\nStill in the aftermath of the Supreme Court fight over to have it on the Republican voters remain energized\nWhatever deficit in enthusiasm\nRepublican voters may have had going into the fall election has been eliminated\nAnd Democrats are facing the hard realities of the Senate landscape in order to get the two seats they need for the majority Democrats need to win at least one of the three contests that currently lean Republican North Dakota Tennessee or Texas\nEven if they hold every other democratic seat and when both Republican toss ups\nAt this point the chances of my party being in the majority in the Senate are miniscule I always thought they were very low\nWhile Republicans borrowed Trump talking points angry left wing mop the left wing ma ma Carla mob mob\nAngry mobs some Democrats gearing up for twenty twenty argue going to have that debate Mr Trump and they may have to be more like ...\nSays and you know when they go low we [noise] [noise]\nThey go low we keep up with this new democratic already has about\nA message stomach twenty Eighteen candidate competitive races are rejected ...\nCaught my grandma she used to say never ever read to where the pig a you both get dirty but the pig likes it\nJoining me now from Miami is Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida Senator Rubio welcome back to meet the press\nThank you before I get to a primary ... a subject I Want to talk about with Saudi Arabia I Want to start with hurricane Michael's impact\nUm particularly to the uh to the eastern part of the panhandle I it does seem as if this was a pretty devastating hip to that part um a lot of people having flashbacks myself included at what happened the homestead how concerned are you that ... Panama City Mexico beach\nI'm a lot of people having flashbacks myself included what happened the homestead how concerned are you that one Panama City Mexico beach\nWill never get rebuilt the way they would like to be rebuilt\nI I use the exact analogy I've used and that is a Andrew you know I ... I think you and I both lived down here during that period of time and that's the closest thing that I can remember in terms of Panama beach and what it looked like Panama City I'm Sorry what it looked like when I saw it\nI didn't get to Mexico beach I've seen that I was at the you see down there the emergency operations center the drone and just come back so we have the fresh images and it basically as a total wipe out and it and it's hard to imagine that ever really being able to recapture the exact identity at one side it'll be rebuilt it'll all be rebuilt at some point\nBut it's going to take a long time you know in terms of electricity in Panama City uh that whole some great has to be rebuilt its not restoration but I Want to tell you what I'm really most concerned about it I'm concerned about all of it\nThere are a lot of inland areas some of these poor rural counties or to the north of there these counties took a devastating hit and we're talking about the poor people many some older\nMiles from each other isolated in many cases from roads including some dirt roads are cut off right now because we haven't been able to reach those people on a number of days\nI Know they're doing the best they can to get to them but I'm really very\nCondition more the fed is there more the federal government is there more resources you want from the feds here is it a is there some military support that's necessary here in order to to speed up the ability to get to some of these communities\nMay be and it's available I what people forget here and I always want to remind them is when it comes to hurricanes the state government is in the lead it is the state government who's in charge of the response\nThe federal government stance and support the state government tells the federal government we need this and we need that so far I have not heard of anything to state and government is asked for\nThat the federal government has not step forward to provide whether there needs to be more that's something that will see in the days to come but I Know the federal government including the department of defense is standing ready to offer even more in the state says it needs it\nI Know that a political norms get erased all the time now but one of the ... raised in Florida which was\nIn the middle of a hurricane coming and hitting the shores there was always this cease fire on television no political negative ads that didn't happen this time he had the Republican Party running negative ads against Andrew Gillum gets them super PACs running negative ads against both Rick Scott and Bill Nelson\nUm is this just par for the course or would you like to see this sort of\nYet some superPACs running negative ads against both Rick Scott and Bill Nelson um is this just par for the course or would you like to see this sort of\nPut back into place of the candidates be more steadfast\nTaking politics out of hurricanes\nYeah look I don't think anything's ever going to be the way it once was appalled especially at the even the election were four weeks away my my fundamental question is whether politics is standing in the way of dealing with the hurricane that would be the one thing I'd have a real problem with and I don't think television ads whether they're right or wrong from a moral perspective\nI don't think television ads keep candidates from doing their job for example you saw the mayor Tallahassee went back to Tallahassee and the governor's doing his job there and Bill Nelson my colleague was focused on the hurricane is well\nA Rhonda ... is not an office right now as an elected official but but his uh his running mate Jeanette pneumonia this and she was at that you see and has been doing her job as speaker for temporary of the state the number two in the Florida House\nSo I think that's the thing I Would look at it as far as norms are concerned um you know politics is different today than it used to be and I don't think it's going to go back and in many in many instances\nAll right I Want to move to the disturbing story of the missing journalist Jamal ... a Washington Post columnist I Know you've been very focused on this first of all as a member of the intelligence community a committee do you know\nMPs and the same columnist ...\nI Would put him is clearly in the authoritarian autocratic a camp absolutely\nAll right John

domestic policy studies at Stanford University had to be seen as national political reporter Kelly and her Mitchell NBC News to find out a cheap foreign affairs correspondent maker of indifferent to reports on MSNBC and Peter Baker he's the chief of course bought it for the New York times and co author of a new book called impeachment\nAnd American history or he writes the bill Clinton chapter\nFor those wondering [laughter] a nice to see let me start with where we just left off with a former CIA director John Brennan and of course the Senator Marco Rubio here's this full page ads in the Washington from the Washington Post\nAnd their own full page ads saying I'd act on Tuesday October second watching post college democracy OJ enter the consulate a Saudi Arabian stumble he has not been seen since demand answers Andrea Mitchell you heard Marco Rubio you heard John Brennan what did you hear\nI heard that Congress is going to take action uh when they put their name will prove it whether they claim that with an accident and misguided a kidnapping attempt connecting rendition\n... uh when they prove this and they will prove it\nWhether they claim it with an accident and misguided a kidnapping attempt kidnapping rendition is also violence it's also taking someone and arguably if we had intelligence it's unclear from my reporting when we had intelligence that name in real time or afterwards or after the fact\nBut they're probably should have been a warning if we had any any way of stopping it but in any case there will be action from Congress the president is going to be forced they've already\nIn the Foreign Relations committee and gone with the Magnitsky letter which is a way of saying to the present and you are now under an an affirmative requirement legal requirement to investigate this which the administration did not want to do investigated with a time limit and sanctions are coming and\nThis is going to be sanctions against ... they've got leverage the Saudi oil the markets I mean this is a big foreign policy questions and we are in a war with them in Yemen\nSo as to how we use them nothing of serious so this relationship the president is not going to be able to stand firm against taking action\nNow Peter Baker launching terribly a ticket for the word Saudi Arabia and insert the word Russia yeah to me it was like it's the same thing Congress has United yeah the president is isolated\nWhat strikes me is NBS these a lot like the early ... which just stay there were moments when people found him to be a performer a modernized with in the hopes that he was going to be somebody who could be a friend with the west and in fact\nBack home he was cracking down pretty hard we're seeing the same thing I think in Saudi Arabia the difference is when when Russia or poisons or former Russian agent on British soil we can unite against Russia because Russia is not\nAn ally is Andrea said Saudi Arabia is an ally it makes it much more complicated we're we're stuck between two friends here in NATO ally turkey and Saudi Arabia who's been friends since the Nineteen forties would put any president in a tough decision\nThe way we treat Saudi Arabia will but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are some regional dynamics are that are very complicated and granted\nWe certainly have an important alliance the Saudis but let's not forget who benefits if we somehow having fracturing of our relationship with the Saudis right the Turks are ready to step in the cutter ... care as well and don't forget Ron right so this whole region actually is very complicated to the extent that we believe the Saudis did indeed do this\nHuge problem and we obviously have to do something about it but let's not forget there are other players and the region that have interests as well so let's not be so quick to run the judgment unless we have complete and thorough evidence of justice actually happened well I Would also say that if he steps\nNot forget there are other players in the region that have been trust as well so let's not be so quick to run the judgment unless we have complete and thorough evidence of justice actually happened\nWell I Would also say that if you step back and look at um the way that some officials in the government particularly in the intelligence community viewed NBS there was deep concern about his the way he operates very young he's thirty three years old he\nIs ruthless he seen as a little bit reckless he's seen as somebody who\nHas this a lot of rope from this administration in particular and yet as somebody who because of his impulses needs a check from the United states until we hadn't had that and this is the kind of thing that intelligent hit me in the officials had been worried about for quite some time for\nAn hour and a shift a little bit the President Bush by the way I think ... and we're realizing envious does care what the elites in this country thinking boy elites turned against him big time\nAfter and molding heck I'll community\nWell we'll see how they react in the next couple of days and we turn to the president here because he does seem to be well let me put it with Andrew Sullivan no Donald Trump defender\nUm here's what he writes Trump's record as a force of destruction is profound but as a monster by there's a dissent decent case that Trump's proactive accomplishments are beginning to add up as well as a huge tax cuts to Supreme Court justices hosts there'll be regulation renegotiation of NAFTA isolation of Iran and abroad or remove a bilateral nationalism\nOn the world stage ...\nWhile this was always the essence of the Trump argument particularly to Republicans who are a little bit hesitant about whether you like me or not I'm going to get these things done that you care about and particularly in the Senate races around the country we're seeing how that is animating itself I particularly with respect\nTo the Supreme Court fight and what the cabinet nominations fight did was to remind Republicans of just how important that central promise was to nominate Supreme Court justices who would uphold uh a certain views of the constitution and I think the president is now coming back to that he's nationalizing\nThis race and I think that's benefiting the Republicans in some of these key Senate races\nI found a question for you we found a clip of a TV and you ran when you're running for attorney general\nIn two thousand sixty here's what you said in that at\nSome city as bold career ... just climbing the ladder using one office to get another [noise] I'm ... I think you deserve better\nNew within two years immediately ran for the U.S Senate what would you say to yourself in that\nI Would say that the future of our countries and sick\nAnd I always said you could see it with the hearings and just as Kevin all you can see what we're seeing out on the streets now the future of this country and our way of life years at stake and it's incumbent upon all of us to do all that we can I'm trying to do my part to make sure that we fight for the future this country and fight for Missouri Claire McCaskill has not but I Will [noise] All right\nJosh ... Republican nominee for the U.S Senate in Missouri appreciate your coming on and sharing your views be safe in the campaign trail with\nThank you so much sex joke you gotta thank you\nAnd joining me now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams welcome to meet the press thank you for having me let me start with the impact\nOf hurricane Michael particularly on southwest Georgia I Know your opponent is going to be two in the area or this week in his capacity as secretary of state he says to to see how a local officials are going to be able to see if they can handle the start of early voting tomorrow\nOr let me ask you what do you know uh about the area or how things are going are they ready to to be worrying about early voting yet or do they need to be worrying about getting the power on\nI I think it's going to be a combination of areas like Albany our Glasgow county Carolyn\nParts of south west Georgia were very strongly devastated\nI Know that Georgia Power and the ... are doing the best they can to turn power back on and deliver it to many people as possible\nBut luckily early voting allows for major centers to except to vote and I hope that the priority will be with in terms of voting making sure that those places are ready but I Know all of our hearts are reaching out to everyone in those areas\nI go down to hurricane it's a devastating process and it takes months for recovery to happen but I think that the governor and at the state leaders has done a great job of responding very quickly\nI'm curious what your message to residents in the area or you could be the governor and a cup you can be elected governor\nAnd uh the state leaders who've done a great job of responding very quickly\nI'm curious what your message to residents in the area or you could be the governor and a cup you can be elected governor in a couple of weeks suddenly the task of rebuilding\nUm this part of Georgia is on a is on your to do list what your message to those voters or why you would be better prepared to lead the recovery than your opponent\nNumber one I've been through this myself I understand that it's not just the physical plant that's a problem it's making sure that people have access to the resources they need\nAnd also when the camera's turned off and when people go home and stop volunteering\nThat's when the real trouble start when people who have been unemployed are continuing to try to figure out how they can make a living and take care of their families and so I Will leverage the responsibility of the governor\nThe ability to connect with state and local officials and federal officials to make certain that resources don't just end when the memory of the storm passes for the average person\nAnd I think that's what you need someone who's thinking about this not as a three day or three week return but really as a ten month twelve months recovery period\nLet me ask you about an issue that's been front and Center for your campaign over the last week to ten days and that is a this issue of rejected voter registration forms due to this issue of exact mattress of it is an exact match then suddenly the registration gets thrown out Seventy percent of these registration belong to African American voters\nWho believe this is an intentional decision by her by her opponent in the opposite he runs\nAbsolutely I was part of the coalition that suit him and twenty sixteen\nTo force him to stop using this process and a federal judge agreed with us said that he had them lawfully canceled more than thirty three thousand registrations and they force them to restore those registration and response the Republicans passed a law in the twenty Seventeen legislative session to allow him to do it again\nAnd so the challenge is two fold one is that we know this is a flawed system that has a disproportionate effect on people of color but it also has the ability to erode trust in our system I know that\nSecretary kept as well aware of this and it's part of the pattern of behavior where he tries to tilt the playing field in his favor or in the favor of his party this should not require the erosion of public trust\nAre you confident this was going to be a fair election in November\nAm and here's why the fifty three thousand that we know about do have the ability to go and cast about the problem is it's a subjective system with a hundred and fifty nine counties and salad\nAnd here's why the fifty three thousand that we know about do you have the ability to go and cast about the problem is it's a subjective system with a hundred and fifty nine counties and thousands of precinct poll workers being asked to substantially verify\nThat's why this is problematic because we're creating another set of hurdles for people who simply want to exercise their right to vote but my organization working with Democratic Party we've put together the largest litter protection effort and the state's history and we had the national organizations that are also paying attention and I think we can make this work\nI Want to ask you about a comment that Eric Holder made former attorney general he was campaigning for you and it's sort of blown up into a bit of a national story a and essentially said when they go low we go high no no no no when they go low we tickle me goes on to explain what he meant by that that it was more proverbial than anything else\nBut where do you come down on this are you on that Michelle Obama side when they go low Hugo high and you stick to it or what Eric Holder's preaching no you know every once in a while you got to ...\nI think there's a hyperbolic moments that happens in every campaign\nBut if you watch my campaign from the beginning\nThrough today I have always focused on three issues education jobs and health care I don't point shot guns at people in my commercials to try to create history on next and I don't use slogan nearing to try to get things done\nMy responsibility is to show Georgians how I Will lead the state and if they watch my campaign from the very beginning of June twenty Seventeen through November sex they will see the same consistent leadership that I Will bring to the governor's office\nSounds like you're citing with Michelle Obama won't put words in your mouth but that's what it sounds like to me fair enough\nI Am siding with the people who Georgia that I intend to be a strong leader\nStacey Abrams I'm going to leave it there a respect for the campaign trail I appreciate your coming on insurance to press I appreciate your time when we come back to me issue that was
