why I think there might be a red wave instead of a blue wave and that's because for years and years we've been told that we buy the media and establishment and whoever else that we needed to go with mark and or a moderate candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney\nYeah exactly right look we're that got us yeah and tooth out as a national guy\nYeah in two thousand six through it again in Donald Trump come down an escalator and we were fed the same talking points of light couldn't land\nAnd with our backs against the wall election night we all showed up to the polls for the the greater good of things and we prove the media and everybody else rock and I believe that that gave the conservatives\nA confidence and I think that they're going to show up and a greater force because we've been told that it was going to be the wave and we're going to prove them wrong and two thousand and they said\nWell that's what a lot of people are hoping that there is a sophistication\nThe wave and we're going to prove them wrong country to\nWell that's what a lot of people are hoping that there is a sophistication sophistication level among two thousand sixteen voters that tells them how necessary it is to go out and vote in whatever way but we'll continue to support Trump because that's really what this is about\n...\nMaybe I'm going to do this starts tomorrow Thursday I don't know which yet but I it it's it's it's about time to go through\nThe west and the Republicans have this list but when they made their own of what to expect that the Democrats win the house and it is a brutal and I don't have any doubt\nThat everything on the Republican list is true they're going to every committee in the house is going to be used to investigate something Trump has done or some body in his administration it is going to be\nUnlike anything we've ever seen every day of the Trump Administration is going to be investigated and subpoenaed that's all the Congress is going to be doing is investigating and indicting that's all they're going to be doing that's all that's going to happen\nThe Senate\nRepublicans hold it so legislation is going to get ... there's going to be total gridlock nothing's going to get done none of Trump's judges will get past his lips\nAfter he nominates\nSo yeah it's going to require a lot of voters to understand this but you said conservatives the Trump coalition is not just conservatives there are a lot of Democrats who voted for Trump there are a lot of independents that voted for Trump there are a lot of moderates that voted for Trump\nThere he got he got people from every demographic spread\nAnd\nSome of the Trump people were not ardent Trump supporters they were frustrated\nAnd didn't like anybody at all and fought they wouldn't go for the biggest change they could\nBut not every Trump voter was a make America great again advocate\nSo how many of those are still happy with their votes how many of those real lives that for what they voted for to continue Trump has to remain free of investigation I mean look what the deep stage when able to do when they don't even run the show\nThe deep state the executive branch\nTo remain free
