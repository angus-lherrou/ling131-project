D printer we're seeing all kinds of folks sort of experimenting with these business model that guy I think of it is I'm a start up\nSo they only need you know about three hundred and four hundred square feet um they don't have to build out the table they don't have to buy the silverware I mean they they all of these things are kind of built into the food court model\nAnd so they can do is just focus on making their food and what has happened is we've seen a lot of kind of young folks\nWho are making gourmet doughnuts were saying I'm I feel a lot of Korean tacos a vegan food from then on me lots of foods from all over the world um but still kind of reflective of the community so few you know you can for example\nTo I'm Chelsea Market in New York you're going to get New York based vendors serving all kinds of interesting foods that kind of reflect how people in that city or eating in a sushi there's a\nNew Israeli hummus place there's all kinds of things I'm really reflect the communities of where your where everything\nWell I Would also say they're they're kind of shaping what we're eating I mean you go to challenge the market to to use your example and you're going to try curry worst which is the ...\nI Would also say they're they're kind of shaping what we're eating I mean you go to chance the market to get to use your example and you're going to try curry worst which is the curried hotdog they come from Berlin uh that you probably never would have to try to New York uh ten years ago but now we hear because\nThe great thing I think for travelers visiting these new food home who they ... they can try unusual foods from all over the world\nRight and then they might go back to their own communities and say like we should open a\nCourier where she's an upcoming\nFood on and all of these things are kind of a lot more possible as a result of\nUm the space of one of the really interesting things about their house is that another way they differ from food of course is that they're very concerned with having your kind of\nStay all day so you can for example in the ferry building in San Francisco\nYou know there's a blue bottle up there and it's a local um parents have girl born coffee cup now national\nBut um you can go there and have coffee in the morning you can have lunch at kind of a restaurant that's built within it called the plantains or you can buy locally made good and then to keep you there at night\nUm they're offering things like drive in movie is um bars are very popular and through the halls because they want you to stay kind of into the night life um a lot of them have concerts allied music there this summer I'm and we're seeing that trying to rewrite are very aware\nOf fruit hollow developers are very aware that\nA way to keep us there all day is to entertain us and have this kind of feel like it's our living room\nYeah so they're they're really fun places to hang out there are very aware that people don't just eat their food anymore and they have to photograph it would be part of it right\nYeah I think there are also really fun place to try trend foods I'm from around the country or around the world even here in in the suburbs of Washington DC or you can find a place called the block and the Baucus I'm Korean American\nUm Taiwanese American you can find all kinds of Asian American foods including um Instagram a ball ice cream they settled down at that um they call it their money back that they put on top of\nAn ice cream cone and yeah so it's just kind of over the top ... love to take their photos with it um bubble off all their another example of a food like that Robin burger I think a lot of people know that the Roman burger by now\nThat is when they take noodles and make it into a ... meet in the middle of it yeah kind of gross but it's delicious I've had\nOne very photograph of All right it looks at just over the top\nAnd make it into a ... and then they can meet in the middle of it yeah kind of a road but it's delicious I've had one\nVery photograph of All right it looks at the top but I think that's a big thing that you can if you saw it on the on the Internet and there's a very good chance they're gonna be able to find it at a food on their you\nKnow are there any down side to the trend\n[noise] you know it's such a booming business right now and it's a very young I Do have to say that I'm In ... there were twenty five and it all that that can have any idea and of course a lot of them\nI'm a ... a lot of folks and it would be illegally and ... one of the foreign are sort of trend um but the expectation that there's going to be about three hundred of them um by twenty ten so there really isn't\nA very like twenty twenty twenty ...\nTwenty twenty um and this isn't a very old trend um and it's only really just starting to pick up and I think I have come across too many folks who have 'em too many gripes with the model right now right now it seems to really be picking up steam\nNot driving other businesses away or changing things too much\nYeah there are so many factors at play well I think I think they're a market forces and the Internet and and um and the way we shop as is changing completely\nChanging completely yeah it's going to be fascinating to see where this all and uh well uh if you want to see lasagna article in the Washington Post you can go to Washington Post dot com thank you so much with ammonia for appearing on the travel show thank you so much\nThat's just me I'm not totally understand that yeah\nAt the beginning of the article you talk a lot about points and my mind was thinning because it's so hard I think you have to have a certain personality type\nTo get free point this way but there are credit card that I guess can help you get past the finish line faster than others in terms of getting points used for cheaper flights are for for flights\nYes and I will tell you I agree with you because it can\nCan help you get past the finish line faster than others in terms of getting points to use for cheaper flights are for flight\nYes and I will tell you I agree with you because it can really be you know I'm ... if you work hard at the points and you can make it work you do have to want to do it or it's just you know the ... but\nYou're right and if the credit card I I think is one of the easiest way to do it are easier ways to do it at all and I was mentioning just before the chase sapphire Arthur card expensive it's four hundred and fifty dollars a year however\nUh if you get three times for points for every dollar that you spend on travel and that makes\nThat makes it and maybe he had worthwhile if somebody who traveled a lot of hundred\nThree hundred dollars of that you can use to travel and you get it back over a year and so if you bought plane tickets or any kind of you know if you've got car rental they'll keep you up to three hundred dollars a year back toward that\nWell all of the details and more
