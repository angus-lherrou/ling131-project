congratulations Nikki\nThank you so much island girl could be on\nSo I have my own thoughts on this but I'm going to ask you why do women need their own magazine why can't they just read a far Conde nast traveler and one of the others that are out there\nGetting a good question and what I feel as that when women in particular in ... in that particular\nThing that the women travelers deal with that they're kind of hard ... may not necessarily need to deal with so when the application we hope to really\nCreate use whole travel guides and really address the issues that female traveler mall experience abroad\nLike what what are some of the issues can you spell it out for us for our for our male listeners cause I have a feeling the women know what you mean\nWhole experience abroad\nBut like what what are some of the issues can you spell it out for us for our for our male listeners because I have a feeling the women know what you mean\nSomething as simple as\nDare I say it on the

provide guys that are tailored to female traveler and they're concerned than me\nAnd so the the uh magazine once again is called ... women aged ... on newsstands as well as on the Web is there a difference between what people read on the Web and what will people will read in the print version of the magazine\nPrinted version and the digital version near each other very well so if you look at

world all of these stories are ... and and treated by female journalists\nWe also have a section called them in a city guys which is the name suggests city guide tailored for female traveler and ... women on the businesses and back cities around the world\nAnd then we also have women to watch where we'd profile women doing exciting things across the industries and with and that within our magazine we mirror the section so within the first issue and you'll find a feminist city guide to the site is\nYou'll find clock the travel content we do a a feature on Germany's hit in wine country and then we also spotlights them incredible women and women's stories that are unfolding\nWhere you said that you are using female journalists bravo bravo I should say um you and you got probably the
