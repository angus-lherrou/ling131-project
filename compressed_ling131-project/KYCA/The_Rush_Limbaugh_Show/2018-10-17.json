I think their primary objective now is\nTo flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition a group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democratic Party and then there's like combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSo the the focus I think is on Jennings up a\nFirst time participation\nUm and that's why this this enthusiasm\nThing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger is so that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans didn't hate ...\nI I think they they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the

think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have media wide throughout the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to run fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I have never believed there was going to be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and I if I ended up being wrong so be it I'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but\nIt is I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHaven't been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooding the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on an even they're stupid travel or order delays using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do it like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think if all of the things were true a lot of people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is ... ... ... than Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if\nThe Democrats are right about all this but
