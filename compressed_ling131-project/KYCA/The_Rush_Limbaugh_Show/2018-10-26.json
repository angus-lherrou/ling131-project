well coordinated with each agency bringing a special expertise to the table [noise]\nBut I Would also like to recognize the many postal employees who we think of as I Am ... years we're appreciate the

focus of the agency is to find the perpetrators of these incidents and they're bringing the justice thank you without\nThe Reagan you on the line when I finally something so\nEach of the devices was being brought a through political total containment vehicles to our lab and they were coming kind of Syria autumn a and we received some of them the first to the we were see where the devices that were sent to former President Obama\nA and the D. C. package that was sent a congresswoman waters and so the analysis began on that I think yesterday um we were started receiving\nI'm a a and the D.C package that was sent a congresswoman waters and so the analysis began on that I think yesterday and we were starting to receive information over the course of the last twenty four thirty six hours so it was yesterday\nBy the time that there are\nAfter a three year old fashioned describe your reaction to when\nLeaves you can also could you give us of wind\nSay for the\nSaw the first part of my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match a\nJust validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in the mental image of law enforcement and in particular the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who are there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print\nI was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves\nA it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nThat even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say is what we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat for shock of friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device that accordingly\nHow could you tell us plainly was targeting\n[noise]\nI don't\nKnow other than what you might uh normally expect a madman apart it appears to be a partisan but that would be a determined by the fact\nThat the case goes for now I'm not able to comment on that easy collaborating [noise]\nWe're not going to be discussing whether the investigation stands at\nThis I'm I'm\nGiven you more ... more\nFocus not on the talk but on the work the work of the men and women and law enforcement here and the work that was done over the last week is something that should make every American proud and grateful and it's too early stage for us to be discussing motivation\nCourse been here in the work that was done over the last week is something that should make every American proud and grateful and it's too early stage for us to be discussing motivation in this particular\nCase you have you\nNoticed they survived [noise] we're\nConcerned about people committing acts of violence under any motivation\nYou believe that the only one\nYou continue to make reference to other devices that might\nSo there's a great difference of opinion even among Republicans were in the race in Texas for cleaning crews and O'Rourke stands today cruise allies contend that\nHe's way ahead of O'Rourke well outside the margin of error\nBut the cook report people say we are aware of other polling that shows a closer race back to Florida for a moment thirty eight Florida sheriffs are demanding Andrew Gillum withdraw his anti cop pledge\nThirty eight elected in Florida sheriff's on Thursday called on Andrew Gillum the gubernatorial candidate here for the Democrats to immediately and on it quickly withdrawn he'll support for a radical organization is freedom and pledged that refers to anti police rhetoric\nHere is in part the letter that they sent the Gillum way the underside and members of Florida's law enforcement community ask that you immediately and on a quick way withdraw your pledge to the organization dream defenders\nAfter learning of this organization is disturbing and anti law enforcement position and statements we believe that any candidate wishing to lead our state should in no way be aligned with this radical group\nThe pledge that you assign to Mr Gillum\nNot only calls for you to defend police and prisons but the papers that accompany this pledge wrongly claim that police were never meant to protect and serve me and you and blah blah blah\nThe police and prisons but the papers that accompany this pledge wrongly claim that police were never meant to protect and serve me and you and blah blah blah blah blah [noise]\nThe pledge in question is a it's a project of something called dreamed of senators and anti Israel anti capitalistic group with which the Democratic governor of Florida Andrew Gillum has had a close personal and professional relationship what\nAre the in the world why in the world what anybody what\nAnti Israel anti capitalist group Gillum has had a long association with them\n[noise]\nFolks there is for those of you in Florida I Know you know that\nI have a desire to outcome here and you know than I Am an unabashed\nConservative and so forth but just for the general welfare and well being of everybody in this state it literally makes no sense to elect somebody who believes that the way to prosperity and and sustained overall economic prosperity and contentment\nWhich has been undergoing ongoing here for a while it needs to be ripped apart in front of a way it's absurd anybody there it boggles my mind but I Do know that education\nAnd media have been well successful in programming people to believe and the wonders of socialism\nEquality fairness and all that except it doesn't happen it doesn't exist where ever socialism\nHappens to be deployed um I take it back that forty seven percent Trump approval is NBC Wall Street Journal will\nBlow me down currently Kirk and his tweet didn't cite the poll that said that can be one of the big ones but it is forty seven percent Trump approval ABC or NBC Wall Street Journal\nAnyway so like I was saying about about John James yesterday John James in Michigan and running against Debbie Stabenow he is the American dream he personified that he has lived\nIt he has lived a life that any would be justified in following emulating\nComes from genuine flames and ... and sharecroppers and is not bitter is not angry has has has grown\nFollowing emulating he comes from genuine ... and ... and sharecroppers and is not bitter is not angry has\nHas has grass every opportunity is a West Point grad I mean he was like kind of man you wouldn't want as your neighbor being involved in the leadership of your town or any other organization you already mom dad and\nJust a decent salary ... this is exactly the same\nDoesn't harbor an ill thought about anybody the left you can't say that the left has enemies\nThe left as enemies that they want to use government to punish that's half the reason there are people who voted for him is that what they think government should be doing is punishing people who are getting away with having better live more success what have you\nThis stuff cannot be and try and it's not who we are it's not how we were founded it ... and we hear all these people talk about our values and Obama that's not who we I'll tell you what we're not and who are not as a bunch of socialists and we are not and never have been a nation\nThat uses government power to punish the enemies\nOf other citizens\nAnd get elected on the premise that that's what is going to happen and that's what the Democratic party's today is essentially promising\nAre going to get even without anybody voted for Trump are gonna punish it anybody who made anybody can do with Hillary Clinton losing is going to get money never mind it's not going to improve their lives any at all\n[noise] he's won't just wasted vote to vote for any of these current Democrat crops the socialists and yet there are plenty of people are\nGoing to do it I got to take a break we'll be back after
