we're finding the tax returns was all about I have to make this point again the left one of Trump's tax returns because that was going to be\nThe end they were going to be able to prove that is why Trump wouldn't release them remember they said it would prove that Trump's wealth comes from Russia\nAnd that's why Trump is a potent storage that Trump would be nothing if it weren't for ... and the

suspect\nAnd that happens after ... in other words this event if he had happened she had all kinds of potential dates where it could have happened and every time she reported\nThis the date changed it became the summer of eighty two only after she began to consult with Feinstein staff\nAnd Anna Eshoo staff and her lawyer Deborah cats and I am convinced that they\n\nDecided to claim the date was eighty two so asked to coincide with where Kavanaugh might have been able to be placed\n\nShe still and this is fundamentally crucial she still cannot specify\nWhen Trump was right she can't specify where\nMeaning the house\nShe can't specify the time of day she doesn't remember how she got home that the floor plan of the house also changes\n\nShe ran out of a small bedroom door bathroom on one

the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary\nFor the past year documenting how the times found it how they reported it how they prompted how they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today\nFirst reaction I had was a cabinet thing must really be unraveling 'cause it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle and it's not really new its taxes\nThe latest news correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen somebody more\nRecent but the last story I saw on this is Muller [laughter] [noise] I don't know what to believe in it if that Mueller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\nWe're down now to Roger Stone in an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with\nRussia and Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important\nThat enabled Trump to hold onto his money and get more But Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity with Russia will there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\nSo [noise] um [noise]\nGetting down to the nitty gritty ... you know ethics say that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election [noise] I'll be costs\nSay that a special counsel should not right and the release a report within this close proximity to an election I'll be cause of the impact that it would have and they of\nCourse are ah unbiased end of the only objective in the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections I which is all\nThey've been trying to do it for two years I wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude excoriated for having a really really shady friends and all that but does it accused him of anything\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen\nIs the way these people operate but but maybe it won't outside of that\nI'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to repeal I don't know what he's going to report 'em ... zero not at\nAll I Know is\nThat the drive by media decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the
