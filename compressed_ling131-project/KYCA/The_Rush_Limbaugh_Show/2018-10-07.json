Institute\nNBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss walk Sunday\nGood Sunday morning in a in a closely divided country elected a closely divided Senate which took a closely divided vote\nThat is left the country you guessed it closely divided\nBut Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate fifty to forty eight late yesterday and sworn in later after the closest Supreme Court both since Stanley Matthew you of course remember him he was confirmed in Eighteen eighty one\nThe book came after an ugly confirmation battle pitted Republicans against Democrats men against women they accused against the accuser and Trump loyalists against Trump detractors\nAnd do the confirmation fight is over the bitterness in mutual resentment it created is likely to winter\nAnd so are the questions were left with will Kavanaugh's confirmation create an even bigger blue way than anticipated among Democrats well the attempt to derail the nomination backfire generating a Republican come back\nWe'll the Supreme Court's legitimacy me permanently damaged by the manner in which cabinet and made it across the finish line and by his behavior at that Senate hearing last week\nAnd we'll cabin I'll find

conspiracy\nUltimately was decided by a shrinking group of self proclaimed centrist\nI Will so chicken from judge cap and\nThis is a difficult decision for everybody I\nCould not conclude that he is the right person for the court\nChicken for judge cabinet\nThis the difficult decision for everybody I\nCould not conclude that he is the right person for the court and his time\nDo you think that there's still a place in the Democratic party for you after that\nI'm just a West Virginia I miss the good Old West when you're a\nReal division and rancor are only likely to deepen in the final weeks of the campaign\nAt a rally in Kansas last night President Trump declared victory radical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resume\nDelayed demolish and destroy\nBrett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect he's like a perfect person\nFor Mr Trump the cabinet vote has presented in opening to launch a new battle in the culture wars just weeks before the midterms\nIt's a very scary time for young men in America he's ridiculed Dr Ford how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember but where is the place I don't remember\nThere's even a little town are you one hundred\nAmount of research have no doubt\nWe thought it was bad back in Nineteen Ninety One and it's even worse today the political climate\nAnd how women are treated even among amid the need to climate you think it's worse now than it was that I can only go by what we've seen over the past month\nWill be decided at the ballot box some Democrats are already promising investigations into Kavanaugh if they win control if he is on the Supreme Court\nAh and and the Senate hasn't investigated than anything else will have to\nRepublican Senate candidates in states Mr Trump won are now running ads hoping to sustain this base energy that Kavanaugh fight produced\nThe liberals to me or you know they're doing it again before we hate the most about Washington\nMean all of the house where many of the tossup races are in suburban districts a growing number of democratic candidates are talking about gender and some are even making the issue of sexual assault part of their campaigns\nI was lucky that I was able to fight my way out of it but I'm also six feet tall and I had I was walking with my uh kids between my fingers\nStarted me now is Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee or Alexander welcome back to meet the press by contract industry um let me start by playing something Dr Ford senator testimony about her basic initial fear about coming forward and get you to react to it here it is that is calculating\nPlaying something Dr Ford senator testimony about her basic initial fear about coming forward and get you to react to it here it is\nAnd it's calculating daily that that risk benefit for me coming forward and wondering whether I Would just be something in front of a chain of it had it where it was headed anyway\nThat feeling that she was essentially now being mowed down by a freight train yeah\nWell I you know I Can't put myself in her shoes but I can imagine that any\nAnyone who believes they were a victim of sexual assault first has to have to live within seconds the difficulty of coming before a public audience particularly one that large must be terrifying and she said I Believe that did you believe her I thought she was credible\nWhat I had what does that mean to you what that meant was if if you're listening to her was all I had to do um I Would have said she's she seems to believe what she believes but that's not all I had to do for example this week I went down in the secure place where we could read\nThe FBI reports I read six FBI reports between Nineteen Ninety three and twenty Eighteen\nHundred and fifty people interview about judge Kavanaugh in every case the interview he was asked do you know of any instance of alcohol abuse and the answer in every case was no\nThere was no evidence by any of these people of behavior that had anything to do with sexual impropriety so\nYou have to consider that mhm and you also have to consider the\nFact that the only person who remembers the alleged incident the doctor for describes his doctor for the other four said under penalty of perjury that it either didn't happen or they didn't remember it\nSo you have to to be fair about it in a very difficult case you have to consider that as well as her testimony\nWhen do you think ended up happening why is it then you think should remember this when you think should just [noise]\nHave I I I don't know the she said a hundred percent\nThat she was going to a hundred percent where it was broadcast so\nDid it but I'm sure that every sexual assault cases usually he said she said\nExcept in this case it she said she said they said they were the witnesses that she said were there all said it either didn't happen or they didn't remember it one of whom is one of her best friends want to play for you something\nThey were the witnesses that she said were there all said it either didn't happen or they didn't remember it one of whom is one of her best friends\nWant to play something one of your colleagues Senator Murkowski who she ended up voting no here's what she said about this whole situation\nI Believe he is a good man ... may be\nHe's not the right man for the court and they\nWe need to be thinking\nAbout credibility and the integrity of our institution\nAnd this is the I think the larger concern I think a lot of us are wondering about now and she also had her floor speech talked about\nUm the issue public confidence and the concern that she has that justice capital does not have public confidence [noise]\nWhat would be hard to have public confidence or if you go through a a inquisition\nLike he did arranged by the Democrats\nIf you go down and read\nSix FBI\nInvestigations of him over twenty five years and see not just the bad things that were not set about him but the remarkably good things that worse at about a ... you would be very glad he would be on the Supreme Court and we'll be fundamentally unfair\nThe president has a whole series of credentialed unqualified conservative judges I'm from uh from among whom he could choose\nTo put someone forward to the ... to the Senate or the United states for confirmation so if there are credible allegations\nAgainst this particular nominee and if this particular nominee in his confirmation process conducts himself in ways that they are real questions about candor partisanship fitness then I think it's appropriate for the committee or the Senate to say perhaps a different nominees the right one\nIf you're considering someone to be said president of universities CEO of a company\nI'm the host of a Sunday show and there are credible allegations against them it would make sense to step back and try and investigate them to see if you can resolve them that's why I was thankful that my friends Senator Flake took a tough step last friday and asked for an FBI investigation\nLet me get you to respond to something Senator Kennedy said to me earlier this week about when\nFlake took a tough step last friday and asked for an FBI investigation\nLet me get you to respond to something Senator Kennedy said to me earlier this week about when he believe things changed in this whole cabinet debate tickle us how\nThis process changed dramatically [noise]\nUh when Mr ... entering the picture\nI think a lot of people including many of my democratic colleagues felt like that at that point\nWe had gotten into the foothills for posture [noise]\nHe was referring to a lawyer Michael ... who is a thinking about running for president who ended up representing somebody who's allegations\nI have not been seen as credible as the other two allegations do you agree with his political assessment there that that the ... entrance into this side show sort of a diluted everything\nI certainly like a Senator Kennedy said turns of phrase the foothills of the preposterous it's going to end up being a memorable phrase I I Do think that um he's correct that there was a widespread I'm response or certainly on the Republican side that these were not credible allegations\nUm I tried to focus my questioning of judge Kavanaugh on issues that were directly related\nUh first to his judicial philosophy his extreme views on presidential power and individual liberty and ways in which I'm convinced till overturned Justice Kennedy's most important recent decisions\nAre and then to focus on issues of fitness and candor um so I Do think what was important about the last few weeks was trying to find a bipartisan focus on facts and the larger question Chuck here is you know how do we move forward how do we heal the divisions in the Senate\nSo I take it if you're talking that way or the house Democrats are talking about re investigating cabin off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges coming from some House Democrats\nI think that's premature I think you know frankly we are just less than a month away from an election of folks who feel very strongly a one way or the other ... about the issues in front of us should get out and vote and participate um there's only ever been one justice that's been impeached and I think talking about it at this point\nI'm isn't necessarily healing us and moving forward a check the Senate's role in our in our politics is not to just reflect the country but to help heal and leave the country and that's the course we should be on alright senator Coontz Democrat from Delaware things coming out and sharing your views as well protected ... when we\nOur politics is not to just reflect the country but to

Nancy Day O'Connor unanimous\nOr Sonia Sotomayor and others it's obvious that we've moved to a bar in terms of how do we define advice and consent and and that goes both ways so I think it ... terms of confirmations a we better figure out how we're going to redefine advice and consent and live within those ...\nYou know I was for a swing swing vote for somebody replace Anthony Kennedy who uh who would be like Anthony Kennedy and there are some potential candidates for that but I don't know that advice and consent would allow us to senator uh to to try to enforce I kind of thing it's complicated\nOne of the people reading about wind Spain was the actor illicit mulatto she said on this week and then went to sleep if you've been sexually harassed or assaulted right me too as a reply to this week\nWell she woke up to tens of thousands of responses and the realization she'd kick started the quote me too movement\nAnd I did actually it was founded in two thousand six by the activists Toronto Burke well both mulatto and ... were at the Capitol hearing last week to support Christine Blasey Ford with mulatto easily seen on TV sitting behind cabinet\nAnd joining me now from Southern California is Alyssa mulatto and from New York to run a Burke welcome to both of you thanks for coming up\nThank you so much for having us\nI'm trying to break let me start with you and you heard me play earlier the quote from Christine Blasey Ford where she talked about our fear of coming out and simply stepping in front of a train that was already headed to its destination um\nWhat are the repercussions of that\nWell I mean the repercussions are will be will remain to be seen but I think her stepping out was something that we needed to have happened in this movement it's been largely focused on Hollywood and on individual bad actors\nAnd I think her coming forward really set the stage for survivors to have a different role in this movement and we've seen over the last year\nUm although some of the journalist Sally Quinn wrote in her memoir last year about an attempted rape\nBy now deceased Senator John tower when she was a college student in the sixties when John Tower was nominated to be the defense secretary and in Nineteen eighty nine she was asked about it and she declined to talk about it with the FBI well a reporter at the New Yorker Susan Glasser asked her about it and let me play\nA let me show you what I'm Susan Glasser wrote she said I call Sally Quinn the night before Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to ask what she thought about our own experience all these years later and she goes I could have been Anita Hill she pointed out but I didn't want to I didn't want to ruin my life\nNothing has changed since Anita Hill not a damn thing is she right\nThink a lot of change but I also think a lot has changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning the cultural battle and often I don't fight for that when I'm\nTo and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning the cultural battle and often I don't fight for the when I'm fighting so then generations\nI don't have to deal with the abuses of power that that we've had to deal with so and and I respect I think she is right but then I Do think that there's a lot going on and I think this this this cultural shift that we're feeling this collective pain that we're feeling from survivors\nComing forward it's going to be able to be translated into a collective power I can say that we're not going to be silenced any longer\nDrawing mark you know Susan Collins said that she was really angry at the leaker about this story that it put it force doctor forward into the public square and maybe she wasn't ready or maybe it wasn't handled right\nUm do you think the United States Senate and in particular Senator Feinstein didn't didn't handle this correctly from the outset in Maine Dr Ford more vulnerable than necessary\nI wouldn't say she didn't handle it right she followed the leadership on the survivor people shouldn't have to be forced out of and ... to tell their story and so she acts were privacy I understand why Senator Feinstein and decided to respect that privacy I think this has really indicative of how we don't understand in this country the life cycle of a survivor\nAnd what it takes to actually mount up the courage to come forward particularly in a situation like this I think it was handled five\nI think I Wish that after it was revealed an after it was linked with handled better\nEllis Malone and get you to respond to what Emily Yoffe wrote in the Atlantic this week the problem with belief survivors\nShe writes this even as we must treat accusers upstairs with seriousness and dignity we must share out the accused fairly and respectfully and recognize the potential lifetime consequences that such an allegation can bring\nIt believing the woman is the beginning and the end of a search for truth than we have left the realm of justice for religion that's not what the lose survivors and okay what do you what would what what what is that I mean\nI Know that Ron yeah when\nSay believes the virus it's not\nBelieve them without investigation believed them without interrogation we're set a precedent in this country of not believing up thinking that women in particular are lying when they come forward with these allegations when people come forward is allegations sold it to the macho believe survivor is about can we start with the premise that people do not\nOften lie about the pain and the trauma of sexual ...\nForward is allegations so the ... the macho believes the virus is about can we start with the premise that people do not\nOften lie about the pain and the trauma of sexual violence if we start with that premise that me believe that is true then you can have an investigation you can have an interrogation of the facts and that kind of thing this is not to say believe people blanket and don't investigate and don't do any um anything else besides believed though\nI I I also think that right now we're defining what and due process looks like in this type of situation because we've never really defined it before because women haven't come forward so we do need to have due process what does it mean to have a fair investigation and these processes\nSo that we can move forward so that we can change the cultural and societal systemic\nInstitute ... institutionalization of sexual abuse an assault\nWell let me get you a lift when they get you to react to something but Stevens wrote in the times he said this I'd rather be accused of murder or friends said then of sexual assault\nAnd then he writes I feel the same way one can think of excuses for killing a man known for assaulting a woman but if that's true so is this falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable of sexual assault itself because it inflict psychic Emilio reputational and professional harms that can last a lifetime\nOr let's let you answer that first responders\nThese these numbers are so low as far as false\nAccusations and women coming forward\nThere from two to eight percent and that's not taking into account that Seventy to eighty percent of sexual assault is actually not report it at all so what\nWe're looking at is very very small numbers also there's not there's no grey area with murder right you don't like maybe ... you know committing murder or maybe not you know there is a very distinct lines that are drawn so what we're trying to do is defined what those lines are so that you know we can move forward\nA in a way that is not hurtful and not\nUm more in support of people that abuse their power than those that are being abused\nAll right I'm going to leave it there for now but uh Toronto ... thank you both for coming on and a plus model I Know you had to get up extra early on the west coast so I appreciate that you're always had thanks very then we ask why Democrats\nHave to win a lot more than fifty percent of the vote in November [noise]\nThe percent of the vote in November\nPay to download time Democrats support hope to take back the house this November and if they do they're going to have to overcome the advantage that Republicans have created for themselves through the process of gerrymandering which of course is drawing congressional district lines to create a partisan advantage\nBecause a couple of ways to do it districts can be created by packing\nThe opposing parties voters in a smaller number of districts or by fracturing them into many districts to weaken their collective power in any one district so how does this play itself out take the twenty sixteen congressional elections are the votes cast by major party candidates Republicans have less\nThan a one point edge fifty points for forty nine point five that's pretty close must have been an equally divided house right\nBut an election night Republicans walked away with two hundred and forty one seats to the Democrats hundred Ninety four seats that is a forty seven seat advantage despite a only a one point or actually technically less than one point edge in the house popular vote now here's how this dynamic unfolded in the state of Pennsylvania and twenty six states\nRepublican side of fifty four percent of the overall congressional popular vote and ended up with Thirteen of Eighteen seats the winner of the popular vote still capture the majority of the seats in Pennsylvania but due to gerrymandering you could argue maybe\nBut go back to twenty twelve in Pennsylvania Democrats actually held an edge in popular houseboats statewide fifty one forty nine over Republican\nAnd yet because of gerrymandering Republicans were still able to capture the same number of seats Thirteen to be exact in this day but earlier this year this map was thrown out by the state Supreme Court\nSo with a new laugh in place for this November's election the cook Political Report rates seven seats currently held by Republicans and Pennsylvania competitive rooting for the the rate as actually leaning towards the Democrats right now those poor flip the Pennsylvania delegation becomes more evenly split something the popular house both will likely support on election I\nLook when Democrats are in power of course they do the exact same thing just look at the state of Maryland and how they did that but after the Republicans twenty tennis too nominee election they held the reins of many state capitals around the country\nAnd they got to draw on most of the law that is why we should keep an eye on the elections for state houses and governorships this November because these are the folks here in twenty Eighteen were many cases will redraw the lines three years from now in twenty Twenty one way back in a moment with engaged\nOur ships this November\nBecause these are the folks here in ... in many cases where we draw the line three years from now and twenty Twenty one\nWay back in ... at the cabinet backed out of the mid term [noise]\nDid you ever look at the stains and your
