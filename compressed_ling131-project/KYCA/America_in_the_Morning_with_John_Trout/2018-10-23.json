Welty uh helps the Latino executives an entrepreneur is to pursue\nA their economic dreams in this country and I'm just curious some thoughts about what we can say about this through first of all strikes me that it is rather inaccurate referred to as the Latino vote as if there was only one you certainly wouldn't confuse Cuban Americans with Mexican Americans with Puerto Ricans et cetera\nYeah that's the three headed monster and then he headed monster that there are so many different points of view also the difference between the first generation immigrants ... and beyond gonna have many different so there is no less you know block\nNow out of certainly the African American vote has been pretty reliably democratic for the past uh\nUh three quarters of a century or if it's only say Ninety percent for the Democratic party that's an unusual year or the Latino vote again to the extent that we can refer to it as an overall varies considerably there are times certainly uh uh for example a\nA former president and before that the governor of Texas at George W. Bush\nDid rather well among Latino voters for a Republican so that this can be done\nAbsolutely I mean look at Texas look at California uh George Bush had the advantage that he lives in Texas all his

...\nThe other Latino ... races there are a great advantage for him and helped carry into the car and\nWe would also take note of a ... a big issue and it's a big issue for everybody the issue of immigration more precisely put the issue of illegal immigration which is really what's at stake\nAnd that is a a big issue again for everybody\nBut I'm Wondering the extent to which you feel it is a predominant issue for the Latino population because after all day to must worry about a good schools for their kids they most worried about crime taxes the whole panoply of issues that affect everybody\nIs the immigration issue and in particular as we speak now this a caravan of some three or four thousand Central Americans heading for the United states is is that in your view a bigger issue among Latino voters then among the rest of us\nAnd I think uh the immigration policy the immigration issue is a big issue but it's not as big as per se education a quality of life of crime and some of the other factors that you mentioned\nI Know of the fact that we live in a world of nation states\nUh there are those who would decry that and I would certainly admit that there are downsides to the nation state but at this stage in the in the world a sociology ... pretty much the options are the nation state or an arcade or some other form of a of try ballistic societal breakdown\nAnd that's that's the way of the world and there is no a one world are we do not all hold hands or we do not all sing ... in that context [noise]\nUh it is my view that a nation state has not only the rights but the responsibility to determine\nBy whatever basis that decides however arbitrarily who gets into a country how many for how long and for what reasons now and then the light in the country in my view will do so based on what's best for the host country\nBut that is up to the host country at an aside that I saw in California some months back is incorrect it said immigration is a right to know it is not a you may argue it should be I Would argue to the contrary but it is not a ride your thoughts\nYou know I I you you back to that sign on site integration is right and I'm Wondering if
