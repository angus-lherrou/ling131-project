I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on an on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a sub in North Carolina where the Florence hurricane to flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going now go go on the major freeways first and then wait for the D. toward then that's when you should you shouldn't start on the side roads\nBecause it'd be times when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama you just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh interstate and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go go and then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what Anthony go because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct\nBut importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on leisure early um track to some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area and that everyone knows you know going to be there and I'm On the other people that I meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several a little bit of a major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nBut when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let say\nBefore let's say you're on a major artery and you're told in the ... has to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach and we're going to do to through in this direction

know where each of those are like you said in activate your GPS for\nYour family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of\nWeather related problems such as Michael\nYou know the storms getting thrown down you know can take our technology and if\nThe towers are the people that you're sending a signal to went down ...\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get that message but if they had another power that the active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive at once of power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio and the good old ubiquitous over the radio always there and distribute such moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat had a job with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening and gamble for the coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script for a movie um why not just bomb or\nA hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive waste but a\nMaybe a hydrogen bomb or\nThat's a nuclear bomb too because you didn't know because it involves a a a a trigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume\nWe're a bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a a\nA trigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter [noise] uh I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other him practicalities of such an idea that they're just too big and then me\nWell you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states less to let's say or this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for this storm and damaging to states other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through lexical cities and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the evil that it has got to kind of be upset\nKnow and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody would ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn and headed inland\nAnd and I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly or\nA one of just simply change of course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and uh I like it could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did\nChange of course in damages somebody else into the who is liable and uh I like it could be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this which we'd better learn
