Halloween season which means that are plenty of fun spooky adventures to check out if you're in that sort of thing and some of those Hans really take things to a new level you only need to talk about some of these extreme haunts she's written a great piece about them for the New York times is Nicole page right Nicole\nHi how are you doing great in reading your article I was surprised to learn that some haunted houses another scary experiences are not just Halloween adventure actually opened a thrill seekers year round\nThat's true and that's what's so crazy about this world that you know obviously we have these things like universal studios horror nights every year but there's this group of people that for that and that's just not enough and they're just looking for the three hundred and sixty five days a year\nYou mentioned heretic in Los Angeles as one of the leaders in extreme haunts what goes on and heretic\nMan it's pretty crazy I'll say that first of all I'll have to admit I'm not a huge horror fan\nBut I think six hours at a hair to ... so\nI feel like I really really went in it and it was to rite of passage for me to watch people go through that but everyone experiences completely different that something that was really interesting scare actors basically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read because they're going to be more creative you know they grabbed an apartment\nReally interesting the scare actors basically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read to see if they're going to be more creative you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it with a rake and then the guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI've heard of people being simulated buried alive waterboarded you're forced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire there's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was busy street launched forty four times one recently been completed within strip two boxers in in the fetal position to merge drawn body fluids his first words afterwards that was awesome\nExactly so that was the one that I was that and you know it was interesting because this took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they weren't blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV\nThey were stripped of their clothes and put in this distress face suit and they were told that they were these criminals that had been a bottom lines to end that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking him through all the moves that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere as they walk in there was a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and they ended up in this tent in the back in the pitch black with all this fog\nAnd this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and start rationing them around and which the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear\nAnd is just smearing this simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest and yes so the majority of these participants did end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was so hilarious about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking\nWow that they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life\nAbout it is that you know I'm watching this thinking wow that they might be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would do it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last them a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some rain so these three months\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people on and the guys\nWere kind of funny and he told me that his only rules are basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred them\nBut you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having no touching rural and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with surface scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and\nYou know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being torture but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moved to the story forward there are all about it\nThis weekend gym just go with New York

I think it was a while but this really goes back to the previous point about experiences you know the research tells us that\nExperiences deliver more happiness than possessions and one of the reasons that experiences to live a more happiness is because they tend to be activities that we do with friends and family\nIf you go to a sporting event if you go to the theater if you go out to dinner with
