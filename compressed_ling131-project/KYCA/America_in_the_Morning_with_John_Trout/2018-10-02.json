exactly what would happen we're joined by Dr Michael ... a professor of finance would start to university and the public policy analyst\nThis would involve I gather first and foremost a number of changes regarding making automobiles\nYeah that's a big one so I'm the agreement we have what China for whatever reason as lopsided in favor of the Chinese and to our detriment China makes a car tells

at least that bad and may be worse [noise]\nWhat in your view was motivation my personal thought would be that the motivation has to do with the sense that uh [noise]\nThe United states is oh so rich and the rest of the world was oh so poor and therefore we owe it to other countries do shaft ourselves and ah and therefore make it easier for other countries but which is a pretty lame excuse in my view\nYes yeah I I'm not sure what exactly the motivation is but every single one of the trade agreements as lopsided in favor of the trade partner now ... what we have with the European Union\nOr what exactly the motivation is but every single one of the trade agreements as lopsided in favor of the trade partner ... what we have with the European Union agreements with China\nSouth Korea which

we will simply a driver stay through their hearts and will rip out their jobs and and in some cases destroy entire communities but it only affects of you and the rest of us will get cheaper brooms isn't it pretty much the argument has been followed up until now\nThat's exactly right that if if we make things in China where they pay their workers are they started out as a dollar a day there are
