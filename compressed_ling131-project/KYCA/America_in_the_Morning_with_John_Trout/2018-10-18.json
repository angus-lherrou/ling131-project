the discussion continues with jumbo Hannon we're joined by attorney and author\nSimply Powell to offer some thoughts about what is now appearing to be a brutal murder or perhaps and interrogation somebody went bad although of right off the bat Sydney or if that is going to be the official explanation offered by the Saudis there is no form of it\nIn the summer when bad although of right off the bat Sydney\nOr if that is going to be the official explanation offered by the Saudis there is no form of interrogation in any civilized country which could ever have this as an outcome\nOh you're right about that gym but as we both know there's nothing about that country that I wouldn't call civilized\nIt's one of the most brutal and barbaric regimes in the history of the world I think from the way they treat women to the way they treat people like ... like this journalist and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as I understand that\nAre released a supporter above the Muslim Brotherhood yeah the reporters really does not seem to be the most a\nSavory character or on the planet but again there's little about that peninsula that is a a twenty first century and a and it's verge you one thing that I find a truly remarkable I Would not for one moment put such a vicious murderous past the Saudi regime\nBut I have in the past thought that they were fairly adept at dealing with the United states that is to say to be aware of what the reaction would be to something like this so they don't like this particular guy\nUh learn these habits of figure out that every afternoon at three thirty or so he's a certain ... actually build up the intersection the guy on a motorcycle belong side\nPops to into his head and the scoots off the guy has gone and a plausible deniability it's the middle east where things are things like this happen but to do it in this manner\nIn NFL Special government institution a consulate\nThat is beyond arrogant to me it's just stupid\nThat's why I think it could very well have been a deliberate message that they sent them they're sufficiently arrogant and just\nBarbaric to ... to do it that way either that or they thought nobody was going to find out because it was on their property\nAnd other than you know him not being seen walking out I'm probably expect that everybody inside to to keep it quiet and I'm not sure exactly how what happened in their lake down all of that I've heard that the\nThe minister their tending the consulate has said that you know there's a tape of him thing\nOr somebody telling you hear me better be quiet he better shut up or you know there's going to happen to you back in Saudi Arabia sensual\nSaid that you know there's a tape of him thing or somebody telling him you better be quiet he better shut up or you know there's going to have you back in Saudi Arabia centrally\nAnd there are questions I gather about the uh the technical means used to a a record of various things that are attributed to the possible demise of the of the journalistic question again the bottom line I suppose is that we are promised an explanation\nBy the Saudis census was Saudi Government property and I'm not sure who else would be in a position to really uh offer the information about what was happening on their property the problem is of course\nThat a salary explanation to say the very least a cannot be taken at face value\nIt cannot I mean they're certainly not going oh yeah we send a wet team in there to chop them up while alive but that's exactly what it sounds like happened and say they did it\nWell it it would it would certainly so appear uh that that is the case now than given the fact that the Saudis have been useful in that part of the world in standing up to Iran the most the stabilizing single element in the region\nAgain it it certainly does not excuse was kind of behavior but if you look at the options that are available and most Saudi peninsula there are no Tom ... a or a John Adams is walking around that peninsula the joy\nOf it they did and they wouldn't live if they did the choices are pretty much the Saudi royal family brutal but more or less friendly to this country or\nAl ... or ISIS equally brutal and very unfriendly to this country in other words the notion of destabilizing the entire peninsula just because we're upset strikes me as a very counterproductive\nI agree and I think the president Mr Kushner very well aware of that and have been working as best they can behind the scenes and us quietly as possible to\nImprove our position in every respect in the middle east writ large and we've been pretty effective in limiting and isolating Iran and the process\nWe will see where it goes the next step apparently the official explanation from the Saudis whatever
