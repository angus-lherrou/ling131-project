looking at it and you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time\nThat can be a sign that it's those are fake receivers\nUm that's because there's a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch of new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if there is a product launch and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nOr how about the ... the accusation or the investigation of Amazon during the ... were payoffs right to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were um that

know\nIf it's true or not but you know I mean immediately when I read that I thought wow there's a lot of the reviews who knows what's going on here but it it's a problem because you were people rely on reviews to to you know what they buy and\nIf they're fake I mean you're you're ... you're not going to like when you wind up with it when it ended up in your house\nWhile we're speaking with video editor at ... dot com or talk about how to spot fake reviews online or in another way you said over used over words are you and me and loss of verbs\nYeah this was a huge study coming out of Cornell that found um that online reviews that frequently use by and me are more likely to be fake they don't exactly know why but it could be because when people are lying\nThey try to make themselves sound more credible by using personal pronouns so they're saying I Need to make it seem like they're they're real person and you know doing this\nAnd then they are they also found that ... more verbs and then hum it the more verbs and truth tellers and to tell her to use more now and\nThat's a little bit harder I think to parse out but the guy in the me if you see a whole bunch of that that's a a little bit of a red flag\nOr what is deemed studying you gotta watch out for\nThis is another thing from the Cornell SETI okay so this one was looking at the hotel reviews in particular but I think it probably applies to everything\nSo truthful hotel reviews are more likely to use concrete word so they'll say something like bathroom check and you know very concrete things that people who were lying
