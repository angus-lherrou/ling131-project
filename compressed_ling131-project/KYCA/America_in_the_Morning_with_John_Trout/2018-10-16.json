started with an apology towards like trying to [noise]\nWe really have to explain why we fight\nUh unfortunately we'd do off the eight years under Obama where the president stuck with an apology taught time trying to blame all the world's ills on the United states a world which created helped create the rise of ISIS\nThe remote or a really really militarized China or Russia that felt comfortable to invade his neighbors yes unfortunately it is time to remind everybody why is that we fight than the the the stories of the heroes who have fought for this nation\nIs it always necessary to fight a war that involves a shooting in one another you you take note of for example in the book why we fight that we won the Cold War without firing a shot cannot be replicated in the twenty first century\nUh yes indeed and it's it's ... song soup called the ultimate victory is a winning without five things so it's it's psychological warfare its influence operations and during the Cold War\nSo we did a lot of counter propaganda operations in math exactly what we need to do today we have to deal legitimize a totalitarian message of our enemies be ISIS so be it the Iranians or anybody else so yes it\nIt can be done and the good news is we have done it before\nWhen you appeared on my nighttime talk show last night uh there was some callers who were curious about the U.S reaction\nTo the

whether or not the president fully understand lead the Saudi Government\nOr your take on how the United states is handling that whole thing and the extent to which it is even a a vital U.S interests in the is not an American citizen\nYeah it's sort of vital U.S interests but it is the way that the nations such as Saudi Arabia behaves off that calls itself a friend and promises to change its ways is important I think the president has done exactly the right thing by deploying one of his toughest cabinet members\nAh Mike Pompeo first in his closet West Point and a former director of the CIA by sending him to Saudi Arabia this week he sent a very clear message to the king that ah we needed an explanation\nA former director of the CIA by sending him to Saudi Arabia this week\nHe says it's a very clear message to the king that ah we needed explanation even if this person is is not a U.S citizen this is how a nation that calls itself a friend is meant to be have so I expect some ... has to be forthcoming very very rapidly from Saudi Arabia\n[noise] you know in the book why we fight the current discussion about objective truth and subjective truth I've always felt that the term subjective truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nAbsolutely right and I thought it was so very telling from the uh Kavanaugh hearings how you had more than one of the Democratic senators starting with Cory Booker use the phrase the truth when talking about the testimony of a dog before there is no such thing as\nA truce or his troops there is only one truth but this is the law you tell yourself and if you are right a post modern\nMulti cultural relative is done and the truth is that can only be one version of the truth otherwise the wood truth\nCeases to have any real meaning\nIn terms of of this war we must be prepared to fight and win is modern more a conventional or unconventional or both\nA great question you have to read the whole book why we fight to get the full of a conventional war is the anomaly big state on state war such as World War two is in normally most of the battles we see today involved irregular warfare whether it's sub state actors\nSuch as ISIS or al ... or
