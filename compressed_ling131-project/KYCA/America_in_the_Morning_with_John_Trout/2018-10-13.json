in New York City it's been quite the evolution here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nWhat can you buy at a news stand well a lot more of the news and get out of the wall Street Journal joins us now with more on how old fashioned newsstands are becoming snack destinations and as anyone buying paper newspapers or magazines\nI think that a typical news than they might be selling about five to ten newspapers a day for the summer and the buying them but not very many people and this has down from even you know ten years ago they might have sold several hundred newspapers and back in the fifties they might have felt thousands of newspapers what\nKinds of products have come in to take the place of newspapers and magazines\nUm thing and it's kind of frustrating what kind of prompted this a column for me as I was in times square and my phone had died so I needed something to read it I went to La Nina than right in the middle of kind of square in New York say they're actually labeled newsstand and I asked\nYou know I I was trying to find something in return they didn't have a single newspaper um they have all kinds of candy and snacks and cookies and [noise]\nAnd I asked you know I I was trying to find something to read and they didn't have a single newspaper um they have all kinds of candy and snacks and cookies and um drinks you can buy 'em your budget you can buy lottery tickets they can buy lots of different kinds of cigarettes\nUm you can by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets in NYPD I'm snow Globes you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws govern what can be sold are there any laws and say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands um [noise]\nWere first coming up ... and these are just the sidewalk newsstands that are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands I'm a new stands out around the city property you could only sell news and\nUm it was even then it was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties the city agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then and then in the Nineteen seventies that agrees them to let them sort of like pre packaged food and\nItems that cost less than five dollars and now that I'm told us about anything kind of food or beverage wise as long as that's packaged in any kind of like ... as long as it's under ten dollars they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because\nI think they want to keep the newsstands from competing with the storefront retailers for good reason\nUm and then the city does have a law that if you're a newsstand you have to sell news and they actually both said he told me they send out people to sort of a force that laws but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals\nAnd from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers will sell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or ... well a lot of space too I'm selling the newspapers because the margins are super low and they don't sell very much I'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and and soda and things that have a lot you know much higher margins\nAre speaking with anti the end of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stores I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the newsstands are selling\nGym that you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back alive a long time before like you know ... came in\nThis has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back a liar and a long time before like you know ... came in so I think even though\nUsually that the retailer dollars fighting tooth and nail and a new standard come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia and the city and a lot of affection so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the new stands out for ... to um [noise]\nThere was kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um rents out the sides and backs of the standard for for um\nSelling advertising for the city wants to make sure that the newsstand can keep going it has an interest in making sure that they'd offer folding they want to keep us
