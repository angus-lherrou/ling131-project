...\n\nBack to the gym I had a show at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killing Syrians killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is already working its way up to the top of the best seller list and they were going to look a bit of just do what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the titled you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the end of World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until a killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\n[noise] sure um after Iraq killing pat and which I became an enormous salary a lot of material left over be as Patton\nWas an occupier in southern Germany\nBefore he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat in and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing a bad one actually fight them wanting to fight Stalin\nAnd the Soviet Union which is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing patent battle one actually fight them if you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA took over from the ... or did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get ... people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the U.S as one of the most of our human beings ever to walk the planet called Odessa\nAnd him we knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and him with what he can negotiate except for peace it's kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of its Athens within the organization and so they helped these guys get outta Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped him a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to general way Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nA it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took a big guys and we took it I meant andme angle a Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Martin woman\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we prove that in the book by dental work so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise] um and I want\nAmericans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university you win the world war two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people it's just amazing I'm ... and when you read it in people but all that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it can happen here by the way\nWill certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise in your eyebrows right now\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation [noise]\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two and certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify who want to this country and others the Vatican another's did in in the sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did ill and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be blackmailed\nTo go after it off Eichmann ... they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and that forced force Truman to do it and who who who blackmail on it\nBlackmailed him I'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named him in um that have Truman didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in a concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six ... number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and to bill O'Riley will tell you all about them or just a

A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody pose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics is the same same thing but in America a lot of these people and apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nYeah a lot of them do [noise]\nYeah yeah so I'll take a quick break come back with more from a Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.
