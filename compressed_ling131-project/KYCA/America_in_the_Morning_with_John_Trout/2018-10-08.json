membership\nLet's talk about this with Rob and like the general counsel and director of the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation their website Texas policy dot com\nA long and painful procedure but uh for the administration it has been a significant victory your thoughts about the lessons that you hope we should look we have learned or that we should have learned from this entire process\nHas been oral wherever the past several weeks but the right outcome only got two at the end I think in the wrong path a given\n... says while it has been a world where in the past several weeks but the right outcome we got to at the end I think in the wrong path or do I think there's two lessons you learned one is that when conservatives stand up and do the right thing\nAnd have courage that we can get to the right outcome\nAnd the second lesson is that and looking back over the past month this is an experience that the American people should never be drug through and should never be done to any person again as what was what was done to judge now justice Cavanaugh\nI Would I Would agree with you uh one of the things that I think that we might keep in mind and that is that if someone suffers a sexual assault that is a terrible thing one\nCan hope that if the person who did that is a brought to justice who's tried if convicted is sufficiently punished\nAnd I am prepared to bend over backwards offering all kinds of ah a consolation and uh and sympathy to such people however when such a person then goes in the direction of accusing someone else without having done this\nI'm afraid the standard has to be considerably higher neighborly you've got to have some kind of goods to actually offer you've got to be able to be specific to offer the kinds of things that get in fact lead to a credible accusation otherwise it's not enough to say that I was one sexually assaulted and\nLet's pick some guy whoever's handy because any will do because they're all pigs that doesn't cut it\nWe were so close in this to setting a new standard that\nThe acceleration is the conviction itself and we saw that start to snowball\nWhen you started to have completely absurd accusations and non us than non uh mostly uh alleged against justice Kavanaugh after the first couple of allegations began to to gain traction and\nIt quickly spiraled out of control I think that the Senate Judiciary committee should be commended as chairman Grassley at bringing this back to a disciplined focused process\nThey gave it a fair opportunity for credible accusations to be evaluated a but also moved to that through and got to an end point where with sufficient for him\nCredible accusations to be evaluated a but also moved to that through and got to an end point where with sufficient information that committee was able to make an informed choice in this one I think it was the correct one to confirm justice scattered off\nAnother lesson that I Would hope that would be learned would be if in fact someone does suffer a sexual assault it may be terrible you may want to manage the memory from your mind if you wish justice\nYou should make yourself sit down and write down details names places times are all kinds of information that they can actually be used because if in fact you allow the terror of the moment to just a\nWash away the details you cease to be a credible witness but that's another lesson but I think perhaps that we might learn on on the confirmation process itself\nAre are there reforms which should be made or is it just a case of live the gross national attitude\nYou know I think the lesson anything for and what the reform is it I Would like to see is I Would like to see accountability\nAgainst those that abuse the system I would like to see accountability against any staff at the Capitol that leaked confidential information\nI Would like to see accountability against individuals subject to the penalty of perjury that intentionally provided false information to the committee we have to draw the line and say the truth matters\nAnd windows are going to use a process there has to be consequences so that
