but\nThere is damage here and Steve I Want to begin with legitimacy what does the allegation a week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWe talked we talked about the\nPotential employee a implications\nRamifications of this Russia the allegation that the Russians were manipulating the outcome of our elections in the case of Trump in two thousand and sixteen and as you say the media's pushing this now in regard to the house congressional elections\nOn November sick so we you and I talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia there's question mark after it and\nThe more I think about that I don't see this going away in the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that\nSense of process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more a question that an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it\nIf you say and you say it's for two and a half years\nEven though you can't produce any evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House what are being done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this\nIn the White House would have been done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this the Kremlin could do this and now they're saying the Chinese may want to do it but that a foreign power\nCould choose our president\nPotentially dean legitimize is the presidency is an institution\nTo cast a shadow alive or let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction the next Democratic president is going to get the same kind of stopped thrown at him or her than the Democrats have been throwing at Trump it isn't gonna end [noise] so what we have to ask ourselves is first we get a\nAlmost a dean legitimize in our elections as a process\nBeginning with the presidential one and two six team now going into next Tuesday these questions have been raised so I have no doubt that if\nThe Republicans hold the house a\nRemained majority that a segment of the Democratic party and its media will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian ... you know tip the scales\nBecause they wanted to protect Trump so what do we then have a shadow over the presidency and over\nThe next Congress that's fairly serious in my mind mine John and then that raises another question in my mind\nIf these people take this seriously\nWhat are they saying about American voters\nOf the American people now in democratic theory and you don't have to be a political philosopher you notice the bedrock a representative democracy is that the agency\nLies with voters and voters will make a rational a a functional democratic decision and you live by their decision you would agree with that I didn't look like he had lost her she had to begin with that premise they go on from there to talk about\nInstitutions are representative government but you can't have institutions are representative government [noise] ah unless you have people to elect them otherwise\nAnd some authoritarian systems have outwardly democratic parliament shrinks apple correct but they're essentially appointed and control\nIt's called managed democracy but a real democracy and representative democracy is\nOh correct but they're essentially appointed and control\nIt's called managed democracy but a real democracy and representative democracy is the one we know\nAre you need the voters but if the loaders are said to be as they are in these Russia gate\nAllegations\nForever susceptible to a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads out of about forty billion ads bought or whatever it was a\nBy some Russian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg what does that say about the American people\nI mean we got to think this through at about people you and I John who lived are pirated life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for a man that I mean I Know that if I buy that beautiful new car\nIt is not going to get me all those beautiful women that are leaning over the car I mean we had been raised to be intuitive leap skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on so to say that the Russians are capable of manipulating American voters\nIs saying something less about the Russians than about our own people but that is what these Russian gate allegations\nAre saying it is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a reporter and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg\nSo I Would often wish them very good morning in Russian and they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of humor they were working for money I understood that but it wasn't a threat it was kind of cheering\nThat they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kind of thing right really very for twice the very thank you very much picked a real hard dates they are for the Republicans imagine today so I I it never occurred to me that it would be\nIt would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed\nIt seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nAndme me cause we talked about this I Will go into it but historically whatever meddling or interference in the Russians did into six team was part of a long history\nOf all let's turn to that just a moment\nLike ... or interference and the Russians did in to sixteen was part of a long history of ... let's turn to that just moments tape about back meddling in there are elections where we'll check

I'm concentrating on Russia right now Russian interference\nHow that actually affect the election I Can't tell you but I Do know stop the possibility that whoever loses on Tuesday is going to blame the Russians\nIt also sets up the possibility that there is never going to be a safe space for elections in America in perpetuity if this if this theme continues Dave our elections are always going to be vulnerable we can't shut the door fast enough\nAnd we have to find another way to go forward as the government which means didn't trust the mob\nTrust the leadership that's where we're headed Steve trust the people who know best\n... that's what worries me among other things and that's the theme and a Bible all that whereas is leading up to me and you got to get the language right\nGave has been an elite project and one of the things I Do in the book is I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan maybe even before to sixteen\nShe gave has been an elite project yes and one of the things I Do in the book is I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan maybe even before to sixteen and the story to the extent that it's known\nI put in the book I don't claim to know at all because you never know everything that the intelligence services do that's why they're called intelligence services I guess [laughter] but the problem here is is that they set into motion these narratives about what's going on\nPeople believe them they were coming to a moment\nAs we know it's a week away where one week away from the election and as you say are the losers are going to blame the Russians they will we've already have that in off year elections\nShow where how do we get our elections back now one thing we do you and I talked about it I won't go into it at great length I heard something the other day that reminded me of and we do to broadcast maybe more than one on the long history of American meddling in Russian election or Russian politics sure\nAntibiotics knock United States we throw money at it\nWhat we can start with Woodrow Wilson who sent troops to ride a bike ride Russian so I ...
