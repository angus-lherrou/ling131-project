witnessed\nThe attacks going back to ... uh the attacks on the other congressmen the threats\nAre what we saw on television and I'm sitting here wondering where is the attorney general whereas the department of justice surely by now there are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nKnow there was a headline justice more I got I have not had time to follow up yet it it I saw when I was on the air here where somebody I'm from the other side is is talking about how um

enforcement action and brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing this stuff and some kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws and I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the the\nAnd you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the ... chief of police

by fours\nAnd and setting cars on fire you don't have to wait for a for\nFor a sessions or the department of justice prosecute them arrest them put them in jail that if you're the the district attorney in Seattle throw the book out um you know these people deserve a law in jail terms a big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats\nAnd the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know there are the kind of like the provisional wing of the IRA back in the old days you know that that the activist wing of the militant wing of the Democratic party and they don't want to prosecute them they don't want to put them in jail\nAnd uh so I think that's where the that's where the enforcement really needs to be getting his at the state and local level where the crimes are taking place\nLet's go to Cheryl and Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened in two thousand eleven

were sent to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it scared you know grandma that two teenage sons\nA Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot ah there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about a Governor Scott Walker he was successful the Republican\nFitzgerald brothers who control the state Senate and state assembly stood strong the governor stood strong and the book is called on intimidated and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics\nThey did and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd people just a Wisconsin turn red\nThere was set attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of recounts lawsuit everything we're seeing now uh happened in two thousand eleven against a successful Republican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin\nI'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt a\nShield annoy us you know the Democratic legislators ran in ... so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that\nRight man right they hit out\nAnd of course the Tea Party expose where they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel [laughter] it was just you know you couldn't carry on a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process\nAnd by the way organizing for America the Wisconsin branch was a busy there that was Obama's group to thousands eleven act in a while\nAnyway I assure you you make a great point I mean we we've seen this show before

a leash ing the power of businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is a is really a transformative across the board\nIt really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on it\nAcross the board it really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking basis are currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had\n'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval index the difference between strong approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at Zero Dark but doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven\nSo Trump's at at this moment is eleven points better so we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something or what do you think Adam are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above it both the things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future\nUh it it really is a stark discrepancy between the two futures that are are in front of us are right now that uh that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan repeal Trump's tax cuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what that means but the average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax cuts that that was asked last year and the economic growth projected over over the future attacks cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of\nLast take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that uh\nThat that that that should be scary to to most American that that all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the uh with by simply repealing somebody's big pieces that that the the house and the Senate president have have put through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions enemies stops to answer their questions and there's a bunch of questions about\nWhite House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions enemies stops to answer their questions and there's a bunch of questions about the Kavanaugh nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela\nAnd he said yeah if the Democrats get their way all these socialist they're popping up now that they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out as socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pets have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\n[noise] you know the the the record of socialism or something like eighty six and zero it's a it's been tried more times than it should've been and each and every time it's a it's\nIt's crumbled and then left misery and destruction at wake and so I mean that's the that that at a very high level that\nThose are the two that your direction we can we can choose\nThe promise of the tax cut the promise of of putting more money in people's pockets is simply allowing Americans to decide how their money as they enter rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington and letting it sort of loss around blind people's pockets and then\nA part of it getting bad back out elsewhere that that that is just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American than American businesses no how best to spend invest their their resources and that's what we're seeing it's the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American uh you know under socialism some people always do very very well so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so if you're part of the ruling click or you're a part of the ... the socialist in crowd yeah you can do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats so they can fry 'em up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down\nThe people are trying to catch rats and they can fry him up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially\nToward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force

mentioned in past week that a down helicopter with us of with the corps has a fully ... fully visible in the video that there was no response even in daylight so is that the same thing here no response to the attack\nBut didn't know the ... you know so what what typically happens when the district centers over on and off into retreats from it and then they control the areas around it the

rose you are here to report on the vast landscape and we go now to Africa to Somalia\nYou will all recall awake past bill reported\nThat the al Shabaab which is linked to the cutthroat said al ... al Shabaab truck cat and Italian unit in Mogadishu and I looked for the follow up to that I was a suicide bombing attack al Shabaab is say an indigenous\nUprising but it has transnational reach so therefore I was I was puzzled by the U.S strike ... an airstrike on the southern Somali coast in these last days and bill reports out at bill ...\nI was puzzled by the U.S strike ... an airstrike on the southern Somali coast in these last days and bill reports on a bill you keep a\nVery careful map of the U.S airstrikes in Somalia for this year this is a southern Somalia co south of Mogadishu what do we know about what was the point of it these look like Penn pranks on a map and I don't see the overall strategy for the U.S to participate\nYeah for the U.S strategy move first and foremost in Somalia is to support the African Union or some of the national government slowly national army in their operations against the problem is that yeah I mean it's small and smiley national army has really anything\nAbout it in a more like a a a clan militias are ripping clan militias show in this particular strike um they hit an area that was very close to where the smiley national army was trying to clear about what\nThey're the defense ministry called the safe havens um is is an area about the twenty thirty miles northwest of the city because smile um which was run by Shabaab several years ago\nSo this was a you know a lot of the the interesting thing we're tracking these strikes at a rally in Yemen and Libya post like that they try to the U.S military government tries to call them counterterrorism strikes\nBut really they're they're military operations off in a some kind to me are are they are as individuals cells and their their networks but they're all off ... military operations to fight these insurgent groups and you have to keep in mind that\nThese terrorist groups in the answered group the one and methane that out tighter and their branches are affiliates or whatever you want to call them\nThe primary goal is to\nEstablish Emirates in in the furthering the goal of establishment corporal\nShow the insurgency a key part of it the terrorism part Italian bombs suicide bombs gets western part is is I think that's just a tactic at a job\nBut I'm a staff I understand this bill so the U.S military and I'm presuming these are\nDrone strikes not I'm not warplanes the U.S military is an air wing of the African Union forces fighting in Somalia and\nUm the African Union forces are fighting indigenous uprisings nothing to do with transnational terrorism\nFighting in Somalia and\nUh the African Union forces are fighting indigenous uprisings nothing to do with transnational terrorism\n[noise] no no this is the first part is often what Shabaab he's both a\nYou know indigenous insurgency but he's also is Titus branch in Somalia so you know it's it's not one way or the other it's both Shabaab is you know local insurgent groups that is an Islamic church group that pledge allegiance to al ... who has out titled leaders\nUm and it's you know any commands and its\nLeaders and fighters brought the game experience\n... al Shabaab is part of al ... network is part of al tighter and but yes you're correct US military is often operating in support of the afternoon in Mali army that's where she writes like that that's what the particularly strike was they like to call them ... that's not the case\nRight right no it's it's sort of\nThis is a remnant of the nation trying to say we are not\nYes we appeal to Congress because you pay for this at least be articulate when we use drones knees are not counterterrorism strikes these are\nThese are police operations I think that was the polite way to talk about in the twentieth century Tom the Taliban is looking to an Afghan election or to say that the Taliban is going to disrupt it is an understatement a you also mentioned that the Islamic state is involved how so\nWell you know both the tell by the Islamic state of course uh you know denied the legitimacy of Afghanistan's elections and what's the key thing here is that the U.S government has been quite delusional about what they think the Taliban is willing to do with the Taliban leaders are willing to do\nYou know early this year the state department actually called on a tall bond to turn to turn over their bullets for about ... and to get out and vote and to become part of the political process Afghanistan\nThis is completely inconsistent with every piece of public rhetoric you'll see come out of the call bond there is no evidence that the Taliban is willing to lay down its bullets for balance I mean this is just mindless rhetoric really\nIn any event this new I'm Calvin theme in that came out just today emphasize the fact that they reject the Afghan Afghan elections which are coming up on October twenty eighth I Believe the parliamentary elections they rejected by numerous grounds they claim that the elections are basically just they sort of a ... at least on for the foreign ...\n... which are coming up on October twenty if I Believe the parliamentary elections they rejected by numerous grounds they they claim that the elections are basically just they sort of a ... for the foreign forces meaning of the U.S [noise]\nThey reject the legitimacy the Afghan government and they claim that basically it's their religious duty to disrupt or prevent the elections from going off\nNow that ... on like the Islamic state is very careful in the statement anyway rhetorically to say that they're going to try and be careful not to kill Afghan civilians indiscriminately and they're going to try and target security forces that are in charge of preserving the elections are safeguarding the elections\nWhat's different about that now of course they will if they do strike out they will end up killing civilians but what's different about that at least in terms of their rhetoric is Islamic state doesn't care Islamic state says we're going to go after if you're participating in the elections civilian or otherwise\nThen you have the right to kill you and so the Islamic state has absolutely no compunction about going out and killing whoever is taking a party elections where's the ... because they're a little more sensitive toured\nSort of how they're they're perceived publicly and in terms of popular appeal at least want to put a little bit of a shrine on their sort of the violence\nBut the Taliban is against the elections not correct um they're not they're not in no way in ... after\nThey couldn't be any clear that they are against the elections and here's the point John ... the whole us strategy in Afghanistan is about right now and I mean we we call it a strategy is about trying to get the Taliban lay down arms and ... and recognize the legitimacy the Afghan government and participate in the political process\nThey couldn't tell us anymore or any more often than they already are that they reject the Afghan government in the political process and then it's against the sharia law it's against the religious obligations\nAnd that they basically need to undermine the Afghan political process because all it is for them is basically just a sort of a a puppet of of the foreign invaders\nA bill I check with you on your sources ride you know this Afghan national election it's a lining up to be a failure or at least considerably diminished considering how much\nIn the old days I remember when we used to make a big deal about an election Afghanistan now it looks like they're going to hold it in ... in a small club in capital and call it an election\nYeah that's absolutely right I Wonder if this ... that is there a lot of places are not going to be open right\nThat these elections are largely going to be held in the in the major cities and the more constantly all those districts that most of the Afghans are not going to be a represented in this election and now that is a major failures Seventeen years\nAll right that most of the Afghans are not going to be a represented in this election and I that as a major barrier seven years at the U.S invasion that you know it's\nThe ... which is worse than at any point\nAnd that polling Centers for Afghanistan to represent the will of the Afghan people that that child that are very clear that the government is a legitimate that a deal election do illegitimate and the electorate looks legitimate when they can't open polling centers throughout the\nRailroad show and Tom shots and senior fellow at the foundation

wasn't planned and it shows that number of things John one of them is that um the disagreements at the top of the Communist Party have become so severe that they basically broken out into open warfare and the reason I get to that is that China really wanted to have the head\nTop of the Communist Party have become so severe that they basically broken out into open warfare\nI the reason I get to that is that China really wanted to have the head of Interpol to be a Chinese national Communist Party official and they were successful in that and for them to do this to take a among\nAnd disappear and indicates that they don't care about China's international standing anymore that what's really important for them is solving internal political disputes\nWe've seen this in the Maoist era you know seizing paying as one mile Arab powers\nHe's also ended up with ... mile era instability you can't have um what a siege and paying wants this really I think is an indication that we're going to go back to the intense political struggles\nIn the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties this is really bad news because China right now looks to be unstable\nMy palm pale said in this meeting that he regret that there will not be an annual meeting between Chinese and us diplomats and military officials do in mid October so not only in the middle of the mill stop\nGordon and Secretary Mattis canceled his visit to China but there will be no conversation between diplomat safe I followed this reporting\n[noise] yes well you know the Chinese are blaming us for the cancellation of the security dialogue but we canceled only because the Chinese said their top the admiral would not be available um and so you know this is and also they pulled the admiral from meetings he had in the U.S [noise]\nSo really what the US was reacting to was China a centrally cutting off the milk Tamil discussions\nAs we pointed out before these milk Tamil dialogues benefit China much more than the u._s. so for Beijing to cut them off shows temper tantrum shows counterproductive diplomacy shows that people in Beijing are are not really thinking anymore they're just getting angry so this is not good\nAll right we'll check jobs the tension between ... and my ... checked off the threats to Taiwan we checked off the threats to the freedom of navigation we checked off\nThe threats that you're not allowed to mention that a million we girls are being brutalized by the Chinese because they are the wrong religion or have a religion\nWe checked out the fact that will be no ... let's go to North Korea\nIf I understand it correctly there's an upcoming visit a weekend visit to young young uh Mike Pompeo is in young young but there's an upcoming conversation between ...\nIf I understand correctly there's an upcoming visit a weekend visit to young young uh Mike Pompeo within young young but there's an upcoming conversation between Pyongyang and Moscow and Beijing I think Ken is going to participate in that\nThe puzzle here Gordon is with the deterioration between the U.S and China where does that lead moons utopian is is is is Korea now collateral damage to ... a temper tantrum\nWell you know it could be John you know a lot of people have said and we've had that centrally this ideology for for decades that you got to be nice to the Chinese and they will reciprocate\nWell you know President Trump explicitly try that last year he said look I'm going to go easy on the Chinese on trade if they help on North Korea well they didn't help on North Korea they took that as a big green light to violate sanctions we've got to do something different and you know I'm not saying that pressure is going to absolutely work\nBut it can't do any worse than the cooperation path I think what President Trump needs to do is to start sanctioning Chinese banks\nReally imposing costs on Beijing for transferring ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology to the north Koreans for violating sanctions for doing all the rest of it\nYou know we have all these disagreements with China we've got to have it out with the Chinese because as disagreeable if that is\nYou know we've tried the other approach and its miserably failed that's made the Chinese even worse than they were before and so you know we are the author of almost of Chinese aggression and it's not like we're the aggressors but nonetheless we made it easy for the Chinese to be a embolden and to try to take down the international system\nMoon Jae in is the president of South Korea he has made it very clear he wants to reunite the peninsula a quote today and this story from Beijing a new order is being created on the Korean Peninsula\nGordon is it is moving on yesterday's news or is he part of the problem ... from Beijing or did he worked for Seoul\nNo no he works for appearing young um have you read the rest of what Moon Jae in said when he spoke to a hundred and fifty thousand North Koreans in the stadium\nYou know essentially it was written by North Korean propaganda is um and so essentially we got a South Korean president who I I don't know what's in his head John but what he's doing is sort of hurting his own freedom his own democracy his own society the nation he's supporting his own nation\nAnd so regardless of what he thinks a you know some people say he's a communist some people say worse\nI don't know but I Do know that he's dangerous um to what we're trying to do\nAnd so regardless of what he thinks a you know some people say he's a communist some people say worse\nI don't know but I Do know that he's dangerous um to what we're trying to do to disarm the north Koreans into stylish and continue peace and stability in the region moon as an obstacle to that

use them as a hallmark has Mr nab there seems to be saying or are they going to be more like the Democrats in the Senate butter saying let's not must not be so hasty about this David\nBullock I think what you're going to hear from those Democrats is that they're going to use the the oversight power the Congress and what we know they will do is hall of everybody they can have them testified before a a house committee and somehow\nOversight power the Congress and you know what we know they will do is haul up everybody they can and have him testified before a a house committee and somehow get them up there and the subpoenas rolling by the truckload at the White House from the Democratic a house committee chairman that that's what they take the house they're trying\nTo show this idea of impeachment of the Republican a fantasy that's been made up the scale Republicans and devoting course Republicans don't need to create a fantasy anymore because I got Kavanaugh to to do that job and and the only question is does that last or ten days from now we're we revert to what had been the meaning of this election cycle\nMr pond [noise] well I agree with David the Democratic officials and consultants don't want to talk about impeachment but their base can't help itself\nAnd the message that is going getting through a lot of the grassroots is we have to impeach Trump and not just trumpet Kavanaugh and that's what this election is about\nSo the the the overall thirty thousand foot message is responsible and prudent as David says but what was the message a lot of activists who sending an individual districts are uh we're going to get them and we're going to impeach them and that's one of our signal issue\nGave it I saw a news item and saying that some group and the Democratic party was not going to spend money or ... pulling money back from the the the Democratic race in in Tennessee did you see that wins that substantive or just a quick reaction\nWell look I mean it's a major democratic group I'm part of the I got the one Democrat who speculated they might have done that it just throw bread is solid or because you know you could give them something to crow about I mean he doesn't need any money so if they're going to pick Brett attended to disown\nThen you know that's fine as far as Democrats are concerned but but it's true that the basis John Fund mentioned\nThe base on the left was all ginned up about this I don't know how much Senate Democrats wanted is is that just like the Obamacare shut down in twenty Thirteen that the Republican base demand it or at least a portion of it\nThat sort of had to take this all the way and this is what happens when you don't have a leader of the party and the base thinks that you're a minority should be able to do a lot more than I can actually do\nYou do not believe that precedent Bredesen was hurt by that remark because he's no longer on the TV\nIf anything he'd be helped I mean I run an ad and say
