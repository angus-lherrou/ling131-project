is they had CNN playing on the green screen in the back and the wind could who spoke English was literally doing a synchronous translational the CNN coverage that will national coverage in central

what's going to focus on ... threat we're now focused let's start with Russia\nOr your experience with Russia from your dad and mom is that no matter how they dress it up their aggressive\nAnd they're aggressive some especially along the boundaries that the empire\nIs it your opinion that the Trump Administration has addressing it adequately now after the failures of the Obama administration to see what Ukraine represented\nI think sending traveling entertainment cells to Kiev instead of socks and blankets is is a very a serious improvement from the Obama years\nSo yes and uh the personalities while making the decisions not just in the White House but elsewhere for example the gender of the joint chiefs general dumped food fully appreciate that uh\nUh KGB Kindle is always a KGB colonel and the the important way to look at Russia is not as the Soviet Union of you'll\nBut what I like to call them and the status quo act to constantly looking to destabilize but we we tend as Americans I Love my fellow Americans we tend to pause it good face on behalf of the other\nRight I'm okay you want to be oh yeah I I say something and I'm On a minute and a lot to do business too busy yes\nThe Kremlin has never work like that whether it was run by a song whether it was run by Stalin or by KGB cuddle so we now have the requisite knowledge and understanding that these are bad actors not the

defense or Institute that wrote an excellent English wanted targets ... one of the primary ... above the Baltic region\nUm they wrote a wonderful English language study that I pray see in in in my work\nAnd it's nothing very new that there's a lot of\nIn the beltway people talk of hybrid wolf fast seven generational grazed out that's just wrapping on on old phones irregular warfare what is different is the combination under serious ... the seriousness with which they apply irregular warfare\nEverything is in direct the focus is on the will on the non kinetic they'll send in a little green men eventually but we now know unclassified open source that prior to leak a Crimean intervention\nRussia had been undermining the Ukrainian nation state for a decade\nWe've subversion with uh other means of television they were ... they were so they say they were preaching propaganda millions of dollars worth of propaganda being pushed into the region into the Baltic region as well right now so it it is it is the comprehensive this of their understanding of\nIrregular warfare that is the danger\nWhen you got to the national defense university ah as the son of a man who fought the
