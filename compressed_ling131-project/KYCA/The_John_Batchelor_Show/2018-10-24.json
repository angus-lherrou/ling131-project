I'm with the power and we're reviewing our ... quickly because there's a new book war with Russia the book is published\nThe uh the criticism that he provided to augment our conversation which was recorded as a podcast and made available on the nation dot com as well as my website and globally I mean not for heaven's sakes they're all eventually everywhere in the ether forever\nUh I tuned in of course than all the other aggregators for five years but Steven taken his right off of each week's conversation and arrange them in a book style we've gone quickly through men squandering meant to and Syria because we now we come to when it grew into NATO conflict and that was in twenty sixteen\nBecause of the concerns the fears of Eastern Europe that Russia having gobbled up half of Ukraine was going to turn its attention to the Russian frontier and the NATO troops and the NATO commanders cooperated in this fear Steve because they injected in the idea\nThat Russia was an aggressor and the little green men could be in Lafayette just as easily as they could be in Poland and since then there's been nothing but escalation in Europe so we started in Ukraine\nWe read just Syria then we spread to Eastern Europe and now Steve because of the exercise that Russia just ran with China in the in the far east of Siberia we have a true global ... global conflict with Russia and China on one side and the United states and NATO on the other in these five years\nYes and it's amazing to me John not amazing but it's striking that as I finished the book how many of the subjects we discussed for five years ago you would say it's history\nAmazing but it's striking that as I finished the book how many of the subjects we discussed for five years ago you would say it's history and it is history\nBut it's still front page news today a in Ukraine for example it's still sad what set off the fall of the government\nThere and brought the pro American government\nThe power in a country that's part of Russia is common Ukrainian civilization right on the border of Russia [noise]\nWe're ... who was famous snipers you remember that John yeah February Twenty one on the same\nAnd said well actually not I mean newspapers still say that the president of Ukraine at the time ... insured shouldn't be deposed in fleet of Russia has sent snipers to kill as a point on it's on my ... square but all the evidence now in is that\nIt wasn't called a niche but he's very right wing even neo Nazi enemies who are the snipers now the reason that's important is that\nThose people who sent the snipers neo Nazis have grown into a major force in Ukraine Today and yet we back the government of Ukraine so this is another theme of the book I mean are we comfortable we Americans backing a government that has a bad\nA really the largest fascist movement in Europe today and arm that arm battalion ... off with thirty thousand fighters\nWell see we just trying to NATO exercise in western Ukraine with the ads off battalion now part of the Ukraine military so yeah of clear we're comfortable we're networking\n[noise] you know I I just want to get myself one further piece of a problem the promotion the lake writer of Gore Vidal's all uh many years ago when I was writing a column about Russia for the nation magazine said that I was a part of an early journalistic alert system\nThat is I call attention to things that people weren't paying attention to [noise] I think that that's one\nThat that's been one important for me I'm doing this broadcast with you weekly [noise] is that you and I have been able to talk about things and they're working behind the news that are very important that are going to shape history and when I read what we've discussed and what I've written up now in the book\nI'm pleased and a kind of negative way 'cause I which a lot of these things hadn't happened the way what we began to trace in late to Thirteen\nI'm pleased and a kind of negative boy 'cause I Wish a lot of these things hadn't happened but we ... we began to trace in late to Thirteen\nWhen Ukrainian crisis erupted all the way through almost last week has been the right things to focus\nAdopt their professor prep for the book is war with Russia question mark Stephen F Cohen when we come back we're going to plunge immediately into nuclear conflict on John bachelor this is the

nearly Seventy five percent of nations have Crohn's disease require one or more surgeries at some point in their lives there was an attack but they don't speak to the realities\nThat truly had been negotiated in signed in Nineteen Seventy two [laughter] ... ballistic missile treaty and it was absolutely crucial to everybody security ... cause it prohibited\nAny country in specifically the United states has Soviet Union and Russia [noise] from the pouring missile defense installations\nWhich meant what let's go back to what was called mad what kept the nuclear peace ever since the beginning of the atomic age was this doctrine of mutual assured destruction that if one side attack the other\nIn an attempt to destroy it ... itself would be attacked and destroy\nAnd that rain but madness could lead to this or in an accident either side from protecting itself from a retaliatory strikes\nAnd that rain but madness could lead to this or an accident kept either side from protecting itself from a retaliatory strike so when Bush left it he opened the door\nTo a profound religion isn't that eventually underline this intermediate range tree\nAnd the Russians began when they saw what was going on to develop a counter or they began violating the treaty I whether they deploy these missiles or not is open to question but they certainly developed them and they tested or they haven't deployed them so the United states by doing that now\nRemember something else happened\nWhen the United states violated another agreement the want it made with Gorbachev that it would not move NATO eastward toward Russia [noise] when NATO began to expand or Russia's borders and today and John we all know we're right on Russia's borders NATO is\nThe missile defense installations which we are now being implemented because Bush and left the treaty prohibiting then became a NATO project where NATO went missile defense with so the result is\nAnd I'll get to the end of this point but I think it's very important the result is today as we talk Russia is reigned by American NATO missile defense installations so you say so ... how does that to relate to what Trump\nAnd it's because the Russians are climbing and American nuclear scientist who are independent such as professor Theodore postal at MIT have agreed\nThat these missile defense installations can fire\nIntermediate range missiles that is there not only defense installations they are often ... so we've been building their capacity to fire cruise missiles as I recall which have been banned for almost a decade now and the Russians have complained bitterly\nAnd we have not responded so we have a situation so when the Russians began to respond they probably violated the treaty but they were reacting to us\nAnd and the age of ... to ... we moved on his shoulder just yes actually exactly\nEven though the the INS ban land base missiles the ages just complicated a lot of them are on ships but they are in fact the land based develop missiles put on ships they it's more that\nComplicated a lot of them are on ships but they are in fact the land based develop missiles put on ships they it's more the distinction between seeing land all I think it's fair to say\nAnd you might get on to somebody and get somebody on like an allied I'm John ... who says why narratives not correct but I leave it to be that as his true with the history of the Cold War we have ... or\nYou know within ten in mind [noise] done profoundly unwise things in regard to Russia Jewish Russia has reacted\nAnd we see what it leads to because of this treaty this act of nuclear abolition ism was symbolically and historically enormous importance now maybe it'll be say\nThere are six months you have to give them notice six months in advance\nMaybe that's a blow off by Trump to get the Russians to do something a trumped by putting you're gonna meet where John and I remember\nEleven in Paris for the for the commemoration of one hundred years since the armistice end of the gun fell silent and November eleventh Nineteen\nAnd maybe they're going to and I think we're supposed to meet again in Argentina November for the sidelines of the G ... if they do meet maybe there is a secret diplomacy underway here David I doesn't look that I have a quote here from the Institute of us and Canadian studies\nA Saturday Rogoff a home with a Russian has links to Russia where\nHe's he is there a guy on America I Know she and being\nAble to leave sat here is that leaving the INS could bring the whole structure of arms control crashing down now that that that ten speculative late but it's been my experience these five years that escalation works this way if something can happen and go wrong it does happen and goes wrong that's escalation\nSo what happens after the ins and is that the start doesn't get extended and that's all that's left there is nothing else after dark\n[noise] well I could I mean not to tell my book again but the thesis of the book is that this new Cold War is more dangerous than the proceeding one [laughter] so during the proceeding Cold War we and the Soviet Union inactive all sorts of measures to keep us safe\nIncluding these nuclear weapons or restrain regulation agreements now they're being dismantled uh so if we have\nThese nuclear weapons or restrain regulation agreements now they're being dismantled so if we have a new nuclear war\nWithout the safeguards that protected is\nDuring the Cold War I didn't mean to say nuclear war we have a new Cold War without the safeguards that protected
