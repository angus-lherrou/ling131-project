be covering every aspect of these close races the president being deployed\nFor a President Obama being deployed to Florida Donald Trump will be in Florida this week and of course we're dealing with the aftermath and the finger pointing a hideous politicization of the deaths of eleven worshipers at the tree of life synagogue or in Pittsburgh\nAre blaming Trump for being an anti Semite blaming tromp for talking about the caravan blaming tromp\nFor criticizing the media for their bias coverage or it is stunning that the left would do this but again all too predictable the closer these a key races get the more desperate the left becomes\nAnd you've seen this in the way that they've pipe the rhetoric and jacked it all up\nAnd by the way the president I'm speaking they're Obama about\nOh he's he's hoping there are compassionate conservatives using the Bush phrase [laughter] of course you know Bush goes out with a twenty seven percent approval rating in two thousand eight that was great news for bronco bomb I thought he loves those types of compassionate conservative to\nHand him and people like him the reins of power but\nHe doesn't mention the fact that when he's talking about kids and pans ... you know it was in Detroit over the weekend I mean he built the pans he's the guy and his administration or had they had to admit Jay Johnson that it was Obama\nYeah and I mean he built depends he's the guy and his administration had they had to admit Jay Johnson that it was Obama\nWho\nYou know began this practice of separating families at all [noise] so and twenty fourteen to deal with the spike or the families we did a number of things including by the way working with the government of Mexico and obtaining their cooperation but we also expanded family detention\nAnd I freely admitted it was controversial but it sounds you know more\nPowerful for Obama to talk about kids and pans\nSo it was President Obama who began the practice of detaining children and it was only went to court stepped in and said no no no you need only can hold people for twenty days did they stop doing this\nOr had had the court not stepped in than Obama probably would've continued doing it as a way to deter people from bringing children into the country along that dangerous track\nJust go back and forth and immediately told her like hey you know I listen to Maxine Waters and pillows

going to be or going to use strength and numbers to overwhelm their systems you have to let us up\nSo that the people coming in and as part of this so called caravan are not religious refugees they're not political refugees\nThey're leaving their homeland because it's better in the United states that's it I I totally understand that don't get me wrong but that's not that's not a legal definition of

basically on Capitol Hill and the house and in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton who says she's in capable of civility you have all these radicals that they're only goal is to bring this president\nStay and in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton who says she's in capable of civility you have all these radicals that they're only goal is to bring this president down and they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and we have to have respect for this president\nWho has done so much to we store American credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had the guts to go and follow through to make Jerusalem the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but\nThey will find any way to pack at President Trump\nFortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support he won the election by forty two points when I get elected I'm going to be conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda and separately the reason why people are fleeing from Joe Manchin\nIs he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWhy um why would a Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why the action is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast to let them know but the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some praise Hillary and Obama but ... and it's not pro life a match and supports Planned Parenthood\nMatch and supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all\nIs that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe Manchin and the more people learn about his actual record not his rhetoric because or what he does is he says one thing in West\nVirginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest\nWashington liberal ... and they move away from 'em so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the Kavanaugh I'm hearing this Joe mansion\nThe um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the Kavanaugh I'm hearing is Joe Manchin a voted for cabin on the end but uh [noise] I mean I think most people just saw that as just an\nExample of rank unfairness and treating some time treating someone who's ... says yeah they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks follow hit home when you know that Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first call on the Senate floor\nMatch and took a powder and in fact he only came back to vote effort Susan Collins declared her position or whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia's should cast a vote there should be leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nCap it off we know that\nFeinstein held that material for months why because she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided in the bed it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used [noise]\nThat's what the problem is a guy like ... you know he may appear to be more moderate rhetoric but in reality when\nYou're first vote is to empower these\nRadicals and you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing their liberal and more and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia and the president decided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nOr and yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\nYeah I think many people realize that the president has really follow through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition to defeat Obama's coal killing rights at the U.S Supreme Court but\nThat it has served as a bridge to\nPresident Trump and then he followed through on his promises which were on some of those crazy a lawful walls and that's putting some miners backdoor now look we have a long way to go but you're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presents\nYou know look we have a long way to do but you're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities always\nWhich are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that huge and that's\nCredit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he kind of goes back and forth and say well he was open and he wasn't the reality is he voted no we voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for and that's not the kind of leadership when he but we are seeing a resurgence in West Virginia\nAnd you have to give this person a credit for so many good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which allows a entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next seven days election day next week but you can vote early in West Virginia correct\nYes in fact ah October twenty

the defense of democracy they are senior fellows they keep the long war journal which is an excellent way to watch the transformation of Afghanistan in the coming months and years\nThe U.S has been bogged down in a combat that is very difficult summarize since the attack on New York and Washington within a month but here we are asking ourselves how is the Taliban doing as it advances district after district\nBill you have a a report that half the Afghan population lives in districts that are no longer in government control that he is a way of talking about how in effect in the central government is in ... uh in alliance with the U.S and our allies are partners they're\nA ... articulate a little more what does that mean they're outside of government control what does it mean for their lives and for the future good evening at\nFirst I mean we we have a population areas controlled by the Taliban and another forty one percent are living in\nBreak down the number is ... we we we estimate that nine percent\nOf the Afghan population lives in areas that are controlled by the Taliban and another forty one percent are living in areas that are contested by the Taliban contested may mean a certain percentage is controlled by the Taliban and certain percentage control by the Afghan government these are typically the districts that where most of the fighting the cars\nBecause this is where the Taliban and the Afghan military or going head to head what would it be like for now we want to be ... want to be very clear we can't say that the Taliban are in a contested area that that is can we kinda consider a no go zone\n'em again this is this this will be the most difficult probably even more difficult than in air that are in areas under Taliban control um areas that don't under Taliban control you're going to get their ... you know whipping and you know they they're all the\nCraziness under Islamic law that we've seen over the last several decades\nI'm In the areas that are contested\nUm you know you could be living in a town that's even in a contest that area that may be under government control or influence\nAnd the next town over his style is Taliban control there is often a lot of fighting in between these areas you're feeding if you were living in one of those areas that might be government controlled\nYou're fearful that the Taliban could be coming next the next day that the Taliban are coming to tax you that the children are going to come to do all of those horrible things that style of an does and you know what we're trying to to just show people here is\nLooked at the situation in Afghanistan as far more dire than the U.S military the U.S government is trying to tell us they are trying to paper over the situation so they can cut a peace deal with the Taliban but the numbers when we analyze the situation we can come to any other any\nLet me underline that bill President Trump made a speech I Believe was the spring of Seventeen talking about his commitment to Afghanistan and at that time we believed they were going to extend\nTheir commit to extend the deployment of us troops and our allies in Afghanistan does it to look that way given the retreat\nNo it it doesn't and what happened is you know the president said we're gonna we're gonna make the Taliban were in a beat them to the negotiating table by beating them into submission to the negotiating table instead we're meeting them as in wanting quickly to it and within six months they they basically dropped\nThe idea that we can cause a military defeat the Taliban and just decided to do negotiations um I only indication Trump wants out of ...\nBasically dropped the idea that we can cause a military defeat the Taliban and just decided to do negotiations\nBy all the indication Trump wants out of Afghanistan before the next election next presidential election and I suspect that's what we're going to be and you know I just think if that's the U.S policy we need to be very clear about what is going to happen to Afghanistan when the U.S leaves\nYou have a map the long war journal I recommend everybody go to the map you get it right away they break it down into government control contested Taliban control and unconfirmed mobile\nAnd it very much looks like they're surrounding the mountainous center of the country I feed them particularly dominating the area around Capitol is that the way to read this and\nThat is I mean the Taliban controlling contest numerous districts\nIn the provinces just south and east and north of the capital and I said look if the if if the U.S wants to cut a peace deal with the Taliban\nLet's let's say the Taliban you know decided hey we'll make some agreement as soon as U.S forces are gone the Taliban are going to turn on the Afghan government they said they won't share power and so I think when you look at the geography and you look at this map I think you'd see who holds the upper hand here in Afghanistan\nYeah and it's not just around ... certainly dominated around Kandahar which is the main\nUh trade route and also smuggling route from Pakistan and the Baluch area and then all along the Iran border look at that built all around Iraq all contested by the Taliban has been a lot\nOf effort in the west and even shocking is the north and the areas that you know really should be the former northern alliance strongholds right at the areas are confess that it's it's very concerning when you look at this and it hasn't changed for the last year plus the Afghan military has not been able to be back\nInto time I want to go back to Iran because we talked about Iran working with the Taliban that does that leave out al ... or ... in an age and some in some fashion about to run the Taliban relationship well\nThings were quick John you just picked up on something that's very important which you notice that the the territory along the Iranian border and part of the explanation for that is that Iran according to multiple pieces of evidence now it's actually hosting called on training camp to sending fighters into western Afghanistan and take over that term\nAnd part of what you've seen these ... these nations that came out last week we were talking on the first segment is that Iran is actually even given the orders of Taliban commanders and some of the in some instances\nAnd take over that turf and part of what you've seen these ... nations that came out last week we were talking about the first segment is that Iran it's actually even given the orders of on commanders in some of the in some instances according to the U.S Treasury Department this is very\nInteresting in a in an amazing development you had already see that are ... with the Taliban in these operations but it does involve okay that answer your question because of course the top armies closely allied with al ... and then I'll kind of has its own agreement with Iran that allows 'em all kind of fighters to search transit Iranian territory they move funds communications\nAnd other sort of vital assistance reliant territory in a kite is imbedded in the Taliban insurgency so they are also deeply involving\nCentcom becoming this Tom when they put out releases about at the Taliban working so closely with al ... did they talk about Iran al ... and the Taliban that trail\nYou know very rarely will you see anything like that they they ...

I saw that that mean that that sounded like panic garden\nIt it sounds like panic especially because if you did this a year ago you would have a one point five percent transaction fee on the black market\nToday that transaction fee is five percent five percent job that is\nA garden there is no way really the only alternative is further west the United states to prop up the Chinese economy has a very time they're stealing technology they're putting in barriers against free trade and blaze and basically being Merck until this country and they will still continue\nTo put forward threats such as we've heard correct yeah\nI I think so that is in a situation where you've got an hardline states you know China is moving from authoritarianism to totalitarianism you've got a leader who is in secure who is got great ideas like Mao Saddam\nThere there are no good solutions they're nothing nothing that outsiders really can do except to try to contain and to tear apart from that um we are helpless to you know we're ... we're we're just witnesses watching a slow motion and sometimes a quick motion tragedy in China\nOne more detail garden about these threats from she and why way are they sitting at a tone a scene for everybody else as they speak around the world are we going to see this kind of bellicose tantrum\nFrom every will trade representative every diplomat are they all on a leash now does speak poorly in the United states and Europe\nI think that uh the tone and see jumping is set really means that every official is going to be really difficult to foreigners because\nI'm to actually have a nuanced conversation or a friendly conversation with an American or somebody else is very very difficult in these circumstances especially when you also consider that see jumping is tightening down control and turn away so you put all this together and it just shows that\nIn these circumstances especially when you also consider that see jumping is tightening don't control and turn away so you put all this together and it just shows that China is going in directions which are extremely disturbing and the best we can do is just pay attention to this because if we don't pay attention John\nI'm the worst outcomes will almost certainly occur\nFatty us one more question quickly because the rest of the world seem to understand that it's finally [noise] I don't\nThink so that is I think we're coming around to a better understanding of China but we are still woefully behind developments internally which are getting worse really by what\nWas the day but certainly by the way\nIs Caitlin towel Mitch garden that's who wrote the piece in foreign affairs which I recommend do everybody Caitlin is an associate perfect\nCaitlin ... associate professor of security studies at the Edmund a wall school of foreign service at Georgetown ... essay in foreign affairs adapted from what China go nuclear assessing the risk of Chinese nuclear escalation in a conventional war with the United states [noise]\nInternational security spring twenty Seventeen and the short answer is yes yes [noise]\nKnew I knew where they will go nuclear\nBecause they do not have\nThe forces that Russia managed over Seventy years to offset the U.S forces they just an asymmetrical confrontation\nLed by an unstable leadership without legitimacy and a man who was making threat right now against the United states of America and declares himself president for life if that doesn't sound like a thriller first chapter what does I'm John bachelor with Thaddeus McCotter and Gordon jak\n[noise]\nAh the Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets but the United states has master hackers to\nThe best one of the CIA cyber ASU defies all notions of what a deadly by looks like in bite\nFormer intelligence agent Eric understands page turning new thriller the tables are turned in big power cyberwarfare Eric ... new novel from done books as bite B.

marching marching marching the latest news is that more than five thousand military personnel are headed to the border in various stages\nTexas Arizona New Mexico California\nThe news from Central America and from Mexico is that\nThere are there maybe two or more caravans marching\nYoung men we see video now that some of them are violent as you can understand in that heat with very little prospect of success leaving their homes and marching north for unclear purposes [noise]\nUm ... the first caravan is now about four thousand according to the latest grows and shrinks to reach the U.S border perhaps around the time of the election so\nGentleman the polls are moving but who can tell David I start with you is the caravan a story about the poll or is this a split screen election\nWell I think it's a split screen election in part because we're I think kind of back to where we were at the beginning of the summer which is\nA house that is poised to flip to the Democrats may not but I think it's the it's shorter headed there and the Senate that is not going to and you have two different battleground cheer you up in\nA suburban an extra one battleground where Indians when Trump or are mixed at best a very poor and voters interested in and making\nBattleground Syria whether a suburban ... battleground where onions and Trump are are mixed at best to very poor and voters interested in making changes for all sorts of reasons\nAnd then in the Senate you have a very pro Trump Republican battleground a bunch of red states where Republicans are poised to not only keep their majority but add to it\nAnd so I think things like the caravan may be a helpful in the Senate races\nWhere we know the Kavanaugh episode woke up complacent Republican electorate and got them energized and and the caravan of certainly not going to be on your helpful um and it may be helpful in some of these races although I don't know if a Republican need much more help in the Senate races at this point I don't think it's going to\nBe that determinative if at all in the house and I think part of that as they are now so many competing issues are that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going to overtake the care of an issue but in part it's just because we have two different battle\nA much fun and the Trump voters in twenty sixteen were not routinely people that the Republican Party counted on for voting I'm being very diplomatic wondering around his story are they going to turn out is there an issue they care about or did they wait for twenty\nI spoke tonight with John McLaughlin a Republican pollster who says the most important issue next Tuesday will be does the Trump will turn out\nAnd that's why Trump is so assiduously going to Trump centers in Fifteen twenty states are running six rallies between now and the election trying to get out the vote Bob he's not going to any counties were he was closer lost to Hillary\nWe will know that and I'm I suspect them the whole thing about the caravan is about driving out the Trump votes showing that you know I'm president but you don't know timed for relaxation the country is still in danger\nAnd that's why Trump uses such Marshall language even in the tone that would seem inappropriate after Pittsburgh he's trying to basically say we're still in a war footing which means we have to demand sacrifices from you go vote\nFatty you have a question a general we're talking you know obviously it's a mid term it's a base election both sides want to turn their supporters out are you seeing any single issue that is really swing the independence one way or another David [noise]\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue\nAre you seeing any single issue that is really swing the independence one way or another David\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue I think ultimately Trump is the factor and where Trump can be helpful and John mentioned where he's going to be traveling\nTrump is helping to turn out his base and what we're seeing unlike a year ago is very little separation between the Trump base and the standard Republican base and there's little separation between the Trump base in the Republican incumbent who Trump didn't always get along with it but it does at the moment\nI think in the house it's working against Republicans by and large you just have so much energy and money even where Republican enthusiasm is ticked up\nUm they're still fighting across such a big Plainfield it's become so why even today the Republican House campaign committee\n... advertising in Charleston South Carolina in a district\nThat are elected Tim Scott a few years ago and really shouldn't be a problem for the Republicans but it all out and say they're just so many house districts are competing for because of all this anger and a mixed that as being motivated by a a rejection of Trump that's what's making it very hard for for Republicans in terms of the house like\nJohn you know the first billionaire president ever elected as apparently encourage lots of other billionaires to go take 'em down\nBy

breakfast watcher we're going to start with oil however energy prices\nAre ideal of the income of Scotland where diamond labs and of northern Europe especially because of Norway depending on the price of oil\nFor its growth Simon a very good evening to you we're going to come to breakfast immediately you can't escape it these days it's sort of like trying to not talk about Trump how can you do that okay fine we already talked about Trump now back to oil you a publishing berets that big oil stocks\nOr a can ride the prices are rising we've seen that is it clear to eighty dollars then it's hanging in the eighty dollars zone does it help or hurt Europe and is this an opportunity to get out of oil or into oil or from the European point of view good evening to\nComing to you John facts on the on the show it's going to be cooked for the oil stocks when the sanctions on Iran and go into effect totally on November before a dumb the market right now the market of oil traders housing grossly under asked\nThe sanctions on Iran and go into effect fully on November the fourth or the ... the market right now the market of oil traders hasn't grossly underestimated the amount of oil that will come off markets are one of the big distinction between\nThis set of sanctions on the sanctions under the Obama administration when when they weren't and in fact was that there aren't going to really be any exemptions to the sanctions you won't get any relief\nSo we could easily see the the amount of oil prices go up another five dollars and then possibly another five more dollars so it could easily hit Ninety\nAnd then we've got huge problems with excess capacity there really isn't much access capacity in the entire world\nSo a pipeline into him interruption in Nigeria or Iraq or the declines of output in Venezuela has found the price of Brent Crude which is a European benchmark could send up even higher and that will really help\nThe European oil companies massively up a British Petroleum Royal Dutch shell which might have heard of ... the French want an end the Italian one that old two very well may be a good time to sell out of the stocks as they go up because as you know we're all going electric\nSooner or later oh walking in my case walking is good gives me fit but yeah that was a story on on oil and it will be very good findings for those companies\nBecause we're watching oil and Europe at the same time we now move me it lead to Brexit higher price of oil does this have any ... does it make any change in the Brexit hostile underway and you can be as Scotland center cause you wish\nBecause oil is so much a part of the income of Scotland\nIt is it is a very good point of view of apathy is an oil city it goes through booms and busts so obviously it was very much and you know when oil prices went down to twenty six dollars a barrel 'em and you know and I was\nDoing great when oil was a hundred dollars a barrel two years before twenty six you know twenty fourteen which was around the time of\nThe ... the independence referendum for Scotland\n'em by the time we got to a twenty six team it was the independence reference for the whole of Britain from Europe [noise] uh yes it does make it this difference because people say well hey there's oil and and you know we want control of bats etcetera etcetera\nOh the Britain from Europe uh yes it does make a difference because people say well hey there's oil and and you know we want control of bat etcetera etcetera it it will make a difference to vote and Scotland is already quite pro Europe is definitely there's a sudden\nI'm twinge of and the London it's hard to be anti London unless you live in London um because of the way it seems to disregard the rest of the United kingdom but having said all that it looks like Britain is going to accept the European Union it's headed my direction and no matter what tricks the\nEuropean Union has played Theresa May\nHum as just as tough as old lever and she is just going straight for keeping keeping going um doesn't matter what's happening around ... see what the Labour Party is doing she is just going forward towards that cliff if you like whatever you want to call it we're going to be cutting accord with Brussels\nYes I see that but the remain or is are very strong Simon and ... I my reporting comes from what I read is the economist which is a remain er\nAnd the Financial Times which is a runner and I appreciate that they very rarely bring in column is that our rec centers\nThat would be the that that would be a challenge for them given that all journalism as I understand it in ... as a practice in Britain these days is a remain er and they repeatedly say\nThat it's going to damage the economy to leave Brussels to leave your up is that the opinion in Scotland that it'll damage our economy\n[noise] the opinion in Scotland that that I've heard it is a multifaceted am one is that we don't want your pain people in in Scotland does a lot of your parents live in an ad and brought a lot of your parents live in Glasgow as well to to to big city in central Scotland\nThere is some talk about it hurting the economy can be quite honest there isn't much when the economy in Scotland say compared to ... to the rest of the u._k. it is a relatively small I'm\nA small amount of GDP and in Scotland so I don't know that wouldn't necessarily going to see a massive decline in the economy here in Scotland I think the\nBig issue is bad Scotland has a long history of being closer to the confidence that it is to the rest of the u._k. I'm not that goes back to you know point Prince Charles\nIs bad Scotland has a long history of being closer to the confident that it is to the rest of the u._k. I'm not that goes back to you know point Prince Charles ... on on those days\nYou know I think come I think you could touch in the short term it could have a financial services in London but I think the longest time they could actually be very good for the economy or one of the things that\nEveryone should know is not to because food as a as a big portion of poor people's budgets than as we get the sort of European tariffs out of the way and can trade on World Trade organization rules the price of food will likely come down\nOn that will be an absolutely brilliant thing to anyone who for whom food or something they like to have on a on a reasonably regular basis\nWe have noise that Scotland points at Ireland and that there is a ... there's trouble with Ireland especially with Northern Ireland because of the border between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland and that and the\nLondon is ready to make a separate deal is di di ... in order to get that done for Brexit and Scotland wants the same deal why what would that do for you\nYeah that would be pretty interesting let let's go let's go through this though that Northern Ireland is critical for the how in the house of parliament for Theresa May's governments because of the Democratic union party which is a form of northern Irish conservatives\nWithout those votes the MPs that represented the UP in London's parliament\nTheresa May could know half a workable government so she has to deal with them\nAnd I can see how the Scottish national actually sampled if you're dealing with them it's only that but you should cut off the same deal and no doubt some necklace touch and who's the first minister of Scotland will be making much hay out of that to try and get a separate\nDeal more more independent sort of in and out and that might happen I'm not so sure\nThat's necessarily going to fly because it almost looks like it's a it's breaking up the island of Britain\n... on another island on the island of Ireland um wherever Scotland isn't and I think that that could cause a lot more psychological problems an optical problems when you go back to London\nIsland um wherever Scotland isn't and I think that that could cause a lot more psychological problems an optical problems when you go back to London say hang on a minute you've you've cut a deal that basically the queen mine like which I Know sound ridiculous\nBut it's a big deal I I I think it's a big deal and it would certainly be a big deal may living in Scotland anyway that's my thoughts I don't necessarily think that will happen but yeah it could\nSimon constable as my Brexit watch he is in Edinburgh, Scotland which is why we were keen on how the Scots are viewing people live in Scotland are viewing the Brexit tussle is going on in London in Brussels\nOr we can count on the fact that the price of oil is going to help the Scottish environment it's also a very good idea to look at the price of oil these next month is not

the last year was that in addition to folks like the ministry of intelligence um they have been\nOn the one they have been the ones on the streets shooting at protesters arresting\nA thousands of them and playing a key role in stopping them hum the minister of interior also plays a role in uh approving permits or or in this case not approving permits for protests in print according to Iranian law you can't a protest without a permit but in practice\nIt's uh or or in this case not\nApproving permits for protests you know in print according to the Iranian law you can't a protest without a permit but in practice it's virtually impossible for any protesters or to get a permit because the regime does not want\nAnyone to demonstrate against them so the minister of interior or I think maintains this process they prevent people from protesting and when they try to prevent people from protesting and when those wheels are defied\nA A R y you know the regime response to force\nThe minister of justice his name is ... ... raised a vi he was appointed directly in twenty Seventeen by Rouhani on the recommendation of Lauren Johnny the judiciary achieve what do we need to know about how he presses the Iranian people say\nWell the minister of justice plays a key role in administering ah Iran's justice system though I think the term justice system is largely a misnomer um this is actually a system really aimed at enforcing\nThe will of the regime against its political opponents um this is a process in which trials can often last a few minutes or access to a lawyer as remains limited uh or or none at all um\nThis is basically a if the regime or if they're seen as unhappy with any particular person they can throw them in prison that will um torture is very common death sentences are ... are very common hum so this is a system that really um\nShould not be regarded with any real seriousness as ... as an independent a check\nOn the rest of the government um I Would also add that
