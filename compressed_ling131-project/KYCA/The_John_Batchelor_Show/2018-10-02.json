Mogadishu October free for Nineteen Ninety three twenty five years right about now the U.S pushed forces rangers other into a rescue effort in the area Mogadishu was collapsed to our understanding this is the George W. Bush administration\nLate in the minister racial or and then the Clinton Administration inherited it\nEnding this is the George W. Bush administration\nLate in the administration uh and\nThen the Clinton Administration inherited it so that's why in late Ninety three\nThe U.S is still involved with special forces and operations movie Black Hawk down is\nTelling a Hollywood telling the first battle Mogadishu bill row Joan Tom Johnson or here so we know that we've been fighting in and around Mogadishu for twenty five years at least twenty six twenty seven years abused stretch back to the early days of the U. S. landing in\nSomalia bill the Italian who's trucks in Mogadishu what is the expectation\nYes so in Italian a unit of as far as part of the European contingent in Somalia was hit in a in a district in Mogadishu with the Shabaab to suicide bombers to live as al ... as you know twenty five plus or to just about twenty five years later\nBut you know al ... continues to haunt us in the west\nIn Somalia and ... and al ... was involved in the black Hawk Down incident Mohammed ...\nWho ah he was killed in two thousand and one he was involved at nine or ... kind of military leader he was in Mogadishu\nUh with some other kind of trainers and they instructed\nThe tribesmen who were fighting the U.S during the black Hawk Down incident on how to hit the U.S helicopters to hit them in the ... the the Blackhawks and the the rotor the tail rotor and that's what brought them down and caused the you know the\nThe the may lay and that lasted two days in the city so you know we continue to fight al ... to this day I was\nTo Bob visits branch there as we noted earlier\nThey um they the Shabaab likes to use suicide attacks any use against everyone and anyone that it can ah it it had a a in a hospital in Somalia is one of the [noise]\nWe were the first I Believe there's been two or three American suicide bombers um that have conducted attacks and Somali that's where the first American suicide bomber enough that it's attacking and and I believe he hit a un compound the couple of years ago and killed and dozens of people\nAnd so the Italian operation was struck by the Shabaab are operation do we operate just quickly bill do we operate forces on the ground in Mogadishu absolutely\nThe U.S special forces a partner up with African Union and Somali forces and when we launch airstrikes often it's because we engage with Shabaab and there's heavy combat and airstrikes or tea bailout um our horses and\nFor ... and Somali forces and when we launch airstrikes often it's because we engage with Shabaab and there's heavy combat and airstrikes thirteenth bailout um our forces and to this sort of the partner forces there\nYeah the long war we think it's Afghanistan no Somalia twenty five years and counting Tom you know that Mogadishu the the Shabaab still mention a county when they when they were a member of their origins\nYeah you know still not really understood a John but one thing is we have to document all the time is the fact that Shabaab and other groups like them around the world have adopted the kind of program all the way through and this includes all sorts of\nDifferent operational I'm sort of a strategies and tactics right down to the ideology and sort of the playbook there for who they are going to reference as sort of key ideological figures and in their thinking and how they look at the world ... and accounting is certainly one of them\nUm you know Shabaab has reference to the economies and their propaganda and the Taliban as well a number of times and this is this is just not something we find to be uncommon with a lot of these groups and it's one of the one of the indicators that we look at the show how these groups are in fact all ... or part of all kinda\nWe'd go to advise the attack on a military parade many wounded many dead and last week when we discuss this there were videos provided by the attackers of the martyrs in the operation but it's in much dispute these last days by Tehran\nThat the attackers were ISIS a mock news agency put an announcement out part time you tell me their airstrikes launched by the Iranians in Syria that seem to be a coincidental\nWell the Iranians struck Islamic state targets in eastern Syria as a response for what happened in Nevada that the tacit admission by the Iranians that despite all the bluster they know that it was in fact the Islamic state the carried out the attack\nThe Iranians for their own reasons and their own interests are very keen to blame anything on the Saudis the Americans Israelis there's a whole laundry list of sort of factors that they try and point the finger at but the bottom line is that there's there was early on after this attack was already evidence that it\nWas the Islamic state not dispositive not foolproof but there were strong evidence that it was the Islamic state and that evidence I Would say in my judgment is gotten only stronger over time including with these airstrikes by the Iranians which as I said it's\nSort of a tacit admission that they think these long if they did but John in the last ... seconds go ahead and tell him he\nSaid even release a very special message from its spokesman touting the attack and advise and that's not the type of thing they do unless they really mean that they did it Tom jobs\nBill

... [noise]\nShaun Hannity ... so you have people now all over the place in this country they're putting politics first and that means in both the rule of law the constitution and the presumption of innocence and they're rushing to judgment you know literally convicting judge Kavanaugh one of the most serious crimes that anyone could ever\nFly about another person the insane in suggesting that he doesn't even have a right to be heard\nOr believed but how do you really feel\nSean's they don't want any of this information to come out now with a letter intended to\nUndermine the president's constitutional authority over the executive branch you've got the highest ranking Democrat Adam Schiff Nancy Pelosi Mark Warner Chuck Schumer saying don't listen to the president of the United\nThat increases the risk of miscalculation ... doesn't it\nWell it certainly does some because you've got a lot of very arrogant flag officers in China right now and they're really itching for a fight they've got all this new equipment they think they're bold they think that we're in terminal declined and hear all the rest of it\nPlus if you add in what John was referring to in the beginning you got to see June paying who basically made me thinks he's got a closing window of opportunity to deal with us\nBecause he's concerned about his ... his ... got to be concerned about other things this is a very good time to take the United states on so that's why you know people talk about a quote unquote decade of concern I think that it's or maybe a couple of years of concern and those couple of years Thaddeus there right now\nThe Chinese ministry of defense complained that dictator violated Chinese China's sovereignty\nConcern and those couple of years Thaddeus there right now\nThe Chinese ministry of defense complained that dictator violated Chinese saw China's sovereignty know Vietnam and die Taiwan also claim this proudly islands Gordon\nDoes they destroy our captain make a decision on his own to come this close to ... I mean all they can totally dominate the area or they're dealing with a super wash up and it's wired into our network so it's not alone out there to that\nDestroying a captain the P L A navy started kept and make the decision on the spot or we see under orders is he talking to Beijing when he does that\nYeah I I'd be really really really surprised if the Chinese captain was making decisions on his own because that's not the way the Chinese military works\nIn addition to all the chain of command issues because for instance our captain was not making decisions on his own but you know in China is much more tightly controlled you've got political officers at all levels in the military so these decisions were being made back in ... during a at extremely high level\nThat is I mean you mentioned in our camp grooms acting under orders to can you explain that\nYou know this is the freedom of navigation operation these are not planned by the commander of a ship these are plan not even at the level of seven fleet I think that we're talking about ... of the commander of the Indo Pacific region\nWhich would be Honolulu and probably even up further up the change to the chief of naval operations the top admiral\nAnd indeed I I wouldn't be surprised if the president himself were generally a prize of what the navy was going to do maybe not on a specific um pass by like this one but in general what the plan was\nSo clearly this politically sensitive on both sides and you're not going to have decisions being made at the lowest levels\nA detail guarding we're told within these last hours that Secretary Mattis you will not make a trip to China a it's a little unclear whether there was a trip planned and they called it off or whether they were planning and they just decided not to go forward\nDo you find any significance Gordon given Mr Mattis his last visit where there were a sharp words that the Chinese are no longer talking ...\nYeah well this is significant you know there were going to be a meeting um they hadn't may be specifically ... a ... a set the time but they were definitely going to have it because this was ...\nThis is significant you know there were going to be a meeting um they had maybe specifically ... a ... a set the time but they were definitely going to have it because this was part of an established dialogue\nAnd what happened is the Chinese said that um Secretary Mattis is counterpart was not going to be available so of course the Pentagon I'm\nNo called off that trip [noise]\nYou know this is one of those cases where you've you've got the Chinese throwing a temper tantrum is in their interest to have these mill Tamil exchanges and they're calling them off because they're upset about one thing or another and we're seeing this temper tantrum play out it's like you've got sucks in Beijing who are now acting like three year olds\nThat that is doing\nSo what is Madison now when the when the ... his counterpart isn't reliable or does he accepted a meeting does he know where does he say well you know it might not be available now myself\nI that's a great question Thaddeus and that decision is not going to be made by Mattis that's going to be made um maybe by the president in consultation with his senior White house staff\nUm you know clearly I think that the administration should say look you know we're not just not available for meetings with you until you guys decide to act responsibly that would be my response unfortunately that's not the way people in Washington think\nPeople in Washington thing that you've got to have engagement you got to have these contacts\nAnd so therefore they appeared desperate to the Chinese to have\nThese discussions these discussions don't produce anything except we produce a lot of carbon as we fly over to Beijing are they fly here for really no purpose at all the Chinese are not willing to talk they are not willing to act responsibly I just don't see the point of talking to them\nCoordinate question because you do a great deal of Congress to have a great deal conversations with major media figures and you travel\nHave we passed a point guard and where the relationship is broken how we how are we past that now are we are I Know we're very well informed this audience is very well informed China but I Can't tell whether they're still ceiling whether there's still some sense that we can repair that I Can't tell\nYou we can repair John but we shouldn't try to repair it because we appear to desperate in the past\nFor like you know what the you know the past where ongoing yeah I think\nThe Chinese right now are not willing to talk so I don't see this being repaired um because we're not going to make the effort that they're not going to make the effort and we have got to raise all sorts\nI think the Chinese right now are not willing to talk so I don't see this being repaired um because we're not going to make the effort that they're not going to make the effort [noise] we've got to raise all sorts of issues there objectionable conduct they're going to react badly to this\nSo I don't see that we're going to have good relations as people to find good\nFor a very long time I think the relations are going to be good because good is getting what you want good is standing up for your principles we haven't done that for very long time John and you know people can complain a lot about this president but he's doing the right thing with regard to China and we need to support him\nLater on this evening I Will have a conversation with captain Jerry

Washington has been consumed by the Russia investigation\nBut when you talk to Democrats about what their voters are concerned about and what are the party is concerned about what they're running on\nIt's not Russia and its its\nIssues and it's it's cultural issues and policy issues and so I'm not surprised that this has taken center stage way from the Russia Russia investigation that's always been sort of noise of the election the under current but it's never been what everybody else was talking about out in the country right or left\nFatty should have a question from prose ... some of those issues have been running and you guys for the Democrats are using John\nHealthcare ... in some areas immigration mainly the seizure of the children's supposedly the border and of course Trump Trump Trump Trump is the existential threat to our democracy\nTrump Trump Trump David a Trump is the message is that it\n[noise] well ah the John trying to hit on it they're running on health care but I have to say and this is the irony of ironies they're finally running on Obamacare in and they have traction on it it is not a liability anymore\nAnd they're running to preserve the elements of it but you know they tried running on all of the elements of it when Obama was president and when they had just passed it and then a couple of years after and it was always a big fat fail you now it's finally\nWorking for them or at very least it's not hurting them and in fact it's Republicans that are here and there on the defensive you know say no I'm not going to take away your pre existing conditions protections and and things like that\nSo it's health care and and then there are economic issues that are running on and and as John said put the brakes on Trump\nPuts it breaks on ... so John and and Thaddeus and David quickly we just have ten seconds no rush again in the voting booth John David know Russia gate\nMore than a hundred or no\nThat is and David quickly we just have ten seconds no Russia gate and the voting booth John David\nMore than under no no John more people will be voting in Moscow on the issue than in the United states\nTo Thaddeus know Russia gates [laughter] enough reason to hate them in their mind so I I ...

year\nUntil and then there was a blank there that they fill in with a particular date\nNow there are some smaller agencies this year that are working on a continuing resolution until December seventh but what is noteworthy is the defense department is not it has appropriated money starting today the department of Veterans Affairs has appropriated money starting today\nThe Labor Department the

with the Senate Veterans' Affairs committee\nAfter being sworn into office and so it was the first time he was before the committee since a report came out and ProPublica in August that said that essentially there are three men friends of President Trump a Perlmutter mark Sherman and Bruce Moskowitz all of these gentlemen\nAre influencing operations at the department of Veterans Affairs and the questions came primarily from Democrats Patty Murray and Mazie Hirono or about his relationship with these three men and we'll keys response to that was that he met with\n\n[noise]\nUsed a argument going straight laced with me this is joined by Andrew\nReview Online [noise]\nI'm Brett Kavanaugh adjusts Brett Kavanaugh's judicial\nThat is now become a debate because judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary committee within these last days defended himself from allegations that are completely over the top craze and yet because he was in temperate in defending his honor his family's life\nThat means he can't sit on the court goes the argument Andy I don't back it up with any facts because there are no but the idea of judicial temperament is late to the game what is it that the Democrats hope to achieve by throwing this down good evening to\nGood evening John well what they want to achieve with every single aspect of their strategy with respect to Kavanaugh\nIs delay so the more issues they can raise\nBut more things that need inquiry into the more witnesses that needs to be a deposed or interviewed\nThe more they can argue that this needs to be pushed back in time\nAnd the ultimate objective viewer of courses to push it back beyond the midterm elections in the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate take control of it and then be able to defeat Kevin all on the numbers\nSo the judicial temperament argument is just noise that it it doesn't come does it actually just eh or did they just make this stuff\nWell they didn't make it up I mean they're they're reacting to Kavanaugh's a very uh ... indignant at times passionate spirited defense of himself and his honor which is not only been smeared\nDragged through the mud but\nI I I Believe if you um if you look at what some of the things that have been set about cabinet I mean they actually called him a serial rapist on absolutely zero\nIf you look at what some of the things that have been set about cabinet I mean they've actually called him a serial rapist on absolutely zero evidence\nThe ... even as stick in the case against him is collapsing for want of any corroboration or verification these outlandish uh and and it really smearing\nA awful things that they've set about him continue to ring in the air so he reacted to that as any normal person would react to it or they regard that as an temper it I thought it was actually quite temporary under the circumstances I mean I guess uh\nYou know Aristotle would would remind us that we have temper for a reason right so the question is what is it for and if it's not for occasions like that I don't know what it's for\nThat is also plays a part in our ... seems to bring into the arguments about [laughter]\nBut he drinks too much discarded any corroborating evidence ... okay [laughter] this is part of it or are these are ... are looking for things now in addition to ... temperament anything like an anger hat on to extend their car to swear Republican broke\nYeah I think that's exactly right of course I'd like to to sway Republican votes and they've seen in the case of a Jeff Flake who collapsed after say he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nOr it turned into a vote with the caviar to delay when he was accosted in an elevator by would turn out to be to a hard left

that's less likely than the strategy of delay which Republicans unfortunately of bought into\nHow does the allegation of had drinking in college work for judicial temperament or is this completely

rapist or one of the arguments they want to make is that they think that his\nDenials of this are very a credible and passionate but perhaps he had a drinking problem and committed rapes that he forgot I suppose or the idea being that is a you know his his mind may not have been in it but it is but his body was it's\nIt's absurd but you know anything that might get traction will be tried it
