point five FM K why CIA [noise] sexual or show\n\nI'm John ... so this is the John bachelor show Steve Cohen is here and he's triggered my imagination here talking about how intelligence services can drive the story and people can take advantage of intelligence\nServices interpretations he's given to good examples of the possibilities of the great ball at mystery and the mystery and it's done ball of the missing journalists perhaps a very likely dead journalists\nHe's given to good examples of the possibilities of the screen Paul and\nMystery and the mystery in Istanbul all of the missing journalist perhaps a very likely dead journalists I'm going to mention operation and Ryan\nThat was launched under on drop off this is in the early Nineteen eighties after the death of ... Ryan ... is an acronym for the Russians expecting the U.S to launch a first strike of nuclear weapons\nAnd drop off ordered the KGB to search everywhere for signs that the Americans and their allies were preparing for the end of the world and what were they looking for the ...\nAnd a large attendance at church or the leader of both countries buying lots of food at the supermarket they were also examining the parking lot at the Pentagon to see if it was unusually empty are full\nAt sign that the attackers ... now and drop off was dying at the time and was quite paranoid as the KGB tends to be but\nThat was the moment TV will remember\nThat we're dealing with a series of events that were very very dangerous operation able archer that the Soviets interpreted as a preparation for an attack on the Soviet Union the shoot down of kale almost double o seven by a Soviet pilot thinking was defending the country\nDo while the intelligence services were manipulating whatever they could to please and drop off who wanted signs of the imminent attack by Ronald Reagan\nThere were instances that could push us into war I raised that the because you can never be sure when you see these\nOperations rogue operation that they're not part of a larger plot to crash the countries together or to gain an advantage by politicians or ambition you're never sure even Thirty years later you're not sure\nThat lack of certainty on the part of people such as you and myself who try to do analysis of this news as a unfold\nAs part of the difficulty because intelligence services do not give us objective information they conceal it sometimes they provide disinformation to lead us astray\nAnd that's one reason I think John since Russia gate began in particular and in the aftermath of the ... case in London to why analysis\nHas been so degraded in leading America newspapers that they're operating on the basis of information I put that word in code that has been put into the public why\nIn leading American newspapers that they're operating on the basis of information I put that word and quote that has been put it in a public by\nIntelligence services now I don't want to stretch your point here but let's go to the resignation of Nikki Haley as UN ambassador it'd be a ... it's interesting ah\nShe resigned\nAs of December and there was a virtual\nLove and at the White House she went to the oval office she in Trump publicly\nLoved each other it\nWas very smiley he was so glad she had served but interestingly he didn't look very unhappy she was leaving and I think we ought to ask ourselves because the Media Analysis of this has been that\nShe was an easy with Trump She has hope for a major political career\nPerhaps running for the presidency eventually\nAnd it was ... she leaves were glory but I don't think that's an accurate analysis because during the time she was there\nAnd we've discussed some examples on your broadcast she has\nSaid things about Russia and also by the way about North Korea\nCompletely conflicting what's what Trump himself has said this is very unusual because they're United or you are you in a bachelor normally very faithfully reflects the will of the president you would agree with that yet\nAnd yet why Trump is saying that it would be great to cooperate with Russia She has literally sat at the un repeatedly that Russia can never be trusted\nThat's a very silly thing for an American officials say because it would imply that we should invalidate all the nuclear weapon limitation\nAnd safeguard treaties we've made with the Soviet Union in Russia over the years so it seems to me that this may be over analyzed thirty second tape and law and order statement that her statement at\nWere not written by the White House and certainly not by Trump there certainly were written 'cause she was always reading but here you see her\nAmplify essentially intelligence agencies allegations against Russia so her departure is probably a victory for Trump against the opponents of this\nAllegations against Russia so departure he's probably a victory for Trump against the opponents of his ... let's talk about the life partner you want me to come back professor Steven Cohen New York university were caught up with the Cold War we can't help ourselves I'm John bachelor [noise]\n\nShaun Hannity show\nThey're either going to step up and take ownership of getting this economy in the water they've asked for the house they got it stands for the Senate and the house they got they got the White House although half of them can't stand the president which is pathetic on their part\nJust tell me what part of his agenda you don't like I'd like to know what part of it is and conservative what part of it isn't good but if I think seven brackets to three is good for the American people got Hannity we did one here on the news\n... ca I didn't want to talk she just said was that was\nReally needed to get that and of course we went to different cities one day he called me out of the blue and it's comforting to know that I always picking on them to have my back in time for a while\nFor the United states to be running a joint air war game on Russia's borders over Ukraine of all places\nOf Ukraine the shore is most uh indigenous conflict that we have with Russia you have to ask\nWhat's Trump told about this did they go to Trump and say we're going to do this exercise it is really going to vary ate the Russians are but we're going to do this because Ukraine needs to practice it's doesn't planes that we gave them\nDid Trump authorize it did he even know about it I mean I think we've gotten to that point\nWhere we can ask the question now people will say that conspiracy thinking but I ... to history we know pretty well\nGotten to that point where we can ask the question now people will say vast conspiracy thinking but I revert to history we know pretty well that the CIA aborted Eisenhower's summit meeting with posttraumatic Nineteen sixty with the EU to flight so there's precedent for\nThis and how we know and drop off as ... as premier of the Soviet Union took the U.S and the Soviet Union to the brink of launching missiles Dave that's where they were in late eighty three and drop off died in early ... and early eighty four and that's when Gorbachev becomes premier in\nLike not just talking about that though everything you say is true you got your dates a little off but it doesn't matter the periods correct it\nSeems to have been that close call\nAble archer or the perception on Reagan's part he was then president that he was very hard line rhetoric Cold War rather wreck actually could lead to a nuclear war he never thought that was possible Reagan hated the idea of nuclear war and that's what began to turn Reagan\nAs he would later say\nTo wait for a Soviet leader ready to do big time any Cold War they taught with him\nReagan later complained when he asked why it took so long and he's right Soviet leaders kept dying on him because after ... have died in eighty to ... a ... of who you've talked about becomes leader\nAnd died in eighty five I had the uh with all the year thank you Steve he bought\nOff of the point is and drop of already was suffering\nKidney failure writer he was on dialysis\nI Know about dialysis my mother had kidney failure it's three days a week on dialysis you can't be a leader on dialysis that's probably why the other Soviet leader who wanted him they knew he couldn't become a strong leader and then he was succeeded by a leader Chang is jarring already of emphysema\nRight and then when Margaret Thatcher ... when Margaret Thatcher met him at end drop a funeral there's just an anecdote I Love she dressed all in black this is Al Gore day after the surging he's had to act very sober\nAnd respectful and you'll get something she ... she said my goodness I haven't got anybody who's out of a coughing and CIA named going that guilt he was that ill in February of sixty four eighty four when she met him\nThan that he was literally living in a hospital during his business\nTurning that guilt he was that ill in February of sixty four eighty four when she met him\nMore than that he was literally living in a hospital during his business as the new general secretary I think he lasted Thirteen months I mean we're we we divert from the story but it's worth reminding ourselves that at that moment I studied this very carefully that\nIn the early eighties after the death of Russian of in Nineteen eighty two right the Soviet leadership did not want a strong leader\nThey were becoming geriatric they didn't want a vigorous leader who would replace them so they kept choosing literally dying man and Gorbachev at fifty three enrolled last\nOne of them said and what it was clear that they couldn't stop Gorbachev he is criminally\nYoung criminal you're young they were already approaching eighty so we divert from the story of that but it raises the it also points to another moment when intelligence agencies can have exceedingly important political influence of the top\nAnd that is when there's opposition to the leader and the leader is weak weak physically or I Would submit to you\nWe politically as Trump is today because as crowded suspicion hangs over him and also because he hasn't quite gotten the hang of how to exercise power in Washington but there are\nLarge openings for quote rogue\nOperations by intelligence today and I think we're seeing that\nAnd even when I Want to do some dates here because I Want to mention the coach cough of Going Rogue operation of Ninety One a draw a brush up to us in eighty two\nUh and drop off guys in February of eighty four changin' co and laugh 'til the spring of eighty five when Gorbachev takes over but Gorbachev has to deal with ... head of the KGB until eighty eight and then crutch cough who was first chief directorate these are the master\nParanoid agents of the country much more powerful when you have a weak leader at the head of the uh the Soviet\nAnd its perch cough who launches the coup\nAgainst against Gorbachev so it's not a conspiracy mongering Steve we're just reporting the facts of the first Cold War and since I Can't find any difference between the first Cold War and the second Cold War right now and admittedly I'm soaked in bend mcentire and guard\nActs of the first Cold War and since I Can't find any difference between the first Cold War and the second Gulf War right now and admittedly I'm soaked in bend mcentire and guard of ... still perhaps I'll lighten up a ...\nI Can't remove the possibility that those same intelligence services FSB there and CIA here or FBI or am I five or am I said\nAre not ambitions in a similar fashion if they think the country has lost the argument\nAnd that raises the question for the rest of us\nI don't know that we can say that intelligence services\nIn Russia in the u._k. in the United states and Saudi Arabia elsewhere are playing a bigger role than they ever played in history before I Would say that I don't know enough but I Would say that they're it's clear you and I now agree that they are playing a very big role today\nThey are not a constitutional branch of our government so therefore it raises the question how do we feel about this\nShould something be done about this remember I I think you'll remember but I'll bet you are not many listeners remember that in Nineteen Seventy five in the Senate there was the famous bipartisan church committee investigation\nInto the CIA operations I published a five or six fire and report in Nineteen Seventy six it was fully bipartisan that is in the mid seventies concern about what the CIA was doing I become so worried\nThat the two political parties including conservative Republicans did a major investigation and it was a sensation at the time\nAnd it was documented that the CIA was running rogue operations they we're assassinating people they were tapping our telephones at home and reforms were in fact the so called Short Creek forms and Seventy five and Seventy six men to prevent this from ever happening again they didn't work\nAnd probably we need a new church committee but we will never get one today because of Russia gate and because of the Democrats would never joined the Republicans it has to be bipartisan in the Senate but we're dealing with\nA political reality that's been part of our lives for decades and now is being framed by these new Iran is a that's an and I want it before\nKnow what are they gonna hide it and I
