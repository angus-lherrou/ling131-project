one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three summer\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassing and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nSoftness with which they're handling\nAt the end when it shows up they show up prepared for battle they're not counter demonstrators they're not counterprotesters they are an insurgency group an anarchist group and the police need to be more sort of early\nPrepared for battle they're not counter demonstrators they are not counter protesters they are and insurgency group an anarchist group and a police state to be more sort of early on to keep the peace\nTo defend like to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on and wants to crap hits the fan so to speak or then it's too late so\nI think a different strategy of more of a sort of strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states is necessary because we are at the stage now and I I've been seeing this for two or three months using the term political violence and people on the lips cough and they laughed and said it was hyperbole no it's not now it's on\nAnd is I'm a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago and it and to flip did the same damn thing they showed up prepared for battle they start fights they like conflict and like I said a the police are there to\nKeep the peace not let this stuff happened not been but don't break those are failed strategies and until they make it clear\nWith a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protest because this is not protest and I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentators I'm not talking about you but there are commentators\nAre on the right who continued to refer to it and it's a fun and some of this other political violence is when they're shouting down or an intimidating people in the restaurant they keep calling in protest it's not protests is insurgency answer for calls for the\nKilling of police officers they call for the down fall of the United states lawfully Institute of government\nWell and I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's it's intimidation uh it's it's a type of\nA political extortion too when they do it to the senators and and the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why is this even allowed in the halls of the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to to get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them\nIn the in the in the halls of the uh the capital and that should be allowed\nRight and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write\nYou know senators and another congressman congresswoman too you know keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the Patriot prayer group or in Portland, Oregon\nKeep their decorum but then some of this is happening to a private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot prayer group or in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to that we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does it look like and I can tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view\nTaking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness in like you said Laurie you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to intimidate and incite fear in people to get them to alter their their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling this\nPolitical violence it's gone on for too long it's gone on too far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is good I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the\nThe anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those soft masters just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and they ... I Would like to think that we didn't learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes in law enforce\nI agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border or so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Don in Brazil on ABC's This week and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and others\nThat about mob about people who do not want the health care about women who want to be heard and listen to when they feel that it's time to talk about their prom like sexual assault not about mob\nThat you're running it maybe that would be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV you're talking about is talking about in painting Brett Kavanaugh talking about in painting Donald Trump I and the reason is taking the deal I agree with Rick Silva mob\nI eerie action to that\nLast statement done in Brazil you know I met them Brazil\nOr not too long and we had a great conversation and she told me the true she said the stuff happening on the left is wrong she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it out when I hear of people like her and I hear others not denounced the violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage\nShe saw the backlash when she came out with a book that really took the or the DNC the Democratic party to task and she saw the ... back in ... she but it is\nShe saw the backlash when she came out with her book that really took the uh the DNC and the Democratic party to test and she saw the felt the blowback realize she bit of scurry back on the plantation and that's what she did it at the end of her or a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate\nYou're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate means exhibit leadership we call this crap all for what it is to tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know or their tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do say anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not she's trying to\nTo frame of narrative and a ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when the when they tried to uh when they're forced I should say that say that answer for that some of these other goons this I'm a feminist moment when they're pulling their crap\nYou know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence give tacit approval to this political violence\nOr and sheriff Clarke before we let you go or the Democrats Stacey Abrams in other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented\nUm people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claimed to represent a and now we have this\nIs mad a crash about to happen again on the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with a with children\nBy this is dangerous to continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on their stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody or citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and want citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges that are in the constitution\nOr belong to the United states citizen it's not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing\nThe the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nAnd again on this Congress must work with the president both on the wall\nAnd of course allowing for immediate turned back at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening and it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America and to this country I completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but\nThing and it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America and to this country I completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there no one's in there and no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment of truth that really is\nA terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration or illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out\nThis elite this broken or immigration system to\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else so that people are proposing follows sealing the border because if you don't steal the border\nWe just saw last week was a guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen a beating has been deported six times Laura six we've heard stories of people who've been caught that have been deported\nThirty times that's not a made up number but the ... the borders is so poor or easily or they can easily get back and so now it's a matter of\nUm you know the eleventh hour and and I don't know we're going to maintain the house I I Hope when I say we the geo pretty I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to beat bill they're not going to fix this immigration system they're going to give citizenship\nOr to some measure of illegal aliens amnesty I'm Talking about and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that the Senate that will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and I'll squandered two years for heaven's sakes with a very\nA strong\nPresident ... arms of sealing the border and immigration a broken immigration system they squandered it so this is what we're left with\nAh the website is Americas

Afghanistan Somalia\nThis segment on the national security report is brought to you by scholars scholars a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scala dot com today to modernize your digital experience\nTo the report on Somalia is dire\nThe U.S has a hand in air strikes and you add long war journal keep a map of the airstrikes and the frequency of airstrikes throughout the coast of Somalia as cheaply in the south\nYou ever reported this past week the Shabaab is executing spies what do you do you measure the strength of Shabaab at this point and can you compare it to the Taliban\nWell you know that like like a tall bunch Shabaab is principally insurgency organization which is seeking to take over Somalia and parts of East Africa\nTo build their own ... their own Islamic state in East Africa and they're doing this under the banner of all kinds of the Shabaab is part of a guide and has been part of all kind of force for very long time\nUm and so well kind of looks at this as the Shabaab is is designated as the organization or it's representative in East Africa to try and build them Islamic emirate there in the U.S is propping up the nascent federal government in Somalia which has a lot of problems and it's sort of very\nMuch an upstart effort is trying to prop up that that government has sort of a bulwark against Shabaab\nUnfortunately Shabaab still controls or contests a large portion of Somalia just as a tall blond does in Afghanistan\nAnd should Bob's roots are very much a local they have a lot of local strength for a lot of tribal relations and other parties that are sort of bought into Shabaab scheme in some areas in Somalia where Shabaab provides better governance on a daily basis um even though it's jihadi governance\nThan the actual government does and this is a big problem because what they're doing is they're trying to actually build this state\nSlowly and so the U.S has expanded its air campaign against select individuals in Somalia the train weaken should Bob's hierarchy and try and take out certain operational commanders who were thought to be especially problematic so over the last\nSince really early to thousands Seventeen there's been an uptick that my colleagues at lower journal have been tracking in a number of American airstrikes in Somalia\nThought to be especially problematic so over the last\nSince really early to thousands Seventeen there's been an uptick that my colleagues that long were journal have been tracking in the number of American airstrikes in Somalia against these sort of a well defined targets\nUm and you know these are the some of these airstrikes are course controversial and some of them are not really all that effective but um but there's the scare campaign has been going on for some months now and has intensified for some months and it's still ongoing\nThe report you file is the execution of spies one of whom is linked to the U.S Abdulazeez Abdul ... shake costs on another link to am I fix\nA that a Wally ... Muhammad this begins to feel like the Cold War the ethics and the CIA recruiting men who have been executed by Shabaab\nYeah well actually Shabaab executed these guys who were ... they were allegedly recruited by the U.S\nBritish Intelligence and smiling intelligence to spy on Shabaab or to cause problems for Shabaab\nAnd Shabaab like other all kinds of branches does this fairly regularly they have a campaign to take out certain alleged spies to try and show that they are you know have infiltrated the ranks in that there's going to be accountability for that now what they're trying to do is tie this back to both the air campaign uh that we just we are talking about with the U.S has been watching these drone strikes against targets\nBut also to the Islamic State's president so\nThis is an Shabaab Shabaab of course opposes the Islamic state just dissolve all kind of does and in Somalia the Islamic state has an upstart presidents that trying to basically carve out a niche from within Shabaab to try and challenged about first authority\nDoes far Shabaab is is the far stronger ... I don't think that's going to change anytime soon Islamic state presence is much smaller but Shabaab is part of its information campaign to try and undermined the Islamic state is accusing some of these spies including one in particular who allegedly worked for him my six\nOf taking money from the Brits and giving it to the Islamic state in Somalia to try and basically a build up the Islamic State's presidents and sort of strengthening at your Bob's expense I think that's probably more propaganda or information warfare and their part they're trying to undermine the Islamic State's legitimacy but you know the details all get very murky very quickly\nUm we just have a minute and to your knowledge is the un seeking to negotiate with Shabaab the way that goes with the Afghanistan Taliban\nYou know John that's a great point you know the top on what's happened with these negotiates with the U.S us the same as the tall blondes Islamic emirate is somewhat legitimate in Afghanistan and of course the top honor Maine's cool see out while I was kind of the day on the other hand Shabaab which is ...\nUs us as saying that the tall bonds Islamic emirate is somewhat legitimate in Afghanistan and of course the ... while I was kind of the day on the other hand Shabaab which is part of al ... is trying to build its Islamic emirate and of course the U.S not negotiating with\nThat and so we have two countries going in the same direction under al ... has a ... and the U.S is negotiating with one part about ... linked but not negotiating with the other part yet yeah we can't rule it out in the future talk [noise]\nYeah I mean nothing can be ruled out at this point I doubt Shabaab would ever agree to any sort of overt negotiations with the American side um because America doesn't have the substantial foreign right there in ... that it doesn't have gas\nJust like who keeps the long war journal he's a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy\nThis segment national security report brought to you by scholars scholars a leading marketing technology company powered millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visits gala dot com today to modernize your digital experience I'm John bachelor\nRush Limbaugh show more than fifty percent of the public ... all ready\nBelieves that the Trump campaign was illegally spied on hands me or through the confluence of the Clinton campaign the Obama administration the FBI it means the drive by Harvey they means they're not able to come around what has really on on the\nWeekend or during the media have gotten the message and\nNow we're learning we instinctively know\nThan the less corrupt him freezing their options\nSpecially their control [noise]\nAre are no longer the by words today we're closing the economy down over there they're going back to state dominated markets and state determination of prices\nSo you know at this particular time um this looks really bad because it shows that um this is the way that season ... thinks it's going to me that they might be able to do a little bit of short term getting through it by determining markets but they can't really have a long term solution here\nAnd you know you're absolutely right this is I think the inevitable result of communism see jumping is not an aberration he's the inevitable result of China's Communist system\nI'm going to use the chest metaphor I Am not a good chess player but I certainly know how to use the metaphor Gordon or whenever the night moves on a board I've learned pay attention\nThe night is the hard to predict very dangerous piece when on the attack I read a report from Washington a pie by making the rare second trip this year to Vietnam defense secretary Jim Mattis is signaling how intensively\nThe Trump Administration is trying to counter China's military assertiveness by cozying up to smaller nations in the region that share American wariness about Chinese intention Madison is the night\nQueen ...

are not the countries\nThat if you had an institutional memory because you wrote through the tidal waves for the blue and two thousand and six and you also saw what\nA block Obama as a candidate didn't two thousand innate how do you read how do you interpret this way it's one poll I understand that it's moving story but how do you interpret this\nThis unusual facts at the battleground districts the Republicans do well in\nMuch better now than it was back in those six in a way\nIs that unusual ... said the battleground districts the Republicans do well in\nMuch better now than it was back in those six in the late as ... can tell you that made it exceedingly difficult for the Republican majority in two thousand six and for Republicans in general in two thousand acres you'd already lost the majority in\nIn the prior election uh my question for Mr fund is you're talking about the house what about the Senate\n[noise] well the Senate is very interesting because there's poll movement in places you didn't expect\nA there's a new poll out a conducted by a democratic for the chose the Minnesota special election for the Senate to be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey and there's a very hard hitting ad out attacking senator Menendez the Democratic incumbent for\nSex with teenage prostitutes are quoting FBI ... reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected and if I had if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats\nAnd gain that clear advantage and confirming more judges including a possible in other Supreme Court appointment next year\nMission fund the Democrats were doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that on an ad for the last two weeks and yet these other issues that come up a it's a puzzle to me\nIs this a lack of discipline or is this because in two thousand and fix the Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find her\n\nWell remember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognized she's liability on the campaign trail\nThat is they may realize as you well know job when they get there and they start getting shall we say acclimated to their caucus those votes can change can't they\nWell yes but what if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or two hundred and Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know Thaddeus it has been since Nineteen fifty two that we had the congressional majority that was less than five seats\nAre from two hundred and Eighteen we've never before in our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen a majority of the entire house\nIn our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen and majority of the entire house\nI watched only clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the correspondent but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little\nThe president is acting very presidential these days he's quite he's quite clear about its accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there's nothing hesitant about 'em at all is that is that showing in the polls job\nWell actually Leslie stall who conducted the interview said I've interviewed the pros and the three times as candidate as president elect and I was president the the change in his level of self confidence and assertiveness is dramatic\nOr she says he's he seems to have grown into the job in the country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable and and\nI didn't see a president shooting from the hip I saw a man who who was prepared for the issues you know how he makes a little pyramid out of its fingers you and he's confident that the man I saw in that in that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party Thaddeus\nMeant just gotta compliment Mr phone does two greatest thing I've heard tonight the country may not be comfortable with him as comfortable in the job [laughter]\nWhat do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the the messaging the tide messaging of the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of the Republicans\n[noise] no but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes he's just going to remind voters over and over again that\nEven though they may have difficulty with him look at the other guys and by the way given you know Elizabeth Warren and given Hillary Clinton and given ... Kavanaugh and given Michael ... you know the other team doesn't exactly look like professional paragon of governing virtue\nI Know John if if I was struggling with comparable actors on the Republican side I think I'd change the subject my goodness what a mo law ... especially mentioning ... who's now a who's now a\nCurse if he raise money for you everywhere he goes good heavens John Fund he's in Budapest, Hungary\nThe Democrat political science says gain a house that's going to happen or is it\nThat is McCotter W.

behavior that don't Miss America is only radio ... lifestyle and pet psychology show\nJoined me for the pet shows Saturday the two pm on press gets news and talk leader ... the news fourteen Ninety\nDo you worry about how much someone else drinks do you ever ride in a car with a driver who has been drinking do you think if the drink or stop drinking your other problems would be solved\nWhile it is ... all of these things are open and what's most important John is that everything is interrelated you cannot separate anymore any one of these\nIssues what we see Iran and Russia now reaching a deal to circumvent us sanctions according to a number of reports that they'll supply crude oil Iran to to Russia through the Caspian and then it would be exported worldwide\nWe've seen reports that I'm Indian vessels were taking on Iranian oil than going to to ... to Kuwait filling up and then selling it as if it is a is Kuwaiti oil\nAnd the agreement with the Russians were supposedly reach last month when President Clinton and Iranian President Rowhani met in Tehran\nAnd the the the other sanctions the other um at this exposure about\nA potent and an Iranian President Rowhani met in Tehran and the the the other sanctions the other um at this exposure about efforts by Iran to ah to impose sanctions to to avoid the sanctions in the administration warned worlds banks\nThat they may try to use these duplicitous means to minimize the sanctions in panic and continue to fund terrorism and there's\nScience that the the flow of oil seems to be according to new data from September that the oil industry is still quite robust and and it means that they're using a subterfuge and and other means like the example of India um\nTo uh to bypass or to cover their uh their exports so sanctions banning transactions with the Iran central bank the ship and comes to oil companies are all scheduled to take effect on November fifth so it could be that they're trying to rush to these things these as much as they can export\nUh now but it is certainly indicative of the weakness of the Iranian economy we know the teachers went on strike today we know that the price of milk has has gone up sharply and other goods that cannot tomato paste\nSold for sixty thousand ... in March is now a hundred and eighty thousand or ... and the reality self that currency as a has fallen so dramatically I think it's a hundred and forty six thousand to the dollar now\nAnd the projection is that the Iranian economy will shrink by one point five percent or this year and maybe almost four percent in twenty Nineteen\nSo Iran is under a lot of pressure that the sanctions will work the new sanctions could be very significant in the U.S has to find ways to close these loopholes\nThat in American looking guys are recent reports soon the Gazans believe in the ... the bigger problem than her boss\n... exactly right I think Palestinians overall a blamed the PA by a bigger percentage than than a blamed the um\nAh the Hamas for\nFor what is happening in it and and it's reflected his lack of confidence and it shows that in the election or change is not going to bring about any ah any dramatic or a difference\nSo we were seeing the um uh the the numbers that ... that came out that are more than ... almost fifty percent almost half\nA do not trust the PA they don't trust ...\nThe the numbers that would that came out that the more than ... almost fifty percent almost half\nA do not trust the PA they don't trust come us necessarily but they certainly don't trust the Palestinian authority and this is a you know a very significant figure when you're looking at what are the prospects\nFor a changing things in in the M M and the guy in God's at for instance because if forty three percent of Palestinians say the ... are responsible for the bad situation and only a quarter blamed a Hamas\nAnd that and that's why they don't want to demonstrate against Hamas 'cause they don't like the alternative\nAnd they don't want the ... to take over and and especially don't like it measures against its own citizens the fact that was another study that's coming out that shows a tremendous number of arrests by the Palestinian authority figures against those who oppose it in the west bank\nSo they they seem to accept Hamas control of Gaza\nIn Europe outcome I have learned because you've taught me\nThe Europeans have a profoundly different understanding of anti Semitism than we do here in the United states I don't know where it started but I Do know it's here today\nAnd Israel has always struggled against that anti Semitic tone in all of the major France Germany Great Britain\nOr Italy we struggled with it by you indicate there is there a change is there an enlightenment in Europe are they pulling back from their exploitation of ah the the tragedy of the twentieth century\n[noise] ah it's it's a good question but I I think it goes too far to think that the that they pulled back what we're seeing according to this latest survey that the Israeli foreign minister did in in major European countries\nShow a clear rise in support and this is the first time in memory for me that um there's been a turnaround in in Germany in Spain and Portugal\nIn Romania where a him or maybe the support for Israel grew to fifty six percent in Portugal or it went to the forty eight percent and and uh versus thirty percent who are not supportive in Spain it was forty percent in Britain it went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd this you know in the core of an area to area and everything else and with all the negative media and and\nIn Britain it went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd this you know in the corporate ... era and everything else and with all the negative media and and measures that were adopted into campaigns in Europe against Israel to see this turnaround I think it's it's really remarkable and I will tell you some it is not something I Would have been dissipated\nAnd the fact that in all these major ... countries in Europe or sympathy for Israel is increasing maybe it's a greater understanding of the um of Israel's unique position maybe it's because today the middle east includes or did they see what's going on in Syria they see what's going on in these other countries that have come\nTo realize that you have one source of stability and um you will have to see whether this is borne out over time but it's certainly a a surprising about we\nHave a minute Thaddeus go ahead you know must remember that the people of Europe are different than the elite that would deem to govern more American\nThan it is true in the countries like Britain and forget where it starts top down France tendency is to be bottom up but I think you're quite right that that that is a distinction and and still the numbers are not as positive as they should be\nAnd we see the campaigns continuing but this split Gillette fried split that is exacerbating things may are also tend to benefit the understanding of Israel\nJeremy Corbyn not withstanding correct about that would be a tragedy\nVery much a tragedy and and that very fact that that he continues in in the current path in Britain is very disturbing may be part of this is a reaction to that\nYes our cousin in London you're aware of the fact that Jeremy carbon as

we don't understand what where they come from or we don't worry about the fact that they couldn't be taken from us now there is a word rights that is very attractive the French Revolution used at the

American revolution for the French Revolution what did he make up these claims have rights in the French Revolution and elsewhere Peter\nUh he was appalled by their claims deprive bought this fight needs to be emphasized not because he was opposed to the what he called the real rights have been because he was opposed to the fake ones what were the fake one\nBroad abstract claim on tethered to any historical experience\nWith supposedly gave individuals' authority to protest\nTo overturn any institution that to please them\nTo this for objective profoundly but he said the ... of the real

um destroying all of inherited political society\nLet's connected to the twenty first century now Peter\nBecause you also have a recommendation of what needs to be done our college campuses are political parties and the television presentation of a most recent very unhappy advise and consent in the U.S Senate Judiciary panel\nHave descended into these abstract false claims of rights that are pending is and we have\nPeople telling us what we cannot say we have people chastising as for who we are for well how were born\nWe have people right now so fearful that they whisper as if they were

have to say at this point acting either pursued or under under assault there it's as simple Washington's under siege what can be done how do we how do we reach start liberalism and at least in the conversation for the young people Peter\nWell the answer is no way a simple\nBut it also sometimes a formidable challenge all the conduct that you've been describing John ah is flows almost directly from the kinds of at the kind of education\nThat uh we have been delivering to our students for more than two generations now it's it's an education that stripped from the curriculum including the curriculum of higher education any serious study of the American political tradition any serious study of\nThe principles of free speech and limited government any serious study of due process and and religious liberty it's an education that treats the American tradition as an almost I'm\nOn the scene saga of discrimination against people on the basis of race or sex or class\nAt its in other words it's an almost ... he's in\nIt that it's a false suffocation in that\nIt takes ugly aspects that indeed are part of our tradition and presented as the whole truth\nAnd it excludes the glories the achievements of the modern tradition of freedom so that's a long winded answer the shortage at ... uh the short answer is that we must undertake a dramatic reform of our educational system so that once again\nWe'll produce students who leave our schools informed about the American political tradition its strengths and weaknesses it's cost\nAnd benefits are and who understand the blessings they can they will receive by maintaining a the institutions of a free society\nAnd embrace liberalism not serious version called liberals liberalism the idea that you don't you don't\nRoutine you don't
