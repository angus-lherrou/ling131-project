southern Afghanistan for the U.S and its allies see somebody who has his own checkered history of courses as is the case often drought Afghans\nSort of warlord or or powerbroker in southern Afghanistan for the U.S and its allies you somebody who has his own checkered history of courses\nAs is the case and often throughout Afghanistan um what he's somebody who was ... he was somebody who kept the ... that that bay and they tried to kill him dozens of times John dozens of times they tried to get this guy they finally got him with a simple trader attack\nAnd I think it's very important to know that the way the U.S responded to this as much about state of the war effort because the U.S and NATO I'm off are just really are just absolutely I think absurd descriptions of what happened here in the in the earliest reports they call this an Afghan on Afghan incident\nYou know John just think about it on the on the top the front end of that it wasn't just an Afghan this was a Taliban infiltrators ... quickly claimed credit for it and he subsequently been celebrating this for days now they actually released a video of the assassin being trained in a toll on camps preparing for this operation this is clearly a tall blond hair\nAnd on the other side it wasn't just that the the killed Afghans he also killed not only the number one most important power broker for the U.S in southern Afghanistan are Afghan ally and also the intelligence in the ... national director of security for Afghanistan and can are\nThey just told us right away that we're going to ask how do you are going to change you and every single one of his medical bill is just all taken care of them\nThey've saved my family's from financial ruin it allowed me and my wife both the focus on most important thing which

John ... show Tom shot some of the foundation for the democracy is here to connect some die\nOut ... dots this segment of the national security report brought to you by scholar scholar a leading marketing technology company towers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visits gala dot com today to modernize your digital experience Tom\nYou have a report about two members about tied in the Arabian Peninsula and now with a wanted poster\nTen million dollars or war for ... and up to five million dollars ... colleague I'll buy tower the where did that come from top\nOh John this is a good example of what we talk about talk about these kind of veterans who who can just sort of keep operating for many many years and stay\nIn the game despite being relentlessly hounded by the U.S our allies because ... and ... are both kind of veterans from\nTraining camps pre nine eleven in Afghanistan so these are both these guys are attended all for which was all ... primary training facility and pre nine eleven Afghanistan and so their journeys through jihad search all the way back then and ... actually was again a fight very early on by al ...\nSpring training facility in pre nine eleven Afghanistan\nAnd so their journeys through jihad search all the way back then and ... actually it was again if I very early on by all ... as a guy who should be groomed for leadership position he somebody who they they rarely on thought you know sort of had that potential and lo and behold today these are two of the most senior guys\nIn um Yemen they've now leading okay there may be put in so now\nYou know a lot of times you hear people talk about a ... pie that's OK and re impotence or as if it's an affiliate of al ... well we've said all along is no it's not really in a ... it's just all kinda because guys like this are groomed kind of veterans who have been putting these positions Toledo kind of global so they probably are sentiment is\nThey probably play a role in actually all kinds of global management team making decisions around the globe now\nA creepy of course came to fame because of the um attacks that they tried to plant against the United states\nGoing Christmas Day two thousand nine or when you had the this underwear bomber on Detroit bound plane and you've had a series of other mostly failed plots some inspired like adult son at Fort Hood\nWhich was sort of had some sort of inspirational connection minimum take a pay for the most part ... plots against the u._s. have failed however they have taken advantage of the war in Yemen this multi sided conflict and they've expanded their base\nIn Yemen and according to a un report that came out this last summer they now have somewhere between six and seven thousand fighters\nIn Yemen Andre ... command so these two guys who um the u._s. ... releases rewards for increase the reward for one of them and actually released a new war for the other one um these are guys who likely have thousands of fighters on under their command\nThe consistent nature of your reporting over the years suggest that out titled looks upon in personnel and\nInterchangeable with other personnel do they move them around in theaters to learn networking Tom do they have a a a chart personnel chart that says let's training here let's turn him there or is it hit or miss\nWell you know we don't know exactly what their personnel policies are we can only track these guys in show when they pop up somewhere and say that there's probably some thought behind doing that and what we've seen is not only traffic from Afghanistan Yemen and back through the years of course going only back to the Nineteen nineties\nBut then you see guys go from Yemen to other places so we've track them to the Sinai we've tracked him to Syria in ... province trapped in the north Africa and Libya and you see these guys go out of a ... pie and they serve leadership roles and other parts of the kind of work elsewhere so looks to us like this a creepy serves\nAfrica and Libya and you see these guys go out of the pie and they serve leadership roles in other parts of the kind of work elsewhere so looks to us like this a creepy serves not only is part of the senior management structure within al ... the top leaders but they have guys are they groomed go elsewhere to sort of continue on with that role elsewhere\nAnd the fact that they move them around is that a promotion can we tell do they have levels of trust and command authority or the ... the would he be comparable to a colonel or general can we think of them that way\nSo John it's amazing you're asking this question because\nThere's not been any work that we can detect to actually map out what their human sort of organization looks like in years ... at least publicly US government is not try to even explain what the management structure of all kind of looks like and when you go through their primary source\nStatements and literature you go through other pieces here and there you can point out and show that they do have a management structure in place despite the relentless post nine eleven war has been ways on them\nThey still have a management structure in place to this day and its opaque they don't they don't put on or turn it on line to explain it to everybody but you can pick up details here and there for example you know I mean I was out here of course the emir of okay well you know he has at least two deputy it mirrors by the way who according to the UN or in Iran and helping and lead the charge for all kinds of globally from her on\nBut then you have guys like this in Yemen who are fighting the Iranians as wise gets all ... complex\nWho are also probably part of the ... the senior management team and you start putting this all together you can see that there is a a sort of a human organization they're from top to bottom and yet there's been very little done publicly by the U.S government to explain it since nine eleven members an island a commission report\nGave a summary of sort of a basic summary of the commission structure that how these different entities within all kind of worked or to guide the organization internationally we haven't seen updated version of that I can that I can point to any way since two thousand four so that tells you how out how out of date or assessments are this\nMeasure belt tightening is showing cohesion rationally is there some change in its confidence level can you tell them\nWell you know it's interesting last week General Dunford had a very interesting comment this is the type of thing that should be everybody's ears perk up when they hear this\nHe says that they've got new indications are new evidence intelligence that al ... is\nAble to communicate more readily and manage more readily across the globe it's sort of infrastructure in place this this is sort of a key tell because there's been a lot of what we call this connect the dots announces through the years to try and explain away all ... to try and say that it has\nInfrastructure in place like this is sort of a key tell because there's been a lot of what we call it disconnects adopt an officer the years to try and explain away okay I did try and say that has\nThere is no ... and there is no global network and play and here's yet another comment however from U.S officials saying no there actually is still some cohesion here and there is there is some coordination across international boundaries we think that that degree of coordination equation is actually a lot more than even what\nSome people have said but it's it's interesting to hear General Dunford it very senior level express that publicly chosen something God does some assessment God told them that said oh look out\nGeneral Dunford as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of four star a marine general\nHe leads the effort to defeat the gal ... when he comments as Tom says look out Tom jobs and

ministers and our secretary of defense thing called the demonstrations by the navy card\nI think that there'll be some huffing and puffing on the part of ... at first because they won't let this go but uh you know within a month or two maybe several months if things will be back to normal\nThe reason is when the United states shows strength the Chinese back off um and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think you know so far China's been quiet about this transit I'm waiting in the next several hours to see what Beijing says\nAnd we'll get a really good ... of where they're going because if we get a relatively mild statement that means things will settle down if they actually are belligerent um you know I trust that the Trump Administration will meet word for word and that's something that we need to do right now to show Beijing that we do have the resolve\nSaturdays Gordon you've been pending in the morning we communicate as you mentioned but we're all skim the Chinese regime attack the United states has interests in a tit for tat sort of ... in a new\nTeam the streets or anywhere else\nThey can do that anywhere on planet earth any place in space you know the euro versus not off limits I'm into you know we're going to see a broad base challenge um and they will do that I'm paying has nowhere to back down he owns this controversy with the United states\nIf he seemed to cave in um have very well may not be living so um you know this is going to go on for quite some time that is um but seems teaching paying is whether he's an aberration or whether he is the ... result of Chinese communism\nWe've got him for a little while and we got to make sure that he understands that he cannot get what he wants\nTo those tendencies trap Gordon six point five percent that the official number GDP said to be the slowest in the decades since the great recession of two thousand two thousand nine whatever the real number is there is a contraction of the growth in China depends upon that means unemployment does Xi Jinping\nDoes the standing committee do they have a response to that\nWell there are only a response John is to do what they've been doing in the last several months which is to stop their dealer averaging campaign pile on the debt and hope that they can grow their way out of this which of course they can't because even if you believe their official GDP number of six points\nPile on the debt and hope that they can grow their way out of this which of course they can't because even if you believe their official GDP number of six point five percent growth and and you shouldn't but even if he were to believe it they're encouraging one and a half times as much as they're creating nominal gross domestic product\nThat's completely I'm a losing proposition for teaching paying it just a question of how long he can hold on he can hold on a long time\nBut he's making the inevitable crisis bigger\nSo they don't have any real solution the real solution of course would be to reform but see jumping doesn't want to do that\nSo he's just going to take the country off the cliff with him\nThat in the camp below slows you talked about before yeah\nUm well there hasn't been very much in the way of capital outflow since September of two thousand six team because the capital controls right now or ... the ones that are announced and the ones that they are effectively enforcing which are unannounced\nBut I think we're going to start to see more money come out because there was a real change in the Senate and China it's gotten quite dark um and you can see that of course with the falls in the stock market and in the currency\nThe only reason why there was a rebound um today was in China which was actually quite a strong rebound and the Shanghai composite was because the Chinese authorities were making these statements about how great the stock market was\nAnd they probably were also buying as well\nSo you know and under those circumstances it's no longer a market\nUm but you starting to see I think a real pessimism because people are understanding the consequences not only of slow growth but also the challenge ... see Jim paying as opposed to the United states and the American response the thing that's different Thaddeus is the American response\n... go to seven or did they touched that that that live wire\nYou know I think so John you know if you'd asked me two or three weeks ago I would've said no and I probably would be wrong um because I think that they're starting to believe that they cannot indefinitely defend the currency I thought that they were defending six nine um but you know they went through six nine\nSo I think I was wrong on that\nAnd you know of course the only time will tell but I think that they eventually after all that what they should do John is a big one time devaluation shocked the markets punish all the speculators but they're not smart enough to do that\nAt one time devaluation explain what that law so\nA big one time devaluation shock the markets punish all the speculators but they're not smart enough to do that\nAt one time

just Republicans in the Senate in general are are in good shape\nAnd they're only competitive house each really that could be swayed either way it's among the states in Nevada but I Do think it's smart messaging by the president a look at your base another reason to turn out gives them another reason to getting ... up about the opposition party\nAnd you know mid term when you hold the White House the hold all balance of power what you want to do is try and convince your voters little they don't show up bad things are going to happen and that's really easy to do when you have no power as bad things from your point of view are already happening\nTo your show up to vote to put a stop to them and that's the president's doing with this message ... you know the one counter here he is

can\nTalk border security and they just turned it around to health care which is where they want things to be a but but the other thing\nThat I get Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump\nIs in control of national security and he had that ... disposal the power\nTo stop migrants at the border and so it's not a situation I think this would be more potent like national security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's\nA situation I think this would be more potent\nLike national security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's handling of ISIS when he referred to them as the JV squad and diminished the danger that they posed in the middle east into American national security in general this is a case where\nA President Trump who's warning of this while I think it's a\nGood election year message down the stretch ultimately he's in charge which means he can implement policy to stop this and that's if Democrats really get into the mission they can say look\nYeah President Trump has the power to deal with this we're not standing in the way\nThat is typically don't they have some type of obligation at least in terms of messaging on this I mean I don't know who's behind this march I just see a bunch of people coming to the United states for a long time for the midterm\nDon't the Democrats at least have to say something and this will be the cause of John documented David what can they say about this David I\nDon't really think they have to say anything about that than in fact I think\nAt the same way I think it's smart for the president to push this from a political standpoint I think the best thing Democrats could do is say nothing you don't anger your base by by by trying to outflank Trump on the right\nAnd you don't play Trump's game by looking weak and looking as though you hope that everybody shows up and and and gets into the country\nNothing the most I Would say if I were a democratic candidate our uh I clearly in for border security and this is President Trump's job to deal with it because he's the president and and that's what I think they should there John\nI think that's a good strategy except that there's some of the leading Democrats who earlier earlier said that it's time to abolish ice so if they remain silent [noise]\nUm and and they don't repudiate their previous position or they've tried to model it I think that just gives ... turns the debate away from health care which is what the Democrats wanted it to be turns to immigration\nWhich is a mixed issue for Trump but not in the districts are Republicans after hold on that is a base turnout model\nCan we agree John that this is a this is about as hot as it gets as we watch these videos that we don't know what's going to happen the next two weeks but they're marching marching marching\nAnd they're not going to stop until they reach the border and that's where it gets interesting\nJohn ...

I. D. S.\nThese are court papers filed within the last days what did we learn from Mr hearty\nThat reef states are curiosity about Russia gate good evening to Chuck\nIn John and yeah thanks for having me um yeah so that these documents were filed a late night friday and to the case involving a lawsuit for some of these Carter Page Pfizer documents that\nYou know that we can chase him for quite a while now and a kind of sucked into a hundred and fifty plus page report is revelation\nNot entirely surprising but still a few of the gaps so or this whole investigation that the FBI used multiple confidential human sources while it was compiling its\n... still on a few of the gap so subtle or this whole investigation that the FBI use multiple confidential human sources [noise]\nWhile was compiling information on Carter Page and the Trump campaign and all these things so that the new revelation there is that we already knew about cars to steal the British spy who wrote the dossier to equate accused tromp on the campaign of all of these things I'm so this new document\nOr refers to multiple uh you know plural\nOr informants that were used and so you and I have talked quite a bit about stuff on our the University of Cambridge professor who has it been revealed to also be an informant who met with page and George Papadopoulos and everyone and uh so now we have those two known informants\nPlus others and so the question that you and I and everyone else would like to find out uh who are these informants when did they crucially when did they start ah their work on behalf the FBI and how much were they paid and all of those close touch question\nHere's the quote from Mr hardy the FBI is protected information that would identify the identities of other confidential sources who provided information or intelligence to the FBI as well as quote information provided by those sources so we have a long list to investigate we know steal\nWe know how or how the FBI has never acknowledge how correct Chuck that's that's we've surmise and other reporters have confirmed the surmise that help has one of them but we don't know does this include down or do we know Alexander down or he's certainly in the position\nTo have cooperated with the FBI and he certainly had a large motive\nBecause after all he was identified with the Clinton campaign\nAnd we know now that the Clinton campaign one of its lawyers ... for ... coy what's connecting with the FBI so do we believe down his name is in the filing\nYeah very well could be ah that that's an interesting possibility a downer himself has given a just a you know one or two interviews senses name surfaced last December\nBut it's connected to ... um and he's not saying a whole lot he's not a ... he he was obviously and the Australian government were funneling information back to the FBI\nAnd the question would be to the FBI consider him a confidence ca chest and there are Lance confidential human source or was he nearly you know just a offered this one off tip\n'em and so it's very possible that down or is considered one of their confidence with human sources\nConfidence or human source or was he merely you know just a offered this one off tip\n'em and so it's very possible that down or is considered one of their confidence that human sources um there are others that you know or who have been involved in that ... who make contact with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos in these guys I'm throughout the campaign who\nWho very well could have sharing information with the FBI um and and as I mentioned you know someone a according to these documents someone was paid for their work and so that raises\nKnow we we can assume that perhaps downer since he was an Australian Government official perhaps was not paid for that work\nSo they're all in addition to doubt or others out there um and so it'd be very interesting to find out what information they provide it but also with the whole Carter Page ... and and this new finally did not get into it but you and I've also discussed how um Republicans on on the hill of referred to\nPotentially exculpatory evidence contained in the fourth and final five so\nUh the somehow a pain to a different picture of the information regarding Carter Page and so um to to go back to Rod Rosenstein who's going to be speaking to Capitol Hill I'm On Wednesday I Believe um he he signed this particular ... so this is a question that\nYou know hopefully they'll be asked to we we can expect tend to try to dodge the question um as far as what type of exculpatory information there might be\nBut it's a bit next to piece that that\nWould help put all together and it's also one of the aspects that President Trump has been interested in declassify from these documents\nRight and it's been a Rosen is dean who stopped at the classification President Trump wanted the fourth ... he wanted the FBI question and answer the thrill choose with Bruce or\nWho was in ... who remains in the OJ principal and who was involved in communicating with Mr Steele to the FBI another he was a go between his wife Nelly are worked for Glenn Simpson of fusion GPS who has now taken the ... I think we should note that Carter that\nCarter Page needs to the other quarter page investigation doesn't happen without Glenn Simpson and Glenn Simpsons no longer cooperating with anybody so a Chuck we moved the story a little bit also in the White House request for release\nWas the word the text messages of many of these players including Rod Rosenstein himself so there's an enormous amount of information that we have not seen yet\nThe text messages of many of these players including Rod Rosenstein\nHimself so there's an enormous amount of information that we have not seen yet and the FBI is being coy about what it will or will not release protecting confidential sources Papadopoulos is testifying this week to Congress is that accurate Chuck\nBut yet he's testifying on Thursday to the to the task force of the same task force that interview James Baker the FBI lawyer smelly or and ah Bruce or a house you to share in the house oversight and Government Reform committee interviewing Papadopoulos and um\nIf you follow Papadopoulos on Twitter um he's made quite a few comments recently about\nA lot of these what he says they're suspicious contacts that he had while on the campaign and we've documented I've documented you and I've talked about ... who is definitely a suspicious or contract he was an FBI informant or George Papadopoulos has said that he had at least\nThree or four more strange contacts people coming up to him and blind to meet with him while he was on the campaign um and he now believe since he's been through you know uh he he's a bit interaction with helper they now believe that\nPerhaps other informants are there are people working on behalf of western intelligence ... or send to approach him to perhaps glean information from it does\nHe think middle ... does he think Mitt sued was one of those ... one of those FBI informants\n... yeah yeah he does um he he believes that he's not laid out\nI'll be honest these not laid out a\nClear and articulate kind of a there is no evidence yet tying sued to down or to help or um no not one clear narratives here um but the these are three or four\nI'm very interesting um approaches that he he you know he had 'em into his theory seems to be that there's some sort of connection here um because you know as as he claims he and he he he pleaded guilty\nTo lying to the FBI but he's not found you know he was not charged with anything beyond feed the lowest one thousand one charge for lying um he's not been accused of conspiracy\nSo um and what we've heard from several lawmakers as well is that soon after the investigation was open based upon information about Papadopoulos but down or information um there were some piece of\nEvidence that the government receive potentially exculpatory evidence which\nOpen based upon information about Papadopoulos but down or information um there were some piece of evidence that the government receive potentially exculpatory evidence which kind of under cut the initial narratives\nThat the government had to to open an investigation based on Papadopoulos so um he he wants to talk to Congress about all of that\nWe don't know yet exactly what his mission will provide 'em but you know it's something to look for it could potentially change a store here give us some new each and follow up\nI'm Chuck ... for the Daily Caller waiting for Rosen staying in Papadopoulos I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nSean Hannity show and there's no mistake about it the people that promoted or the white supremacist they're the ones most responsible [noise]\nAnd I fully and completely understand that they're mere presence [noise] brings out of a justifiable I'll say is justifiable reaction from people [noise] in a righteous indignation come

difference I Want to be a part time in my self I didn't find that in\nYeah let's let's I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think with respect to General Flynn when he pled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with\nInvestigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise] generally speaking prosecutors when they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled do not\nGenerally speaking prosecutors\nWhen they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled do not allow cooperate or to be sentenced by the court until after their cooperation has concluded which usually means any testimony that they're\nGoing to give are expected to given the investigation of because you want a full breath of the person's cooperation to be before the sentencing court so I think the fact that General Flynn\nIs now scheduled to be sentenced and apparently the sentencing is going to go forward on December right team indicates that Mahler doesn't think he's going to require him for any in court testimony that's not a sure sign of that but it's a pretty good sign or so that is another thing that leads me to think that the investigation is probably\nWinding down to a conclusion as far as the Woodward comparison is concerned might might point to in in my discussion with rich and I appreciate\nYour mention of the the McCarthy report podcast um [noise] the point of that discussion was that Mahler works for the Justice Department as a prosecutor he is not a lawyer for a congressional impeachment committee\nAnd a prosecutor is only real job to report is whether to recommend bringing charges or not or declining charges\nOn a particular investigation\nAnd a particular set of facts that he's been authorized to investigate so to my mind it's not ... job to do a ... on the fitness of the president to be president the question is whether there's enough evidence to to bring charges based on the things that he's been authorized to investigate\nThaddeus [laughter] and you mentioned in the past how this would not be a surprise for Mr Rosen Spain assigned to continue\nTo stress that this was all necessary but you've also made the point and believing last article was well there are a lot of the stuff for the special counsel's during its been handed off to other departments existing departments adjuster and really have to show why this was necessary or just to remember that\nI Do agree with that I think that you know we question that he is whether this investigation was necessary because it was not assigned in compliance with the regulations of the Justice Department which require both showing that there's a conflict of interest that make\nAssigned in compliance with the regulations at the Justice Department which require both showing that there's a conflict of interest that makes it impossible for the Justice Department to investigate the matter and the normal course and that there's a factual basis for believing that some\nA criminal charge may be appropriate because some crime has been committed um there was never any showing that there was this kind of conflict of interest and there was never any articulation of the factual basis for a criminal investigation and the fact I think that\nThe portions of the investigation like the to Russia indictments\nThat Mahler return have been transition to components of the Justice Department is strongly indicative of the fact that there was never any\nConflict of interest in the first place I don't think those cases should have been brought\nBecause I think that the the charging instruments there are more in the nature of a publicity\nAnnouncements than real
