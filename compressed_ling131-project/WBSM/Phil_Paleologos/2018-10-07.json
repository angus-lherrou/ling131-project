his father's help overcome the limitations of the asthma that almost killed him before the age of three but in a Eighteen Seventy two when Roosevelt was still only Thirteen\nHis father told in sickness is always a shame and often a sin\nYou must make your body and he was determined to do that one of the ways that he did it was traveling with his family and a traveling in the saddle he loved riding he loved hunting his father gave him a gun pleased\nTo meet in this context his name is Justin Walker\nHe's a law professor at the University of Louisville and he was a law clerk both for Anthony Kennedy and for the appellate court judge who God willing will be replacing Anthony Kennedy a judge a cabin on 'em and professor Walker thanks very much for joining us\nVery much for having me on the show and it's it's\nPleasure and I I Know that you actually you first met a judge Kavanaugh when he was teaching at Harvard law school were you a student right\nThat's right and if you look back can you think what was the most horrifying incident of uncontrolled rage that you ever saw from Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] well you know micro I it I get the joke but on the other hand I think you know it it will be funny if this whole ... ridiculous vicious search and destroy process uh once so tragic um you know I I took him for class and I I worked with them every day in chambers for a year\nUm his students included men and women across the ideological spectrum\nHe treated all of them with a with dignity and respect his his temperament has just as has just\nAlways been impeccable and that's what the lawyers who come before him um have said over and over and over again and again across the ideological spectrum\nNow as an as a law clerk you saw him a virtually every day right yeah and um what about these these charges of alcohol abuse or did you ah ever see judge Kavanaugh showing the signs of any kind of alcoholic impairment\n[noise] Michael I absolutely not a hundred a hundred percent a hundred percent not you know there there are some accusations that have been made that you know I understand how some of his critics might say well ... will never ... you know they think on every other tree I Believe I Know the truth but they think they'll ever\nBut these accusations about things that he's done in public\nAbout you know the notion that it was an open secret when he was in high school or college that he was wild and crazy um if this was an open secret and all his friends all of its queens is the time would have known about\nA and instead it's quite the opposite the people who know him best dozens scores of people from high school and college over and over again say\nHe was he he was he was not wild he was not crazy he was one of the more responsible high school students college students are and and the description of him that impacted by a few uh you know outliers on the on the next room mate who you know hasn't you know that we had a falling out or something or is is just not the truth\nI I think that uh Lindsey Graham has come up with a perhaps a a solution about the one kind of\nTest of a judge Kavanaugh that might satisfy the Democrats\nAnd I'm One of those think as as a a professor of law now and somebody who is very well schools and constitutional law whether you think that a senator Graham's suggestion would be a violation of the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment here is Lindsey Graham\n\nA bottom well why don't we don't want to say\nOkay what he says why don't we don't come in water and see if the flow so good old medieval trial by ordeal but do you think\nOf straight out of my python and the holy grail a and a\nYou know I Do I I I think that this process has been really unfair to to judge Kavanaugh and also the doctor I think that they have both been used by Democrats on the Senate committee or for political purposes\nOr their strategy all along has not been to try to find the truth which is a slap in the face of Dr Ford their ... their their strategy all along has been\nTo do whatever they have to do by any means necessary to delay for the sake of delay and I think the strategy has been trans parents it goes back to you know a thousand years ago we were talking about whether or not a million documents\nEnough or whether it needed to be two million documents it was delayed for the sake of the way that explains why her letter was not investigated in July when it was received and it was only leaked to the press against her will on the eve of judge Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation so for these Democrats talk about um temperament I forgot to talk about credibility\nUm [noise] you know it's it takes takes a lot of gumption when it comes to credibility judge Kavanaugh's way at\nOne if you were speaking the judge Kavanaugh I Do believe he will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one votes and maybe with fifty votes who who knows it could be fifty to a but it will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to\n[noise] to rise above and and prevent all and become the great associate justice of the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWhere I Am not going to be present trucks and after two I think that you need my advice but I'll I'll say that uh we saw his judicial temperament and hasn't packet of ... legal mind for twelve years on the DC circuit when he was vindicated by the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen times and we also saw in the last confirmation hearing\nThat he was outraged about an outrageous process as well he should be\nAnd I have confidence that wants to use on the bench spring court hopefully he wealthy\nThat we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be\nWill be the same kind of judge she'd been for the past twelve years so I'm I'm looking forward to that I share your cautious\nOptimism I understand uh you know it's it's the process of so farcical at times that it leads to sell it lends itself to jokes but but I Do want to really you know he's serious that this people have been hurt by Kavanaugh has been hurt his family doctor for that they received death threats this process stinks\nAnd how do we think that ... and that's the last question that will have time for Justin Walker professor of law how we fixed the process\nOf my good [laughter] um you know I I'm just a ... or as we were talking earlier went to Harvard but you have to Yale degree and I'm going to trust you Michael tests\nTo have the answers to the big picture questions more than we just learned civil procedure but at the Yale I've heard that they they really learn how to solve the world's problems\nWell again this is a a gigantic problem and I want to get to that and get to that with listeners because clearly this process is broken I mean everybody hates this has not been a good moment for America let me tell you one thing and I'm going to tell you this as soon as we come back from break\nChristine Blasey Ford how do we know because it all declared against Kavanaugh will

term devil's triangle refers indeed not to a sexual act as has been alleged by Kavanaugh's detractors\nBut rather to uh drinking game they played in high school they actually played the drinking game devil's triangle\nQuote devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school it was a variation of the game quarters when we played rebels try and go for people sat at a table on the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next one another to form a triangle each of the four participants took turns being the shooter\nThe shooter attempted to bounce a quarter\nInto watching the glasses rosy alumni we do not remember the exact origins of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle in our yearbook to refer to any kind of sexual activity\nTo us it was just a

nationwide\nBegan early Wednesday evening in states including California Alaska Arizona and more Alaskan Arizona of course are particularly important here because a lot of the four undecided senators and there are only four of one hundred who are undecided\nOne is from Alaska and that would be Jeff Flake who is leaving his Senate seat and uh\nThat's Arizona and Alaska at least\n... the senator from Alaska I I Do believe that in the last analysis\n[noise] um probably Murkowski Collins and slate will all come home and vote for Brett Kavanaugh now these are three senators none of whom are great fans of President Trump\nBut even Republicans who have been very critical of President Trump and I'm One of them\nWould say that one of the things that he has done that has been wonderful in his administration and yes I think it's been wonderful he's appointed exceptionally find judges and not just Neil Gorsuch but appellate court judges in a record number of them have been confirmed thank you Mitch McConnell this is the way it's supposed to be\nPresident working with the majority leader to put good people and the judiciary and not people who are going to upset our constitution or tear at our constitution there are people who are returning to the constitutional order\nAnd to limit the power of the judiciary by the way that's extraordinary because there is a normal human desire to grab as much power as you can\nAnd the idea of a constitutional is judge like Antonin Scalia or Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh\nIs that someone says look I I get to decide a lot of things as a justice of the Supreme Court but I don't get to make new legislation or create or discover new rights that no one ever suspected existed before\nThat's refreshing and it's worth supporting and I think it's um it's very much\nA force in unifying the Republican Party the Republican Party hasn't been so unified on any issue not even the tax cuts though they did go through\nThis issue I think is unified conservative sentiment across the board number one because Brett Kavanaugh is a good man and an outstanding judge who either way who's judgment of been affirmed by the Supreme Court in the past\nAnd the record number of them\nIs um been a very successful judge so far he's a good man the other reason is unified the Republican Party is because the Democratic of salt\nHas been so

Bush he didn't get a majority but he got more popular votes than George W. Bush he lost the election\nAnd uh then last time in November of two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton three million more votes than Donald Trump she didn't get a majority and a yet she lost the election how did that happen what would happen largely because the third and fourth parties but leave that aside\nA President Trump won the election you won the electoral college President Bush won the election won the electoral college so if our caller is right and these protesters are really protesting the system by which we elect presidents the only way to change that as a constitutional amendment and it won't\nDo you know why because under our constitution in order to change the constitution you need three quarters of the state legislatures to go along with the change\nAnd there are more than Thirteen states and that's all it would take that are small enough that they would lose a lot of cloud of the electoral college went away I mean right now New Hampshire is a very important state New Hampshire has only four electoral votes\nBut those four electoral votes in close elections really count people go to New Hampshire not just because the New Hampshire primary states like gum Wisconsin Wisconsin's ten electoral votes\nAnd uh people go to Wisconsin\nAnd part of the genius of the federal system is meaning it is I mean that you need to win not\nA majority of the wrong popular vote but a majority of the various states which have their independent existence\nAnd look\nThat does you know those states are are weighted not one vote per each state\nBut they are awaited according to population and so it's worked out for two hundred and forty years the the idea that that is what this protest is really about what the protest really is about is just to stereo on the left\nAbout\nLosing some of the dictatorial power that had been assumed by activists on the Supreme Court\nLet's go to your calls and to Tammy in Marietta, Georgia you're on the ... that show it's disagreement day\n[noise] Hi I'm Heather how are you I'm well\nHey man I Am a disagreement the disagreement is that you talked about um several weeks ago\nBut my statement is why it's so passionate about this particular man it's almost like this year nephew and you just so angry that people don't believe him or that is possible that he could have violated this lady and he's you know it's very possible that he could have done it is not\nJust lying about it but if I'm saying if this particular man doesn't get confined it's almost like it'll break your heart you just so angry that people are angry about it I don't understand why\nThis particular man I mean Daniel Schorr even overturn roe v wait are you sure that have gone to abolish the voting rights act because that's that's what people are\nPassionate about it oh that conservatives\nOkay let me I Will I Will answer that in a moment but I Want to let you finish you had another disagreement and I will answer your question very directly coming right up but go ahead what's your other disagreement Tammy\nThis agreement with a few weeks ago you were talking about [noise]\nUh I I think I don't know what it was a young black man it said he felt unsafe and I'm a white neighborhood\nAnd that just made you mad that someone would make that statement but and you're trying to convince you say not true and not true but you don't know how this young man's field in a quiet neighborhood he can fly on any feel unsafe every white neighborhood is not safe\nThat's absolutely true you're right I Am but what he was saying is that he feels unsafe in any white neighborhood not just that he feels unsafe in a specific white neighborhood which can be crime ridden the points that I was making was that\nYou know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth uh in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth\nBut I think the absence of any confirming evidence\nAt all is overwhelming and\nThe whole wave at her accusations against him came out or very suspect and ... and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political contest\nAnd the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is she really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know I've never met him but I Do know people have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are on the uh left\n'em ... who was a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with a a judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion\nThat he should be blocked from the Supreme Court\nBased on on early unsupported unprecedented accusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and\nAnd uh and violence against women\nMost of those people do it\nAs a pattern is not a one off and the idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a doctor for it are completely non credible and have been clearly the night or that I think it's worth taking into consideration of coming up\nAnd uh but the point is she was up there very emotional she clearly wasn't they ...\nWell rehearsed witness she gave very a vase of answers and I don't think that she is um I don't think our charges are accurate against judge Kavanaugh\nBut why not express compassion for somebody in that situation appreciate your calling your challenge um meanwhile\nQuick word from relief factor Amy from

I mean across\nPolitical eating illogical religious all own boundaries\nIs the idea that discrimination based upon race is profoundly wrong but so is discrimination based upon religious faith or discrimination against people because of their religious faith there's\nA remarkable guy who ah we've talked about on this on this radio program before who was\nA fire chief in the city of Atlanta\nAnd he's experienced ... discrimination based upon race in his life\nOr he's African American and he is also experienced discrimination based upon his religious faith he's a committed Christian and fortunately there is the alliance defending freedom\nTo help defend people like chief Calvin Cochran let me welcome to the show David court men who is an attorney with the alliance defending freedom and a chief\nUh Kelvin Cochrane ah from Atlanta a gentleman it's great to have both have you on a chief Cochran how how did you end up as fire chief for the great American city of Atlanta\n... Michael thank you for allowing us to be on the show um my journey to Atlanta really started when I was five year old kid and report growing up in poverty and sauce report firefighters putting out a fire\nA cough the alley from wherever you live and um when I saw those firefighters that day I uh looked at my big brothers and my mom and little sisters and said I Want to be a fireman when I grow up and are stuck with me all my life that I became a firefighter\nIn Shreveport in Nineteen eighty one and a Eighteen years later I became the first African American fire chief in the city of St quarter course experienced a tremendous amount\nOf discrimination because of outrage there early portions of my career but through hard work and faith and determination over came out with those challenges but eight years after becoming fire chief in St for I was blessed to become the fire chief in Atlanta\nOn the thin layer Shirley Franklin and um ten or twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are much stretch it onto the minister ration of president Iraq Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back\nTo the city of Atlanta buys the honorable America same read and two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand Fifteen\nOkay this is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success\nHow how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I had published a book\nThat I had written on my own time and self publish for Christian men the book is called who told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam in the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcome the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated this was cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and wife and how they match 'em on it and that any sex outside of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions what's your opinion is that literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men in the fire department where you\nKnow certain not at all\nSo it it was it the fact is you self published a book you hadn't use public funds what business is it of the city of Atlanta\nFor the mayor of the city council or anybody or what's the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument we're using a passage in your book to ruin your career", "show_name": "Phil Paleologos", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "07"}
