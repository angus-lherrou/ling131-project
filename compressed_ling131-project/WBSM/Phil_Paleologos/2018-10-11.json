Massachusetts the now indicted a mayor boy mayor of Fall River or a boy mayor he is he's Twenty years twenty six years old he he's not a great\n... they were cheering him as like the millennial mayor and I'm not going to look for and now he's\nNow he's stealing money from investors and then in return for them keeping their mouth shut he's giving them city jobs and he's using the money to buy sex toys\nDo we treat them out of our generation we trade trade the boy there to the ... the boomers although no not even for a sixth round draft choice we don't want that by the way you know where he went to college gross oh no Providence yes he did he\n... he was in your ... or ... what do\nYou guys are the same age and they both went to a prominent yesterday CEO Herrera ... was he a theater major were you a ground floor investor zap it found it hurt you with a great idea it's cold snowy owl\nBut how he's speaking of you're saying um you know why he wouldn't want to take a picture of him put him in that position or whatever pictures and come back to haunt you well little flashback not too long ago when Kim cardio machine and went and took a picture with Trump and she was on the cover of the New York post and it said Trump meets the ... says sometimes taking a picture of Trump can\nBut that was that was full laugh every was but I wasn't a political statement yeah which I Would say that was\nYeah you can say that but that's also very insulting she's a woman who goes for once in our life she had an opportunity to do something huge for social justice reform and that's what they do with the picture and he was on her she's kind of known for her hiding\nI realize that but if I met with the president I don't care if you're there for that that shouldn't be on the cover is like Trump meets the rump it's kind of degrading to the whole thing I thought they were all I thought everything was about women empowerment and someone's trying to do something good and that's how you make fun of them\nI'm just saying it's a double standard and you guys should acknowledge that that if ... and ... was saying oh she shouldn't be on the White House this is a joke this is a joke\nYou know what I'm In favor of grace um favorite sewing more newspapers or the ... of the new stamp whether it's\nLike ... to the Boston Herald tied I disagree but I'm not going to run you out of a restaurant Jim case scores one for criminal justice reform you don't think that's a snappy tabloid headlines who\nI just was product I just\nThought it was ... she has a business woman and a certain point you can show a little bit of respect people for what they're accomplishing um and another and other new to\nFind somebody that's a good point too he's now a negro\nBlack because that racist I Would say so\nI didn't know you're even allowed to say that any more\nI'm looking for though to that picture of the day with President Trump appearing in every campaign ad that runs in a in a major city as it says a record low African American unemployment and he's and he's there you know what do they call it ... with a Trump\nAnd it's funny too because there was a while where every time he would come out and do something like this I was waiting for him to take it back like they all do you know what I mean like I was waiting for the next day to come out issue a statement issued\nReady to your friend Brady it took it back basically\nYeah well that's what I was expecting but if someone had a really good point I Twitter they said even if he did and I don't think he will at this point that even if it's kind of came out tomorrow and said I was wrong I'm part of the Democrat Party it doesn't matter because what he's done at this point it's he's shown\nHow frightened they are different ideas so he could take it back today and it's still the impact it's huge it doesn't really matter anymore he's shown that they're they're afraid\nHow ... how many how many black votes do you think comedy in the White House was worth the presidential election\nSyria that the law that is a long way away oh it is it is but I'm just saying like how how many how many people's ...\nIt'd be changed or at least open to President Trump as a result of what happened today\nWell I think what's interesting is that the upcoming elections in midterms Mitch McConnell was being interviewed and talking about on the Democrats' strategy and just this kind of that lack of civility in politics and he was saying that similar to when the Republicans were riding high when they thought you know oh\nWell we're going to impeach Bill Clinton and oh this is such a good this is such a good strategy and he said it really backfire they rallied\nRallied the Democrats around their candidate and he said I think the similar things happening with this cabinet and its rallying\nWell yeah I probably ... you know like the Brett Kavanaugh thing kind of like took the mask off the Democrats about what they really think about presumption of innocence due process right and so forth this just goes to show what they really think of any black person wants to like for him so yeah it's just a different it it's a different\nA mask has fallen off the Democrats let's play Mitch McConnell cut fourteen talking about the Democrat Party\nDemocrats may say you went back the house that they plan to launch many many investigations into\nThe president and Amos racial make clear that one of the lines of inquiry is going to be the person's tax returns presence businesses prison hotel contracting city um do you think that that's a

I remember the price we pay for a ... page\nBill for governor remember all the answers you as\nBlogger for ... to cook it you know this was going to make a seventh grade year and I\nSaid it was off work exactly the opposite of public a mad at us and uh and felt so sorry for president plug show this business of presidential harassment or ... said it was I going to ...\nIt's interesting it will be able to help themselves so\nI Know but that it is funny though because at first they never understood why Everytime they ask\nYou to talk about some with ... ... it's not it's not Kanye West or Brett Kavanaugh's these Democrats but can't help themselves\nBut it's why Everytime they ask Nancy Pelosi or anyone like that are you going to impeach Trump it's like you know that they want to and that's what they want but if they say it they're afraid of exactly that they're afraid that people are going to say well even if I'm not crazy about him I don't really want you guys to impeach the president\nSo it's interesting because I think deep down they want to but they just can't say it right now\nIt's like ... plus he said would say that like the former governor of Tennessee's age the will of course he of course he wouldn't vote for capital but he has to say right with her boss that little bits\nGoing to be on TV Tonight saving the recipient says what's wrong with you it doesn't mean do Hillary has got a couple of bottles a hot sauce and their pets there\n[laughter] well let me get back Jeb Bush is bad news and I think how he's really going to like the story oh it's just not getting invited to the wedding thank you that were either and now it's out sorry about the car [noise]\nSo much for my role or Jewish\nOr sleep on a Casper you're picking over every mattress you ever had tested for yourself for one hundred nights brisk ... go to Casper dot com and use code how wait for fifty dollars towards the purchase of sauce mattresses that's Casper ...
