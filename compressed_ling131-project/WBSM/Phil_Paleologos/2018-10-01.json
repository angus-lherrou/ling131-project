I I had a lot of stuff to do with the uh\nFinishing up the end it's on the book and we were in uh we were in old orchard over the weekend doing an event and the\nYou know they had to go to the BBC event on a friday night so I was I but I specifically whenever I wasn't doing all these other things I stayed away from the TV so I watched a little football yesterday\nBut I I I didn't want to see this crap and I just turned it on and it's all the same stuff\nAnd you know and I'm ... thanks for listening to the radio show and you know we've got to talk about and we try to make it entertaining but it's it's very frustrating you know the problem is if you're a guy\nThat any ...\nAny time they want they can do this to somebody and if and if you're\nA woman who who loves\nA man you know whether it's your father or your husband your your brother your\nSon your nephew they can do this do anybody any time\nAnd it's just it's totally unfair and it's it it it's really wrong what they're doing to this guy Brett Kavanaugh while while at the same time Keith Ellison gets a total ... by the way but whatever happened to\n... [noise] if we ever heard and do you remember those Daily Caller stories about the uh the the youthful hookers was patronizing in the Dominican Republic he's running for reelection New Jersey you see taken it on the gym [noise] oh no he's a Democrat I'm how we saw\nAgain like you do is is this the wrong word phrase he brought Justin Trudeau to his knees last night\nHere suspended [laughter] one week suspension like to go and pay as well but they got fired from being the coach of the football\nYou're actually going to you're going to get like a mark sign treatment in the Canadian human rights board\nSo so he won so we was happy about that and uh\nHe was but I also will say I think it's a combination of him being happy\nAnd also him knowing that the base is very riled up right now because of this cabinet thanks and he's going out this is old school Trump this is from when he was on on the campaign trail he's not holding back his jokes are often his timing is down pat\nAnd the press people I can always tell when he's really funny when he's surrounded by liberal press and they still laugh you know they don't want to laugh but they still do\nBut he you know the thing was though he knew that this is a this is a giant victory the stock market was up two hundred and fifty points I mean this is again he's fulfill probably his second or third after build the wall this was his biggest\nBiggest campaign pledge of twenty six states if he's fulfilled it but of course the first thing the first question is about the Russia does your which is the Brett Kavanaugh not even not even a rape not even rape or sexual assault convict or an allegation Seymour\nDidn't Brett Kavanaugh have too many adult beverages when he was at Yale University that's the big\nGlass there yes we drink beer like fear still I fear\nThinking of actually you know you know we'll go to like have a night in a second I Do want to play some of these cuts off from Trump's they are so funny let's play 'em cut number seven Steve\nIn fact when I Won I said the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse there were so\nTheir logo but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico shop [laughter]\n\nWho knew he smokes with great Spanish\nAnd also we can actually the male whale does bad all roads\nLead go right to cut eight\nFor her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats and I guess I'm a living you to the media but I consider you a part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be talking about we want more time for the FBI\nSo he was not happy with that Brett Kavanaugh questions as you guys all heard in the intro it might be worth replaying him talking about\nHis own drinking and how he did not drink he never has and it's his only this is classic Trump soft application which really does distinguish him so much from Obama in the sense that he can make fun of himself he can make a joke and his own expense\nAnd it always does land because they all want to make fun of him too so let's play 'em cut three I don't think he did\nHere's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my only good traits I don't [laughter]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a list serve alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason [noise]\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be will be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man\nWas drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him in many many years they go back to high school\nYou know I graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and then go crazy and you know they weren't I just go there was sixteen Seventeen years old\n[laughter]\nTo one of his only get traits that really got people laughing\nAgain remember to last week he's with us and they have this they're having this dinner you know fancy dinner or lunch whatever was and the poor wine and he doesn't drink any of the wind\nAnd their their pastor yeah at the editor at the same time then they start talking about cabinet and there has to cap it off because he drinks too much well it goes on with us if it doesn't really matter again it's it's like everything else\nWith a ... in the Trump era whatever proper his friends do it's wrong\nRight and to your point highly um men are supposed to be there's this toxic toxic masculinity but then as soon as Brett Kavanaugh starts to cry because his reputation has been torn to shreds\nHe is a joke he set you way and pizza to Roger we can make fun of them are now Matt Damon can make fun of him because he cried and they're they're just there's so many hypocrites and the Democrat Party and also\nHere's another one though he got angry on Thursday and that means that he doesn't have the judicial temperament to be\nAlways been a judge for twelve years nobody's ever complained about I'm yelling from the bench or anything he doesn't have the judicial temperament but you're on the other hand he had just been laid back like he was in the interview on Fox with Martha Macau him two weeks ago right by it yeah he he must be guilty well see guilty he's Modell asserting but he's innocent\nDid it he's he got to political by saying that this was retribution on behalf of the Clintons and missiles to a political smear job on him but they have no problem of Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticizing President Trump during the campaign and after the election\nBut Steve retreated such a funny treat over the weekend it said something like\nUm you're a rapist efforts made the Democrat thing it's like having a you're a rapist and then he he responds back no I'm not you sound so angry like a rapist and then it says dot dot dot now you're being quiet Laker rape that exactly what this guy supposed to get there is\nNothing that the FBI could do that would convince liberals that he is not a serial gang rape\nOh no no this is a conservative tree house had they had description the word the phase three now in the face three is investigation forever yeah well it it if not forever we go to face for you know what that is\nIt was a flawed investigation yeah yeah I'm

I Hope Republicans are watching this is how it's done\nI was so happy when he turned it back on the Democrats and when asked for specifics oh he gave specific the games of a civics it out on you know my last year you senator from Connecticut Senator Blumenthal a lying about his Vietnam service for four hours\nAnd and die holding\nHolding this woman's account for for for what two months that seriously she took it\nUm he actually went through the these scandals involving the Democrats and that is what the Republicans should do Everytime turn it right back on these guys because what they have done oh my gosh if only the worst they could be accused of\nIt is a a recovered memory thirty six years later that the groups that girl in at at Fifteen Years old\nBut this is another thing the uh the the uh presses or why is he so obsessed with the fact that Richard Blumenthal told the few white lies about his Vietnam service [laughter]\nYeah you know the white lies oh my gosh going on and on about his\nService and then nailed dead right that was only because I'm One of my my my favorite that no ours\nRepublican consultants that Blumenthal even won that election he collapsed and the

people ... and I and I couldn't believe when I saw where he was going with it last week when Blumenthal was questioning Kavanaugh\nAt least ... throughout that lab mix Russian false false and all of them I say if I had Blumenthal record\nThat's the last thing in the world I Would ever mentioned even if somebody had a gun to my head you know doesn't have any self realization of where he ... no ... but he knows he's not going to be criticized by anybody except you and me you\nKnow that's the realization that Democrats have they know they have the media\nAnd they can get away with and if anything can you imagine I mean a Republican if all if you don't care about politics you don't care about policy or that's just not important to you you have to vote Republican just for clean government just for honest politicians\nBecause even if Republicans want to be swine liars dirt bags um domestic abusers rapists even if they wanted to and they had it in their hearts I'm not saying they're
