commented on the cabinet domination and this is the thing that she's going to come and I know and nobody in the Senate race wind but there's going on with Marsha Blackburn in the recording industry\nBecause she's got a lot of money from Nashville and she she represents Nashville's interest and like the recording artist interests are very well and she seems to be something going on to\nYour point Steve that's a very interesting theory because she's just coming up on the end of a contract with the company that she's been with and she was like fourteen years old and she just signing on new on so maybe there's something like ...\n... ... ... how does she stay on the Cleveland Browns because you know the governor ... brother ... owned the Cleveland Browns I think she

and just threw it out on the ground\nWas touching up about why\nI guess he just didn't like her I don't run the seals lunch but you go I mean that's a busy Philip is very well liked in Hollywood

it's just speaking from experience but it's a variation on\nThe the big lie back in the Nineteen thirties\nWith Joseph ... but listen listen to her describing the spirit mushy and tell us if ... if this rings a bell with what happened to Brett Kavanaugh cuts sex\nSelling path you demonize and then you have to wrap up near a Metallica concert wraps near near somebody with Paul Kirk and all the rest\nAnd then you might actually died [noise] and then you're right it seems to be pointed in the press that this is this a mess\nSo they had that the allegation that get past the point is there\nAnd then it's called around us mia Hamm merchandise passes we play on the air that we made this is a cat\nAnd if\nIt sounds like the Russian collusion hoax an Brett Kavanaugh smear\nAnd what was the contacts with that is this like secret recording of a Democrat meeting where their strategizing if he's like so with the guys here's what we're going to I mean it's not one of those things from the\nSide like a you know Mitt Romney talking about the forty seven percent you know or something like that no this is just a flat on that looks like it's some kind of seminar or something I mean do you see saying that she's been smeared no I think she's saying this is how you do it I mean that's the way I look at\nYou know who would smear her she's a Democrat you know she she gets a as she gets a free pass\nThis is like a it's a class one it's near one oh one right Democrat boot camp\nAnd so then so then so what this does is I'll give you an example is the follow up so you have you have the first accuser\nFord steps out she's somewhat believable I credible is too much is is to to uh uh gullible a word to use shows emotionally persuasive yes that's a good way to put it so then the second one steps forward Ramirez\nIt's less credible lot less credible\nAnd again the New Yorker reporters now have admitted that they couldn't find any evidence she was telling the truth but they wanted to put it out there to show the pattern which is that what you call it what what ... was referring to with the smears so once you have two of 'em out there then you can have Allison camaraderie step forward\nCut number not\nHaving listening to the president call these accusations against ... and I'm not one I'm certainly to credible once there was also a third one hopes it wasn't like we all President Trump was back from high to\nThe real President Trump who believes that due process okay yes\nI think it's funny because that anti plus the clip their fact checking it on like notes and stuff and they're saying\nRepublicans are using that in pretending that Nancy Pelosi was describing what they did the cabinet really this is taken out of contact and she's she's attending to Republican no we're not stupid we know she's not saying it now where are you saying that she admitted this is something people do and it's very similar to what happened now\nThis is like a pre game show saying but uh you know it's expected the Brady is going to throw out the ... the day now that I ... at all but his back and then he's not going to be double team there's about ... it'd be like she she she laid out the game play out like that but that was that\nChuck Schumer laid out the game plan when he said he would go up against the intelligence community they got six ways from Sunday uh getting back at you know he wasn't specifically addressing the the dirty ... but yeah it looks like it\nAnd he ... and it was even more a crack credible that Schumer would say that because he's one of the gang of eight so he ... he's the one who gets the ... they get to see all of the\nProduct whether it's real or whether it's\n... a product from the from the so called intelligence community and so they know where up they speak and this is this is what's been going on in the ... you know the kids screw around with\nThis stuff they Trump's gotta get this stuff out he's gotta he's gotta declassify all these documents ... documents so everybody to see what they were trying to do that we're trying to rig an election and regular Supreme Court nomination to tell us\nHow we are [noise] are you\nLooking for a pre own car well before you go to the dealership where you'll be pounce on by pushy sales people give the guys who try\nAnd I I I don't think I really don't think that the judge Kavanaugh judge Garland or that similar at all you know I mean the Merrick Garland strikes me as one of these guys who why ... you know he he seemed to uh you know if you didn't look very deeply into his background he seemed like a somewhat moderate person\nBut I think he would have gone straight briar full briar a full Kagan a full ... once he got on the court I I I don't think they would have by he I don't think you would have got near an appointment if he hadn't have been a A R a reliable left wing\nA vote by the way there was an interesting a little quote in the wall Street Journal yesterday from a Elena Kagan and she said you know you have\nSome people who were uh in the middle and she said and and sometimes you get an ... you get a ... Sandra Day O'Connor you get a John Paul Stevens you get a suitor that are in the middle and you know ... and and the person who wrote the story said\nHow come none of the left these are ever in the middle how ... how come none of them are ever expected to you know see the light\nAnd and vote for for more sane a judicial decisions it's always it's always the people who are appointed by Republicans that are expected to to bend and evolve and grow\nBut that was a ... it's very interesting the Kagan would be that upfront about it that the you know the because they those ... those for a ... a you know that are the are the liberal orthodoxy they never they never\nBreak very seldom\nNo you're never you never wondering where they come down on any issue but I I was thinking about America Garland I recall when he was nominated he cried\nAnd there weren't think pieces about whether what that meant about his judicial temperament and he was crying and there was no analysis of him showing emotion he didn't get smeared with gang rape allegations he was just nominated and he cried\nYeah I I Know I it was it's ridiculous I and again I think ah you know that's kinda like Mitch McConnell's\nHat trick you know stopping Merrick Garland that's one\nGorsuch is number two and now capital that's three that's a hat trick as far as I'm concerned since said he has to keep it to three okay now that we're we're still open to getting another one who was that guy the red Sox last night hit for the cycle if he gets it gets if if it gets a single double triple at a home run you hit for the cycle was that hold\nThe hulk too I think in this case though hitting for the cycle would be getting funding for the wall\nThat to both in the ... will they will named after him have for four or five hundred forty to forty to a dog your next with highway car go ahead Doug\nHey how I kind of question about due process going to be thrown out I remember a couple of years ago they had a special on\nTalk of all these college guys that were being brought before you know College Board of trustees guys or whatever are being charged with like rape but they couldn't bring a lawyer in or anything like that as an needed that it's actually going to be a case in front of the Supreme Court\nI don't know if it I don't know if it's gone that far but I mean I've read a lot of stories about that you're right though that they you know what they what they were saying is that there were there were several stories about this when they wanted a Christine Ford or\nTo go after a cabinet defended himself not even knowing what you was gonna say and they said this is the ... this is the way it works wouldn't be at these a campus tribunals you know that they know that but I'm at the ... the guy just don't have\nAnybody on that two or three years down the road because they're going to say he has to remove himself from judging hands yeah watch\nNow you know the thing is too I I was thinking about this when I was reading that ... piece on the Harvard law school you know demanding that a cabinet and not be allowed to teach there anymore in the same with Yale Law school\nAnd you know this kind of like the Duke lacrosse case ... ten years ago you know when all the faculty said that everybody on the Duke lacrosse team should be thrown out but I mean those were just liberal arts\nYou know more seats for lack of a better term most were P. H. D. I mean these guys are supposed to be trained in the law or they're being trained in the law I mean it's a little ... it's it's even worse I mean it was bad enough when the\nWhen the do faculty want it to basically Lynch the Duke lacrosse team on no evidence but this is this is even more a disconcerting than that\nBecause these guys you should know better than the than your average a PHD at Duke University thanks for the call Doug Steve your next with highway car go ahead Steve\n... show thank you [noise] you're ... you're tired about Hillary getting help Donald Trump or get elected by bigger last year and a half or panic administrators pushing the trans fats roles\nThey reject or is it fair to the word\nCame and say it and that's what I think a lot of middle America over the edge of Africa now\nYeah well I mean there were so yeah she she wanted open borders a she wanted to she she said she wanted to basically uh you you know repeal Citizens United which was the first amendment she wanted to go after the Heller decision in D.C which was the second amendment\nOr she had no problems with locking these people up like the ... and ah the guy who did the video that they blamed for the ... massacre I mean they they were they they had no problems with the Tea Party or the IRS going after the Tea Party\nI mean if you if you paid any attention at all ... and a two to one of the way the government was operating and the authoritarian stances that were being taken by Obama and the fact that the the mainstream media was a was complete complacent complicit in it\nI I mean you you had to be pretty shocked\nMe ... I mean that was thought that was a defensive vote by sixty three million Americans that was in those with and then they then they had the audacity to call us a deplorable to redeem above like we were ignorant believe me\nMost Trump voters knew a lot more about wars going on than your average Hillary voter and that's why they voted for Trump not because they thought he was a a spiritual leader we talk with Tucker Carlson about this he wrote this like more than two years ago\nNot because they thought he was a a a moral a tight and an exemplar spiritual a guide they voted for him because they needed a bodyguard they needed protection we needed protection from the deep\nState police state and that's what he's given us and that's why a nobody is uh that's why nobody has that dissatisfied with the aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two are nine nine one nine says I Hillary Clinton sounds mad as hell almost like she's not going to take it anymore\n[laughter] eight for four or five hundred forty to forty to fill up your next with how white car go ahead and fill up\nHow is shut them days law school's invalidate the coursework caught that Kevin and therefore invalidate the degrees that we're with those credits\n[laughter] yeah I mean they\nDidn't fund and reading from the tuition for those credit\nBut think about is filled out he was only nominated in July that that was the seven months of the year it's three months later and he's gone from being the or the one of the best teachers they had both of these great law school supposedly great law schools to be a a a you know a pariah\nJust because of just because of uncorroborated charges against them\nYeah he's a great individual and then\nHe is he is I I don't I don't know the guy I'm not a big fan of judges in general for obvious reasons but you know I mean he seems like a really solid human being\nAnd the fact that he's you know the fact that he wasn't a you know uh you know spinning in anybody's space last night he was he was totally gracious and they said All right thanks thanks for the call law they're fill up eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two I'm highway car\nTalk radio [noise]\nHow we got our\nSleep on a Casper you'll picking over every mattress you've ever had tested for yourself or one hundred nights risk free and go to Casper dot com and use coded how wait for fifty dollars towards the purchase of selection mattresses that's Casper ...
