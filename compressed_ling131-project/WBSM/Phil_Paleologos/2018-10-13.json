catches for Ninety nine yards incredible numbers Ronnie\nAnd elected the off instill scoring Thirteen points it still led to a team losing by Twenty one and it still let them being woefully inadequate at the most important position on the field which is quarterback as great as sake one Barkley is\nAnd he clearly skill set wise deserved to be probably the topic of the draft use the best player in the draft okay 'cause he's better than Baker may feel these better than Arnold is better than all these guys he just played the wrong position for the New York giants need and what I mean by that is is as you said in your accurate\n... man has been done for three years and now it's getting worse worse worse the fact is the New York giants\nHad Fifteen Years of stability a quarterback\nNow it's going to be the turmoil of trying to replace Eli Manning how many times or the New York giants can trap number two overall in a quarterback rich draft\nHave the opportunity to get a young quarterback that can sit one year before he ultimately takes over and you hope Rodney 'cause you never know what young quarterbacks that he gives you the next Fifteen Years and you have a transition from a bread far too and Aaron Rodgers where you have stability at the position for decades upon decades\nSake one Barkley is great but it's not helping him win games or one in five young quarterback is much more important and they didn't get one and the giants are going to stink this year one in five they're going to get a high pick next year that quarterback class doesn't seem to be shaping up to be as talented as this one Ronnie that was my problem with the biggest egg\nLumbar ... and you can you can say that and you could say well you know what if they would have gotten Sam Donald and Sam Donald it's not like you said in the world on fire\nIs he's not I mean he's been inconsistent he's been up and down sometimes he looked flat out awful you know the kid has potential but we don't know the

NFL bud owed outback of junior coming off last Sunday's interview where he called out to play calling even didn't stick up for you are manning\nThe antics Thursday Rodney where he's yelling and screaming on the sideline banging his helmet\nThe fan I mean obviously the frustrations building and then he walks off two seconds before half time when the giants have an opportunity the Hail Mary attempt your thoughts on a hotel back and juniors entire week Rodney starting from the interview and what culminated to Thursday\nWell first of all he talked about his interview just everyone says hey he's is just that on his interview and to me even with your interview being honest I'm\nNo matter what you're filling about your teammates that is not the right platform to go out and basically sell your teammates out you talk about your teammates you talk about a quarter back to organization you talking about everything except you yourself\nAnd that's the problem that I had with oh Dale it's fine you know if if you want to go out and criticize somebody which I'm never good when I'm never good with him criticizing somebody but I Am good which you criticizing yourself and saying you know what I Need to grow up I Need to become a better leader I Need to make more place and that's where I have problems with oh Dale back them\nAnd you also have to admit then you have to keep the media out of your locker room we've been around this game a long time and we know one thing in nothing ever comes positive when you allow the media to come into your locker room and really divide your teammates and I think that had an effect on them on Thursday because even I'm\nTroy Aikman talked about he says this team they're not playing with any fired no enthusiasm they just don't have any emotion and I think that's a big part of it but you but instead of me going to the next point I'm gonna let you respond to that because I got some more\nOh why you have more yeah I agree a hundred percent of what you said Rodney I mean you don't I don't think what he said is wrong I just don't think that's the venue to do it right I also think that if you're supposed to be somewhat of a team leader right you're ... the highest paid wide receiver football\nYou are now a veteran to a point you're the most recognizable face so that franchise even more than Eli Manning now\nAnd you're calling out teammates in play calling although correct It's not the venue to do it leaders don't do things like that\nAnd it is upsetting to me to see a guy do that and throw guys under the bus\nEven insinuate things I mean he's not throwing names out there you can easily tell what he's trying to say so to me I did have a lot of problems with ... the way he handled that the form that he used for that Rodney I mean the fact is I mean here's a guy that is kind of quirky right he's kinda shown that over the years some ... yourself right\nI think a combination of both\nI think selfish is a very good word to here I think it's a combination of both he's just seems to be a guy that is out there for himself kind of an Antonio Brown like\nYou know and the giants really roller dies when they and this is the reason why they didn't want to pay ... this is the reason why because they felt like you know he's he's a mentally talented kid but if we pay him he can go off the deep end and anytime you have that one fire cracker and let's face it\nThe giants have no leadership when the giants won previous championships they had big personalities with Michael ... and those guys\nBut they were able to center it all based off of football\nAnd they had great leadership even though they had big personalities and they weren't selfish and\nThey play team ball and that was one of the main reasons why they were able to come up and the biggest moments of the game and win Super Bowls\nAnd wind championships that that was beautiful you know but to me he doesn't understand the impact of his influence you look at sterling shepherd was a kid that he came and he played with a lot of energy had a great smile had a lot a lot of potential\nNow you see him getting upset you see him getting upset and\nThrowing stuff and I'm like now he doesn't understand the influence and then you saw on Thursday nights he like apple he's getting upset and he was given a second chance so you see the frustration\nTrickle down effect and not once did I see a land the comic now wants to see Olivier burning not was not see any of those guys Ogletree come up and grab one of these guys who said ma'am\nCalm down you know and and it's a shame would you have to look at a guy like said climb Barkley who's tried to do the right thing or you know trying to work hard trying to fight and claw for every single yard to do the right thing they absolutely have no leadership and I'm gonna tell you this ban\nIf I'm the giant organization I'm looking to get where we can continue this conversation\nIf I'm the giant organization I'm starting to cut people\nAnd it's not just air flowers and it's a it's a few other names and what we can discuss this next segment but I'm looking to get rid of some people and give some people's attention\nWe are going to keep this going on because I Want to know some of these names you want to talk about but Rodney here's the thing about it think about this it's the giants organization in turmoil this is considered one of the most you know well run organizations in the NFL right it's like the beacon of consistency kind of like the Pittsburgh Steelers the giants\nAre a mess right now think about that they are an absolute mess when it gets these names rowdy and also back and junior walking off the field before half time efficiently start we're going to hear what hotel set in terms of why he did it and do we believe it or not that's next on the safety what's alongside Rodney Harris and not the worst the right here on NBC Sports radio\n\n\nUNBC sports

I Know what he's saying too because at half time is a very very quick halftime unlike college colleges extended I'm ... I'm half time I think it was like twenty minutes\nUm you want to go up in there you want to get the ivy it takes time to get everything the ivy to come in there to get you back hydrated I'd get what he's saying I'm not going to doubt his toughness or his willingness to play the only thing I dealt with oh Dell is is\nIn a sense is selfishness because when you're pointing that everyone else in the locker room and and you've yet to see what you need to do in order to get better I don't think that's a good sign\nI'm not going to question was the meeting hydration or not\nI'm saying is I Hope that's why he did it you know the problem is we've gone to know old job back um junior so much to know that his emotions do seemingly cloud is judgment at times they're they're they're losing years to catch his at that point he's not as significant part of the ... the frustrations mounting\nI'm saying is I Hope you have to walk you have to jog off the field because he needed hydration not out of frustration Ronnie bought\nThe antics on the sideline yelling screaming crying seemingly banging his head against the or the fan with the helmet on that screen that's crazy he looks like a crazy man out their ears are talking about all that\nI was just trying to get myself going you know that that's\nWhere I feel like some of those players right after I was ... some of my best stuff [noise] um so I was just trying to get myself out of 'em and I did that and it is\nIt helped me you know there was a lot of things going on at that hit me fired over it like I said if we bring out the best way to bring out the energy um [noise]\nI don't know the way around it but\nTo wait ... the stats wars that Syria was six catches for forty something yards forty some odd yards\nYeah forty four yards with no touchdowns and that brought out the best of him [laughter] like ... let me ask you this [noise] listen\nI've been around his game a long time okay forty five years old I mean what does it who does this guy I think he is I mean does he think like ... complete idiots maybe and once again he made it all about him\nLike when you're doing that and you're yelling and screaming like that you may be pumping you up but it may become a distraction to someone else I like all day all men I like the fact that he's fiery and he's competitive but he has to understand there's a difference between doing that and being a distraction\nIn in in in in a little further than that where's the leadership like why is everyone so afraid to get in this guy's face\nIs like you know what he's so popular and he's this and he's the studies high paid guy and there's no one that's willing to get in his face and cherish this guy on that team I\nI don't believe it it's like wow these these kids are so afraid of oh they'll back I'm like why\nNot just the kids were patch termer [laughter] where's the head coach where's that where's the offensive coordinators anybody in a leadership position saying listen Odessa settled down man quote banging your head quick crying but by the way who needs who cries and things are headed for to get themselves from ...\nThat that's the weirdest I've never seen a guy used that supports himself up\nThat's district he's listen he's a strange guy he is he's very selfish\nStrange guy to say the least and then we talked about Ronny maybe it's time to try and start to consider life after oh dumped back and junior but Romney I Do want to get into a potentially thinking about life after certain somebody life after chasing Garrett for the Dallas Cowboys are we closer to that reality Rodney\nBecause Jerry Jones finally called out his coach that's next to safety blitz Rodney Harrison dance what's been right here on NBC Sports radio [noise]\nZero Johnson used to be see sports radio [noise]\n[noise]\n\nIf you suffer from E.

to a great point what's been the\nBiggest problem for Jason Garrett as you put it it is lacking creativity on officers Rodney\nAnd you're right may lack written there's nothing creative about that often Rodney ... during the break we're kind of talking about I Want you to you know tell listeners about what you're saying in terms of the moves they made and what it is meant or what had happened meant for this team\nYou go over here to guide third round draft choice micro Gallup and he's a big kid he can run down the field yet you don't take chances down the field\nYou don't really address you tied in position um [noise] what else um have on Austin you might have on also yeah I mean he's supposed to be this guy is gimmicky guy comes in and he's supposed to be a big guy kind of like a ... and he hasn't I mean he has\nTo the hype it anything like that but to me it's just a lack of development would that Prescott um he he holds the ball to long he takes half the sax that he gets his his fault because he just he was like he he's afraid to be dynamic is like he's a robot like he has all this\nJust this talent waiting to just for some young\nYou know I'm Sean McVeigh type to bring out and he just has not developed into the quarterback that I thought he would be I mean yes he displays maturity he says the right thing and he you know he wants to be a leader\nBut this this kid has not really progress to the quarterback that I thought he would be and if I'm Dallas and it's unfortunate but I'm looking at him and saying really is is he going to be the quarterback of the future I Know Jerry Jones came out last week and say yeah he's going to be a quarterback of the future\nBut something has to change and that tells me that well you don't believe in ... I'm Jason gear you criticize them for the fourth one play and yet you're saying the deck is going to you're going to commit to that if you commit to that you cannot commit to Jason Garrett\nThere's two things when it comes to that Prescott I look at Rodney one is ease his growth stunted because adjacent Garrett and there is a lot more talent there that if you got the right person to nurture him he would become that superstar but he probably should be too\nI Wish he would play more like Cameroon I Would I I mean to me jak Prescott\nNeeds to open it up more in terms of his abilities his his running I mean this is the guy that's only rush twenty three times a year and he has that ability to make people ... to have that be a weapon maybe not quite as good as Cam Newton but he certainly has that ability\nAnd he needs to just kind of let it out there I mean you you you have to be ready to fail\nTo be a successful player right not every throw is going to veto wide open receiver sometimes you have to throw in coverage and give your guy a chance and I think somebody's just got to tell jak press Alison deck\nJust go out there and have fun I think he's trying too hard Ronnie in the sense of being perfect and that's impossible to do as you know having played so long in the NFL\nHe he doesn't have that person that he can sit there with there isn't a mentor type of person for jak Prescott ever the cowboys it puts them in a precarious position 'cause as you said although Jerry Jones says this is our quarter back to the future why would you invest a hundred and forty million dollars in debt Prescott right now\nWhy would you do it it might be the worst contract and football history when it's all said and done because I don't know what he truly is\nThat is that part here he's average he's an average quarterback\nIs the average because that's what we're seeing or do you think in terms of his skill set he's just an average ...\nNo I think his skill set is definitely above average I think the cowboys have failed him I think you know Jason Garrett's inability to develop this kid ... with the system I think often salon I think we all know that often the line is over rated and they've got an older fast\nI'm I just think that you know obviously they they they don't have enough weapons and we we I mean we can continue to say this over and over again but I look at that and he's just and and you hit it perfectly Dan you talk just let it loose\nJust go go with it like stop trying to be this robot trying to be this perfect quarterback\nJust play football you got into this game\nTo rely on your instincts to let certain things take over and to me he tries to be this perfect role model quarterback man\nKim that's why I Love about can you can talk about how inaccurate he is and how you know you can say what you want but that kid wheels his team to win and he gets up and he celebrates and he he gets pumped up the crowd pumps gets pumped up the defense the effects the special teams you see them wide receivers coming over there and then they're shooting hoops and\nThat's what I Want to see from that you know there's limitations that we all have on the football field but the one thing that gets everybody pump\nAnd your emotional when you care you get excited\nSo some fire show some excitement and now to help get your team to the next level and it's okay sometimes if you go to the often go to line of scrimmage and you've got eight nine guys in the box and maybe on a second down and for instead of him and the ball off you check to a bomb\nAnd tested defense and let them know and send them a message that you're going to throw the ball deep\nThat's what I Want to see from Prescott I'm tired of him playing this conservative road trying to play this perfect quarterback and it's not working this is your career because at the end of the day if you continue to be average that Prescott they're not going to pay you\nOkay and don't get an injury then all of sudden\nEverything changes so that's what I'm saying well you have an opportunity now may take over the game you're the one behind quarterback and win lose or draw they're going to always blame you\nYeah you're absolutely right about that you can tune you we can sit here and talked about his fault but\nYou said it at least this is a guy that will take an opportunity you give us guys that chance I respect the quarterback that would write U.S Open it up and go three un out with conservative play calling and literally thinks and dunks and that's you're right I mean can new to me at least has how do I put this intestinal fortitude\nI'd yeah you've got to fire it mattered and like he want he feels like I'm the best guy on the field and at the end of the day when all else fails I'm going to run I'm going to run over three guys if I have to to get that first down I'm a I'm a I'm a go to that goal line run to the one run through two or three guys get helicopter and

C. sports radio [noise]\nYou know to get get comfortable I think I think ultimately Dan this this game is going to come come down to both offices are going to move the ball up and down the field\nI think ultimately it's going to come down to which team I remember I said this which team can score and a red zone and which quarterback will make that fatal mistake that's what it's going to come down to because neither one of these defenses I Believe in do you believe in in ... either one of these differences\nNow I don't care what Kansas City did against the Jackson holding them to what fourteen points I don't believe in these defenses the strengths of both these teams clearly or the officers their average defenses up asked Rodney\nAbsolutely absolutely and and you'll get you'll get every now and then you'll get a game where Kansas City or a patriot to stand out and they'll look good and everybody of jump back on the bandwagon but for me you know watching the tape these these defenses aren't very good so it's going to come up and down they're going to drive the ball up and down but you know one guy and I'm looking at\nAnd and this is the guy you know Julian Edelman with him coming back you could just see a different energy with Tom Brady and times been successful without Julian\nBut when he's in there he just gives them a different energy he positive he's pumped up he knows he has his most reliable target but there's one other guy that I really really anxious to see and I believe this guy's going to play a huge role against\nThe Kansas City linebackers and that's James White James White seems to always be that one guy to pet feel and I know they're excited about Sony Michel but James White in the past in game against these line backers are going to prove huge\nHe is on pace for over a hundred catches right now he's got the most perceptions it's unbelievable what James was done and it's funny because he's he's a he's a proto typical patriot player in the sense of\nKevin ... could have gone elsewhere probably and put up bigger numbers but he had his role he knew as Roland played so well in kind of you know you've got the credit but people don't you know you look at the statistics are not like wow you know Kevin Fox James White the same way James White plays a role and plays it so well\nAnd you look and you say my goodness this is the guys have a hundred catches this year because you never think it because he goes about and does does its job but here's a guy I'm and I'm interested to watch and okay\nJosh corn in that Tom Brady got a bit more comfortable last week right and how much more comfortable they're going to be this week because for Tom Brady Josh Gordon is that new shiny toy and he is by the way a Ferrari\nAnd and I'm gonna tell you this anytime you\nI'm Out there against Orlando scanned trick\n[laughter] okay Orlando's [laughter] I I ... you only have to be in all senses system a long time to know that a man just run a deep ... or run a deep out Ronald polls ... just go the\nOkay I'm going to put the ball up for grabs you sick for your absolute monster I'm going to give you some opportunities and I believe that's going to be part of the game plan\nBut let's get back enough what Tom Brady let's talk about this young kid patch homes and and to me the you know aside from his arm and his scrambling and everything what's really impressed me is the way he's handled all the pressure and and all the hype\nYou know you sit back and you think about when you listen to him talk he's always very complimentary of his coaches he's always very complimentary of his teammates\nOkay we talked earlier about oh Dale back I'm pointing the finger but what was passed my homes is done he's pointing the finger and said hey a big part of the reason why I'm In a position of succeeding right now is because of my teammates because of my coaches\nAnd and I think that's huge and I think they get excited about him I think part of the reason why they've embrace Tim is because he's so unselfish and he's so humble and when you have that alone with the success that he's having that's why they they've embrace this young guy Dan they absolutely love\nWhat impresses me is this when he comes out of Texas Tech I'm thinking All right strong arm as wrong as not as strong arm as we've really ever seen\nHe's going to want to force it in there he's going to want to be Brett Farr vest to where he knows he's got a great canon so he's got thrown to double and triple coverages and sometimes it works and sometimes you get picks off right that spread that was by far you know what though he's not\nHe this is a guy who yeah they'll make some mistakes and you might as well be a rookie had one start last your final game of the season\nYou know before they decided to turn the page this year but he make smart decisions Rodney he's not a guy that just recklessly throws a football in there\nHe knows what he's doing he's got great command visibility that's the surprising thing for me because young quarterbacks and he just turned twenty three less than a month ago Rodney with a cannon like that want to utilize it and show off and instead he is sewing control themselves for such a young age that's been the most impressive thing for me Ronnie\nI have a question for you salads and maybe you can get into this who's the better tied in driving skills soon run in ... where you take and right now\nTravis Kelsey only because he's healthier the Rodney I'm really curious who do you think it's better between drunk or Kelsey\nWould say tribes Kelsey and the reason why I say that now is because\nYou know when when you look at him and they do so many different things where whether it's screens whether it's um you know they isolate him one on one\nHe's so athletic and you know yes obviously corners are safe bees or linebackers I think it's always a mismatch but the guy he runs such good routes great speed and he brings a level of energy and and probably more than all that he's healthy\nWhen you see robbed and cows ski running his routes last week he still hurt\nHe's not a hundred percent and Rob is really good in the blocking game but Travis is something about this all fence and it's something about the way they utilize him you know it's not like he has a lot of quiet games\nYou know and he's just so difficult to match up with and I know robs a big big God but we've seen him get taken out I think Jacksonville took him out some double coverage them one on one by ... Gibson are we seeing Detroit do a pretty good job on cronk ... will disappear\nYou know Travis I just think Travis is young he's healthy he's kinda in his prime and he's doing his thing 'cause there's not a knock against growing rock is you know I think rock is one of the top two or three tied in that ever played the game but if I'm taking\nBut China right now I'm taking them tribes Kelsey\nI agree I think right now here's the thing it's health related\nAll time Robert gas is as you said top two or three times in the history this game three three catches away by the way you will get the five hundred catches in this game for his career that's impressive at twenty nine years old but in terms of health but ... you know Robin ... taking shots over the years right\nNot head shots I'm worried about it so it's nice shots they need people have had to go low on him because he's such a big guy and it takes a toll he's got the ankle situation now is limited and practice on Wednesday He's obviously playing but the fact is\nHe is just not healthy and I don't think we see a healthy Rob Gronkowski much and yet he still does what he does Travis Kelsey right now I think is you know I don't know if it's better maybe just healthier Rodney so is the way to put it 'cause I don't know if he's actually a better player per se ... an all time\nGreat I think he's more dynamic right now yeah you know he can do more you can do more with them because obviously smaller little bit you know faster and a little bit more athletic ... when he gets gone and you don't ... don't you you know we had this discussion he made an excellent point he said hey if there's one game\nYou know and and I had to pick one guy would be ... and you know probably that's true because I'm Rob has played in big games\nYou know he's he's done it on the biggest stage and and you know Travis\nTravis you know he's been he's been really good but he's no wrong but I'm just saying right now as of now and maybe you're right then because of health and because of the way they are utilizing him you know I I think maybe that's something that you know but you know when I look at Kansas City is often it's um\nYou know everyone thinks that this is a office this just big place this is a very diverse often and you know a lot of times you can say well just don't give up the big play\nWell that's not the case in his office because this office has proven that they can go on long sustained drive they go they can drive they can go on ten twelve fourteen play drives a very patient often everything's not a big place or the perception out there is this this is just a big play off ants which retail and all these weapons\nNo this is a very disciplined often where Andy Reid doesn't matter mind going six eight ten twelve fourteen play drives and I think that's the thing that really makes them\nA lot different than the perception of what people have\n... absolutely right Kansas City impressive they take their own you know they take their you know on beating record\nInto Fox burrow on Sunday Night Football football in America starts at seven PM game time after that make sure to watch it it's going to be awesome right there on NBC alright the Twitter questions Rodney answers them next right here on the safety blitz Robbie Harris and dance what's been on NBC Sports radio [noise]\n... and you're listening to NBC Sports radio [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] as\nA small business owner you make every dollar county so what can you do with ten dollars go to this to print dot com today and you'll get five hundred high quality custom business cards for only nine Ninety nine that's less than two cents for cars\nAnd enlist in print your satisfaction is absolutely guaranteed so it's never been easier to turn five hundred strangers into connections just visit this to print dot\nCom and use promote code two thousand and check out that Mr print dot com promo code to zero zero zero\nOh hey this is interesting what the minimum that you to tell you about my ... she didn't each week I'm joined by special that some of\n... stop by pop football [noise] get you inside scoop on the biggest story and maybe even a little bit about that if you have a tag in your closet that says structure that things got it [laughter]\n[noise] that's wrap sheet in France they held on apple pie ... or your favorite", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Phil Paleologos", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "13"}
