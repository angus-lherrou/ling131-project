you know what's been going on with the FBI and it's you know it's clearer and clearer they they were up trying to what\nSome birds that the two thousand sixteen presidential election and then they were trying to overthrow the the the regime\nThe administration I should say of a president Donald Trump\nWith ah with Rod Rosenstein and or at least a page and Peter Struck and et cetera et cetera well there's another corrupt or agency police agency and us the Massachusetts state police you know about the all the stuff that's been going on the overtime scandals\nOut on the turnpike uh the uh the hiring a drug dealer or drug kingpin as a a because she was the girlfriend or one of the lieutenant colonels trying to uh uh ... squelch a a drunk driving case for a uh\nThe state police tried to destroy all the records it's some it's an astonishing story state police tried to destroy payroll investigations as fraud investigation began\nIts on bleeping believable\nSo stay what's the polar question one of the results that's far which law enforcement agency has more corrupt the Massachusetts state police or the Federal Bureau of investigation\nI I'm I'm truly amazed by what's going on with the state police but I you know ... the the the Federal Bureau of investigation has been corrupt for all basically all of its existence and now they've tried to ah they've tried to\nEngage in a soft coup against the duly elected president United States I still have to vote for the FBI as bad as the state police are yeah sixty one percent say it's the FBI yeah\nBut I mean who who would who could imagine I mean even just a couple of years ago that they would the both of these agencies and again I I had more respect for the state police than I did for the FBI 'cause I I knew\nThe people in the ... a lot of the some of the people and the FBI in Boston office I I seen them literally in action\nAnd I knew what they were there were there were ...\nBut I didn't think that the state police were this bad but they are there's no doubt about it you imagine if a if if they if the Democrats nominated a real candidate for governor\nCharlie Baker would have a problem but as it is this story broke yesterday there was a debate last night it between the first debate between Charlie called Deval Baker the Republican incumbent who's responsible for all this because he's the governor\nAnd his Democratic opponent and didn't even come up because the Democrat uh apparently the staff is so darn good they didn't notice the story being posted on the Internet\nIt's talk about incompetence\nGood lord aid for four or five hundred forty to forty to press your next with our car and go ahead Chris\nI think they're both just sent from ah the Florida State police and the two thousand election last Fifteen thousand votes uh yeah it was a candidate rather I think it's something to do that\nBut that's my original plan was I think that Trump's not declassify nose or even you know I'm sure he would do because they ... him wrong and that's the army's\nReally as efficient kitchen well you\nKnow so so why is it why let me let me put it this way why hasn't anyone been indicted\nWhat are you talking about\nWhy hasn't anyone Barry ... Russian collusion nothing's about Russia and they're not there where where where's the Trump campaign's connection to the Russian collusion\nWith out\nIf the if there was a Chris if there was anything to us why why was Carter Page calling into the show on on Monday and laughing about this why is Carter Page texting back and forth with us in joking why isn't Carter Page I hid in prison somewhere why
