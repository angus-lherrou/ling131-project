eighty seven eighty eight school year I was I Witness to a shocking ceremony taking place inside the\nDelta Kappa epsilon fraternity house that involved a semi circle of cheering front rows watching the local prostitute perform a public sector\nI have three additional eyewitnesses and two additional non witnesses or those non witnesses are always very valuable quarter law\nTo uh to whom I related the event back in the late eighties I Can't say for certain that I Can't say for certain the judge Kavanaugh was present in the frat house during the uh vet but he was still at Yale during the time period attending Yale Law school and I\n... back\nHe may have attended what would have been a big party at the ... newly purchased off campus house\nSince I Know the name of one of the party's attendees and since we know the judge Kavanaugh saves meticulous personal calendars from his past it shouldn't be too difficult to ascertain whether he was present at this event yes grace\nYou know what you can say a lot of things about fryers and we might not be ideal either yes or no from Providence College would ever be this leisurely these people are the worst you can you can even not go to a party without someone coming forward to the press people aren't tension seeking will no kidding\nBut there's this guy is worse apparently he uh he he uh has created it about this but senator Coons sent this letter I guess to a ... to to Grassley the chairman of the committee and uh so Grassley writes back to him and this is the great part of this I was disappointed\nWhen you forwarded me allegations regarding relating to judge Kavanaugh's years in New haven quote unquote the accuser who apparently created the TV show in which people strip wild dancing to their favorite music\nTells of a party that took place at the house of judge Kavanaugh's undergraduate fraternity during the Nineteen eighty seven eighty eight school year which allegedly featured some salacious activity\nOf course judge Kavanaugh had already graduated when this party allegedly took place in was the first year law student that period is as you well know the most academically intense time and most law students lives will come back we'll\nTake calls when we return today for four or five hundred and forty to finish this letter from a Senator Grassley castigated\nNow he's he's he's written the scholarly study
