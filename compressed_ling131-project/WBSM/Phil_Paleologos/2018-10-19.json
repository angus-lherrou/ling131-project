those\nThat caravan of migrants rush toward the border bridge in Mexico just afternoon local time it's hundreds of federal police and Guatemalan cops in riot gear stood guard\nUm does actually reminds me I don't know if we had this cut but Rosie o'donald we're talking about how she thought that Marshall Law should have been put in place when Trump got elected because we weren't sure about what happened with Russia\nAnd she said something about oh you know whatever and the whole law chimes in and it's like he wants to put troops at the border and says it was like such discuss if that's completely crazy like using our own army to protect our own borders right\nWhen he was elected what I wrote on Twitter was we should impose martial law to make sure that the Russians were involved in the final tallies the votes and bought another husband died at Thirteen Russians for election though I like martial law what's wrong with you know we're a little essay where he wants to send an alternative the border so I Would have been in the military to the White House to get here [laughter]\nI just want to have a caller insane Rosie o'donald though I don't expect anything that are from her but not all it's like saying he wants to say to the point where it's like yeah yeah the president and this is a country being invaded that where you\nWhere are you supposed to send troops if you're not going to defend the borders against them invasion and the right this is this is an invasion they're coming over here to they want to be supported by us in other words they want to subjugate us and make them work to support them\nI mean ... that's about to me is an invasion of and you want to talk about craziness what the Democrats why don't we play this uh this Castro cut this congressman Castro\nI mean talk about out of his ... he's ... this guy Castro he wants to ... he's another guy he's like a macho senator he wants to he wants to run for president too from Texas and I listen to this theory this was this a conspiracy theory he's ... five\nLet me get to the point that I think is the most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list\nTo the crown prince to envious of Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that and one of the people that he took action against Mr ... soldiers getting just as they are coming out and\nWe don't have I just want to be there for a viewer as we do not have that reporting I'm not sure\nWhere you're getting there had been reporting to that effect or not I've seen a cording to that effect sure a flight\nSure how how crazy busy enough to be when CNN CNN is the sponsor of the ultimate fake news of the Trump era which is the dodgy ... and and and they're backing off this it's so crazy\nIt was a U.S intelligence and the Trump Administration are working together U.S intelligence has been trying to engineer a soft coup against the Trump Administration since since before he was elected president\nAnd and now his his son in law is conspiring with quote unquote U.S intelligence to kill this guy but you know I'm going to guess Trump had no idea who this guy was I don't know about you I had no idea who he was\nCan you imagine imagine if a Jim Jordan went on Fox and said that Obama and Valerie Jarrett were conspiring to kill people in Iran I mean come on\nBoth strategy and this guy this going to be no blowback for this guy he's he's got the uh he's got a card you know he sees no one's going to go after him\nBut you know crazy too is that a lot of people keep saying oh the Democrats don't have any messages you know they're not running on anything and it's like I don't think they're running on anything they're just choosing really convoluted conspiracy theory to use as a way to get votes like Republicans may say you know the economy's good\nYou know we want to protect the borders those things you write a note card and go out and kind of you know rally people's gather for it\nNow what now what are you gonna go up with this Saudi Arabia thing and that's how you're going to get votes it seems like they're losing they don't have that they don't have any sort of direct message to get people out it's all just\nCreate some new slogans like the taxpayers are sending a go the distance for dysentery\nSo after him down to the war has war whooping\nCough so after ... ... people started ripping Castro uh he put out a statement on Twitter to be clear I did not intend to accused Jared Kushner of orchestrating anything\nHe doesn't he just he didn't mean to but he did [noise]\nOh I also want to get the story in front of break man arrested for threatening Kavanaugh support on Saturday of yeah\nA Long Island

know the kids are getting drunk and football players that sort of stuff so anyway when she started cracking down on the football players who were carrying on for you know bad behavior\nJoke paternal went to the guy that ran the thing ... said look I I run this whole school and you know basically he ran out of town and this happened you know about a year before hand she testified in Louis Freeh

but I think they're their to their too powerful to be brought to justice because they have these giant trust funds and\nAnd uh you know what five members of the Supreme Court went to Harvard and all these ... and you know we've been even people like Bill gates you know he's a he's a drop out from Harvard Marc soccer bird he's a drop out from Harvard but they all these all these rich people all
