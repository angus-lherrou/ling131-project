course of course we ... the thing I don't think it's a I you know she's\nShe's a little worse for wear but you know that happens with that line of work you know I I don't think she's a horse face\nNeither do I know neither do I have and I'm actually glad that you don't think that I here's my thing and I and we can argue about that where you're never gonna change my opinion never gonna

and the great state of Texas she will confirmed or whether she saw her and she knows nothing about me a total ...\nSee I'm just saying this from a female perspective on sometimes going after women's looks whether you're on the left side of politics to the right side a lot of women have had something in their life or someone said something mean about the way they look and you don't forget it like someone says I mean you never forget so it doesn't play well with women when you insult and I'm In a high point\nTo in his life he didn't call her horse race that he I mean he's right\nAbout your thought fondly of her but I mean she's also been playing kind of nasty\nShe's so slowly had but he is the president and sometimes it's okay to say you know you could take a little bit more of the high

holding off for so long probably from advice from or legal legal team for the past couple of months so he definitely just let loose but\nAs someone who just sit and read all the headlines this would have been easy day for him to do would\nYou like great had already like granny who's all was the other granted it was all was a you know calling and when she's loaded pretending that Russian accents I

... like contributions and you see the people you're face to face you feel good afterwards\nBut online giving money to Stormy Daniels you seem to have money to burn or they're just very fiscally irresponsible because anyone would have a brand new would be like I don't need to get money for that probably put this towards something\nOut because they don't have much of a life that's all I Know Stormy Daniels go ...\nAnd let's pretend that this wasn't it didn't take two to tango here but she got herself in this situation as well she wanted all this attention admitted it yeah so it's like why

Cherokee guy on with him like the the leader of the Cherokee Nation or whatever and the guy was saying oh you know like this is why it's bad it's like you shouldn't have done it and Jake Tapper said you know to play devil's advocate she didn't say she was part of a tribe the that's the point the\nPoint where the ... or I Want to grow it powwow chow it's ... it's right out there Elizabeth Warren
