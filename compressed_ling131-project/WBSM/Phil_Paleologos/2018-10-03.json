oath yes absolutely Ninety six percent say yes how it All right I'm not a big fan of uh Jonah Goldberg usually but yeah\nI like this a column that he wrote last night you idiot reporters are making it worse\nAnd he's talking about how there it's just that it's just a mob just it's like the it again it's like those are crazy a middle aged tags that are uh are prowling through through the halls of the capital's just screaming at a at people where they're at Reagan National airport when they get off the planes\nAnd he says a mob behavior has a powerful capacity to make smart people dom as Tommy Lee Jones says and men in black person is smart people are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it\nI was doing in MSNBC host this morning sound almost panicked about how the FBI might not be able to confirm Julie sweat next absolutely ludicrous charges against Kavanaugh even as she reported that NBC couldn't confirm any of it\nThe fear palpable in many quarters is that the charges against cabinet are unraveling prematurely and so the press must start rambling them back by the way the FBI is supposedly on the verge of delivering the report to the a GOP senators the or the Senate Judiciary committee I guess\nOr if they can't wrap all them they must spend new stories hence the New York Times' decision for which they've now apologized up assigning deeply and openly moon bat partisan reporter Emily basil on the ghost flunking for the latest bomb shell that Brett Kavanaugh through some ice at a bar scuffle well in college\nMeanwhile whole panels of pundits and experts on MSNBC or made up of people who cannot imagine or claim they can't imagine why cabinet might be upset at the un verified uncorroborated and literally unbelievable claims that he ran a gang raped gang when he was Fifteen\nInstead we get hours of hand wringing every day about his supposedly on judicial temperament as if any judge or justice on the bench now are ever would be expected to remain calm under such circumstances not to mention just judges and justices somebody anybody in general\nI've yet to hear anyone ask a Democrat is what Mitch McConnell bits of Merrick Garland very different from what you people have done to Cavanaugh I mean Republicans didn't try to destroy Garland personally and professionally\nOn nearly every question an issue the tenor of the press shockingly mirrors the tenor of the Democrats is he a Jonah are you really shocked by that\nBecause it could anything be more predictable than that at this point\nMirrors the tenor of the Democrats who insist that it's false that Kavanaugh to disprove all these allegations that is an understandable albeit morally grotesque position\nFor partisan hacked Democrats who've made it clear they'll do whatever it takes again as Chuck Schumer admitted to block Kavanaugh but that's not your job you supposedly objective journalists you should care every bit as much about this proving the allegations of sweat Nick Ramirez and yes Ford as proving them your job as you said ...\nScreening in your heroic martyr status here in the age of Trump is to report the facts\nYou're not supposed to be rooting for one team or the other\nIt's fine if you support the me too movement in your private time but you're not supposed to lend any movement aid and comfort never mind air cover in your reporting\nYou wouldn't mind aid and comfort but it's the air cover that's the problem\nYou might also consider why millions of people now love it when Trump says that people are the enemy of the people it's because of how you are behaving right now you're letting the mask slip and Nielsen monitored Fifteen minute blocks of virtue signaling partisanship\nYou're burning credibility at such a rate you won't have enough to get back to base when this is all over\nIt's a good point those are all good points aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two Dennis your next with highway car go ahead Dennis\n... listening to that

her sophomore year in high school so she apparently by our own account didn't have any problems for the last two years in high school\nBut once you got to Capitol Hill she got some ... she started having problems now that doesn't actually very very likely either does it\nSeems like a little estimate hours\nYeah I Know it it ... somebody today actually came up with a chart I think it was an engineer but he was in power line blog dot com you have a chart of how many of all the I was a tie it was various timelines when she said it happened because it happened yeah mid\nTo late eighties when she was a a when she was a late teenager or a ... then it then it became then she narrow it down to it could have been in the summer of eighty to eighty three eighty four and then finally she nailed it down to this one summer of eighty two she's she's slowly work that down and this is like the six a version\nOf of what had happened eight for four or five hundred the forty to forty to

got nothing and they're going crazy so is this is my question what did Democrats do\nWhen that happens as far as they have like ... ... they can't go back to Russia we heard about it for two months I haven't heard of\nWorms year also for two years right [laughter]\nSince the summer since the summer it's been insane I haven't heard the word Russia in a solid week yeah they can go back to it so what are they thinking\nSince the summer it's been insane I haven't heard the word Russia in a a solid week yeah they can go back to it so what do they get they get either gonna lay down and die literally or ... or you know ah they got to do some soul winter\nI I don't know I I don't know my I mean I'm not I'm not on the mailing list so I I don't know but I mean the boy who know that this story was in the works in the New York times I mean not that this is going to ... this this is a a real a nonstarter of a story about Trump's taxes in his father's taxes who's been dead for almost Twenty years\nBut ah they they'll they'll come up with something though they they all was well like they like it was new I mean but you know you're you're right about Russia about Mike or did you see the latest started on the Mueller investigation what he's doing\nYou know Roger Stone that phrase Roger Stone is this I he's you know we have some connection he's in New York Republican uh and he's kind of a a flamboyant character he's been on the show before he's written some a crazy books he has a big a giant tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back\nI mean that's that's tells you all you need to know about Roger Stone so apparently Mahler is interviewing witnesses about his emails and his tweets and his social media as if somehow that's going to lead to charges against Roger Stone and then Roger Stone will somehow flip\nOn Donald Trump is if Roger Stone has anything to ah to put Donald Trump in in prison I mean how far away or are we away from my ... when we get the Roger Stone\nYou know it's

it completely resolved\nShe knows about this so it makes no sense that she's up they're acting like this like she's just about to collapse why did she go get treatment she knows her there\nWhat do you mean it makes no sense Gary I mean it doesn't it make or didn't it make her more sympathetic character that you seem that she was a you know and even though that happened thirty six years ago she still seem to what\nThe U.S are suffering this a terrible trauma from the the alleged incident that she could that and again she they they they portrayed it the the fact that she couldn't remember anything added to her credibility that's the way that that's the way it was portrayed by the Democrats in the mainstream media\nAbsolutely you know one thing I'd love to see how it is someone brings forth ended a candid video clip\nOf what she really talks like and acts like she's not for the Senate committee well\nI [laughter] you know that you know most people now there there is some video or

you know when it comes to paying taxes they to toss around quarters like they were manhole covers\nJohn Kerry didn't want to pay the excise taxes on his new yacht that is that his wife gave him as a a consolation prize from losing to George Bush he they all have asked they're always heavily invested in these municipal a bond funds which means you don't pay any taxes on them\nYou know the the Clinton they may make rubble donations of mildew shower curtains unused underwear and took write offs why how come these people want to you and me militant normal to pay our fair share a crutch like
