mainstream media\nIs Arthur I'm not we're not going to a TV set but people are texting me they say on CNN and MSNBC and they're calling a cabinet shop all us counter insurgency lectures\nI like that going for what they went through the night that from one of the awful but but you know something I Want you to do me a favor highly could\nYou please find out what kind of beer that Kavanaugh drinks because I like to give it to everybody who works for me if I can get a guy like him\nI you know what I'll well we'll see what we can I I don't know that we we've never\nAscertain that we do know that at that bar in a New Haven where he got into that terrible bar fight where they were throwing rocks at each other he was drinking pints so maybe he's again sky Arthur ... Guinness is good for you that's OK thanks for the call\nYou know the other thing is too highly that a lot of people are forgetting is that\nPeople say oh well this has never happened if Jeb Bush was president and they probably maybe they wouldn't have like gone this low but maybe they whatever ... gasoline wouldn't have happened as a Jeb Bush type of guy would not stuck with Kavanaugh going through the my bike that that the Trump thing only Donald Trump\nYou know say a lot of things about him he's loyal to these people like you think he's going to flip on this guy when he's gone to the exact same thing in South\nRight that some of the some of the right wing websites were saying earlier this week you know they're you know there are reasons why you know ... not that great of a pick he's kind of a moderate he worked for George Bush uh you know he he uh\nUh some of the stuff they actually Susan Collins went through in a in in her ah in in her week long speech on the Senate floor earlier today\nAnd uh you know about how he uh he he protected quote unquote Affordable Care act\nThey say about Obamacare but you know what I I think this would this really is a a life changing experience as we were talking about I mean how can you how can you go through something like this\nThese these kinds of filed charges these death threats against your family he had to flee the moon bats came out and the vandalized his house they were they spray painted all this crap on his garage doors and every ... he's going to remember this for the rest of his life and it's\nNot just okay the you expect to a certain extent these moon that they're absolutely out of their minds but the worst people are like the guys he went to Yale with\nWho actually had normal jobs that are coming out and saying oh I'm a lawyer but this is why I don't think he should be noted how ridiculous today feel right now how ridiculous to know that all you did was show yourself to be a complete ... and he's going to be at school and there were three\nPeople today that yesterday or today wrote a wrote a column an op ed piece in the Washington Post they said we went to Yale with Brett Kavanaugh and drank with them and that's why he should be confirmed where\n... and then once you're a rat yeah it said I'm I'm drinking buddies with Brett Kavanaugh this is why I don't think he should be confirmed thinker I save it for somebody who cares okay no one cares\n[laughter] yeah I sort of a sudden my call today I got cut out so you can read it online though I quoted I'm One of the mafia guys from New Jersey and again ... horns a prisco\nAnd he said they said on our ah there's no water he said it's it's like a bakery they take in they they take tickets waiting to rat you out apparently Yale is a lot like the New Jersey mafia you know they're just ... they were taking tickets to rat\nThem out and I thought another thread that said oh you know Brett Kavanaugh lied he said he got into Yale from busting his butt but really he was a legacy ... yeah I like he was also he was also ranked ... in his high school class\nNumber well yeah I'd like to the people writing my column today in the Herald on the message boards a oh he's just a rich punk\nI didn't get the feeling that that look at it that house that he lives in I didn't get the feeling he's got a big trust fund\nThe Jew he's ... he's not as his wife is a civil servant works for a a which is a town manager or city manager in Maryland He's making these making good money as a judge which make it like a hundred and Seventy five thousand but he had a millionaire I don't think\nAnd they kind of run into the Trump problem where they want him to be so evil\nThat their own logic gets mixed up with Trump it oh he's too rich to be president oh but he's also he's also pour he doesn't have that much money by our cabin I it's like\nOh he's a you know he's too much he's it's too much toxic masculinity oh he cried he's such a loser when you can make up your mind a little bit you can't have everything about him\nAnd then he he's he's in the upper middle class a white Ivy League puck but on the other hand he's a low class dropped\n... when you guys have puts catch up on it for Getty and then Trump put ketchup on a steak that they're really against politics aside they hate catch Margaret\nYour next with our car go ahead
