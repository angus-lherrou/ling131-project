a long time very intense\nThem was presidents from this morning in a actually it was a very reassuring\nA press availability and anyone who believes that there was some kind of secret and Trump desire to unseat Nikki Haley here whether she's planning to run against him she's not a as a matter of fact she made that extremely clear\nA ... ... is she a presidential possibility for the future of of course is\nIs she just about the strongest Republican nominee monk and think of for nine for two thousand twenty four\nOr for two thousand and twenty for that matter\nYeah I think she is she was a terrific governor of South Carolina we enjoyed having her on the show or she is a natural when it comes to politics and she handled the un job with so much dignity in class even when she had to work with Rex Tillerson\nWho was in an ideal partner for her as secretary of state the um uh she did a comment about\nThis rumor that she's going to be challenging Trump for the nomination in two thousand twenty of course that's ridiculous she won't and here is Nikki Haley making at about as close as clear as she possibly could\n\nThe southwest enough to know when you step aside and\nI Will say this on are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can\nI look forward to supporting the front\nA President Trump said that's so good and uh of course it is and it's appropriate look this doesn't mean that a Nikki Haley didn't have some disagreements with people in the Trump Administration she did\nA but she managed to work with the president and apparently the president deserves all credit according to all observers for allowing Nikki Haley to do or job\nAnd it's very unusual for a un representative because look you're talking about such a corrupt organization\nBut she stood up for the country\nAnd did it with class and eloquence\nHere's President Trump this morning and and again this was a press availability where they both looked comfortable and happy and like they genuinely liked each other or they were sitting in bright yellow chairs in the oval office and uh here is what President Trump said about the first\nInkling he had that Nikki Haley would be leaving her job\nShe told me probably just wants to go she said you know she said\nMaybe at the end of the year the other two year period which end of the year I Want to take a little time off or\nBeen a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise]\nFor eight years and she uh\nShe did this and this is possibly more in tune\nWhat's going on in the world is very dangerous in the last thing [noise]\nWhat she's doing a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of solving a lot of problems that show together just wanted to tell you the ... or we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will unless you're never going to say you got to finish the job but I\nMuch okay and uh then Nikki Haley talked about some of her sense of accomplishment she's completing her first\nTwo years or her two years as UN ambassador and she's going to continue working there until January it's unclear which is going to be doing after that there are some rumors we will get to those but here is a Nikki Haley talking about\nThe achievements that she sees in American foreign policy in the last two years\nTwo years with the United states on foreign policy now\nKnow that if we think we are going to do something we fall for when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether NATO\nSaying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether to the trade deals were given a major thing they get the pine nuts and they followed through\nThese two years of the last\nThree billion and the un fight\nSudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nFreed North Korean sanctions\nAn generation dying in a way that we can really work for\nAnd the Iran deal bringing attention to the world every country needs to understand you can't overlook all of the bad things they're doing do you have to see them for the ... they are [noise] um I think you look at the anti Israel bias and that Dr\nEncouraged that the president shown in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world\n[noise] you know all those things have made a huge difference and the U.S\nBut I can tell you that um [noise]\nAnd the U.S is drawing in a way to make all American very proud\nI this is I'm about as a strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was part of it but all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that are in the CNN poll a despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about Kevin on and\nThe the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned there's a lot of talk about her replacement and some of the talk that is most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter Yvonne ...\nWhy would that make any sense ... has traveled around the world uh she speaks very well she has dynamics you certainly would have the president's confidence\nI should also be a terrible choice because it would be very easy for the rest of the world to see a look uh America is becoming like a banana republic or like a dictatorship or clip talk or see where\nThis family that seems to be attacked for its financial manipulation\nTold well these are different people now they've they've become evil and crotchety and privileged old white males as you can't work with is you can't be civil with the irony here is that when she was a U.S senator\nOr Hillary Clinton actually had a reputation as being somebody you could actually talk to and and work with on some things\nAnd for her now to suggest that civility is impossible without Democrats in control is outrageous especially when you look at Democrats freaking out like that the teacher who was

[noise]\nThere is a powerful powerful pieces in fact one of the best things I've read in the New York times\nAnd it's by a writer named Neil Patel like and it comes out the same week that a new study comes out from Canada is published in the American Journal of psychiatry it's peer reviewed it is a very very alarming scientific study\nIt makes it clear that marijuana does more damage to teenage brains for teenagers who use marijuana\nThan alcohol\nEither way it doesn't mean that alcohol is a good idea for teenagers as it is it and no don't somebody bring up Brett Kavanaugh look at it most parents understand that it's not great for kids at fourteen Fifteen sixteen to be using alcohol\nBut it's even worse for them to be using marijuana yes even in states where that might be legal by the way I don't think there are any of the legal marijuana states where it's legal for people under Eighteen\nI this is um the peace in the New York times when I'm Talking about is by a guy name Neal

Kansas City wow All right so we're on opposite sides on the tie breaker here I\nLiked that analysis I I Would be Wilder CKC do that and the people if you've ever been in Boston it's been anytime there oh it's brutal when the patriots lose and especially if the red Sox are losing to across town because they got the two for going on\nI I'm going to say the patriots win this I think it's going to be close game\nHowever and I do believe it's going to be more of a high flying affair kind of like a Jeff said too and also Josh\nA lot of points on the board so I think the patriots win at thirty eight thirty for Brady is going to have the air and out of it or something's going to have to be happening there too and that in the homes\nIs Aaron Aaron [laughter] or have you back to the [laughter] of just on the football folks [laughter]\nYeah on the football [laughter] um so I I think it's going to be close game though that's you'll see the the wide guys have it at three and a half New England favored and fifty eight and a half points or whatever that's worth\nI think I told the story before I Lived in Vegas I did that was my first syndicated show and I'll tell you what I learned a lot about how the lines are set and really some of brilliant people do this I mean guys with degrees from MIT like math nerds and they analyze everything forward and backwards which again means nothing\nYou know paralysis by announcing except for that if you look at the line's a lotta time they're right and I'm very curious about that over underline because that would mean we'd see a much more high scoring kind of game so that's it we'll see if any of us nail the score this time around you can play at home with your buddies\n[noise] yes [noise] really a lot of fun Sunday night football's a lot of fun [noise]\nNo question about that\nYou know it's interesting as we look at Sunday Night Football we do do this thing where we look at both sides of the ball and when I ... well I mean by that is you know we talked to somebody who's on the team for a living and their their day in and day out watching what's happening\nWith the team so you know they see what the what was happening at some of the practices when they're open or at least what's being said as you get closer to to the game I covered a couple of teams is way so I Know what that's like you really are just immersed in it\nI was like that with the Dallas Cowboys even used to live with them so far have grigorian joins us he's a columnist for\nA great paper the Kansas City star and we'll get his take on Casey and pat ... coming into this and Andy Reid how he's feeling about the kind of play calling against a bell a check\nAny reduced to infuriate me with poor walk management in the later years when he coached the Philadelphia Eagles seems to be doing a better job with this Kansas City team\nOr this year and even last year you could say did a lot better job and some of the play that were called and I think a clock management although you could still question that it's been different this year pat in\nThe homes is just a whole different ballgame these are all final now the falcons beat the buccaneers thirty four to twenty nine Steelers wrapped up the bangles twenty eight\nTwenty one chargers knocked off the browns thirty eight to fourteen Baker Mayfield with a touchdown and two hundred and thirty eight yards passing but it was all about the chargers Melvin Gordon\nReid touchdowns you want to talk about a fantasy player and just good player Eighteen carries a hundred and thirty two yards from Melvin Gordon the uh I told you about the Seahawks wrapping up the raiders are ready in London I mean raiders put just three points on the board\nAnd over time watching us right now with two fourteen on the clock in overtime is tied the bears and the dolphins at twenty eight\nSo a third and fourth that's what the bears have tried to convert at Miami's thirty five yard line how 'bout that\nVikings wrapped up the cardinals\nOr earlier we mentioned that before the Vikings pick up their third when jets just completely a thrashing the colds for most of the game but forty two thirty

briar\nThe Democratic appointees on the court what's usually called the more liberal block on the court they came to this or that they came to the East Room and the White House\nAnd they should some

Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me\nMy approach to judging remains the same a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial decider who favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret\nThe law not make the law\nA judge must interpret statute says written and the judge must interpret the constitution has written informed

that but not this one\nPresident from his actions and his words so you everything you need to know the president is using division as a weapon and he probably is proud of every when he and his party yet no matter how much it costs Americans\nApprove remember his divisive language tonight at justice cabinet swearing in prove that this president\nIs our divider and she\nReally is that is that fair

what'd you talked about which ... which made me cringe as well\nIt it was wrong for him given the fact that he's\nAnd the Supreme Court now to be so political as to specifically blame the Clintons by name and there's another reason for that only ... the Clintons had much to do with it frankly I think that it was Dianne Feinstein\nAnd the people on the committee and the the whole thing was set up but um I I I think he he made an inappropriate comment\nAnd and by the way and the knowledge that so it can't you recognize that he did something fairly extraordinary and in a acknowledging that he said some things that he shouldn't have said\nYou know what we're talking about the highest court in Atlanta and even in the knowledge meant there is problematic because forever now it can it can

many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses because he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles for a guy who happened to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts\nAnd he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that and and that she also wrote articles that it had appeared in like a magazines that were some justices thought were pornography he didn't\nAnd just that plus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year olds who had been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment and today's terms it didn't ruin his judgeship\nA and by the way there were attempts to
