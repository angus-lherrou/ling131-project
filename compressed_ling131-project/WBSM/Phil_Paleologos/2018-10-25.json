St John Brennan name spelled missing an ad and that kind of surprised me and he had some feelings that basically there's something a little suspect that this\nAnd I would think that if it doesn't turn out to be ...\nYeah or you know any conservative group it it's fine it's responsible for this they defaulted could be on the other end of the spectrum if you know what I mean yes there's something to suspect\nBrandon Brandon is a pretty easy name to spell the end so yeah and you know you know people are saying that Florida the reason that's misspelled is because\nYou know on the on the keyboard the ass is next to the ... so that's that's why that's why it's misspelled but I mean you know I I'm most of us are spelled Florida a million times on the keyboard and how many times have you ever made that mistake with an S. and the day that never ...\nI agree and and they're sending this aspect that I I mean I don't know if the President Trump will get to the bottom of that and I really hope he got before the elections that they can catch whoever it is I don't condone any violence\nOr no no no one does and and but the the problem is the ... you don't have a great deal of confidence the FBI and not just because they you know they try to fix the election for the Democrats there just\nI hate to say it but in many in many regards they're not that good I mean they got the Unabomber but it took them decades right be what book what they what they really odd you know when what what what big cases if they cracked\nThey're just they're they're not they're not good there I'd rather have the marshals working on this I'd rather have the drug enforcement agency the survey the secrets or even the secret service yeah\nI mean they squeeze in a hooker here and there but generally they they're good at getting to the bottom\nOf guy they yeah I mean yeah I mean you can't give you can't give the secret service anything after like to weigh up in the sick you know I mean or or you know over the place where there's quarters you know one of\nThe equator back to you don't want to send them to like Colombia right for that matter the Netherlands but we don't we don't think\nThe we we we can assume I think I Know assumptions with the mother leap ups but we can assume that this these packages that not come from Columbia so they so they won't be distracted by hookers from from Columbia\nAid for four or five thanks thanks for the call me and thanks for holding on a somewhat says they didn't get the Unabomber his brother did\nWell you know the thing is though you know part of [laughter]\nPart of being a sloop is like being a reporter to someone's got to be there to actually pick up the phone and again we we have we have records now of the FBI picking up the phone and not be able to even though even if they get a check whether it's about this guy Gary Sampson who killed all the people\nOr the Parkland shooter or the ... or or the the bombers in Boston they actually got the tips but they couldn't follow through with the Unabomber they got the call from the brother and they followed through\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two All right we don't have time we'll take some more calls we come back we'll take a lot of calls and the next segment so get a get to get on board of how we are\n[noise]\nWell you guys in the north to be the same way if you have land\nSo these are the things that we can't rationally ... said have the smartest people they could give us this great country could somehow rationalize behavior but what we do is we understand their fault and and we also understands their great as and we build on it we don't ruin it we don't destroy our foundation\nYeah so we're we're looking forward to having the up your Brian to discuss the uh twenty six and elections I you know we do the deplorable show we play a sound clips from the campaign and you guys are I still remember at you know on the box you guys have the uh the the president odd when before he was surprised that he would come on your show once a week right\nNow we're yeah why not I mean that that was one of the great draws a Fox and friends wasn't it the you know having him down every week he was he was crazy and uh just he would say whenever popped into his\nMind just call in Trump Tower you know even though he could have just come down I guess you could have just come down in the studio it's only a few relatively few blocks away but he he was there he I mean he was a great draw for you guys ... for more than a year was ...\nYeah what happened is and he would ask you call up and ask our rate you know because we get ratings you can get it every minute we've got every Fifteen right it's like I I Want to get you guys tell me tell me the area which you need the most I mean if you're going to live like a high [laughter]\nBut the thing is highly a lot of what he does now he did then he doesn't just said whatever comes into his head he said he goes in his instincts it you know why we interior\nOut you know what is you know what is going on their economy why we wrap up the debt so all this you would react to it was ever in the news he would eat about Ninety second notice any reacted top five stories and then we move on and most fifty to sixty percent of the time it would be newsworthy\nThe eight o'clock out so it would be introducing Donald Trump asked to clarify what he meant this morning about or his criticism of George Bush or or Brock Obama and gave on\nAnd he almost ran once and then when it's like you always got to stop going in like listen I'm going to save The Apprentice one more year they did and then Iraq\nYeah I got to you you know there's there's all this talk now about the civility and we need to return disability and all this stuff and and you know there there's a great irony here because the Democrats have been so obnoxious you you ran into it yourself a couple of weeks ago you were you were basically harassed on the on the subway in New York City weren't you Brian\nYeah I mean they've earned those had I'm a fifty fifty seven and added eating down the block from Fox and the guy got up to me and he wants to take a picture\nAfter this Israeli couple or three and say can I take a picture we watch in Israel they tell you the channel\nAnd then in southern Calif that to me and says hey if I could I could take a picture and ... on it or the guy pops out and they start taping as crazy questions and my main focus how I'm not giving any content and I'm not going to sit there and do an interview on the street with your co eds\nSo I did we exactly do every day I Walk right down the block I Want into the subway from\nThe subway I went to Penn Station from Penn Station I have to run a railroad and offered to Long Island railroad I'm a these guys just were screaming a brain kill me talks to Donald Trump Brian kilometers a racist because Donald Trump is a racist and trying to excite some type of violence\nAnd for the most part he did and there was two of them and I never felt threatened but my main focus was I didn't want to show them I just act like you could see it on line but they took it down\nBut it didn't exist I'm not sure that was right and wrong but if I lose my temper start engaging isn't that what they are brio if a if you guys have a better idea I'd be curious\nTo know your I I think you know I think you handle it well I mean if they they always taught us that in local TV news you know if a if somebody's yelling at you a politician or just somebody on the street when you're doing a live shot don't respond\nOr the or the story becomes it's two jerks a you know to bodily or has has going out one another so you you always have to you know sort of turn the other cheek\nAnd you do you handle that you handle that wealth what I mean the reason I brought it up is because you know they're making it sound like it's it's all one way but you know you have personal experience and so so do a lot of people that have been to the Trump rallies ... you know people\nHad their ... have their cars are keyed they or you have these uh uh agents provocative tore them were paid by the Democrats as James O'Keefe pointed out during the two thousands or sixteen campaign\nYou know they there's a ... at the at the AT T for moms are roaming up and down the street so I you know guys getting sucker punch with a bicycle walks\nMe the host of the violence is is going the other way\nYeah I mean you know what I Would I Would love that this election or if we went out of our way and Trump could take the lead on this is mostly on the other way because I keep losing and if they lose the house they're going to be it can you imagine what you on ...\n[laughter] yeah I mean John Brennan but what about all those tweets the John Brennan has been sending out I mean he he's a he's\nBasically cough or a a ... coup against the against the sitting president of the United states and and now he's now he's all bent out of shape because somebody doesn't even know how to spell his name or know what network he works for ... a piece of wood and the mail\nI mean they're they're acting like they're you know like they they've come back from my you know a a five months on ... there are a whole lot more too [laughter]\n[laughter] oh I Know I mean and basically\nYou look at his tweets even James Clapper called them out\nOf ... is incendiary treats it I'm just wondering is it ... cars there aren't a lot of that whole Russia plot I mean are we still looking into why Stephan how far this professor American professor was put into action to go after path that apple is a quarter page do we know why ... won't have to wrap it up all is\nDo we know Spicer ... other ... Carter Page does this all go back to ... and his is a President Trump's and the Republicans are they getting close to ... this is that why this guy so insane\nYeah I I think so I mean until until the a package actually arrived at the wrong network Brian I mean who once seen this guy for a month right I mean he's kinda like gone to ground\nYou know he's the he's the I I think he realizes he's got a problem hey by the way what about Megan Kelly she's all done at a at a NBC is is I Know this is a rhetorical question is should coming back to Fox Brian ...\nUh I Would have no I haven't talked to in a while but I always thought it was a you know I was\nA there always will be if you if you are\nOr how it but she's really a threat to the person and so I Can't I Can't say that I think what great things to say about us I don't know what happened over there but she's on the smartest\nA smart people I Know a great well I didn't get a chance to watch because my radio shows aren't from nine to do I have no idea what's going on nine am but I don't you know I that's it looks as ugly as I've ever seen anything a period\nYeah so uh so what we saw a ... you're going to be up here with us and Curt Schilling you saw what happened to Curt Schilling last night right the or the great Boston Red Sox play or they didn't you know he's a conservative and they had the uh the reunion before the red Sox are the second game of the world series\nOf the twenty four team the team that the you know finally a van wish the curse of the band but you know and everybody was invited back except for Curt Schilling who's ... who's one of the few players from that team who still lives in the area\nBut they they snapped them basically they they won't admit this but because he's a conservative\nAnd uh they didn't invite an attack even though he was the hero you know with the bloody sock and all that any pitched in a you know in in in a blinding claim so he and he had he got he got totally not by his\nBy his old team was it was it was a rotten thing that they did to him\nIt's a whole ...

percent say no maybe there's another act\nYou know the problem is when you get used to making that kind of big money I mean even when you get offered like three million bucks I mean somehow I I don't understand it myself but it seems that it's it's offensive to people who are making twenty three million when they're only offered two or three million\nGo figure but that's the way it is\nAnyway aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two if you haven't been if you don't read the New York papers you probably don't know the story I mean even if you read the New York times you sure do know the story the are the Robert F Kennedy foundation it's it's one of these the Kennedy family foundation so that one of the kids can be a human rights advocate\nOr if they if uh it's it's not run by Kerry Kennedy she used to be married to Andrew Cuomo the governor who I got the who announced a with great fanfare yesterday that he received a bomb and it turned out to be a flash drive\nBut she cheated on a Governor Cuomo with a polo player and then she got arrested for driving under the influence you had an accident up in Westchester County and she she was driving a sheet cheap ... such a mistake and we took ambient so now she's running the RFK foundation\nAnd she's getting paid three hundred and fifty two thousand dollars a year to run the RFK human rights foundation and so they the brilliant idea that they've come up with the RFK foundation Kerry Kennedy formally Kerry Kennedy Cuomo\nWas to take some of the money that's in the foundation and bail out people basically women and teenagers who are stuck in New York jails\nWire usually stuck in a jail it's because you've committed a pretty bad crime or maybe it's not that bad of a crime but\nYou've jumped bail before so they've increased the bail so so Kerry Kennedy decided to start bailing people out with her with HER Foundation money\nThere was a headline in the New York posted a another RFK Bailey skipped squirt they this is a woman named Ralphie my read twenty five she was arrested in June for allegedly robbing a build a store in Chelsea\nManhattan and I'm not like a criminal mastermind but if I'm robbing a store don't you want to Rob a store that's likely to have a lot of cash\nOn hand e yeah and how your bar yeah a bank liquor store oh yeah a liquor store liquor store going to have plenty of cash especially you know
