the electoral college there were going to control American politics yeah her generation\nIf not forever then they lose the election and they want to abolish the electoral college then they talk about the Supreme Court is sacrosanct any time they rule in favor of abortion or gay marriage it's settled law the Supreme Court decided that it's the ultimate thing\nNow there is a conservative majority on the Supreme Court so we're going to have to pack the Supreme Court right\nYeah how do you think well thought out\nBut that's what they're saying man you know they're talking\nNow I ... well they they do not accept democracy or losing in a democracy the U.S\nImmigration of course the biggest issue that's how they when finally permanently and beyond repair um or fifty years in the social experiment

is was designed to be a super legislature these philosopher kings but the left figure it out oh they go last\nSo simply as a logistical matter if we can pie with these cases and get five justices to rule for so it's either you know sixty million foreigners voting for us in elections if that's not even enough then we'll get five justices I'm now these are being these these paths of cheating are being cut off\nSo they want it back to the court well OK then Republican gets in and he packed to the court and then a Democrat gets in and he thinks will\nRemain where we will see that one time

I think that if you listen to Susan Collins speech yesterday and if you listen to the river the rhetoric on on the right and coming out of the White House they seized upon much less a credible looking at it allegations\nThey seized those evil Republicans they're always sneezing\nAnd how would sing seizing and pouncing she seems to have been much less credible she seems to have bed reach was older than them didn't know any of them was from a private high school group she was from a public high school\nAnd she can she said she kept going back to where they were dragging the punch and raping women\nAnd she ... she seemed to have some less credibility but now now that this has happened you you're going to you know you thought it was a big victory you know it it it it saved our constitutional liberties and our republic for ten Fifteen Years it's really going to last a lot longer than that cuts sex\n[noise] the thing about making a deal with the devil\nBack up his bargain alright the devil does not what Trump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most he is delivered racism for these people he delivered massage any for these people and now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something that they've been trying to get for a generation\nSo then the question now becomes not so much like oh we'll just stick for the Republicans I think it will that for the Republicans\nThis is what they want the question is what are the Democrats going to do\nDemocratic turnout doesn't need to be high for a mid term and sweet high for a presidential election right and that's what we're about to say we're going to see if there if it's raining but they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see if this rain last for thirty days or two years\nOf south of here because that is how that is what these people have set themselves up for\n\nIt oh God he wanted was a hundred years we've got to set this thing up right we're going to have everything under control for a hundred\nThousand years how old are they think Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas and Alito and Roberts said Gorsuch you're going to live to be\nA thousand years and by the way he this guy says the devil does not Welsh and then he talks about racism I I thought well ... was a a ... or a two oh that's right\nThough he's a liberal he can say whatever the hell he places and then the other thing is that he says that the devil doesn't Welsh on a deal I mean I think that being deceptive it's something that the devil would definitely do write the book it's within his character\nYeah I think I thought that was the lesson of the ... the devil is always trying to sell you a bill of goods you know everything's going to be fine if you cut a deal with me and then the double comes for your soul\nThis MSNBC guy thinks the devils on the level\nWho where did we get these people from or do they just look at tweet so they just pick the ones that said the racist than to homophobic slurs on their uh tweets I mean do they as it does anybody not have a problem with taxes or\nA or a problematic\nTweets that works for MSNBC or CNN\nOkay let's play the a cut from the U.
