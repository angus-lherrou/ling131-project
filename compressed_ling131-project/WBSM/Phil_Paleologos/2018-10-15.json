I'm like maybe they don't take a picture need a car because all everyone associates with is running away from a hit and run drunk driving seen it does no one had any grasp of what other people think of them\nThey they get a free ride these Democrats get a free ride so they think no one's going to call 'em out just like the big no one's going to notice these corrections they run a fake news story\nHours later\nI Love the through the Boston Globe's tweet on the uh Ted Cruz making the Chappaquiddick joke they said was Ted Cruz making reference to Chappaquiddick question mark\nOr ... or ... see you know to be to be charitable I mean he could have been making your reference to Joel's father Joe the second who again crippled Pam Kelly and the Nantucket accident\nBut if I had to guess I Would say it was Chappaquiddick yeah have you on where people tend to go at that\nCrippling a woman for life is bad rounding a woman worse\nYeah I'm In my opinion anyway oh and with the Elizabeth Warren thing it's like yeah between her coming out with this news\nThe Kavanaugh thing which really rallied a lot of Republicans and Michael ... endorsing people left and right against their well\nIt's looking more and more land or sea I I missed us he out last week he endorsed I think it was data Steve right he came out with like I see are isolated over this is what he did I didn't know he was a drunk driving more you know aerial Dr ... picture beta that like oh my God\nSo he tweets out he tweets out a link thing we need to when we need to get rid of Ted Cruz like with this link to donate to ... campaign you click the link and it's a fifty fifty donate thanks so if you donate thinking you're giving money to pay into you're giving half of it to ... to\nPack this is like when the

actually privileges DNA company definitions in this debate which are ultimately setter ... colonial definitions of who was ... so she basically said that she's a she's speaking with a fork tongue is what you say that the you know whatever her DNA is she's modern India\nI mean that's that's that's what that's what they're saying that's what they've been saying all along the people who are in these

registered hearing aids for Seventy five dollars down and fifty dollars a month spot missing out on conversations and start hearing again hearing help\nDot com Steve what's the poll question what are the results bus far do you think Elizabeth Warren's DNA test was on the level no a Ninety two percent said no way in and even if you accept the fact\nOr the non fact that it was on the level it just goes to prove she's not an Indian\nOn under any definition she is not a Native American\nThere's no way that Harvard should've been listening her lifting her as their first woman\nPets and she should have to give whatever Harvard gave her for you know her special Native American heritage she should be given that that\nWas she's clean men but they didn't ... that it was it used to give her the job but if it wasn't used to give her the job then see why was Harvard bragging audit or in their right it in their press releases you know they they they were taking a lot of heat that they have many minorities\nOr black or you know black or Asian or whatever and or a ... and they had too much too few few females on the on the faculty so suddenly this woman of color as they were promoting or is suddenly appears on the campus after she uh after she had changed her a race\nAt the University of Pennsylvania another Ivy League law school\nAnd she can't claim to be Cherokee because that's a whole another cat and I personally don't believe she has a enough showing in her blood she'll even find out what type it is it even is connected to American indian\nAnd remember this is her own test Nancy this is like Christine Blasey Ford's a lie detector\nTest [laughter] yeah I I mean who's by him and and you know people will sign why would she why would she put out a test\nLike this uh you know when it's a what makes her a clear that she's modern envious because it's caught because her\nHer people or people are Cherokees her people are the ... left media they're gonna portray this you heard it on the view there they're going to portray that he's proven that she's an Indian it's ridiculous at\nSuch a small percentage it's like one grain of sand on a beach\nRight exactly thanks for the call Nancy Joanne your next with highway cargo had Joanne\nHey listen if that if that daddy is correct and the African American of European descent has actually more\nPercentage rate than she currently is saying she had right ... ... what if the if Trump took task and he had a higher rate probability that she did\nWell I I think I think his family is like that they haven't been over here that long is that his father is German like second generation German and his mother is first generation scotch Irish\nSauce Scots Irish so I Would think that he's probably like maybe a hundred percent the European but you know you're right I mean he might as well take it I mean that you never know what's going to turn up\nAnd uh you know that would that's the thing if she took the same pass that all of us to talk you know just for laughs you know she would shoot people would have more belief I mean I I don't think the the test would be any different it might even be more damaging than the one but she but she put out there but\nAt least people would believe it I mean no one's ... who's believing all these tests that the Democrats are putting up now you know ... uh Christine Blasey Ford's a\nTest or you know ... and and the the recovered memories of all these other people I mean they've they've kind of a reduced the credibility of ah people like this in this uh in in this political party base for the call Joanne\nFive five eight four four excuse me five hundred forty to forty two um our guard [noise]\n\nTell the truth about our background then choose and she has benefited hands simply you know before she became a a Native American\nShe was a just an instructor at the University of Texas law school I mean not a bad law school but it's not the ivy league you know and she wasn't a tenured professor and you know as soon as she started checking the box she she started moving right up through the ranks\nWell money money it's one thing that we can talk lately and county was Elizabeth Warren an assay benefited but here's here's the daycare enemy about the whole thing a lizard warning and professor from heart rate versus a kid from the south in from Chicago\nYeah who is making out better today and their thought process well\nI I agree I agree and the again the irony here is that uh this this story breaks about her uh her persistence and claiming to be a Native American despite the evidence to the contrary\nOn the same day that the trial starts in us district court of uh of Harvard University being accused of a basically playing identity politics on the other missions and this is a this is a really really important case that's being tried the Asian American groups that brought this suit against Harvard\nTo show that a Harvard has a different standards for different groups\nAnd again that's what that's what Elizabeth Warren's career is all about you know she she figured out a way to game the system\nAnd uh and and now she's caught and she wants to be president you somehow has the ... a lot of it so so she's using these uh a friendly fake fake media fake news outlets like the Boston Globe to put forth this myth\nThat she's actually proven that she's in India\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two pet your next with highway cargo had said\nHey how are you doing good you know\nI've listened to your show for years I listen to all sides or radio news or let's just say we're probably going to disagree right off of that but I can be respectful if you can\nBring on the ... go ahead come on what do you want to say\nAll right uh to me Elizabeth Warren you know we're talking about our heritage and that's that's not even\nAn issue right now I mean we have so many other problems\nWhy why do you think you've got to make sure that it's going to\nSolve problems for Americans right now no butter\nHeritage did solve a problem for her she wanted to be a good to be a tenured professor of law at Harvard University and so she checked the box and she became she became one\nEven though she's a white woman\nRegardless of who she is whether she's Chinese Japanese ...\nBut that her she's she ... her her what she ... she built her career on fraudulent\nDidn't cheer you're facing this you're focused on a miniscule amount and not only that\nI imagine you're out of questions holiday at most one sixty fourth and she claimed she was in India this kind of boring me to death yeah I mean ... game that day right when you don't have any argument here I shouldn't have had a white as she why did she lie why did she lie\nWhy it just says\nYou

ago\nTo see you later at about ... ... is our house there is this what moss is among the best they can do is is is this all there is this is the defense it's just uh\nPart that's the only reason she's here that's like say\nKanye West it's being a rapper as a small part of who he is why would you get the White House because he's a rapper because he made a lot to do as a rapper\nI mean she was still be flipping houses if she took a self identified\nRight that's that's yeah I mean this is ridiculous she she built her career\nOn a fraud she's not a Native American aid for\nFor and you know there's something to be so I was thinking I was just re reading that I think from the University of Alberta you know they you know there was\nThere was a lot of political correctness in that statement by that
