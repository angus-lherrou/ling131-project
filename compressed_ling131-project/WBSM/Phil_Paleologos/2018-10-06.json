like and I wouldn't miss this for the world is a Notre Dame\nYou look at Notre Dame\nUndefeated perfect five and I've taken on Virginia Tech and you want to talk about tracking Virginia Tech can be tricky and in fact\nFor Notre Dame is favored by less than a touchdown and they Blacksburg it's pretty loud if I'm looking at this thing and I'm looking at in the book and the amounts of off sense that e and book\nHas put a in a couple of games that he's CNN as quarterback for the Irish\nJust phenomenal is what he's been in fact I was somewhere I Want to say was at an airport\nWhen I ... or ... her and I just didn't think about it how many points right Ninety four point\nSince he jumped in and those couple of games so as they get ready for Virginia Tech is going to be about trying to trend that defense I mean the the off sense\nIs is actually really complimenting for once the defense for the Irish Frank Kelley knows it's a while he was sheepish about putting a or stepping around cheapest with the media stepping around putting in e and book why a brilliant move that turned out to be so far anyway\nBut Virginia Tech like I said is tricky I mean look these clubs haven't played each other very much and you could say well different lineup et cetera but the hope keys\nI Would love to be the top ten team in front of a wild home crowd because they haven't done that in a while I look to stand up its I thought it would be sooner than that but it's been since Miami and you have to go back to two thousand and on line for that [noise]\nSo uh they certainly Justin ... knows what to look for with Virginia Tech because all of the game as clicking for Notre Dame like I said I'll sense and defense they've been explosive obsessively and of course part of the deal is to get to eat and book but it's been really hard\nTo to view it they've got this pro style\nQuarterback in book and he is nailing it no interceptions had his cornerback rating is like off the charts Seventy four point three percent so it's not going to the uh easy and for the home keys they're going to have Ryan Willis in there\nAnd he starts he started the season as a backup guy but then he jumps and because he's replacing a starter Josh Jackson and he doesn't have quite the fire power that he and book has but he hasn't had any interceptions are either but that was again just coming in for him in that last one\nIt's really the hope he's defense against the Irish often\nAnd one thing Brian Kelly did his he tried he knows that lane stadium will be crazy\nAnd he tried to simulate that to make them think don't get cocky just because of where we are because people are talking about a ... a lot and dare I say Notre Dame as one of his head she'll semi final\nTeams you know you got four teams could they be one of his his answers could they could be one of those teams of course there was a handful of on the feed is\nAnd the Irish and where they rank isn't quite there yet but that can change as we motor through more football and the next couple of weeks\nOr the mountain years I like to talk about here because there for another another one of those undefeated teams and if we dive in\nWould your

seen a thing or two\nIn the friendly confines of Notre Dame stadium when they travel on the road when they're playing decent competition that being a top twenty five team but a different story I mean Notre Dame won a nine or laughed and games three and Fifteen or their last Eighteen games\nAgainst ranked teams on the road and now you're asking the Irish right now to to not only when the game but now there are touched a full touchdown favorite against Virginia Tech and I get a lot of people through Virginia Tech and deservedly so in a trash after they lost the Old Dominion but they have a new quarterback\nHe threw for three hundred plus yards last week Virginia Tech got very impressive\nAt Duke God dominating went as around they touched out on her dog so I expect at least early on it's gonna be an incredible atmosphere at night and Blacksburg first I Notre Dame is ever visited there I think Virginia Tech airs a smart Blake especially at the current number seven ... plus the points\nYeah there you go to the points that's the key and then I Want to swing to the powers play what do you think is the best game coming up\nYeah I mean if I'm looking at ... and value for it and I and this might surprise some people but I'm actually going to fade the on be in Kentucky Wildcats is the big game it's going to be on national TV and then I\nI I'm going to take their opponent Texas a and I'm at home and believe it or not Texas and I'm at a rally six point favored in this one here's what I like about a Kentucky's been flying under the radar offseason kudos for them they got a big win at Florida\nFollowed up with a couple of big ones at home but now finally Kentucky has some expectations there in the top fifty and this is the first ever trip\nTo Kyle feel these through to the plane in the same conference for last seven years Kate still haven't blade each other this is the first time I've ever played one another I like Texas and unlawful bounce back performance this week

pre game dot\nCom and that was some good stuff there are telling us you know looking at Notre Dame and Virginia Tech and Notre Dame a seven point favorite but the Irish just want to nine on the road against ranked teams and you think back you think about Virginia Tech losing to Old Dominion\nWhen they were four touchdown favored\nBut the huskies have this new quarterback he's talking about and the atmosphere is always crazy in Blacksburg so that's the deal when you have that home cooking in college football especially at these bigger programs that's where it can get a little um it can get a little tough when you're\nOn the road whether your superior or not and Brian Kelly understands also the luck of the Irish and wanted to go in the opposite direction loving what's happening within book\nI'd so it is official how 'bout that huge huge win for Tom Herman and the Texas Longhorns they come in at night teen knocking off seventh ranked sooner Z and what is a huge rivalry game Ninety

the Turks they hope but there's still a lot of football to be played in this one because when you got fourteen minutes or so and the clock you never know twenty seven seven if I were looking at a crystal ball I Would say that yeah\nIt's gonna sail to the victors I think they do take this on and Jim Harbaugh has speaking of\nBoys behind you get a lot of noise that he's been listening to\nUh since taking over of course as the coach and I think he's found his man in shape Patterson the transfer\nFrom old miss 'cause he's been looking pretty good two hundred and fifty yards passing so far

you why because they're afraid that just what happened this past Sunday\nAs happy in what two years ago and it was going to happen again and that's exactly what happened and this is the reason it wasn't the fact that\nYou know Thomas wasn't a good guy that he wasn't a good player they just didn't want to invest in a long time he took it as a personal shot and and he got into was still owns as opposed to saying this is a business on out there participate other thing that I didn't like about real Thomas's you got very arrogant\nAnd last week when he said hey I practice when I Want to practice my life I have a headache I'm a practicing\nFingernail hurts I'm not anything that hurts me just a little bit I'm not a practicing because I'm taking care of my body well that's unfair to all the other players in a lot to do that that's not right you are a leader you're paid eight and a half million dollars not just because of what you can do on you\nBut what you bring to the lock it to me

lot of money sometimes maybe they forget that the people that watch\nDon't quite sympathize the same way that maybe their teammates were in their same situation making a lot of money understand\nBecause most people are working steps I don't mean that in a negative manner I mean and the sense of we're working five six seven people work seven days a week some people work two jobs to make ends meet some people have to decide do I pay the electric bills to pay this bill this month\nDo I have money for a family vacation you know and I think when Thomas looks nice golfing at eight

the the the attributes to be able to play a kid's game make a lot of money doing so and and really frightening retire early so I think when the euro Thomas is the world show the disdain and they\nSome their nose at eight and a half million bucks the average person doesn't understand that because as you said Rodney average person's work in a town out there and making nowhere near that type of money and I think and Ronnie you're an athlete you played Fifteen Years in the NFL I don't ever use somebody that never forgot that you know we've had conversations about money and things like that you've never forgotten that but\nDo you think maybe that's the case sometimes that when you start making a lot of money eight and a half a lot of money\nPeople forget that you become somebody that most people aren't you become a multi millionaire\nYeah and and and I think a lot of times we have problems as we're always looking on someone else's paper\nYou know you sit back and you you sign a

week we got some clarification\nAs the report is lazy on will return to the Steelers during the week which is weak seven leading into the week eight match up against the Cleveland Browns first of all it becomes I mean first of a surprise coming back earlier then he should win then he could be coming back it's still a crew the year\nAbsolutely because I mean maybe I'm the wrong person to talk to about this but I just\nAnd and and\nMaybe my faith level was different um you may what what do you make like twelve and a half million last year exactly yep and he's making fourteen and a half this year would have made that was seen half yes to me that's a lot of money to sit down\nAnd if\nIt's me I Know he's I Know he's he he's sitting out for a long term contract if you're going to sit out be committed to sitting out I don't understand coming back\nSo soon anything can happen I think the real Thomas situation should really should have light on the fact that maybe he shouldn't come back\nBut for me in the first place I don't think I Would ever missed this year I Would have just came in and made my fourteen and a half million and the worst case scenario put insurance policy on yourself you may twenty something million dollars over the last two years that's a lot of freaking money Dan to pass up yeah I don't understand in ways I I don't know\nWhere you are old school you're certainly old school I mean there's no question Rodney but here's the funny thing about it you absolutely right when it comes to this because\nThat's a lot of money you know her cousins is the only

fact you complain about it for two straight years and then you sit out weeks at eight hundred and sixty three thousand dollars Rodney eat is awfully incredible how athletes\nLike a ... dollar right now Scott off their you know I mean they they scoff at this incredible amount of money but it doesn't make sense and here's why Rodney\nIf you're going to come back we're number seven ... rather than sit out all the way the weak number tend to do with Vincent Jackson did years ago just come back play the last six games the crew the year toward free agency if you're going to come out come back earlier than that\nThen why didn't you just start week one instead of losing all this money made all that money riding makes no sense that he's going to come back earlier then you can\nYeah you just you just really took I'm I'm just sitting here stunned because I'm sitting here thinking like okay what was the difference of those for the first four weeks or um [noise] this is the so what was that like um maybe three and a half million bucks I don't yeah amazing something like that\nYeah yeah I mean even three and a half million bucks I Want my three and a half million bucks for games that's that's just me especially a guarantee you know a lot of players\nYou know going to seasons go into situations where they don't know if they're going to make the team and they they're really dependent on that salary but he had twenty seven million dollars guaranteed the last two years man that's a lot of money and even as a running back your mindset almost has to be you know what kind of things a year to year a couple of years guaranteed here and there\nI I just don't understand them and it it's hard you know I look at James Caan and James Caan has a tough little running back and he's out there he fight and then come on and he's making peanuts compared to what may be on bill he's making less money in\nWeek the entire year that later on bills making one year when we had a great point yeah\nIt's a great point he's out there fighting a long running his butt off and you know obviously he's a different level player and I understand um bell he's trying to leverage is you know his position but if you're gonna do it man why come back because you know\nI Want to come back are you coming back because at eight fifty five for um the difference between ... and we five is another\nYou know two or three of ... it's just weird to me man I I don't know if he's getting good advice or he's got to look at perspective once again that's what I say perspective and maybe I'm just totally off base of fourteen and a half million dollars in one year of playing football is almost a million dollars a game it's it's a lot of money then\nIt's a lot of money but also here's the other aspect of it if you look at where he ranks in terms of salary on his team of course Robert ... going to make more\nAntonio Brown makes more but I don't think there's anybody else making more than that and no nobody should come out and question other guy's\nContract or look at his wallet but do you think Roddy that the other forty some players on that team weren't making lay beyond bell money agree with way beyond don't you think a lot of those guys who are on that\nThat birds you were gonna keep going on this Rodney because\nI mean the guys who are these special teams players are the guys who are every year valley for roster spots they're not making a million bucks do you think they really care and feel sorry for lay down and what you think about that answered on the other side because I think it is a locker mission that's next it is of course safety blitz Rodney ... worse than right here on NBC Sports radio\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] your NBC Sports radio lifting now\nBoard shall we right\nNow it's clubs and on top of Wake Forest fourteen\nAnd they're Thirteen minutes from the halfway point of this river Lawrence did get to start for Clemson happening so far for forty one yard LSU and Florida is tied at seven that well but if you still there at the halfway point\nFourteen minutes to go and they'll hit the locker room\nFlorida State seven ... over Miami twenty fifth rank Oklahoma State trailing Iowa State six teams seven ten minutes to go there in the locker room Indiana at Ohio State in this one Indiana leading Ohio State three nothing\nHalfway through the first quarter of that one\nAlabama made it twelve straight against Arkansas they wrap them up today sixty five to thirty one now and it was a long warns ever the sooner any NBC Sports radio\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on a ... we covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nTo you also have to understand to like Mike Tomlin this ... this has been a ... a tough situation for the Pittsburgh Steelers because it has become a distraction\nYou know you see the frustration it affected them the way they played the way they prepare the way they approach this game it's affected 'em Dan I'm you know and then you see Antonio Brown you see guys starting to kind of separate and complain\nI'm ... there was one two and one before you know if they lose the falcons they're they're going to be won three and one\nAnd then you start to look it up and then really the end of world I mean the world is falling crushing falling right on top of the Pittsburgh Steelers if they lose that game\nIt's just been a a bad distraction into something that might Tom and he has to get a firm control of and only only thing he can do at this point in time is if you're in and you've reported in your part of the team\nYou focus on those guys that are there\nAnd if laid me I'm Bill is not there you don't know what's gonna happen if he's going to walk through that door and not maybe that was just a rumor who knows exactly until he walks through that door\nDon't mention Leon bill you tell your you tell you guys in the locker room don't talk about levy I'm Bill we don't talk about people that you know having reported yet\nYeah no question I mentioned to see is it actually that week seven as we're hearing does it actually occurred that point to lay down bell\nWalk through that door it is of course the safety ... NBC Sports radio riding I Want to switch gears something interesting happened in week for that I really was I couldn't wait to bring up on the show and that is to coaches in\nOvertime situations going forward on fourth down it worked for my ... it didn't work for Frank Reich Reich had what twenty seven seconds remaining in a tie game in his own territory goes word ...\nIn field goal range could have picked a field gold ends up in essence tying the Philadelphia Eagles in that game rather gets the planning to go for the winning when the game\nWhy don't you think Rodney when you see to first of your head coaches go forward in overtime in fourth place\nI thought it was great up all Frank right I thought he was well within his mindset and really the foundation of where he came from to go for it I thought he was trying to make a statement to his team he was a former coach often self coordinator or um quarterbacks coach with the Philadelphia Eagles so you know they go for it\nAnd now they play with an aggressive mindset and ... and it really equaled a Super Bowl championship so when he came to the cold I knew nothing will change and he him being a former player you know his mindset former players and I told my record Tony ... the same thing former players they would rather lose\nAs opposed to walking away with a tie a tie does nothing for me at least if I'm going to go out I'm gonna go out fighting I'm going to do everything I Can't I'm a fight and claw I'm a goal for ... if I'm often coordinate I'm using my creative mindset to try to come up with something to play didn't work\nBut when he came post game conference he said look ten out of ten times we're going to go for it that's the mindset that we have to hear have here and then also said my last point was like\nThere is no player that's upset with the coach for being too aggressive offensively no all sense of ... a guy on on the side of that ball or say you know what I\nLike that were too aggressive no officer guys going to ever say that in a Angelo came back and said you know I Love what he's doing and I hope we continue to do it because we're not playing and you know from office the standpoint of being too aggressive\nYou don't came to my mind when I saw that happened\nIt it just reinforce to my mind how ridiculous and idiotic it is that the NFL last ties\nBecause the message that was sent by those two coaches and the reaction of their own players and fans was we don't like ties we would rather losing game that end in a tie\nYeah here's the NFL making it more realistic for ties to occur by going from Fifteen minutes to ten minutes and that over time period instead of going in the opposite direction to kind of\nFigure out a finality in these games the way that Frank right did the way that a fable did\nThe NFL is encouraging ties when it's evident that no one wants ties riding that's what came to my mind when I see to coach is not one not want what happens in week one of the week to where we had tied games and each of those weeks the NFL has got a ... and get the message and they hand that was given to them by these coaches\nWe don't want ties in this league Rodney\nIt's ridiculous they still exist because those coaches I agree they were right to do it because it's better to have finality with a W or now than a stupid T.\nThat's how I was in that scene why ... why would we still even talking about ties I mean just either adapt to college situation the way they do things or\nFor me but like I said take it to the thirty are line let each kicker kicking whoever Mrs and then if you make it move back five yards and if you make it move back five yards and eventually you're going to have somebody that that makes a kick\nAnd the other you know of other kicker might miss a kick but to me you know that's how you you know keep kicker is relevant that's how you keep special teams relevant\nI it's just stupid man it's crazy I mean we play in this this leak and I've been involved in this league a long time this is a billion dollar league and we still don't know how to get rid of a tie\nLike people want to know like who wins and who loses it shouldn't be any record that one too and one I mean that's so stupid it's just so come on a league you've changed all these rules protect quarterbacks to enhance the office of performance but yet\nYou want to end in a tie it's just ridiculous\nIt is utterly ridiculous it doesn't make an ounce of sense the coaches have spoken but here's you know what it's funny because that's exactly what I expect from might favor for him to do that you know he said that aggressive type a guy we saw him on hard knocks a couple of years back\nThat's exactly what I Would have expected from my vague rebel to go forward in that situation but you know running the players have to love it in a sense of the confidence that you're putting in them I Believe in you that you can get this job done I Believe in you that you can get this first down you can get this touchdown whatever it might be as a player on the in a coach or young coach\nThat you probably are still skeptical about because their first year coach when they show that type of respect and costs\nYou you got a lot of it as a playwright\nAbsolutely you you believe that the coach believes in you you feel like you know we have aggressive mine to coach we're gonna we're gonna always fight and call to the end because that's what coaches come locker rooms do you say you know we're going to fight we're gonna we're going to put ourselves in best position to have success\nAnd that's what you do man and you'd be aggressive and you you try to win football games and that's how you really get the respect of your locker room\nYes certainly I think those two guys did win the respect it worked out for rape all they win the game it does not work out for Frank right in that regard All right speaking of Frank right the costs of course played Thursday against the patriots\nI got to be honest there's an interesting aspect that game that came out that should be scary for the rest of the leak that's next on the safety blitz Rodney Harris and dance worse than

hey it's illegal for you to have that you're giving your Bible we've had teachers confiscate buy\nInto the student shows that once she legal brief and they read it and go oh okay it looks like it is legal here's your Bible back it's almost like this a head in the sand kind of environment where we don't understand our religious celebrities in this country anymore\nI yeah and what's strange year as I'm sure a lot of the people on the left who would say oh it's terrible to bring a Bible to school would absolutely defend any child who wanted to bring a caller on\nThe school or or wanted to bring the communist manifesto whatever they want to break\nRight absolutely and we get that question off and why why don't you champion that we're we're Christian ministry we champion bringing the Bible the Old Testament New Testament to schools for Christian kids too\nRead on their own or with others and invariably or this is a a lunch setting typically we're a little Thirteen fourteen year old girl or a boy\nOr has four or five friends around the table and they're reading the book of John or something from the Old Testament it's completely right I mean you think of Michael what's so frustrating to think of the impact of the Bible on western civilization\nAnd here in this country people are wrongly saying teachers school administrators wrongly saying hey what are you doing with that that's illegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNot know it does entirely and see what what I ah I see from the materials that you prepared for this\nYou are emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people and saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell a war I I hate you unless you come in and joined me in my face\nI you you're also emphasizing the kids who bring their bibles to school to\nTry to bear witness you know winning and kind and a friendly way\nAbsolutely I mean one of the things I often ask friends who you know have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what's he missing in his resume he was a person who exposed\nReally espouse loved joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and to the people at the school that they bring their Bible to one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school all brought bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians but the whole class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that you know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they're going wow we never knew and I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for\nThe left in the progressive to talk about the um you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message they sure do a lotta shaming for people of faith to the point where these kids are embarrassed or feel they can't bring their bibles to school or talk about God\nAnd that's not good in that environment for us to be in today everybody should bring their ideas their thoughts their opinions and their faith into the public square", "year": "2018",
