the body as us educated right this uh this is a\nReporter yes I think so yes\nWell suppose suppose that defense the Saudis were to uncover a girl who got drunk with chick ... she showed me back in high school and accused them of unwanted physically aggressive romantic advances you think all would be forgiven and he's not rounded he's not around at the NIH it right and they couldn't doubt his accuser right\nNow they couldn't do the only accusers they can out are the ones who accused Bill Clinton\nAnd I'm sure up in Alaska the Democrats are doubting the accusers against the lieutenant

five hundred forty to forty two when we come back we're going to talk about ... years was talk a little bit about Sears, Roebuck\nGoing down the ... mowing car [noise]\n\nHave you noticed your parents are becoming hard of hearing an keeps saying what did you say are you experiencing hearing loss fearing help express can help with FDA registered hearing aids go to a hearing help dot com and used promote how are you to get FDA registered hearing aids\nSo I I don't know I mean I I haven't been to Sears for a long time a grace was talking about it during the winter and one of the last breaks and she said she said at one time I went to see the last time I went to Sears I went to get some vacuum cleaner bags\nThat I couldn't find anybody to help me out the escalators were broken and then I couldn't find the vacuum cleaner bags so she went home and order them online and she's never been back\nAnd I think that story could be repeated like twenty million pot [laughter] you know I mean that's that's that's where they're ah they're they're a customer base when you know they they were dissatisfied and you know the other thing about it is that the the sort of the middle ground\nOf a of the American economy they the consumer side of the economy is kind of gone somebody pointed this out yesterday I thought it was a good point you know it's like the uh you know red lobster restaurants are struggling right you know the high end restaurants the flemings steak house a capital grill they're doing great\nThe the uh the the fast food restaurants like five guys they're doing great but the things in the middle like red lobster or sucking\nShe bears are doing good I ... are doing good Budweiser forget about it it's God\nIt's also that the fears I Do do is at the mall and the mind general is pretty lackluster\nBut that theory like everything around that the earth is like the gathered and gets on the side and the mall that no one goes do you like if you got rod said no one would be there to help you because it's ... nobody's there so not only is it here is dying off but it's like killing everything around it like a poison ivy\nPoison ivy I don't know about that is what happens to all the empty fears now well\nI mean a lot of 'em have already been turned into other things having to say they've been turned into GM's or something\nI guess maybe Jim's might work out but I mean there's not a big retail giant pits itching to have more locations\nNo no definitely not I I don't I don't know what they're going to do they don't see that's the thing too but that's the thing lamport always thought you know when he when he made this big score with Kmart Fifteen Years ago we could sell off all the location so we always thought well I'm okay 'cause I can sell off these locations\nBut when he wasn't counting on not that anybody else was counting on it was the Internet and Amazon\nAnd coming in and basically cutting the heart out of a lot of these malls again the middle the middle malls that the really upscale malls are doing OK but the mill malls are aren't doing so well\nI'm just saying about the mall in Bangor there don't you get like a cumulative effect once the Sears shuts down and then fewer people are coming in because of that and then another place shuts down and then pretty soon the mall can't even sustain itself and you put the gigantic building what the hell are you going to do with it I\nI Know I hey I used to I used to go to the ... I think it was a borders in the bank or a mall I used to my first couple of bucks I did I did gang busters at that ... at a at a bookstore [noise] now it's gone I I Know a guy who has a car who used to have a car that he wouldn't have every Christmas there\nA couple of ... and he used to it I mean it was a huge part of his business I he knows he's listening to the show now he knows who I'm Talking about\nAnd I don't even thinking God I don't even think he goes into the bank or a mall anymore because it's not worth it 'cause he he doesn't have to foot traffic he used to even you know even for you know being in there for the six weeks right before Christmas so I mean this is a it it's a larger story but it's kinda sad too because it's\nSaid it wasn't a bad story it wasn't a bad chain I was thinking about this my my father used to work at the uh he used to be an assistant manager at the mountain view house which is now the mountain view grand than whites feel New Hampshire and when I was a kid\nOne of the one of the guys who stayed there for most of the summer was a general woods General Robert woods he was the he was the former CEO of Sears he was a former ah he was a West Point guy in a former general in the Philippines believe it or not way way back and um and and he and you know he was one of the big biggest\nIndustrialists or a retail tycoons I guess in the United states how about the Sears Tower in Chicago it's not even the Sears Tower anymore they sold it Greg your next with how we car go ahead Greg\nHey existing how we you know we all grew up with the Sears catalog\nAnd just to imagine if some technology company could take in the strength of that platform and it just moved on line you would have had the first Amazon because it had such and such a reach in all parts of the country and you know had a wide range of products\nYeah you know they said they I I ...

of\nOther people as well not sure why you think it's a big deal because when you smoke pot you forget how to punctuate sentences but I I don't think it's a big deal actually that\nHave been smoking for a while and they can handle that ... although a lot of the people who say they can handle it I really don't think they can handle it but I don't like the thought of making it so readily available that it's going to spread it to learn\n... segments of the population you know people are saying well you know people buy it legally now so it's not going to make any difference well you know the thing is when the lottery started a lot of people still went to their bookies but you had a huge number of other people\nThat didn't have access to bookies or who were afraid to go to ... you know weren't in areas where there were\nA lot of ah ah bookies\nAnd so now now you had a ... now all these years later you have so many more people gambling than you used to have and you run into a lot of problems you people who are gamble get into trouble now I mean not everybody the gamble gets into trouble\nBut you have a war with legalized gambling you have more people getting into trouble getting into Bush this it's this I'm\nSure that there are more people drinking now but were drinking during prohibition I I don't\nI don't have any statistics obviously I'm In I'm not saying we should go back to prohibition\nBut it's just if you legalize something you're going to get more of it and you're going to get more we'd hear and I just don't think we need is a a is something that ought to be encouraged\nI just don't think it's a good uh it's it's good for society and again if we had the system that we had a hundred years ago where there was basically know welfare and you had to take care of yourself I Would think differently about it but now we have\nA welfare state why do you think all these people are trying to come up from Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador you looking for jobs you understand that\nYou know they they're they heard there was no work here\nIf you if you make it easy for people to live without work and they're going to live without work and and that's why they're swarming into this country from around the world why we don't want these people coming into the country and living off of us why don't we want to encourage people to\nSmoke pot and be more likely to
