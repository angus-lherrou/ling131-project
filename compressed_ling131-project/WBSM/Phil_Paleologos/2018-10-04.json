they think about what they're voting base is going to do with this decision just because\nEither way it's that if you truly believe he's a sexual predator which I don't think any of them actually do but I don't let's say in a crazy world they did believe that then that's how they should vote they should not vote based off of where I'm going to get votes and on the other hand if you're like a Joe

it's basically they put a little microchip the size of like the tip of a pencil on to these um a circuit boards that are used in some instances by the department of defense\nAnd it allowed access so it wasn't like an external hack that could change the operating system of these microchips so basically\nAll of this is compromised any any time that one of those chips got into a Defense Department network entire thing is ...\n... they didn't put any of those things into Hillary Clinton's computers and they they wouldn't have all the secret they also\nGet a to apple and Amazon to a bunch of companies and and this is I think this is why it's funny is because the critics of President Trump want to say that he's starting a trade war with China when in fact they're doing this kind of thing

agree bill and I think a lot of people who are coming to that same realization and that's the ... talking about Russia show and some people were calling in and there was one guy in his thirties who said never registered to vote until he saw cabinet and he saw what they were doing the capital and he's a you know holy bleep\nYou know if they can do this the cabinet I'd better get down and register
