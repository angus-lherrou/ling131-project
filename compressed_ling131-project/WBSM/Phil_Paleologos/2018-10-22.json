process\nFor him right\nWhat's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander as they say eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two granny Warren\nBorn on the bio [laughter] they're all kinds of favorites are burning love et cetera et cetera stars Byrne that's a movie you know a pony your next with our car and go ahead Tony\nHey out a long time listener first time caller how're you doing\nGood thank you for thanks for calling\nI Want to ah talk a little bit about ... percent or a Second Amendment attacks yes a lot of people are talking about the uh two years that she's back in the millions of taxpayer dollars trying to prove that you could buy guns on line came up at the end it\nWell the last ... last shot come up she's come up all I Am the handle a lot of things I was in she Tony\nOh yeah yeah she [laughter]\nI I I loved it when she said her life was an open book\nYou know [laughter]\nI tweeted I yes powwow chow is the title of that open book and then she she also said so then he called her she is in case you didn't see that I wrote a column a couple of weeks ago she she falsely reported on her income taxes sworn under the pains in penalties of perjury that she'd donated fifty thousand dollars worth of used clothing to charity\nAnd then she said I just made a mistake\nOf course ... she never says the Donald Trump made a mistake or or any any Republican made a mistake but she she wants us to to believe that she just happened to put down incorrectly that she took fifty thousand dollars worth of clothing that actions on her income tax forms thanks a lot\nOf them are talking either about the Trump or organization that all of them are donating their their uh salaries every month to charity\nRight that yeah no you know you're right I mean that's another thing yeah they keep talking Donald\nFirst they said Donald Trump wasn't really a billionaire during the campaign remember that Hillary Clinton said that at the Al Smith dinner one time you start really is riches he says he is then he gets elected president and they say well you know what he's too rich to be president [noise] this is the thing every\nEverything he does [noise] they ah they either\nThey accused him of doing things they're doing or whatever he does too much or too little too much or too little mowing [noise]\nThat's what we had an incident back um it was just a couple of years ago when an individual that what was the newer driver that had raped a beat the student Austin and although I'll tell you about the college student and she was doing the responsible thing was taken overhaul\nUm and then she's ready to fight over a driver that was from the Dominican Republic and instead of being turned over to us so he ... you know he would stand trial and he would face of crimes\nHe was released out of the court and we never saw regaining some clinics right back to the Dominican Republic\nAnd you you asked them to hold it and then there's the the case in Quincy and an African who are raped a woman in the ... and you guys went to pick him up correct\nCorrect who went to um pick\nHim up as well or he was from Guyana and he was released um there was a ... or the ... and it just wasn't on it or is this place and that subject board a flight back to God or the next day\nYeah and and everybody was pointing the finger at each other the clerk or the judge and the sheriff and everybody was trying to blame each other for ... for him getting loose so uh what is it ah so so what you're saying is that since this a lung decision by the Supreme judicial court\nYou've had more women calling and saying why why didn't you pick up this guy who attacked me he's back out on the street now when I'm a I'm petrified album so in other words is is that what you're is is that what you're saying\nWe've had we've definitely seen an increasing domestic violence like most ... but what we've seen as\nWe'd had victims reach out to us and I thought he was in your custody I thought he'd be deported back to his country why he back on the street we've had some lives that even helped us as far as I'm identifying the subjects who he is um and as far as someone beard\nOr eerie legal you've got to get them there are plenty of victims which take advantage of the visa which we work with local law enforcement to get these victims of domestic violence sexual assault visas\nTo stay in the country who had been victimized\nBy individuals so it's totally reverse those kind of what the standard is that what made friday night I'm you know I definitely doesn't threaten people that go to court\nUm refer shore aren't going out and specifically arresting people there are coming forward and report crime um it's it's really frustrating when or what\nSomeone or you know for either party or someone in the media reports that 'cause that's spread more fear that just does need to be there\nWhy would you make such false inflammatory statements\nYeah honestly uh there's a lot of the state of lately\nI'm from\nA lot of officials and the media I just wish people would actually come to understand exactly what I was on a daily basis we get painted with this broad stroke I'm In pretty much you know we're villain eyes\nJust for doing our jobs ... for anyone that does say that were out there threatening all we're asking people are separating families all we're doing is\nEnforcing the laws that are on the books plain and simple laws already written they weren't written under this administration I've been here with ice for three administration and we've done the same thing with John I'm\nWould you say her claims are categorically false\nYes\nThen I Want to play ... I Want to play another cut here where she uh she she said the uh Jeff deal called her out on something and then we'll play what you really sad here this is again from this is from the first debate in uh in Brighton on a friday night\nOh the ... this is the cut where she she denied Jeff the it starts out with Jeff deal and then she denies that she actually said that you wanted to or to abolish drugs if they're in the uh it's it's in the intro\nSee I'm I'm just looking here I'm a I don't see it so let's just\nUsed to that the criminal justice system is racist from front to back now I Want to know who's exempt from that because he tried to back away from that statement whether it's lawmakers who make the laws\nAbout it I've got to this that's the that's the wrong what's a what's a first of all a fifty fifty\nGang in Boston somebody was killed just a few months ago on an east Boston beach that person was apprehended by ice and that's where we needed to allow them to do the job of identifying those criminals who are here illegally and committing crimes they're the ones that are keeping I speak to you want to get rid of that agency wholesale briefly and then I Want to move on to see\nThis agency for formed an agency that can't tell the difference in their risk between a seven year old girl between a woman going in from brain cancer surgery and the terrorists or a criminal is an agency that is not working is not making a safer [laughter] sure doesn't reflect our values\nAnd then she ... and then she ... she denied that she said she wanted to replace it but here's the flashback of her saying it worth the cup worth doing\nTo\nSystem [noise]\n\nWhat's your take on those two statement she says you can't tell the difference between the seven year old or someone going in for brain cancer in a terrorist\nUh yeah unfortunately that kinda that that was kind of hit home for all of us at least ... myself personally and and everyone else in the Boston office I'm not I have no idea where the\nThere has got that from a I can tell you that no one in my office has ever put handcuffs on seven year old boy or girl in Massachusetts we are a quote unquote separating families and interesting family unit\nUm I I I pretty much kitten kitten again category we say that we definitely know a difference between a terrorist and the child um I it's been a while since I've been all but you but I mean we've just had a large operation of art right\nNow one of them you know really good a fantastic job I mean you took it took ... five people off\nThe street for getting illegal or welfare payments these were illegals and most of them were either a domestic abusers and or drug dealers in one of them was an actual convicted murderer from Puerto Rico\nOr yeah and that's and that's a bad thing how it is because you know statements like that a ... yeah they're pretty inflammatory and it kind of like I said it hits it hits home for us because that's not what we do in the state of asked you that that we do it my air operations in New England\nIce categorically we we aren't at the border arresting people by our charter where we're interior enforcement you know our brothers and sisters and green and blue with the border patrol and customs and border protection\nThey are the ones who stopped family and it's coming on April and the border ISIS responsible for that attention side of that\nSo I just wish any political figure whether it be Democrat or Republican independent would actually learn the mission of heights first before they say that we're resting young children or we don't know the difference between a terrorist at a child or someone going for brand cancer surgery I can definitely tell you that no one on your way to break into surgery has ever interested\nUnder my watch in the box office\n... we appreciate the good work you're doing in the ... so to a most people in a in Massachusetts New England that are across the nation as well and who who by the way can I ask you one last question I don't know if you\nCan answer it will you be voting for Elizabeth Warren in a couple of weeks\nI I'm a political highly so\n[laughter] I think she'll get a lot of votes in the ice office in Boston\n[laughter] he always ask those questions I just really can't answer\nAll right Todd lions we appreciate your coming on and uh you know it's a it's terrible what you said about you guys though again we appreciate the job you're doing it thank you for your service and thanks for taking so many of these uh criminal illegal aliens off the street and we wish you were getting\nMore uh more cooperation from the local law enforcement\nWell we just really appreciate you and your staff and other outlets that actually get the real truth of the operation
