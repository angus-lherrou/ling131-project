know where I remember a few years back we were trying to build a wall between Iraq and Syria you know because uh the the uh\nThe ISIS caliphate was being set up in Syria and they were ... they were they were drifting down into Iraq and we were trying to protect the Iraqis and I and I and I'm sure you were thinking the same thing I was thinking which is that's great we're trying to protect the Iraqis what about protecting the people in the United states from the invasion\nOr you know CNN loves through the countdown clocks like the countdown to their ... a town hall the countdown to this comes down to that then account down till the caravan at the border that would seem to be more exciting to me than ... town hall\nThat ... that that that'll be the same countdown clock as to the blue waves crashing before it reaches the shore 'cause that's what that's what it amounts though there's it's this is going to a wreck their uh their prospects for a for a ... ... ... pro regaining the house of representatives\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty to Dan your next with how we guard go ahead than\nHey how good they just wanted to address this little ... from everybody was having about who to vote for governor because none of us want to vote for either the Democrats sawdust to encourage everybody to do what I Would I Would ask the word I'm gonna I'm gonna write it Scott Lively\nI think he told me he doesn't want them to do that though they didn't they\nReally didn't have that well maybe I'm mistaking then you could write into cars I'm Robin ... for governor ah I ...\nI don't know I just I you know my my my fear then is that ah you know you know I don't I don't think this is a law but I think in some places\nThey will probably tend to throw out ballots that have right ends on um just because they don't want to go through the hassle and they don't think the election is going to be very close and so if you ... ... and again I'm not saying I'm not you know pointing the finger at any one city or town I'm just saying that I think there's a tendency in some places to do that\nAnd uh and I can't say I was like well a moment but the other the point is if you there are other there are other\nRaces you want to vote and I'm thinking specifically of the deal fake Indian race right so if you don't want to you you don't want to risk the chance that your ballot will be thrown out and the and the deal will lose a vote I that's that's my only caution there and uh you know I I yeah\nIt's talk on that is a sad commentary on the state of affairs but it's it it it rains pretty close to to rally problems yeah\n[noise] yep thanks thanks for the call Dan aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two you know might be that they would that would count if they thought it was a a quote any of these races were close they might they might be more inclined to count 'em but they just the you know you just look at it and say I do I really want to spend you know an extra minute or so writing this down\nWhen it's only going to be one or two votes so I I Would say just just blanket that's that's that's what I'm going to do I I've decided I'm On a blanket aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nA ten year next with our car and go ahead Ken\nHey great show and I got a solution [noise] potential temporary solution to the care of an invasion yes okay what you can do what you can do and I think is is totally legal\nIs what the president could do is when the Caribbean and gets\nClose to the border and the district there in the border patrol district it there and\nHe can close the border by proclamation a decree it anybody who crosses at that time is not subject to asylum ... asked her benefits or whatever they can get stroll light out because the borders closed\nWhat they call it now is the borders open all over the place and they get a nice if they can claim asylum in the set whatever\nRight I think he did close the border if you close the border they don't have that right to claim asylum or anything else\nSo I think no I think you're right ... no I think I think that all of that costs yeah I think that's\nWhat they're that's what they're trying to figure out I'm sure that they're you know border a border patrol or ice or the attorney general's office one thing about sessions as you know he's been a real disappointment in a in a lot of ways but he's really on top of the immigration struggle\nYou know he's a they're they're having a the liberals are already complaining but they they were were hiring a immigration judges who were just basically rubber stamps for letting more a welfare mend the consent of the U.S\nAnd he's he's were send that a lot of the uh the job or\nA the job offers to these people and they're really angry about that so I think I think Sessions' will be on top of this by the way and does the the earlier caller was speaking about Joe the job I was thinking about getting Joe the general on tomorrow because tomorrow is the day that a Rod Rosenstein\nThe deputy attorney general is going to testify before Congress under oath about what happened and it's it's it's not going to be very satisfactory I'm pretty sure of that because he's going to testify behind closed doors and then they'll make a transcript and then they'll give it to all the intelligence agencies quote unquote\nThe uh the the uh the soft coup agencies or the the Democrat operated soft coup agencies to decide what they want to or a redacted on grounds of quote unquote national security which means everything\nAnd so it's not going to be it's not going to be very satisfactory but we need to keep keep an eye on this thing 'cause it's a ... they cannot be allowed to get away with trying to overthrow the duly elected president of the United states it's just not it's it's not a\nIt's not in the cards as far as I'm concerned I don't care who controls the Congress they they've got to be the action is got to be taking these people have got to be put in jail for what they tried to do because if if if Carter Page George Papadopoulos Paul Manafort the rest of them don't have\nCivil rights none of us up civil rights I
