a acknowledge there's a possibility that President Trump wasn't planning anything he didn't wasn't trying to do anything\nBut I think this comes down to a pretty well thought out and I think inappropriate and smart strategy for including the election campaign let me tell you why\nBecause right now he sees that the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate both of which are goals\nIs to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats have become that's why I think the Kavanaugh hearings were so important\nWas the Capitol hearing showed was that even for people who might have some doubts about President Trump and some of his character and his personality and this and that what you saw from the Democrats was just so infinitely worse and more hostile and more out of touch and showed such contempt for\nBasic American Standards of of decency and due process and everything else I think that a a great core of people on the Republican side said not that\nNo and we have to come together and fight it and that's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named Jerome hunt zoning\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real crime\nThen the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was

nationalist\nAnd the indignation that you hear about that from the left fits in almost perfect lead to a very controversial column that appeared yesterday\nBy our friend David learnt or who's a professor at Yale by the way and a very very brilliant guy the the column appeared under the headline the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd by the way I don't entirely agree with his column\nBut I'm kind of mostly due and one\nOf the things that to learn to says about the real reason they hate Trump is because Trump represents things about the average American that a lot of intellectuals and certainly intellectuals left really resent\nI mean all of this stuff about we can't have Thanksgiving anymore we have to have Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and yes that was the thing here in the city of Seattle and back in two thousand and eleven I think it was\nUh the school board declare that we had to observe a day of mourning associate with Thanksgiving 'cause the Native Americans in this basic idea that we need to stress guilt rather than gratitude about our country\nIs sick an awful and I think\nThat flushing out some of that from some of his most stern critics us on the President Trump is pretty good at a professor ... writes Mr Trump reminds us who the average American really is not the average male American or the average white American\nWe know for sure that come two thousand twenty intellectuals will be dumbfounded as a number of women and the number of blacks will vote for President Trump\nHe might be real lining the political map plane average Americans of

on hold on the point about this is can we recognize that American nationalism from the beginning of the country\nHas been different because it has not been based on race in other words the ... and ... in German nationalism\nA such as it is it all very complicated there's a I have a a a tweet that came out um basically defending Hitler in order to condemn Trump that we have to get to in a moment\nBut ah at Hitler wasn't even German he was Austrian and that's why his nationalism that he talked about was all racial and based on race\nBut well it's interesting you mentioned the ... because that's the route French nationalism is the root of chauvinists I'm which obviously as negative implications\nWell know showman is um is is different because of that is is a ... who is associated with it it's considered an extreme form of nationalism now if you take an extreme form of nationalism ah where are you you were insisting and urine nation must rule the whole world\nProblematic but one of the points that that people who've written about this make in defense of nationalism in in defense of identity\nIs that if you don't have a nation defining who you are\nAnd do you define who you are based upon race or ethnic background or something other than a a national inheritance or a national cause\nIt's far more dangerous and far more toxic\nAnd or in

a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people had baked and the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump\nAnd I think that Trump's antics as a personality had depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law and I think that\nAt best it showed the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in a violating norms and politics and at worst\nAlmost extra constitutional so I think that Trump managed to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to October surprise on their feet and having to blow up in their face\nYeah it's it does it does

that's eight six six nine five four three three eight eight back with John Fund a John is the national affairs columnist for National Review\nHe worked for more than Twenty years for Wall Street journal and a is also a contributor at Fox News we're talking about the the upcoming elections one of the things and and again you made this observation before John\nWe're both admitted political junkies follow this stuff a lot ah but the house races with four hundred and thirty five of them\nAre so confusing to most people my strong gas is that most Americans most Americans and I think probably an overwhelming majority could not identify who their representative in the house of representatives actually is couldn't even name\nSo what do we do about that or just basically live with that and try to break through somehow into people's consciousness on these house races\nWell incumbents have an advantage in when Ninety percent of the time because they do a lot of constituent work\nFor their people and they also get around the community shake hands and become well known\nSo while not everyone knows who their congressmen is a lot of people in the middle the independent voters or if they've met their congressmen or their gotten their mothers Social Security check taking care of the congressman's office they liked the congressman\nAnd the the the job of a congressman is two fold if to represent the people and also of course vote their conscience that it's a balancing act and ultimately voters have to decide what's important to them\nSadly the vast majority of people don't vote well about half the people will not vote in the selection\nOf those who do vote a lot of people will vote by party down the line but you will have some people say well even though I disagree with my congressman or woman I like what they're doing and they have integrity and they're honest person\nI yeah and uh whether it's it's the same kind of thing if you ask people in general do you think that Congress is honest and legit it's usually very very low approval rating people don't trust Congress as an institution\nBut then you ask people what about your own congressman congressman Smith I I happen to have a congressman Smith whose ... are representing my district as as it happens so what about ... and they say oh my congressman he's the exception he's really a good guy\nIt says the normal way people feel and they talk about public schools are are medical care anything else is that I'm the only one who's fortunate [laughter]\nIn an island of dysfunction in a while to get his numbers in\nPublic and keep the house it may be in part\nThat the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say yeah but I Am really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked or ... or shaking his hand or helped me out\nAnd that's why in general you never bet against incumbents so some of these Republican incumbents me in the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nSince the real problem is the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... or more\nEmpty seats than in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because at an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party street party line\nSo I'm\nIn in terms of I Know that the Republicans have good chances of knocking off some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook\nPolitical Report to win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks the campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWell I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that's number one\nTo the economy is really good and that's not an accident or ... o'clock Obama's policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats the takeover Congress and the third is you\nKnow uh there's some basic things the Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law as proven by Kavanaugh\nAnd to why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it that moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election\nAnd at the same time the Democrats are completely silent but a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president Honduras and his henchmen uh what's the wall Street Journal is written about and the Daily Beast has written about that this really started uh as as basically a means of undermining the

combination that hobby and I\nWonder if this happened this nation for the confederacy those guys they worked traders in any other nation those got into them I Would have been I think it's outrageous that we're any monuments museums ...\nOkay I I look as you know I'm ... and you've heard me before on this Mike I'm sympathetic to that point of view not that they should have been hang a but that are up to have a monument in the middle of a city park well Nathan Bedford Forrest I think was just removed or is about to be removed\nFrom some um him and I believe in Memphis, Tennessee and Nathan Bedford Forrest was not only a Confederate general he was the founder of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd so okay but you see this mountainside is is different um and it it's different because this is like Mount Rushmore it was a work of art it was a public project\nAnd I think it's perfectly appropriate would signage around it reminding people of everything that you said\nThat ah these are people who fought against the United states\nAnd in context of this entire monument was put up\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away this three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there in a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a needlessly polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the ... that show hey\nYou know my heart I'm well over ...\nI heard your mate and I just listen to your explanation okay maybe in fact they'll get their heritage\nNo no I never I never say that this is their heritage I never say that because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay but here in the outfits you find that it's so beautiful historical and all that I Would you feel that that was the Stone Mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that's their heritage\nAgain and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage and that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an art work piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move age three acres culture that it took Thirty years to make you only blow it up\nOr if there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that ... should be blown up\nI think it's important that it be preserved date is part of the record of history\nAnd they didn't have any statues and Auschwitz but if they had them there that should be preserved is part of the historical record as well and given the fact that ah they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place that was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have T shirts say Stone Mountain\nAh that that that very very polarizing unfortunate ... your choices [noise]\nI I think the key question becomes um what

the Senate race in Arizona and the Senate race in Tennessee and the Senate race in North Dakota\nAnd all those high profile Senate races but there are a bunch of others and almost always there is a big surprise or the comes that wow I didn't see that one coming back in Nineteen eighty when Republicans ended up taking twelve seats in the U.S Senate yep twelve seats\nThere was a situation like that in the state of Washington longtime senator he had been elected for ever been there since the earth cooled name Warren Magnuson\nAnd boom on election day he loses to a guy name Slade Gorton who's a friend who became truly a great great representative for the state in the United States Senate\nNow could history repeat itself there will be some surprises in election day and one of them could be right here in Washington state\nI'm joined by the Republican nominee for US Senate in Washington I'm Susan Hutchison Susan great to see you again thank you my pleasure and by the way you can find out about this race it's Susan for Senate dot com that's pretty easy\nUh right now you just told me something that is is remarkable ... even in the most recent polling that you have of likely voters because of this mobilization of Republicans that everybody is feeling all across the country this is getting to be a close race could be as close as four points\nThat's absolutely right Marie can't well as an Eighteen year income that she should be sitting well about fifty percent right now and we've got her about five points under fifty percent so um she's in trouble and and so we've been working really hard in order to close that gap and what is the big\nChange that you're going to bring representing Washington in January of next year so what Maria Cantwell has been doing we're not doing\nFor these last sixteen years then the last what twenty\nFour years well she's been in public office she's twenty five years I had a congressman before and Twenty years in federal office\nSo this is her six federal race or election I should say but um what what I think it's going to happen is that people around the country are you going to realize that this is not a deep blue state as people believe\nThe chairman for half a decade of the G O P A state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a of a deep blue state where a purple state and and\nMen by the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and one of the one one now yeah both and so what would change one seed there and then makes a a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead says on his ...\nRight if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot\nA that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists\nThey don't want this new vision that has been so articulated by the Seattle's city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they passed\nAnd uh we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay this had tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with and\nAnd your opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs bill she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not a tax they don't love it's another way to get people's money\nAnd the people in this country are seeing a new way and that thanks to Donald Trump kind of it doing with his policies are what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved in our state and across the country that unemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd um I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three full terms in the U.S Senate um what's what would be your first priority if you actually won this thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and a lot of people may not realize that we were inundated with forest fire smoke based on
