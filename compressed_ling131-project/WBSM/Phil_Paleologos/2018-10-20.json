A. S. D.\nS. I. T. C. original flavor [noise] for for a while I don't know if we get them out\n[noise] or your\nPresentation of what you ask them for a new for for a dream wedding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo I only got to see the Grateful Dead when they were that other than the Grateful Dead band with all the other people 'cause I was too young but I still remember the phenomenon of seeing people on their knees putting their heads together and begging for tickets thing they needed a miracle so you may need a miracle to get into this game\nBut I don't think the brewers necessarily need a miracle to win it it's going to be a battle I don't believe it's going to be a blow out though\nBut I think they have the momentum they've got to handle on the small ball even though you can look at Manny Machado\nAnd you could look at a David Freese he's silence that crowd yesterday when he drove in both of those runs for the Dodgers he can be deadly the thirty five year old who was the lead off hitter in this last one and a surprise to a few people when Dave Roberts actually put them in that home\nBut I Do like the brewers to pull it out I really do\nWhat do you think is gonna be the brew crew or the Dodgers in the middle of all this this is the best time of year because we're waiting to see who's going to meet the red Sox in the world series and while that's going on with some pretty good games coming up a little bit later in college\nFootball you know when you look at Clemson and who could be deadly North Carolina state they just do their business the wolf pack and they are undefeated to an island the ACC Clemson has had some challenges this year yes they're undefeated yes they're ranked third by the football at the college football selection committee\nBut look out and it is in Clemson but hey it's a stone's throw away at Memorial stadium you're going to see some of the will power\nPack out there for sure and uh it's not going to be easy necessarily to stop Ryan Stanley that defense that everybody's talking about for Clemson they got to get to Finlay if they're going to really make it work for them this could be a no they're close\nGame for crimes and and they have narrowly pulls a couple of those out I'm thinking of the Aggie game in particular Clemson\nThough is favored by Eighteen and a half [noise] Eighteen and a half\nSo you would think that the odds makers know a little something something because yeah they are a powerhouse teams but this is the kind a game that's almost like a trap game or say on us like a trap game\nThen you've got Alabama and Tennessee I mean really it's ridiculous to think anyone can stop Alabama and it's not going to be Tennessee that would be the shocker of the day if that happened maybe of the it would be the shocker of this season if it happened in Knoxville they'll have their fans out there but Alabama\nIs actually a favor by almost thirty points\nBut even if you forget the line you forget about that you just go up and down the fence in the defense for Alabama that all starts with two or who was a pro style quarterback I mean he's ready to go he's ready to roll Annie is thrown Twenty one touchdowns for reasons\nBecause he's just that good and that's why he is the lead quarterback for Alabama and we saw what happened last year for all the marbles in the national championship which is why he stepped in for jailing hurts and then the rest of the history but\nIf that's thirty some points holds up or twenty nine and a half points holds up you definitely will see jailing hurts as it's been customary now for next saving and the fourth quarter because why waste to or if they have put the game behind them and this is probably what we're going to see\nIn the game between these two although it's always intriguing to watch and\nYou're out what Nick saving his thinking and in the beginning of course usually it seems a little bit closer but [laughter] just give it a little time and and then it is out of reach an intriguing game to me\nAlways separate raw meat from vegetable fun to cut you keep your family I think you've got to you by the U.S [noise]\nThey have\nWhat are you doing just sending a gift to Dave

something cool like that I think Dave twenty thirty seven deserves it he worked hard what are you getting Steve twenty thirty seven\nI guess I was thinking Steve twenty thirty seven with just fend for

all kinds of drama there's a good Charlotte\nLike season ending injury [noise] there's a mystery kind of like having an agent at Hollywood's Philly drama drama around mom's time delays and then there's the drama ...

grocery guys lift who's tooling around solo\nWell in my household let's see if it's a Tuesday night it's going to be a pen a pasta with a green mushroom sauce [noise]\nI'm kidding it's always [laughter]\nCome on that's what you eat\nOr out of the most part it's I'm so busy and uh you know the the the places the fast food places or nearby and I just pick stuff up on the way home you know\nIsn't that brutal we all have that excuse me I think fast foods advantage is that it is fast\nAnd that we're all too busy and it's easy good that that we like it boom they felt it up so we inhale it and that's the deal that the single guys let's just start with fast food I agree pieces have to be huge I bet you men order pizza that more than women though I Do I think that\nHealth why so the single ... single moms always worried about her weight more than men are so that means even if we're dying Jones and to inhale a pizza and we might or probably there is probably a good chance to that you're going to hit the grocery grab up some yogurt or something a little bit more low Cal and motor on how\nI think there's a better chance I think I think my unofficial survey says\nThat between men and women not that a guide never goes the grocery store but that mostly women they would make themselves a single at from twenties on up\nThey would make themselves go into the grocery store and grab something maybe a little healthier they wouldn't constantly always going to a fast food I think that would be more by men than women\n[laughter] okay [laughter]\nOkay we're going to challenge me in America go ahead [laughter] bring it on I Want to hear the fast food challenge and you know what lives\nIn all of us are that way though I mean we're all guilty of it and it's because of what you said we live these crazy hectic lives where we're a lot of us are gigging so you're juggling a couple of different things you don't have that old traditional back in the I don't know sixties and seventies you know nine to five job and\nTo income household deal and whatever it's different it's just different lifestyles it would be great if there was a better way to survey that I mean I I I'm Serious that I have done a few kind of little tests on this but\nI Do believe it's still not that again women aren't accounting for fast food but this is a little bit more you you do they're doing it I really think that [noise] I mean the thing\nAnd I when I eat my NA pasta fill up because I Love it\nI said let me jump on these um scores real quick and I were to go back into baseball Auburn did wrap up old miss the thirty one six team you know it's interesting because Auburn is five and three they had a couple of would've should've games are can be a lot different story for them\nJared stint him it's so fun to watch and once again he\n... up with the wind you know he's the guy that's going to get over there and he does and so uh no problem but he's not on any Heisman lists if he's not on necessarily a pro list he's he could be on a privilege to be drafted\nPerhaps a little bit in the lower rounds but of all the other quarterbacks that are out there is not gonna be the highest on the list\nThirty one sixteen like I said over old miss and he had two hundred and Fifteen passing yards and that touched down in that victory elsewhere these wrap up I'm\nO T not wrapped up because it was looking like it it was going to wrap up in it surely will certainly soon Miami of Ohio the nemesis of the college I went to Ohio University I Can't even tell you what the T shirt said or jak silver would yank me off the air but just use your imagination\nTo twenty four Twenty one feeding army there in the sea and throwing that out because I got a couple of people that actually sent me emails wanting to know about the ... conference in Miami Today in particular\nSo there you go you got ...\nTemple in Cincinnati Cincinnati does warrant the conversation\nBecause they're in the top twenty they're perfect at six you know and they are tied with temple at Seventeen so they're going into the ocean he northwestern that made a little something something noise in the beginning of the year not now\nThey did beat Rutgers but barely Rutgers is a measly in the Big Ten one in seven they knew it was going to be a struggle\nOnce they jumped into the big than a couple of years ago Eighteen Fifteen northwestern\nWinning that one I mentioned a couple of the bigger games that are kicking off later Clemson in North Carolina state that has danger signs even though the line certainly doesn't portray that\nUm other interesting games include LSU in Mississippi said already mentioned that as well South Florida takes on Connecticut they should walk all over them at number Twenty one UCF perfect sick so they should walk all over east Carolina\nAnd um you know then you go deeper into things and you get\nUSC and Utah now that would be a fun game to watch the use are\nFavored by seven favored by seven there wow so where does this time go it flies stages set for the national league championship series this showdown\nPutting the Dodgers back against the wall they might not make it back\nInto the world series we'll see brewers could stop that sum up next what's at stake we'll talk about it with Brad powers as we go inside the line ... bc force radio

business ... business dance circles around the big bulky but he may go off in the small business phone solution as a virtual receptionist to direct calls to the right extension\nYeah I like the under more than anything I I think the six point line says that it is a flat spot for LSU because in my opinion there clearly the better team but they are coming off games against Florida and then obviously last week the the big outright upset went over Georgia at home Mississippi State meanwhile comes in ... by\nBut but I in my opinion that's all price on the line that's while she's only six point favor I prefer the under here and it's two reasons number one issue off as can be a little bit flat Mississippi State\nOn the other side has the number one scoring defense in the country and Mississippi State out often they have a good quarterback by the name of ... but they're pretty one dimensional on off and so I think ...\nThe defense will have their way with it so under forty five ... favorite picking that one\nI like that what's your how we're playing of the day\nOh that's a good one and we're going to go to a relatively big game and the pact\nWell I'm going to take Utah minus the seven against us see and it's a play against us see in the underdog role last\nTwelve times USC has been an underdog there one in eleven against the spread there are also very good away from home Utah playing with revenge from last year Utah's red hot team the last couple of weeks big game there I think the moment might be a little too big for the freshman quarterback for us to give me the you\nYeah what do you think overall this year when you look at the line the ones that have held up the ones that have and what kind of years have been so far midway through\nWho that's another great question case ah I Would say they're outside of the couple of the the the big upsets like BYU over Wisconsin and of course Old Dominion\nOver Virginia Tech there hasn't been a ton of you know significant offsets this year the lines of pretty much how study the top of the board and I get it a lot of people last couple of weeks I a lot of rank teams have gone down but a lot of times when they say upset in the newspaper headlines\nReality is not necessarily an upset a lot of times those teams that are lower ranked are actually favored in the game I think pretty much you know what the few exceptions college football there ... it's kind of an anti climactic is the word that I Will use\nYeah I agree with you I think it's the anti climb climactic too as well I think it's if we had on on the coaching carousel them maybe that would be a little more interesting because you know we've seen what's happening at Nebraska used to be a powerhouse school they got Scott Frost a former\n... quarterback as the the coach now and I guess they have to give more than one year but it's not looking good for him I Would say\nNo not not a good start and ever after ... plays Minnesota or they get this case the last ten home games for the Oscar there oh and and against the spread or you've seen a lot of a season of utility and it's even like the case here in Vegas with a ... point spreads\nCrazy crazy crazy as soon as we get closer and then we will this all down and we you know because I asked you for predictions at the top if you had to predict right now who who would you pick as the four will be there the four left standing to go at it for the national title\n[noise] yeah I think slam dunk Alabama uh I just don't see anyone coming close to the Crimson Tide ... maybe that they have a a closer again next week against LSU Alabama one slot to slap for me would be Clemens then I just was going to be a double digit favorite and all their remaining games until they get to the playoffs\nI would've said possibly Michigan they're struggling currently on the road like they always do against Michigan State I'm going to give you a surprise Oklahoma team that everyone thrown up in the trash 'cause they lost the Texas they look really strong are they coming off of by the sooner\nI didn't get to the playoffs and then the force spot you know what the heck will go with the the fighting Irish just 'cause there'll be favored and all the remaining game so Alabama clams in Oklahoma and no Big Ten and Notre Dame\nI Love it I'm going to ask you the most important question of all we were talking about grabbing earlier and I think that men eat more fast food than women were all crazed were running around like maniacs or you like a regular at in and out\nAh no I'm not ... and ... shocking 'cause I just moved out here a few years ago I had in and out maybe five or six times I'm not a fast food Junkie I'm just never been that way but but I Will say in and out are definitely one of the better of fast food joints in America\nYou mean are you eating healthy so you like if I ask you bacon or broccoli you're taking broccoli\nA no not necessarily the case said I have a girlfriend that that's a very very good cook so I always choose that over a lot of alternative\n[laughter] well that's that's a very smart man the girlfriend that cooks that's a good thing [laughter] is it an age it's a rarity I Love\nI Love that today's day and age um yeah because you know why I actually I think men also cook do you ever cook or a male birth control\nAbsolutely yeah it happens once every couple of weeks I'm not as good and that's why I don't do it but I don't have an issue with it\nI Love it or the next week we'll be looking for that powers play again we'll see what happens thanks it's been fun pre she ate it\nAll right take our case acting\nI talk to you next week so Brad powers will join us next week again pre game dot com we look at the games through the will we do look at the games through the lines and as he said it's really hasn't been that kind of big upset college football\nSeason I mean let's face it we do like the Simpson and Goliath kind of\nMatch up we do and when there's an upset people talk about it for ever in a day it's a and M. had upset Clemson you would have never heard the end of it I mean that would have been the thing because constant would have been knocked out possibly of the chances of getting a title and\nJim both Fisher in his first year as the head coach at a and M. would have been such a hero he already is doing a

... nothing but an all pro um kick return or you don't show people respect you disrespect people but when it's time for you to stand up and be a man you act like you're a eight year old child\nI lost a lot of respect for jailing Ramsey and he was one of the guys that I really appreciate it kind of his you know his swagger and what he brought in and the way he played\nBut to me is just to look at the Jacksonville Jaguars and you know before I even go into the team I'm just very disappointed with Jamie Ramsey because he showed a lot of immaturity I think he really showed his true colors at that interview there\nNo question about that if you're going to walk the if you got to talk to talk walk the walk and I mean in a good way in a bad way and after a defense that take away seven points from the chiefs on a a pig sex\nBut you're talking about a defense that into games against the chiefs and the cowboys they have given up sixty three points\nAnd they're much better than that Ronnie they got names they got players they're not playing well and the jailing Ramsey wants to be the guy to put the bulls eye on the back of that team not just the defense the entire team with his trash talk and the bulletin board material he gladly gives every week even in hard times the man and talk\nI don't respect somebody that will only talk when the going is good Rodney but when the going gets tough eight or not in a locker room and be they give you trash answers like that lost a ton of respect to me he's a fraud around you hate\nSay what he what what else does this show it just shows that the Jacksonville Jaguars they can't handle success they were very successful last year\nAnd what are they doing now I mean you look at Blake borders since he beat the patriots and all of a sudden Blake borders as the next coming up John Elway how how do you even explain is often so coordinator you drive back and you pass the ball sixty one times against Kansas City\nWith Blake boils it's unbelievable they've gone away from what made them successful last year yeah you don't have a winner for net you never really have ... he's always hurt\nBut it has to you have to develop a mentality especially from a defensive standpoint I played on the number one defense understood that we had a really bad all fans\nBut we didn't worry about the often so we said hey if we have to stop a teen twenty different drives that's what we have to do in order to win a football game you don't get caught up in what the audience is doing yeah bleep borders as a fraud to nobody really believes and Blake\nYou show they show their true colors and what their belief system wasn't late last year and a F. C. championship when they when conservative and they wouldn't let him throw the ball down the field so don't get mad jailing Ramsey because this is a tension that you like how you get mad at the media for asking you questions that all the fans I'm a fan\nI Want to know what happened in that game\nBecause when you watch the game it's different from watching the game and then you go back and you watch the game again and you see the breakdowns and you see the lack of passion you see guys not wanting to tackle you don't see the same passionate Jacksonville Jaguars defense that was hungry\nThis team was hungry last year they wanted it now everybody's complacent everybody got their all pros made some incentives got paid and and and now they think they can just step out on the field and people are going to say okay this is Jacksonville Jaguars were going to lay down it doesn't happen that way\nAnd where's the leadership ads you got all these great players you have all this great talent but talent alone isn't good enough I played in four Super Bowls I Know this is one of the most talented teams defenses that I've ever seen in the history of the NFL is forest talent\nBut when you don't play with passion when you don't play with energy and when you don't play unselfish that's what ...\nThe Dallas Cowboys we just rent and raved about a week ago they put a forty some points on you it's unbelievable now what they need to do is we'll see what type of leadership they have we'll see what type of guy they haven't that locker room see if they can come back and make a difference but jailer Ramsey just shut up and play football man\nYup because you can't handle it that's exactly what it is you can handle dealing with the versus the losses and that's the type answers you give shut up and just play football but Rodney water disappointed so far there one in three in the last four\nFrankly they've always beaten one good team and that was the patriots game as you said they lost you know they they beat the New York giants they beat the New York jets\nThey lost the titans ugly Ninety six game where you know you have to tape or I Would open and watched that\nThey got blown out by the chiefs I got blown up by the cowboys you're right in terms of pure talent dish teams should be much better it should be a legit Superbowl contender\nAnd we saw Rodney in and shave on all of us I guess to think that they belong in the same conversation as the patriots and the chiefs atop the AFC they don't belong in that conversation right now because they are playing like trash\nAnd maybe we struggled struggled against athletic quarterbacks and now you have to face another act athletic quarterbacks and dish and watch it\nWe'll see what this locker room is made of will see the leadership we'll see what the coaching staff once again Tony done earlier this summer said hey somebody needs to boil jailing Ramsey aside and and talk to him and make him shut up\nWe'll see what happens who you're talking on the field\nThere you go to turn things around in Jacksonville alright turning things around in Oakland is it possible\nOur thoughts on John ... safety place Rodney Harrison didn't force with force regime\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] your NBC Sports radio updates now\nFrom Michigan starting to open it up after\nA Ninety minutes laying a whole bunch of other things between Michigan

check as control because this never happens the bell Czech team but here's grew in responding to rush on Melvin tweets take a listen\n[laughter] I haven't talked to him you know I'm sure I Will ... there was a Twitter report out their film Elizondo some seem I think\nThese different techniques may be confused I don't know I'll talk to him but he's got played better he's in a competitive situation perhaps he's frustrated and I can't blame us\nAnd to me it goes back to even with a little Mac remember during training camp he never even had communication with a little Mac right\nYou know he has to do a better job and it can't be I'm controlling the all fans and you control the defense now you have to have a communication and a level of\n'em just personal interaction with every player on your team\nYou know he gets so caught up in office and I said this on one of our shows like you get so caught up on often you forget about the defense but you still have to have a connection you still are you you're the head coach of the team\nYou need to be able to talk to your fifty third player you need to be able to talk to your first player or you're you're twenty third best player you need to be able to communicate and have a relationship with all those guys\nAnd the fact that you got a young guy blasting the you on Twitter and you said maybe he's confused I haven't talked to him to me that you're not doing your job\nThey paid a hundred million dollars and if it takes for you to sixteen hours Eighteen twenty you gotta do what you have to do to be able to get through to your players and obviously you're not getting through the players because they're not playing with passionate I plan to the raiders was actually better last year there are better team last year\nAmazingly yeah you're right and how about how much is on route and I mean\nHere's the thing that's what I said then everything I just say it was it was on John grew him it was on him because he's not communicating with his players he's not bringing out the best and if you have\nHe said resigned Melvin said something about you know I'm tired of change my my ... the way I play or whatever I'm getting back to my old self that means that you have to be able to adjust and adapt to the the type a personalities that you have right now these kids are different they're not like\nHarris and in the old school guys these guys are completely different so you're tactic your communication the way you approach you guys have to be completely different it is a young\nIsn't it amazing Rodney bat in the course of nine years 'cause he's been out of coaching for nine years he's been in that cozy\nYou know cushy job in the media making seven million bucks and he's making a ton of money with Monday Night football here's the thing though in nine years the the type of players changed drastically we've seen this before remember when the red skins went back to the well and they brought that Joe Gibbs and of course Joe Gibbs is an absolute legend and want a ton of Super Bowls\nComes back he was different he didn't get the job done and you have to think to yourself OK maybe a coaching style that works in one era or one decade doesn't work in this one\nGuy ... check out when you want to get tough and yell at them and the call 'em out and that's John grown that's why at the CIA key nickname back in the day when he was with Tampa Bay and before that open when he was younger\nHe's got to change but here's the problem the raiders alright cheap organization you said it Rodney they don't want to spend any money and sometimes you have bad contracts in sports like basketball or baseball because it's guaranteed contracts right\nHere's the problem but the raiders there one guaranteed contract is their head coach for ten years and it may be the worst contract that they have Rodney they can't get out of it\nAnd and and think about all offensively you have Martian lands and you have some readers layers talked about this you have 'em at the one yard line and you decide to pass you got Martian lands\nIt's like they don't have any cohesiveness in there all fenced they looked confused car went down hurt his arm and I saw him you know and and the camera cut into him he was crying\nHe was crying he was flat out crime because it's frustration and it was paying it was a lot of things and he's trying his very best to be that quarterback but just think about trying to play quarterback for John groove and how difficult that might be\nA my goodness well he you know he talks about Derek car as well and we talked about dark Carter a bit ago terms of you know the disappointment how he's played and that he's obviously not in the same guy from a couple of years ago he screwed\nThe strength to this for faulty than where I Am to play better goes on he's on my watch I shut it when I got here via sleigh will I failed this guy's a good player that can be great and we got to protect them better so we can really see what he can do if we do that I think um they'll showcase for\nSome of the things you saw ruin IRS plan for thirty two of them are there for four hundred and fifty yards come back to Cleveland there's a lot to work with their I'm excited about is\nA big part of that too is offensive Lee you have to put them in better position is not every often salon has a great often alive you know what I'm saying like you have to be creative offensively to help him out you can't be predictable you have to have some level of consistency I mean it's not like we're going into the first week now\nAnd we're going into the seventh week of the season you're over a month and a half nine including all the old TAs and training camps and many camps and things like that that you spent with this kid you know what he can do\nSo yeah obviously he has to play better to have to protect better they have to be a better prepared football team\nAnd that falls on the head coach point blank period I mean their car he like he said he's a good quarterback or above average quarterback but he's not great so we gotta stop maybe we just have to lower the expectations once we lower the expectations because right now I'm not really surprised with all this\nI knew that this was going to be a disaster we talked about it ... how difficult it was going to be for John grew to come in and really truly change the culture\nBut is it when you watch their car Rodney watch more film than anybody but when you watch Derek car is it a confidence thing you think\nOf course it is it's a ... it's a confidence thing it's it's a ... you like he's confused he's afraid to take chances and make mistakes sometimes it comes on the ... and it's really good\nIt's it's a little bit of all that but I think it's the expectations we think if we if we as fast just lord I expectations of said okay you know we don't think of him as like a\nMaybe a I'm Andy Dalton you know kind of just\nYou know decent at times but we try to put him on a level of Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees and that's where he's just\nAn above average quarterback with great athletic skills he's a he's a good looking kid he can move he at times he makes plays like Russell Wilson ... oh my God this guy could be unbelievable and any reverse back to him though his old so\nYeah it's really it's maddening to watch because a couple of years ago Derek car was on his way to being in that elite quarterback ... certainly the last year and a half yeah clearly has not been that guy no question about it but from the struggles of Derek car\nJak Prescott probably was listening to our show last week Rodney because we said something asylum play that he should have been long the old what does he do against Jacksonville what we're going to get to that

Michael this is from a Jeff\nAnd Jeff says Michael it was reported today that the budget deficit exploded Seventeen percent year over year do mostly to the Trump tax cuts the Jew so often preys on your show\nPerhaps you could comment on that instead of this ridiculous Elizabeth Warren side show very glad to comment on that uh let me just tell you that those people\nWho are saying that the reason for the budget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are partisan ... it's not true how do I know it's not true\nBecause revenues year over year at the same time that the budget deficit went up revenues went up they didn't go down the increase they increase slightly but ah my source for this is not only government figures but the New York times and the Treasury Department the New York times\nYeah they report that as a matter of fact the\nTreasury report of the federal revenues rose buys zero point four percent from the two thousand Seventeen fiscal year to the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year\n\nAnd uh they view that a treasury as a sign that the tax cuts are paying for themselves and the New York\nTimes takes issue with that because they say well the growth in revenues would have been even greater without the tax cuts okay they might be right to the growth of revenue would have been greater but the growth in revenue is still growth in revenue we're taking in more money\nThe problem\nWe have is we're spending too much and I actually think President Trump did a good thing and advising the cabinet that he expects every federal department to cut at least five percent and the knowledge that we should do more\nLet's go to on disagreement day Christine in Seattle you're on the Michael ... show\nShallow Michael I'm I'm calling today because I just to be with your marijuana\nI'm I Am a survivor of\nYears and years and that the pilot and I'm I\nBecause of that developed pie TST and\nI go to therapy I've been in therapy for about three years and\nThey recommended me to be on you know\nLike pharmaceutical drugs\nWas scared to do that and I didn't want to become reliance on it so with a combination of therapy and smoking marijuana I Am recovering\nI'm I'm very happy for you and I'm Glad to hear it and marijuana is legal medical marijuana has been legal for a long time um but you said and you're right you didn't want to become dependent on some of the pharmaceutical drugs shouldn't you also be concerned about becoming dependent on marijuana\nYes I actually am from that is a concern of mine um however I proven to myself I'm a numerous times that\nLike I'll go I'd I'd gone through fans in the past ... years have no you and then I use a cage and all and then I can like turn it down that OK early when I Do use I use it right before a therapy session I adore\nAnd ... and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you ... the the basic position that I Would have on marijuana is simply that being dependent on anything\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times they have an advice column whole sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nAnd I was saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and they say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said at the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but the ideas looked life life has all kinds of challenges\nAnd sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything don't make things\nOr difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go to a Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael ... shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I'm not ... today that we all are Saudi

happen if a President Trump all of a sudden it's announced okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what would happen do you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nAt first you're\nAbsolutely they would they would first probably get them from China or Russia and a ... again what have we accomplished ... I Do I Believe that Saudi Arabia's a problematic country I think it's a corrupt and brutal autocracy it's a very problematic country\nBut do I believe that it would help the United states to completely alienate ourselves and end the working relationship with Saudi Arabia Thomas Friedman is a big liberal wrote to find peace in the New York times yesterday\nAnd that piece made the case that look we need reform and the whole Islamic world we need reform in the religion because the essence of what happened in September eleventh was not paying enough attention to the real threat of radicalized murderous a neo fascist\nRay to be so great to be a celebrity I'm\nOne of the one of the reasons I guess every once in a while it's it's worth looking at some of these wonderful celebrity couples and I think the Davis and can be very funny and Ariana Grande is obviously very talented\nI don't think either of them are thought leaders or a enormously season a or in depth commentators on the passing scene but I I only think that because I don't regularly read team vote\nOr [laughter] which says uh and poverty by ending you can end poverty without ending capitalism I mean well I'll tell you can't and pain you can but it sure helps and pain when you get to go to release factor\nAnd this came in from Greg in Hawaii he says my left knee started swelling last year making climbing stairs in walking distance of\nThe seven then you'll fall flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals there lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to\nFifty percent off in stock and ready to go save big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents get will look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off free finished\nHardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nEach year nearly nine hundred thousand people in the U.
