Kleenex I didn't even know there were men size Kleenex but you learn all kinds of things in this job a first up something even more important which is the American economy which\nIs coming along and the market's up a little bit today but generally the economy is coming along and there has been a great deal of\nGood news uh there's more good news when you pick up the brand new book\nIt it literally is just going to be arriving in stores if you've ever used doors are right now it's a book called Trump's ... inside the America First plan to revive our economy\nOf the book is by my friend Stephen Moore and by professor Arthur Laffer a Steve congratulations on the book and it's very well time\nUh Iraq over like thanks so much for the nice guy words and I'd a lot of fun writing it you know with my buddy laugh or it was really just kind of first hand account of when we started working with Donald Trump back in early to thousands sixteen ...\nAnd and I do think a lot of people including me a reading some of your personal descriptions of coming into Trump's office and\nBut he interact with people it's reassuring it's sort of different portrayal than what you get in mainstream media yesterday everybody in the in the press and you of course have been one of President Trump's economic advisors since the campaign\nBut uh people are fixated on this alleged shouting match between John Bolton and and um and John Kelly the White House chief of staff and\nA new all these stories a White House chaos that's not what you see at least that's what you indicated in the book\nBut Trump is a person who likes to actually have differing views at the table you know so we used to have arguments all the time I mean I liked them I mean I like Donald Trump a lot personally is a is a fun person to be around he's actually come very gracious these very charming and\nOr attempted or he would like to put two or three people on the table and district ... disagreeing physicians you know and we do get out and then he'd\nEat sort of make up his mind which I think is a good thing that's what a businessman does ah so you know so what if they're shouting at each other you know he wants to have a ... he doesn't want to be surrounded by a bunch of yes men and I think that's a that's a good thing\nOr about Donald Trump but you know I'll correct you on just one thing is that Michael when you said that ... a kind of becoming a long look I did I think you're under stadium is I had this is a full fledged boom or on right now\nYou know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was in you know I've I've heard from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine in ... in between and everywhere I go I'll I see is you know I saw this in Seattle I saw it in Portland as she at San Francisco I see it you know Nashville, Tennessee in Denver, Colorado and\nAh you know Austin, Texas everywhere just about\nFriends everywhere buildings going up skyscrapers factories warehouses biggest construction boom and history of this country is going on right now everybody's so bullish on America they want to build a lot of it is for investment money that's coming in\nTo the United states we have what you know every time I Do your show I liked the you know I'm ... another statistic uh first of all we got the\nIndustrial production numbers came out there like the highest ever and then we the the seven point one million you know the statistics seven point one million more jobs than Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming toward the border in that caravan I've let me let me go to one of the oil and I just\nInterrupt you one sure it's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today\nAnd they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald Trump ally ally and and and I you know and they and they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama what way way way way out but you know that why that was right\nYeah because people didn't get jobs exactly there were no jobs here yes and it's been rough the real\nReliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came in the United states so you know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic opportunity but they never connected the dots on CNN on that you know\nUh but the but it is a sign that they mentioned that lets you and I agree on this we need a lot more legal immigrants from this country we need more people on the farm farm workers and we need more service workers and we knew him reading more technology workers and and I used to tell Donald Trump I\nDon't do this you know it and it's in the books\nWe saved are going to build that wall battle make sure it has big gate so people can come in legally\nThe book is called Trump a non makes inside of the America First plan to revive our economy but you don't believe that President Trump should allow this a ... a caravan from Honduras which is marching forward was Honduran flags by the way that they should allow\nA van into the country do\nYou know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we talk a and I'm I'm watching all these people are you know a lot you know there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on and\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cut and three years and we actually have a slight increase rap is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nOr continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues that put people in the work at ... businesses profitable and move businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah look the problem is spending and you know people I say oh you're just a robbery Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do you\nKnow that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agency and this is what businesses did during the recession they\nTalked in their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of inefficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money they became profitable getting we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and that that is a structure\nWe need pipelines we need ... terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports a lot of that Michael I think can be good to be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nThat is evil\nIn North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to that\nWas evil\nIn the last two years I've seen through\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\nOpponents are not evil\nWe are blessed with a political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully\nWe must recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nIt's beautifully said I'm thanking Nikki Haley speaking last night the Al Smith dinner will come back to that meanwhile a quick word

when our that evening I learned about her daughter telling her what happened\nAnd was shocked as any parent would be the here that this happened to her daughter and she talks to the school officials and finds out that this happened because the schools transgender policy specifically allowed this boy to use the girl facilities\nOkay is there a is their policy if the schools just basically any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right it all it takes is for a student to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assume that when you say that the little girl's five years old was molested she was touched was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the ... hills but um and it's something\nThat we would all be above ... of course with the opponent anybody who has children or grandchildren is going to be appalled by the so so what happened ... show went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct this policy what the school authorities say to her\nYet no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think the school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they share the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so ... was left with no choice but to do with any parent what they would take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in helping or seek the justice at the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or Bennington, Vermont\nVicious Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a traditional commonsense values\nThat you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that\nGirls go into girls restrooms voice go into a boys and if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a teacher's restroom a single use the facility but you never\nMental facilities have the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window because of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay as so Pasha Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh it's usually you'd think that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who is doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what ... what happens\nNext here ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taken seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay as so a ... in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother indicator Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that\nAnd to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to\nCautious daughter there are better solutions but the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa I those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... the cater school district it here\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about\nWho um I give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skills of this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation and it's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC\nOr religious liberty is still under assault and it's under assault or by bureaucrats by local officials by school boards in many many different areas and right now you're on something of a winning streak overt ATF orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible wins from the Baker jak fill up to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently chief Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one point two million dollar settlement after he was fired by the city of Atlanta for writing a book about his Christian beliefs\nOkay be part of this take part in it um maybe there's not that much we can do right now to save this poor Christian Woman who's been condemned\nTo death for blasphemy\nOr for talking about Jesus um but we certainly can defend people here right in the United states go to the alliance defending freedom a and and you'll find that go to Michael med dot com\nThey need something needs to be done and there needs to be

focus on the dangers of what is going on with Saudi Arabia is to look for a moment of a way that the Obama administration mishandled the situation in Egypt a host name Mubarak had been a virtual dictator of Egypt for a long time\nAnd Hosni Mubarak was not Thomas Jefferson and he wasn't Ronald Reagan and he was in some sort of benign ruler is a tough guy they did not support personal liberties of randomly\nRussian in Egypt and then when the Arab Spring came to Egypt we let the Mubarak regime collapse and\nDid no one any favors because Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came to power\nOf they were awfully close to disaster in the country the military came in fortunately and they supported a coup with general al Sisi and he is now the dictator of Egypt and is he vastly better and more of a Democrat more of a liberal than a Hosni Mubarak\nProbably he's not he's probably less of one\nBut it's a difficult part of the world is a part of the world where there are murderers terrorists as the alternative and by the way the same thing is true in Saudi Arabia\n[noise] do I believe that uh Mohammed bin Salman is I don't know the second coming of Nelson Mandela know\nThe guy has real sluggish aspects but he also has real religious reforms that he has been undergoing\nAllowing women to drive was a very big deal and the radicals who are the main opposition of this regime and when I say radicals I don't mean radicals on the left I mean radicals on the Islamic right\nOr they would love to get rid of Mohammed bin Salman\nHe's also it was called back the religious police who used to run wild and Saudi Arabia and and most of all he has really been leading the way we're trying to get Saudi Arabia to engage with the west I Know there's this you know that they used to ban movies entirely\nAnd he's a good good for them I mean even movies as you would like\nThey they banned emphasis Disney Princess movies are banned well we'll talk later on about why feminist ban Disney

able to enjoy\nA Disney movies particularly the animated classics which are so wonderful I honestly believe Snow White and seven worse is one of the best movies ever made period is a great film I think the same is true ... ah maybe fantasia\nOkay that that they these are amazing artistic achievements are just amazing films and they have everything going for them and the idea that they are now being criticized now let me just say\nThere are aspects of these films that are badly dated where political correctness has actually lead to some corrections I've I'll give you an example a lot of people may not know this but I've actually seen the original form of fantasia\nAnd fantasia for those who don't know it's a movie made by the Disney people and won't was very personally involved because he loved classical music and he loved this film and this film took great classical pieces of the boss prelude and view the minor and Easter Vinci rite of spring and Beethoven's pastor Ralf symphony\nAnd it created sort of cartoon animated uh bringing the film bringing the music to life and it's quite interesting\nIn the past around symphony section or they went to ancient Greece and they are dealing with guns and goddesses and ... centers are Half Men half wars\nAnd they had one really offensive little scent or\nWho was black and ... and was act and I honestly I'm not making this up this was in the original movie and at the time I guess it was considered funny but it's profoundly offensive and racist and you'll pardon me I'm not endorsing it I think they did the right thing to take it out of the film\nBut they had this little black scent or shining the lives of the of the other centers\nAnd it it detracted from the movie and it was horrible and they changed it but I don't believe the kissing Snow White\nCounts as that and by the way when I was mentioning cure a nightly criticizing the Little Mermaid was ... a cure and I said she was on the Ellen DeGeneres show and you'll never guess what she said her favorite Disney film was on Allen's show\nCan you guess Greg dory of course because Elon histories she's the voice of dory\nSo um she said a\nChair and I didn't like Cinderella that's banned in her home she says she has a three year old on her\nShe says um because you know Cinderella weights around for a rich guy to rescue her don't rescue yourself obviously and she added this is the one I'm quite annoyed about because I really liked the film the Little Mermaid I mean the songs are great but do not give up your voice\nFor a man hello\n... okay I I agree there are some and I've written about this I mean I think that that part of what I found problematic and live a Little Mermaid which is a wonderful film\nWas a the idea of the kids know best which is a very regular theme and then a lot of films for children that parents are daughter and foolish and ridiculous and should be taken for granted but okay ... kids can still love the movie\nAnd I don't think we should have a problem with it\nNor do I think that suggesting that people might take names that can be comfortably written now that don't have to be spelled and sounded down look one of the

that guy at the baseball field you don't think that's evil and the person that said that is an evil\nOkay well you know as a Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil or Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the matter is\nThat that philosophy all along anyway I don't I don't have a liberal have had for years okay you just haven't admitted it 'cause we're like OK showed it at our at least the medic you know don't cut me off on this\nI have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think about what happened that little government that that comes from politicians that politicians are only eat will do that because now you don't have the gods now\nGosh now as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look or Tim the the idea of equating one thing and another is is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one\nTerrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's the life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this then I think it's profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle Tim if we lose the language\nAnd evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that ah Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and a threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that that people had an and there were people of this nature a stolen was evil Hitler was evil\n[noise] um you know I I it's funny we hear that a lot and obviously there was
