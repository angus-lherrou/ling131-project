I'll tell you it's a it's a mystery and the part of that is because of some of\nThe pathetic play some of the injuries some of the loss of\nA players from the previous year whether it's trader free agency or you know whatever except for the red skins have been pretty interesting uh silently amassing more wins they've won the last two they're four and two\nIn the east the eagles\nA mind boggling losing to Caroline although you give the Panthers credit last week they were ahead Seventeen nothing and then Twenty one points the panther scored in the fourth quarter was crazy and the eagles even had a chance to win that game\nBecause they were so close to getting it in the end zone but uh then Carson once throws a pick\nAnd the reason they were they got that set up is because there was a pass interference call when they're way down the field\nA buddy at thrown a nice pretty big bomb and it set them up for that and then they completely blew it and then the cowboys kick hits the upright boom\nThey lose their game so both of those teams three and four and the New York giants are just the job of the NFL I mean you could look at the forty niners but then you say well you know Jimmy ... out and they've had a few other problems they've had to contend with\nBut I say you put it between who are the biggest dogs in the NFL meaning the worst the worst of the worst the giants with all the big headlines OPEC I'm signing the fat contracts and then of course getting sick won Barkley who has performed well on a miserable team\nAnd then you look at the Oakland Raiders and John Gurdon the brink trucks\nThat backed up to his house and dumped all that coin on him and he was supposed to be\nLazarus raising this team from the dead and uh they just than just absolutely awful although I said that and they have had a couple of really close games and then a couple of blowouts too as well but some close games that they lost if you look purely at the scores\nBlood they need a few things to happen and they needed to happen fast because this is all the build up for getting ready for the trip to Las Vegas and a few years and I was just there that stadium is going up fast my friends are we talk more NFL on the flip side gets you up to date on some of those early college\nIn ...

month a federal judge in California's most down stormy down a lawsuit against Donald Trump involving ... he wrote about honey but she has on you when you heard that the Dallas Cowboys met the asking price of a first round pick from already Cooper\nYeah your I mean I was done I think we both were I mean the fact that they gave up a first round draft choice for mark Cooper in it and all you hear these guys on television talking about he's a two time pro bowler and he's this is that when I go by as I look at what he is now\nAnd what he is now is he's a very average wide receiver average to above average wide receiver to me and and and this is not a personal shot against him but he's kind of that in the mood player\nYou know he wants to whenever he wants to play he\nCan play like which are more a coup or are you going to see the one against Seattle there had zero catches are you going to see the one against Cleveland that had eight catches or you don't see them on\nYou know me which one which which wide receiver are you going to see he's just so up and down so inconsistent and for them to say that he's going to be our number one guy and maybe it's a change and environment do you think that change them environment will\nKind of kind of pulled him to be in the number one guy that he was back a few years ago\nI'm going to be Mr positive hear Rodney I've had a good couple of days I'm going to be Mr positive and only twenty four years old I think the Oakland Raiders or a bad situation\nTwo years is rookie year in the second year in the NFL he was on his way they're showing that he is a very very good wide receiver and I'm not going to I'm not going to say a leap I'd say very very good\nAnd then last year the bottom fell out as confidence level drop you you put it very well that this year he's up and down one game he looks great the other game he's invisible I Do believe the proverbial changing scenery will help them Ari Cooper but here's the problem\nIf you give up a first round pick for a wide receiver\nYou want a guy that you know is there mentally and physically is a guy that is confident\nNot a guy that you hope the change of scenery will help that's why to me this is such a ridiculous deal for the cowboys because it's a shot in the dark you're giving up a premium take because they're not that good anyway it's a top Fifteen top twenty type pig\nFor a guy you hope with a new beginning with a starting his helmet is going to go back to the for me had his first two years the NFL it's a big risk Rodney\nWell here dance actually it's funny you mention that here's Jason Garrett talking about giving up a first round pick for mark Cooper I think he may think otherwise\nWell obviously it's a big decision and so uh you know we talked about it a lot on all levels of our organization and you know I Do believe we've done a good job selecting guys and the first round and the cornerstone players that are cheap and we really believe that that that um are it can be that kind of a guy\nSo basically to me is what he's saying is look the raiders are bad um organization it's a bad environment over there we know about our organization we know about our environment so we can bring this guy and surround them with a lot of positive people\nCoach them up really really good which you know I don't think we've had this discussion a couple of weeks ago they've done a great job with that Prescott\nAnd we're going to coach 'em up and now we're going to put him in there and he's going to flourish but when you look at both these quarterbacks that Prescott and um their car aren't they the same guy\nYeah that's a good yeah\nAren't they all kind of conservative check now guys every now and then you know Dr ... you know they'll open up the game plan for that but aren't they the same guys\nAnd Rodney they're both guys\nGreat starts to their career now the question is are they what we thought they would be you know idea and these guys\nYou know ... these guys kind of just you know guys who were lucky to have systems early on that ah you know plate to their strengths and skill sets now is a different story and they're struggling that's a great that's a great comparison anything about that Prescott and Derek car because both of them are kept in check downs\nBut here's the loose\nBut he but here's the difference is is that Prescott having to check down because until I'm Ari Cooper gets there look at the wide receivers he's dealing with Rodney\n[noise]\nI I think I think being aggressive as a mindset I really do I really believe that you know I obviously Sean McVeigh\nBefore he even went and got a brand new cooks they were taking shots down the field\nYou know they were aggressive it's a it's an aggressive mindset if anything I Would say if this thing is going to work is because you look at John groom and John ... is not always the most positive guy you know what I'm saying sometimes when he talks to players you hear these clips it's a little condescending\nYou know what I'm saying where's Jason gear is more of a nicer guy seems a lot more patient he seemed like he he's a lot more in tune or a little bit more connected to his quarterback\nSo maybe that's the thing that he's playing off of once again it's about coaching it's about getting them comfortable in saying hey you don't have to be the guy we want you to be the guy but you don't necessarily have to be the guy which I truly don't understand at this point but I'm gonna tell you this is Jason geared if this doesn't work do you think Jason Garrett get fired\nOh there's no question is that he absolutely gets fired if this does not work but this is a bad troubling track record for Jerry Jones to think about in the Jerry Jones era Rodney\nThe wide receivers that he is traded first round picks for remember Joe Galloway traded what two years from picture Joey galley Roy Williams is shipped off a first a third in like seventh and the lions\nThat didn't work out either he's never made really a successful trade in the sense of given up I draft makes for a wide receiver and I think I'm Ari Cooper comes with a heck of a lot of question marks the way that Galloway did and the way that Roy Williams did in the track record tells us in the end they're going to regret given up that first round peg here's the problem for me\nThe Dallas Cowboys lack weapons and wide receiver and I get that and maybe having a guy like him are Cooper makes Colby sleep better but I just hasn't it been proven time and time again in the NFL Rodney\nNighttime again dial pound to five zero and see the key word nighttime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA market ... made and local farms supplies are hard to come by that's why you need to

Mac on on his back last week I mean he\nHe played great\nAnd it's like you they get these guys they don't have big name they don't pay gas Fifteen million dollars a year they coach 'em up Dante scar neck you the best off into line coach and all the football coach these guys up they teach them techniques they formed the offensive game plan around these guys to help kind of protect 'em and cover them up\nAnd at the end of the day you don't you're getting violent given up a seventh round draft choice via left tackle as opposed to panic got Fifteen million dollars that's why the patriots never have problems\nYou know as far as a salary cap but if you're a giants and you go out like\nWho's make Olivier Vernon like you're pant him like he's in all ... he's not an all pro no he's above average player but Japan in what Seventeen Eighteen million it's crazy\nAnd they traded Jason Pierre Paul it's not fair for third round pick of the get no pressure on the quarterback right now the New York giants an absolute mess\nIt's running that organization that we've had how many conversations about the sake lump Barclay should they should they not have drafted him hey we're so far past that point it at this stage\nBut the reality is what do you do though for the giants moving forward I mean you like manning is the problem I agree a hundred percent they don't have an office of line that can even you know give him time and the fact is he needs time because he's a statue out there\nThey ... Jenkins is probably on his way out of Libya Vern is on his way out at this point in ... New York giants so everybody right get rid of everybody freight all these high priced guys that are making all this money is your Norse Jenkins worthwhile million bucks a year right now Rodney\nAbsolutely not I mean once again you pay a guy like him land in college eventually he's going to be a free agent he was an all pro a couple of years ago he's not plan to the level you see 'em up missing tackles taken bad angles getting beat deep\nYou know long coverage is I mean it's just a trickle down effect is not just one guy and you you see the ... you see the um frustration on pasture on his face I mean you see it time and time again but ultimately until you dressed a quarter of a drug the quarterback situation is going to continue to be like that\nIt is the safety blitz Rodney ... NBC Sports radio but here's the problem with the quarterback situation for the giants Rodney look who's behind Eli Manning if they had a competent guy that they felt could step in right now maybe they go in another direction after the by we can a couple of weeks and bringing a young quarterback\nWill leave out the first round of teddy Bridgewater\nOh no\nAnd here's why the giants first round it might be the first thing in the draft and then they might have to draft that quarter back then but here's the problem with that and I've\nDone the research on this Rodney this trap class in terms of quarterbacks when people talked about Justin Herbert from Oregon or Ryan's family from NC State or Twain Haskins from Ohio State I've not heard a single person say that it's even\nComparable to last year a strap class the five first on quarterbacks and the giants had the second overall pick\nThey could have little rodent would that make you more likely if you're the giants since there's no like one God it's really kind of outstanding wouldn't that make you more likely to want to trade that because you know that there is no quarterbacks really there and the top five or top seven that you're looking for any way\nEspecially with teddy Bridgewater being healthy with him having some experience with him learning behind Drew Brees\nWith him not being a statue see with me when I look at teddy Bridgewater he's he's enough of a pocket\nPresence but he's still good enough as an athlete to escape and do some things and he's not gonna wow you with the big fancy place but he's not going to be the guy that consistently turned the ball over so to me he's he's kind of a of a better version more athletic version of Eli Manning\nBut you're the problem is though he doesn't he's not a big guy and I think the problem is all these teams get an amateur by size right Herbert six six to thirty five you've seen Dwayne Haskins at Ohio State the guy is massive you'll get teddy Bridgewater and I like teddy bridge where I think you know the jets signed him is a great offseason move and then getting a third round pick from the saints\nThe fact is though teddy Bridgewater kind of place like Iraq but he's more athletic but do you think you'd ride ten is a small do and I just think\nThat ... me if he is a big guy is it all the guy I mean are not as big guys as Jimmy ... a big guy with a Jimmy about six to\n... I don't know I've never seen him is he being dude I don't know if\nYou've got great ... big news man it's but it's about heart it's about efficiency is about control leadership and all these different things I I just think that if the giants really wanted\nTo make a mark and and and really get their quarterback do you trust one of these\nQuarterbacks from ... next year's graph what do you go get a God it's proven like teddy bridge one and I'm not saying he's proven that he's going to be great because I think he's slightly above average at this point but I I I Do believe he's a lot better than you\nKnow I I agree I Do for you\nYou know I think you could probably pride teddy Bridgewater away from New Orleans considering look Drew Brees isn't exactly showing age right now I think you could probably prior while you can sign it was a free agent as a matter of Bridgewater is going to be a free agent unless the saints want to slap a tag on him which they may not want 'cause it's gonna be a lot of money so\nIf you have to trade for him I'm sure the saints would take a second round pick\nIf you have to sign them maybe the New York giants are smart to draft a quarterback and bringing Jedi Bridgewater and kind of see how it all plays out\nOr my has pointed this or do you go crazy and and just go in and try to get pay some hill the third string quarterback who's kind of a Jack of tree [laughter] Jack of all [laughter]\nThat'd be good [laughter]\nOh you like the taste of elite that guy could as ... I mean he does everything does he like return kicks do and stuff you badly as I Know he plays kicked covered it [laughter] it's unbelievable the guys unbelievable you'll be in the NFL a long time because he plays so many different things speaking of quarterbacks and by the way Rodney\nYou've sold mellowed out as you get a bit older you know not you know no more Jeff Fisher situations but guess what Rodney was up did you anger some people this week did you I don't know yeah\nDid you got to get into this 'cause the Jacksonville Jaguars struggling they may not like Rodney said we'll get to that and I don't like it I ... at all you have to ask is it'd be ... and being sportsman right here on NBC Sports radio [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nIf you suffer from E.

I'm ... I'm ... yeah yeah yeah sorry [laughter]\nBut yeah they have a very capable back within him and to me they just got away from what they did best and that was just run into ball attitude up front just pounding people create turtles on defense just this mentality which says\nAction pass which set up Blake and his big to six five two hundred thirty five pounds self where he can scramble and he can uses athleticism gained yards I just think they completely got away from everything\nThey had so much that's the patriots and I I Believe that that was their initial downfall because now all of a sudden this off and became like a passing office and they lost that toughness that\nThat granted out mentality and\nIf you're the Jacksonville Jaguars you have the type of defense that you have you want to keep the games close you want to control that you want to be able to have ball control pound people enforced people into doing what you want them to do and I just think they got away from it you\nKnow I agree with you a hundred percent of the gun away from a successful game plan but I'll tell you what's killing that team and let her for that can stay healthy right this is your number two for for that and the NFL he missed\nFour games I think last year he's missing a ton of games this year and it's only going to get worse because if they thought that letter from that was coming back anytime soon they wouldn't have made the move\nTrading a fifth round pick for Carlos Hyde so with outlet for that look TJ yelled and is an adequate back but he's not a game changing game breaking type of backed away they'll end up for that can be\nAnd if your defenses are going to play at the level that they should plan we just got into that the fact is you're not helping late morals and this is a quarterback that has to be held he'll play morals isn't going to win you the games but Blake boils at times can play smart enough football it's not cost the games but if you're going to put the pressure on Blake boils to have to give you that result Rodney\nWell we see the results you're not going to win a lot of games but I think it comes down to a point here where with October thirtieth right around the corner Rodney the trade deadline they're\nI mean if you're Jacksonville can you keep going the rest of the season when such high expectations with Blake boils at quarterback don't you owe it to the team to go out and make a move and bringing a quarterback\nWhat ... I mean we we talked about a day and we keep talking about every segment which what quarterback are you going to get the comes in understands the system that's going to make that big of a difference\nRight we they need a smarter quarterback somebody that's not going to turn the ball over as much right let me throughout names ... and I will tell you right now these aren't great quarterbacks I'm just saying is it a marked improvement because they play the position a bit smarter than Blake boils ... Taylor\nNo doesn't turn it over much nothing not at all nothing Nick falls like happening who ... the Phillies not giving them the falls ... what if you all for a second round pick\nI Would I Would definitely take photos with in Jacksonville and get rid of late but if I'm if but you know even looking at them and you talked about earlier and talked about learning from that I I don't think he's going to be able to stay healthy\nI'm I'm looking at levy on bill I'm looking at the Trade Center for that I'm I just don't think he's going to be able to stay healthy I mean he's so young and he's getting all these soft tissue injuries already I'm I'm looking at you know going all in ... I mean that's an opportunity that I mean I think we're really take them to the next level and help your young quarterback\nYeah that's actually a great thought yeah I didn't think about that maybe just make the move it running\nBack sometimes you just have to do unconventional things sometimes you just have to take a leap and do something you know and and that's the thing that's gonna really separate them you're going to get more easily back who knows what he's going to be next year but I'm looking at maybe going out and this year in in which\nWho knows what's gonna happen and maybe Pittsburgh says you know we're not going to give up a lady on bail and to one of our direct competitors and you know right here and if see but in all season I mean that's a possibility\nThey can make the run that and but here's the interesting thing they're playing in London right whatever happens in London Rodney there's still a couple of days before that trade that mine can you see\nEx Seville jaguars if they lose to the Philadelphia Eagles\nThey get poor playoff offensively again can you see them panic can you see them make them move whatever it might be I Can't even tell you what position or whatever it is can you see a team like that panic if they lose yet again you're talking about the Philadelphia Eagles no time of the Jacksonville Jaguars if they lose to Philly in London and they continue to drop further back because look\nThe Houston Texans have won five and a road there are top that division now Jacksonville is supposed to run away with that division can you see them panic from that point on after losing if they do lose in London to Tuesday when the trade deadline comes and goes\nAbsolutely absolutely um and I look and I don't even really know um\nTheir schedule I'm trying to bring up their schedule but I think they have to play the Pittsburgh Steelers I think they played the Indianapolis Colts which is probably I Can't even say give me because that team at least they play really hard and they compete but then after that I think they play the Pittsburgh Steelers which is a tough which I Believe they're going to lose that game\nKnow it at home the visor dot com

Ronnie the Philadelphia Eagles suffering an ugly home loss of Lincoln financial field last weekend flowing a Seventeen point lead they were leading Seventeen nothing going into the fourth fourth quarter\nThe Carolina Panthers storm back they win the game Twenty one to Seventeen and a Sunday Night Football you had a\nYear animated when discussing something that Doug Peterson said at the post game press conference for those who missed it take a listen to what Doug Peterson was talking about when he talks about pressure\nUser games that they galvanized football teams and and this is going to do that as you didn't brings us closer together um basically told them that hey\nRushes off of us nobody on the outside world to give us a chance to do much of anything and fresh off we can go play have fun and it just flashed\nThat's a bunch of garbage to me that that really bothered me and it really disappointed me Doug Peterson like\nYou talk about the pressure's off your the defending Super Bowl champs you won the super bowl with a backup quarterback and you're talking about the pressure's off no the pressure is with you\nThe pressures in fact that a lot of people\nFigure where Carson wince rejoining the team that you are going to even have more of a chance to get back to the super bowl and repeat as Super Bowl champions the thing that I don't like about it is as a coach you're basically making excuses you're trying to flip it and you're trying to somehow flipped this whole scenario\nTo try to create a false sense of motivation for the fact that your team wasn't very prepared and that your your team has gotten complacent and then when the super bowl to me embrace the pressure don't run from it then\nI don't understand that you're absolutely right like ... when was it okay to just win the super bowl\nAnd seemingly enjoy the next year not try to win and again like there's always pressure when you have that bull's eye on your back and we've talked about this heading into the season Rodney\nThat here the Philadelphia Eagles they finally won the super bowl they have a heck of a roster by the way they bring that Carson weddings there's more pressure now because you bring back your started quarterback\nHow is it that this is to me is counterproductive right because if you're trying to do the whole well now the guys think they can play loose and and you know no one believes in us\nA coward move like me it's a it's like\nYou like challenger team say look we got a bull's eye on our back we already knew that we are going to get a T every team's very best\nAnd he needs to stand up and and and it meant that\nYou know I haven't done a great job as a coach we as a coach and that we have not done a great job I mean you look on the defensive side of the ball the corners of getting exposed Jim Swartz continues the blitz he continues to put those corners on one on one um find themselves without safety help and they continue to get towards\nHow many times is going to take that you don't understand that your quarterback position is weak\nYou lost um their Barnett now you've got to play Michael Bennett you're not the same team so you have to make coaching adjustments and and flat out they just they've under cheap they've gotten so content and so complacent with what they've been doing\nIt because they want a Super Bowl and they haven't gotten over the fact that you know what people are still paying us on the back and telling us hey hey we're so happy he won the super bowl ... thank you for bringing us not forget about last year that's why it's so difficult to repeat like the patriots did I was in the last team to repeat it two thousand three two thousand four\nThat's been over a decade yeah\nIt's very difficult to do because guys become complacent coaches make excuses people make excuses you got Carson wins back he's playing pretty ... good football he's getting hit too much but he slammed really you know good football I never thought that he'd be plan as well as these plan considering him coming off at a CEO\nSo to me land is like you as a coach you have to stand up in front of everyone and say look I Need to do a better job of getting my guys prepare theirs\nIsn't that we they they should but all experience that they have lose a game against the Tennessee Titans in overtime lose the game like they did last week\nNo you have to be able to against the Carolina Panthers you have to be prepared for those situations Carson Carson when it's had an opportunity for check down in the flat I think it was turned down a two and he decided to go in the end zone for what just take the check now and that's your job of responsibility as a head cold\nRodney Harrison dance horsemen NBC Sports radio but Rodney here's the thing you've been in Super Bowl winning locker rooms and then in the year after that and as you said you were part of the last team that repeated how much of keeping guys in check\nKeeping guys understanding that you have to stay motivated to how much of ... of that happens with ... leadership and I say that because I look at the Philadelphia Eagles Ross I think to myself I think our veterans right renting grams been there a long time Malcolm Jenkins of anthill guy Michael Bennet Fletcher Cox\nBut isn't it also up the guys in the locker room to kind of make sure guys aren't complacent guys aren't too comfortable and relax guys aren't kind of taking it easy because they want us to pull ring the year before doesn't that also have in the locker room Rodney\n... that's the coach sets the standard\nAnd the players follow the veteran leaders follow if you got great veteran leadership especially guys that have been in a lock them that have ONE Championship you supposed to follow in the ... the number one message to coach is supposed to send is what we did last year last year has nothing to do what we're going to do this we're going to get a team's very best so every time a team plays us because every single team and an NFL\nThey've broken us now they've studied us they know about our our appeals they know about every single one that you guys you're going to get every team's very best there every single play that you've played on coaches are looking at\nFiguring out how do we defeat the Philadelphia Eagles and that's the bottom line so embrace that understand that and that's the beauty of\nTrying to repeat that's the beauty of trying to win back to back championships because it's a journey and don't make excuses and bail out and say all my now my my teen can just relax and just go out there and play\nThis is a really good team I expect expectation for this team has to be right back there in the NFC championship right back they're fine for a Super Bowl ring and for him to sit back and say oh it's this type of loss galvanizes a team like\nSouth planned up like you haven't done a great job I I really liked the Peterson I really liked the Philadelphia Eagles I think they can be good for very long time because I I Love Carson wins\nBut for him to sit there and say that is just really was very disappointed because he had been a former player and him being as competitive as yeah more or don't fourth down all for it on to and basically shoving and shoving it down people's throats and said hey this is the way we're going to do it remembering off season he said this is the new standard yes\nSo how can you say this is the new standard when you when you're setting the standard it's always pressure to meet that standard\nRodney to barest thing that looking at the standings the Philadelphia Eagles aren't running away with the the NFC it's not a good division cowboys aren't very good the giants are awful Redskins are okay team nothing there okay you know that they're okay every year they're okay they're like you know seven nine I ate and ate that type of team eighty nine and seven\nLegal should be running away with this they should be legal should should and your Thirteen and three that's when they shouldn't be but there are three and four they're playing like crap the often isn't isn't playing well the defenses average there doing nothing well right now when you watch the tape Rodney you watch this team\nIs there one aspect that they're playing while in right now or is it all just black not\nNot running about a bigger problem is if they're not running the ball they don't have the success to often salon isn't playing with that ship with that edge they've they've let down their guard remember they were the underdogs\nThe pissed off an upset at this uh ... they lost their edge and that's what happens when you lose your it's just like the Jacksonville Jaguars\nThey certainly have lost their edge no question about it the Philadelphia Eagles not playing well but it's okay to or no pressure on them it all starts again with this weekend against Jacksonville two teams that need a win\nAlright Rodney it is weak number what are we now week there were eight of the NFL season some big match up you're going to be writing those down that's right we're gonna break those down next it is the safety blitz football that America's

radio [noise]\nThat carries ten Harris what is going on there Rodney why will they not give Christian McCaffrey Fifteen to twenty five carries a game\nTo game the game plan changes then just depending on who you're ... you're playing against 'em but to me it's like most often coordinator and north turn it was a coach with me when I was out in San Diego\nThese guys when in doubt what do they do they don't run the ball when in doubt when things are going to re and everything's wild and crazy they're going to pass the ball right\nYeah that's just the natural and think they're going to drop back even though cans out the most accurate but he but he plays with hardly plays with passion and he wants to will his team to victory I think there's going to be a very close game um\nBut they're going to have to they're gonna have to run the ball if if they plan on being Baltimore or they're going to have to get Christian McCaffrey matched up against those line backers the one thing that camp we'll have to deal with is all ozone pressures all those men pressures Baltimore does a great job of disguising their coverage is and if they can pick up the blitz it can be the Baltimore Ravens\nRodney ... safety blitz NBC Sports radio and this is the marquee matchup about this one the Green Bay Packers at the LA Rams LA yet to lose this year Green Bay look I mean Aaron Rodgers shows you why he's one of the all time great quarterbacks he elevates other players on his team\nIs Green Bay do they have enough to walk into the memorial coliseum\nAnd hand the rams are first lost the season Ronnie\nAnd you're talking about a healthier Aaron Rodgers yeah\nI don't think the I don't think the rams defenses as good as what a lot of people make it out to be\nI think they have I think they have a bunch of guys that this is how to ram slate let me tell you how to let me break it down real quick the rams are team that they play from ahead a lot\nSo what happens with the defense you don't have to worry about the run even though they're not very good in the run game but they don't have to run because there are always ten twelve fourteen points up and play from ahead so now and Donald and those guys can pin ... years back and get to the quarterback\nBut with Green Bay rebates always going to put pressure especially with Aaron Rodgers on your entire game so if they can kind of keep it a little balance run the ball you know keep that all fans of the rams off the field I think green bacon leaf compete but they're they're they're going to have a hard time stopping ... those weapons that they have\nA I like the rams in his game than\nI Do too I just think they're too loaded here and I got to admit I Am impressed by Jared golf I really am a couple of years ago and you thought who can blame\nMe we all thought he was a ... right right [laughter] I mean the whole world thought he was a Boston it shows you get rid of a coach Jeff Fisher is you've got nothing out of Jared GOP since you know since he's gone\nNever miss an opportunity to him I said\nWhy not I mean come on he had case kingdom you Nick falls in Jared golf on the same Ross and can do nothing with them but the thing about don't forget he did right wow are you ... yeah yeah he it tastes key and um he had a Nick falls in that chair golf unbelievable wow yeah and they couldn't win anything\nWhen you think about all the other one got paid and another one was going to get two hundred million wow\nRight and maybe would have Superbowl down the road right wow\nHow ... we gotta we have to both be honest [laughter] how surprised are we because even after last year when ... took the steps from his rookie year when he was awful to last year when he was pretty good did you expect him to make this leap to where he's honestly I mean he's he's on the verge of that elite status right now I'm surprised\nI'm a I'm surprised to um the fact that they have so many great weapons I think they've they've done a wonderful job of surrounding him with some great talent and um\nAnd it just shows that coaching matters\nIt just shows that you know and now I think what the level of success that he had\nYou saw with the ... you see these often so coordinators and he's young quarterbacks you see these owners and general manager starting to go get younger guys that can that come out with these creative ideas in and they can relate to these quarterbacks and that's one of the reasons why I think\nThat they're going to blow up everything in Cleveland\nAfter this year they're going to blow up everything he was going to be gone off its coordinator Todd Haley he's going to be going to go and blow up everything and they're going to bring in a young hot off in some minds to work with ...\nEverybody's looking for the next ... has been nothing but brilliant since the rams you know he was thirty one years old when they hired him and I remember when they hired him Ronnie we've been doing this show together a long time and we were both skeptical there were a guy's not lock them they were older than him couldn't he gained respect you know what the answer was\nHe's done it right the guy is I mean you know what he knows what he's doing he's an office of group and he's got great hair Rodney that's all that matters\nTitle gray hair he's great hair\nOh I thought you said gray hair I was about to say at thirty some that's crazy\nYeah ... it probably is gray hairs at the stretch that job but I'll tell you what he has done a fantastic job there to say the least Sunday Night Football it all begins seven PM football night in America and NBC and all in ... Minnesota Vikings\nDidn't we see this last year in the postseason that turned out to be one heck of a crazy finish Rodney\nIt was I mean I've watched it a couple of times this week I'm referring to the game last year and a while I mean Drew Brees came out he was slow um he started slow didn't put up any numbers in the first half came back in the second half\nYou know a lot of different actually I think I'm the saints if I remember correctly they blocked upon a markets Williams had a really nice interception obviously he gave up that they play and to me you know and I'm just saying if if if I had a vice for him I Would just tell them look man\nJust be you know focus on the positive of what you know what you did last year I think that what five interceptions last year or you have very good out here yeah yeah great rookie year focus on the positive and go out there and play and don't be don't be surprised they're going to attack you if you know they're going to attack you in a deep half of the field\nBut um you know I I just thought that\nYou know we look at it that you like wow the one thing that you could never do against the saints you can never relax because Drew Brees is going to put pressure on you [noise] um he opens up to all fans they put pressure on you then hire field because they have so many different weapons and he doesn't even care like last year it was fourth down at ten and\nHe passed it too will lose me\nAnd it wasn't Michael Thomas it was really neat and and to me that was huge because first down second and third now like an completion and things like that\nBut on fourth down and tend to most critical moment this is their season he passes it so to me that show that he trusts all his guys his weapons and you got to defend the entire field if you want to stop Drew Brees\nIs this same steam because it's always been they've had a great offense and defense has been a question mark you mentioned of course Williams and others they make the move for you lie apple they haven't been grading the secondary if you look at you like apple and there's a statistics this year in terms of the pro football focused type of statistics he's an improvement or the saints defensively\nGood enough to win a Super Bowl Rodney in part two is\nThe return of ever seen Griffin what does it mean from Minnesota\nTo start with um Everson driven I I I think he's you know you you talk about probably their best player their best defensive player and hunters\nAnimal but this Everson Griffin he's you know he's special and you think about him is in the last X amount of weeks because of um some issues that he was doing what he's going to be excited ready to get back on the field we don't do as level of conditioning but he's going to be definitely a difference maker\nAs far as the saints as me trust in their defense is that was the question was that the question\nYes it do you trust the defense the point where they're legit Superbowl contenders\nI Can't see it at this point that I trust them to be that defense that they were last year I think marsh on a lot more he's getting better I think he he he's like kind of surprised like OK\nLast year was great but you have to continue with the off season work and everyone's going to attack you do I think they're as good as last year and definitely not but I Do think they have the potential to make a Super Bowl run absolutely because it's a myth is MIT pointed to season they have plenty of time to improve and I and I like I told you earlier in the segment\nI Believe that he lie apple is a guy that you can coach up that he can be definitely an asset this um crawly kid\nMan he I I I don't like them I Would put I Would put ... apple in before crawly any day of the week\nThere you have a big game seven PM it is of course football night and America NBC\nNew Orleans Minnesota doesn't get much better than that I Rodney the Twitter questions have come and hot and heavy all week long it's time for you to answer them next go it is of course the safety blitz ... on NBC Sports radio [noise]\nZero Johnson used to be be see sports radio\n[noise]\n\n\nI used to have a sweet tooth had it removed and when I was a kid so what do I crave instead of chocolate a big red box from Granger Granger satisfies my craving for great customer service with twenty four seven support effort was ordering and same day pick up the next day delivery options no busy signals know cavities\nI Love Granger you know why\nBecause when it comes to reliable product in technical support ... got your back\nColor could Granger duck on to see for yourself Granger for the ones who get it\nDone the national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars by some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Phil Paleologos", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "27"}
