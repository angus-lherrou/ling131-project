I think yeah but so he was ... so he ... he had a role in Cheyenne Autumn ... and he he was an Indian brave and do you know who is while was now a woman named Nancy Kwan car was married to my cousin\nOh oh now\nSo I'm practically an analog Whitey Bolger I Know and what he wanted to have you know me ... and\nI Know it's terrible it's terrible\nUncovering crying tell you that's a big problem in this country\nYeah but anyway so that was I mean that's one story then supposedly he was also having a he was also having sex with Catherine Greg's brother\nDavid Greg you he was a young guy and the you know so he said he would they would ... why do you want it to bring this guy David Greg into the gang and uh and so he'd be hit they bring them into a table and hit like pass out\nTo like pass out does not off the table and so are they they'd be watching this this kid was like Twenty years old and why these like you know hovering over I'm sixty years old and they go\nYou don't know these stories and ... and so so uh uh Whitey or why they would go\nI think he's got a problem with vitamin deficiencies and then I'll be like rolling their eyes like pat and they would say yeah vitamin T practice that [laughter]\nThat's what he's doing so finally he ended up dead or he had that he got himself supposedly in uh in on Cape Cod\nBut there was a problem ... with no this if you shoot yourself you use in the head you usually don't then throw the gun across the room and the gun was like Fifteen feet away from him that he ... himself allegedly shot himself in the head requires a special talent medical miracle\nAnd then why do you use to go down you know were widely used to like to go and ... in a in on the Cape\nAnd on the ... province town Robyn [laughter] I was actually down in Hyannis over the weekend and uh you know at the at Cape gun works there a couple of I used to see him in province staff\nSo so when they when they killed the when they kill the guy in a in in Tulsa wheeler\nYou know that that was the ... and Joe McDonald killed killed wheeler and uh so Whitey was a suspect in the case\nAnd so they had a they they had the ... the guy who's still in prison the FBI agent he put it in a report say Whitey Bolger couldn't have done this a couldn't have committed the murder despite what all the all the wise guys are saying because\nHe he at the time was in profits town and then he\nThat's at with female companionship just in case one just in case there's any confusion you know about who we might be ...\nYeah when I was younger I remember I asked my dad because he grew up around I'm the same time that Whitey was kind of finding all these young kids and you know like you said bringing them into the gang or trying to you know make them criminals and I said dad why didn't he ever go after one of your your siblings and my dad said\nBecause we had a big family\nAnd they grow up in South Boston and they grew up in the projects but they had parents and they had they had a home base\nIs looking after like kids kids with no home life for kids parents week people who who thought oh well at least he cares about me and then he would like attack that it's like the ... exactly\nYeah you don't have a lot of people said that he he pretended to be I mean I'd is that's another story\nI've never been able to knock down the road or or prove that he that he you know sometimes a masquerade it as a priest\nI didn't do I do know he used to hang out a jock so you know what ... says right in Bay village it's this transvestite bar I feel like math reading as a priest is just a little too on the nose yeah it's I you know those sometimes stories are too good to be true it's kind of like you know I mean I I again I Hope he was\nMurdered by a member of the mafia you know that would be that would be perfect but\nI I don't I just don't know if it's your turn off your that lucky yeah exactly exactly lose some stories are just too good to be true you know what I may yeah and and I don't think the globe is making this went up I mean maybe somebody's telling them this I Hope and again I Hope it's true who won the Whitey death blow it was a guy named Michael on it and how many calls\nToday yeah we're going to get to what I Hope he doesn't take it too hard sometimes I call people\nIf they win something like that\nLike a death pool and they feel really bad\nThey feel like they have caused it that's what they take like the pope or Mother Teresa ... nobody feels bad about this guy drier [laughter] well my question\nIs how he um he was a big dog person right or did they have like little poodles\nOr had a a G G and the Nicky I think was the name yeah because a lot of ties to a miniature French poodles a lot of time with my my dog frisky\nIn shows is Gigi and ... what's that show it's HBO show on that nothing Donald ... you\nKnow what happened you here's a sad story but ... he he took him when he was in Clearwater he took him to the dog training school and they were all trains and everything and so then when he and Catherine Greg went on the lam they left them with Catherine Greg twin sister\nAnd so then so they were they were there they live with her for a while and then Catherine Greg started calling the sister and then they they they put the pen register on the phone so they they they were tracking it back so they call in the twin sister and said if you've been talking to your sister and she said no I haven't and they had a cold on a perjury rap so they gave her a\nThey gave her house arrest because they didn't you know they figured it was a little too much centered a prison yeah it was a twin sister right\nSo they are so she was under house arrest so what do you do when you have two dogs and you can't leave the house you kill them yeah that's what you did\nRead than they were even in contact was because she was probably worried about her dogs they get the Dodgers\nGraces more hurt by the dog dying and all the people [laughter] well\nNo it's just there's something about killing animals like on TV or in movies that has\nTo have a picture of Mickey and Gigi in a rap man I don't know I Know there is\nShow there's some show and I'm going to find it during the break it's like an HBO or Showtime recently that and they had a character who is supposed to be like Whitey Bolger and they didn't explicitly say it but it was just\nAnd they had two little white poodles and that's when my parents were like oh it's about this picture with a parrot oh he's a bird guy that's how that's how you know something was

I've had experience with this on the local level just watching the why of gangster Whitey Bolger whose dad today in prison in West Virginia\nAt the age of eighty nine hours how he was able to search for a justice\nIn in Boston and in other states as well as they as as as a nefarious influence expanded\nBut I mean this is a national story I mean they they tried to they they they try to frame people for crimes they didn't commit and at the same time these were the same people who were overlooking\nThe real crimes of the other campaign Hillary Clinton I mean Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act\nThe espionage thinking about that word espionage you know what that means that's that's why she she wasn't spying for another country but she was the doing ed committing\nIrresponsible

polar question what are the result stuff's bar\nWill they ever find Whitey Bulger's ill gotten gains\nThere've been estimates that he had up to fifty million dollars or that he made mainly in cocaine and the Nineteen eighties but I'm going to say no they're not going to find it eighty seven percent say no alley eighty seven percent eight\nFour for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number of the highway car show will will take some more calls\nAnd that when we come back about a about this matter and also about the uh the caravan and or the president has said in\nThe ... we can't talk about the care of and it's it's like a thousand miles away that's the new CNN role you're not you're not supposed to talk about it because it's far away\nOkay All right ... the uh the the caravan the the president has said he said he's going to sit down fifty two hundred troops to the border maybe more and more importantly he said he's going to end by executive order the birthright citizenship and I think that's just a wonderful a idea we're going to have a a\nJessica Vaughan from the center for Immigration Studies on a little bit later\nBut this is the this was the beginning I mean this is what they've got to do they've got to do away with the ah birthright citizenship they've got to do away with chain migration I Know that's another that's I Know that's another uh another dog whistle at your watch your micro ration from right right\nAnd they've also got a they've also got to change these uh these Koch of made me laws on a refugee\nStatus in asylum status eh it's become a a giant scam and I'm Glad that the president of the United states\nIs a is is at least beginning to make the move to end these immigration graphs that are wrecking the country um how we are [noise]\n\nHis name is Jeff deal and he's running for US Senate\nHis goals and the same as yours and Elizabeth Warren\nJeffs a real a proven track record of saving hardworking families here in Massachusetts money like defeating the two billion dollar gas tax I meant Jeff deal is the only candidate and Democrat or Republican to fight against sanctuary city she supports building the wall\nI don't know if I were ordered to probably because what's the choice I buy it either yeah they were uncompromising they really are you know yeah like better than anybody holding up was in\n... yeah no they can they can and they I tell you the guys the guys here in Boston I I Know are are are extremely pleased today they're uh they're having a a ... they they they open some wine early\nUh [laughter] ... thanks for the call top mark your next with highway car go ahead mark\nThanks Halley when President Trump calls Democrats the party of crime the fact the facts proceeds right facts like in California\nThe Democrats had been giving early release two convicted criminals and now they discover you know one surprise the crime rate has gone up dramatically ... innocent citizens how he had been ... I Know in ... I Know the Democrats think policy\nYeah bart we have a a we have the Democratic candidate for district attorney in Suffolk County which is Boston, Massachusetts\nAnd she wants to do the same thing in Boston that they've done in California which is basically decriminalize all these so called minor crimes like shoplifting I mean isn't isn't the justice system enough of a revolving door as it is\nWithout a guy with without\nProsecuting people for assaults or a or shoplifting it's ridiculous it's not going to work\nAnd yet and highly their other sick idea is to decriminalize drugs possession and that is causing crime rates\nGo up and quite a few Democrats they also yeah\nI I Know and uh and then the other problem of courses are illegal aliens and many judges not just to Massachusetts law that's what I'm most familiar with\nAre ah are are refusing to imprison illegal aliens because they say if they imprison them they will be allow it they they will be subjecting them to deportation orders from the federal government\nSo they let them go and then guess what happens when you when you let people go for say robbing a bank and only give them seven months which is another case we had in Boston to banks Rob seven months they let the guy go they'd only been sent him to prison they sent him to a jail\nHe gets out just what he does he splits the throat of two doctors\nYou know I mean this is happening everywhere in the country\nMark not unlike the individual who murdered cake dying like\nYeah well that would have died yeah and I yeah five times I mean at least a yeah I mean this and that was\nThat was at least the so called accident he shouldn't have been in the country but he was just messing around I mean this guy in Boston he slit the throats of these two doctors during a jewel robbery a home invasion it it's\nIt's totally unacceptable and it it's totally unnecessary\nWhat's ah what's going on in the ... and there's all this a virtue signaling going on and that's the you know it's not just on the TV or\nThe cable news channels and at night it's a it's going on in the in the court rooms every day it's going on in the halls of Congress with all these people are complaining about the Republicans in their quote unquote hate speech when they're the ones who are really engaging in that hate speech thanks\nFor the call mark Freddie your next with how we are going to have Freddie\nThanks for taking my call I just wanted to say it's ridiculous for people to say that you're going to fall by thinking about this conspiracy because just talk about the opposite people believe people believe that Trump conspired to fix the election so why can't they believe that Hillary conspired to fix ... election why can't you flip it\nIf they're willing to believe that Trump like to be paid on and all these other crazy things that nobody that proved\nWhy can't they believe that there's a conspiracy where they tried to win the election by by framing Donald Trump\nRight I don't understand you know for a fringe evidence Rush Limbaugh\nMade a point that it's been made before but he made it again today you know if they had anything on Donald Trump don't you think they would be leaking it by now\nRight and right after\nThe allegations of going after like someone for tax fraud that happened years ago if they had something current to get them on\nRight right and you know this whole thing well he's a ... you know if he ah releases the Feisal applications to show that we committed abuses than he's obstructing an investigation\nHow long do they need to investigate they'd been investigating now for over two years this investigation started either in April or July of twenty sixteen\nIt's now in two days will be November of twenty Eighteen\nAnd they have nothing they have nothing and you know and they and they will they'll leak anything they look look what happened before the inauguration they leak the dodgy ... which turns out to be a totally fictitious smear job paid for by Hillary Clinton to the Democratic National Committee and now now what thank God the\nLook out of the things that the media is done how they've been manipulating things you can see that the media is an attack if you look at all these things that involve the Clintons you can see that they're always involved in some kind of conspiracy or some kind of cover up\nI Know and and now ... now Hillary Clinton is saying is making a joke all blacks look alike and ... is is this is this getting round the clock coverage on CNN or MSNBC I don't think so\nYou might be talking about this other than ah other than us and I have a handful\nOf other uh outlets and I don't think so she gets a pass every she gets passed for everything you talk about a ... percent of his criminal a career criminal that's Hillary Clinton aide for four or five hundred forty to forty two Eric your next with our car go ahead Eric\nHey how how are you good\nI Am actually calling in regarding a sound like you're pretty excited about Trump's a change on the immigration and birthright citizenship\nYes it might be a good idea overall to have it done but I think the way he's going about doing it is unconstitutional I don't think he's right to do it that way and I think for a lot of us who support the second amendment and how people in the left and to\nBe willing to go against the amendment do things on official there we shouldn't be supporting him and what he's got to do\nBut I mean it's going to be up to the Supreme Court to make the decision 'cause when when he when he does issue this executive order if he does and it looks like he's going to I mean they'll they'll go into the ninth district there somewhere and appeals court and I get to stay\nAnd then they'll have to go before the Supreme Court and ... the Supreme Court will make the decision Eric I mean won't you be willing to abide by that especially now that we have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court\n\nYou're right but the more I look at it I don't see how the Supreme Court is going to side with is the only way I can hear that from the fourteenth amendment was passed it they didn't have illegal immigration than anybody that came over to immigrate so I suppose they could come out and say that\nNo illegal immigration now if there were all that changes it but\nBut you know and I know isn't that you know it happens isn't the fourteenth amendment it's not it's not about protecting a you know some uh somebody who comes in whose whose parents are from Saudi Arabia and he and bore he happens to be born in El Paso Texas and then he goes back to Yemen to to run an al ... a\n... it's it's about protecting the children of slaves right I mean it's it was it that you're you're right it wasn't about illegal aliens was it\nNot at all thanks for the call Eric eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two um highway car don't talks about\nHow God will be back

celebrities and I know I'm a little bit and he he was in that was his nickname blue Jay\nHey how he does a Canadian radio station that wants you to tell them what kind of guy Whitey was tomorrow you want to do that sure sure no I told them I Do with the international radio star how we are yeah\nI told him I Do it today but they said can you do it to interview at four o'clock I said no I don't think so but I'll be glad to do it tomorrow\nI'm going to be on with Chris lied and so I'll tell you some stories about Chris lied we come back he's he ah he crossed Whitey Bulger's to white ... oh I'm going to ... that's a good story to tell when we come back we'll take some calls as well um how whites are [noise]\nAre you looking for a pre own car well before you go to the dealership where you'll be found somebody pushy sales people give the guys who try to build up a Jewish and my job is to make finding the perfect used car as easy as possible so that means I Do all those ... we'll see you know once I figure out what you want out of a car I go find\nFor a couple of months have a baby they ... they stay long enough\nFor the state department to process their babies passport application and then they go home with a U.S citizen child\nThat child can come back anytime and\nGo to school here or you know live here and sponsor the parents for ... for a green card and ultimately citizenship later in life not all of them do come back on many people don't realize is if if they never come back\nThat birth tourism baby gets to pass on US citizenship to their kids\nAnd then we're responsible for the citizens overseas I had a friend who was a consular officer in Lebanon and said you would not believe all the people here who carry us passports\nAnd they're pretty sketchy involved in you know terrorist organizations and so on they don't love America they just want the court and there was this case recently in uh queens about this\nBirth tourism facility where one of the workers they're kind of went nuts and um you know started\nSlashing at people with a knife if you know they were covering this right and left in the newspapers until they found out that this was the birth tourism facility and then no reporters anymore we're interested in talking [laughter]\nSo I I remember when the when Obama was president you had this guy I think he was in Yemen ... he was a a was a terrorist leader he was now the the guy\nHad the you know and so the Obama blow 'em up with a drone and the and some people think Rand Paul was one of them it was going crazy so well this guy's a U.S citizen and attorney he's one of these birthright though citizen citizen guys his his parents were just happened to be passing through\nAnd uh they weren't they weren't Arabs he he'd never lived in the U.S but he he was a U.S citizen and so they claimed that they you know we had the he was there was Miranda rights before we blow 'em up even though he's a you know on the Internet ah you know saying what's up some more uh nine Elevens in the u._s.\nBut this is ridiculous how many people are the\nPropaganda is the chief propagandist for al ... I think he was yeah yeah and and and they bragged about that they wanted him to run their social media operation because you know he was an American and plus they can travel back and forth in the United states that will because they have a U.S passport\nYeah so ... years old three says any actual evidence of women doing this because I've never heard of it happening this six oh three you've obviously never read the newspaper gone on one cause this during the ... the ... every a media are you know even the left wing media have pointed out but this this a scam is going on and it's a\nIt's a huge ah it's it's a huge a brain on American taxpayers\nThat's right the and a lot of times these birds happen on the public dime because they know how to work the system that the women go into the hospital to do the actual birth and say that they're indigent\nThat's how they busted a bunch of 'em out in California and the Los Angeles area of is that they they found that they were you know like if you did this and pay for it all yourself technically you're not violating the law unless you've liked the consular officer about why you're coming but if if you get you know\nUsing Medicaid and then collecting wet and then I think the owners of the birth tourism facility we're also like not reporting all their income so they got like tax evasion but it is way more rampant than people realize that the biggest problem really is the illegal aliens having kids here because that's\nYou know a lot more people and and it's there's nothing illegal about it and then you know we end up with\nYou know it's really like dreamers without the passport\nSo what what we're speaking to Jessica Vaughan from the citizens of citizen I keep costs sorry the center for immigration I Am a citizen native [laughter] the center for Immigration Studies\nWhat is it one of those numbers I there's there's some incredible numbers for like Los Angeles county about what percentage of births are are are to illegal aliens\nJessica do know that statistic\nI tell you oh we don't me with these questions about the next I uh I don't know exactly how many in Los Angeles but you know it's high I mean there are some\n... in Southern California that have an enormous share of the population that are in the country illegally like Santa Ana and of course Los Angeles right off but we don't know but I I Do know there have been hospitals that have literally gone bankrupt\nBecause there are so many birth to uninsured illegal alien when it in that area\nRight and and the number of hospitals going bankrupt it keeps moving north because of the hospitals go bankrupt the the illegal aliens keep moving further and further north and it's ... it's like they're creating this uh the the says zone of ah of desolation\nBe behind them it's it's ridiculous in in Santa Ana California by the way as one of these places where\nThey uh they they were grabbing all these illegal aliens for driving around with unregistered unlicensed uninsured motor vehicles and so they were raw impact and pounding the cars and they were taking away all the cars so the the illegals complained and they were the majority in the city and they said you know so they stopped him pounding cars free illegal aliens\nSo if you're a U.S citizen in California in Santa Ana and you're driving around an unregistered unlicensed uninsured car\nIt's going to get impounded and you're never going to get it back but if you're an illegal alien you just go down to the yard and pick it up the next day\nI mean this is ridiculous what's been going on here and people at least you know at least ... television networks are saying but you you know you're a native ... for bringing this up and it's it's ... it's reality what's going on here there's a dual standard of justice here and they were on the short end of the stack\nThat's right I I did a radio debate with the guy from the Kato Institute today about birthright citizenship and he said\nNot Jessica you're just anti immigrant this immigrants are benefit to our country and you know the reality is if they're still great what what's happened to California why California is thriving it's not it's because they are it's called bird\nUh about half or more of all illegal alien headed households are accessing some form of welfare program and it's it's not because we're giving it to the illegal alien parents because they have a U.S born child here\nThat qualifies for this assistance and billions of dollars a year for us taxpayers\nYup or five years ago it was almost two billion dollars just state funds in the commonwealth of Massachusetts which is a medium sized day so you can imagine what it is you know when you figure in all the state moneys and all the federal monies that are going around the country it's got to be hundreds of billions of dollars a year\nTo pay for a pay for this nonsense what's going on at the southern borders\nAre Jessica Vaughan working people go to learn more about the your organization the center for Immigration Studies\n[laughter] ah\nIf they know it's on our website at the I.
