Southern California because they can't take it anymore and they're they're they're being under\nUnder bed for a you know for all the jobs in the trades not to mention there are being overwhelmed by the the crime and the disease but at the being brought in by these ah illegals\nI have a wonderful story from the LA Times an anti\nUs America about um a family I think it was eight daughters\nCross from Mexico crossed into this country illegally only one stayed behind to having baby after baby paid for by um [noise] on by by the government um she took fertility drugs to even have more kids but anyway the sisters all escape Southern California\nUm or at least several of them did moved to Kentucky [laughter]\nThey moved to Kentucky to get away from all the Mexicans in Southern California that it's just like living in Mexico everybody speaks Spanish has the same dysfunction we come to Kentucky that the streets are clean 'em the lights work everyone obeys the law this is what we were coming to yeah it ruins it\nFor everyone including the ones who were fleeing the societies and got here to begin with\nMaybe it's unfair that they got here before the other ones did but you know it's unfair that people who live in Latin America can walk here whereas people in Bangladesh and Uganda can't walk here um yeah life is unfair but at some point you have to save the boat or the lifeboat crashes and nobody gets saved\nYou know this is a ... ... what are you what do you make of these attacks on Trump as a as he is somehow responsible for\nThe shooting at the synagogue even though the guy is all over social media talking about how much she hates Trump split so now they have on line I Know but\nThey they always do this [laughter] nobody nobody was blaming the Bernie Sanders on his supporters shot up that that baseball field I mean I guess a lot of people at least on our side you won't hear that on MSNBC but I assume a lot of people on our side are pointing out but no this is what they they just\nThis is the media trying to get Trump to bend to their will on and say whatever they want him to say one they want him to say\nIt this is exactly what they did was Charlottesville live a chapter on that in my book resistance is futile of course Trump was right there were good people on both sides are bad people on both sides oh boy you have we seen that in the following year not only have Confederate and other statutes patches of Thomas Jefferson of Abraham Lincoln have been ...\nColumbus which for Columbus had been torn down defaced moved melted down\nUm so yeah of course some people are out there protesting because they didn't want the statues being taken down and they weren't part of some ... group and we've also seen anti fall running wild running through the streets with masks\nSmashing store windows beating people up on whom they they take to be cautious I eat a Trump supporter\nBring a suit and tie in one case they they just they\nTalk about the you know a racial profiling they were profiling unbiased not where you know reaping the guy yeah\nThat's right no but they what drives them crazy as they used to be able to boss around conservative does that mean Rubio apologizing and Jeb exclamation apologized and Romney apologized and won't why won't from ... to our will it so I Will say that is one of the greatest things Trump is doing as president not\nGiving in to the PC outrageous demands of the media to apologize for things having nothing to do with him\nYou know what I'm Talking about in too is you know when you when you have no laws for a certain segment of the people who were here legally aliens ... you don't have laws for anybody until you have the right like the Caesar\nSay ... or or or this this guy ... were lesser degree powers in in ... in Pittsburgh I mean the old days these guys\nUp in mental institutions you know\nYeah than it's worth pointing out that at least in the Caesar say our case we do have another problem of immigration um that you know he's half Filipino and\nNow he's also I think he's a fake Indian movies this week when he was like your friend Elizabeth Warren but\nIt it it it just simply isn't historical facts that in this country political violence has historically come from the left in other countries there's a lot of political violence so few bringing people from other countries I'm the same thing with the welfare consuming and the drunk driving we are bringing in those cultures\nLiberals figured all these third world immigrants were dumping on the country would always be for them\nBut it turns out sorry liberals some of them will end up being like like um\nSay those are all the around the block and be told supporters\nBut this is not the traditional American um behavior and this is more like ...\nYeah well you know the the thing is to what do you have to do to get locked up in South Florida you and I promote your with that area\nBut that ... the Parkland shooter he was a one man crime wave in nobody did anything about it until we finally you know killed a bunch of people this is the same way with stays our ... junior you know I mean yes how many more how many crimes that this guy to command you\nKnow this this past week has an excellent advertisement for 'em as Trump said concealed carry and the death penalty and and sees are healthier essay off as a great at an artist meant for the three strikes laws\nYeah uh and yet he's been criticized for saying that the ... you know they might have been a different outcome at the synagogue if if they had an armed guard but I mean it's that's common sense isn't it\nOf course are just armed parishioners this is why people on our side support concealed carry when when you don't know who has a gun but lots of people not doesn't mean everybody has to go on lots of people like to use guns it's fun to use guns I like to shoot I'd like to have a gun because I'm utterly defenseless\nOut in the world without a gun um you never know who's going to have a gun and concealed carry does tend to cut down on those things\nYeah I mean they've been shootings at churches and the places of worship before this and uh sometimes the police go into these and I've gotten ... for people today saying that the you know they've had cops come to their uh their their churches and the cops say\nYou know I'm not going to tell you what to do but maybe it would be wise if somebody was assigned to have a concealed weapon at the er at church on Sunday or whenever you\nKnow just let the concealed carry permit parrot carriers coming there was that wonderful woman out of Colorado Springs church I think she was a blackout I'm\nAnd she ... I think she may have been an off duty cop or she was just you know an armed citizen but some lunatic came running at the church I'm ... trying to shoot people in the parking lot trying to break into the church and she said she said a little prayer pulled out or a gun and shot him dead\nRight right I I just noticed in the Bronx last week there there was a guy jumped over the counter of a a bigger and a and B the guy came up with the equalizer the owner and shot him dead and they didn't they didn't invite him that which is a that's a sign of progress\nOn your [laughter] yeah All right All right and thanks for being with us look forward to talking to you next week the title of your new book resistance is futile bile I'm how we are\nGoing the trends but we\nBelieve New England featuring the all new when he Nineteen Subaru Forester was symmetrical all we'll Ross fully redesigned inside and out of all you want to smoke you wouldn't find the Subaru\nThe way vodka Tom\nThis is a real estate rocky via Elizabeth [laughter]\nFive as living dot com\nOr what the Mayans fruit chestnut grown design remodeled you burn it makes us all up in the wind going they help you get your home ready for sale so Ryan is getting a home ready for say what is the number one item that uh you would taco to increase value\nWe would look at that front entryway first and our goal would be to get that cleaned out and shrubs and laws and that would be where we would stock\nOf age their loss for the Minnesota we're fooled by taking down the Vikings and develop more now on the west was won\nKnow but no this month or two pack of Napa night vision had lamb says up to ten dollars off cause with ball comes longer nights and pour overall visibility luckily our head lamps up superior elimination which helped reduce the chance of an accident [noise]\nSee better Dr Saper with up to ten dollars off a two pack a nap and night vision headlights quality parts ... people snapping no well\nI don't know [noise]\nThat participate enough out of our stores for instance I wanted to [noise]\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five\nYeah that's eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the\nFirst steps to recovery to help you need to be one Callaway eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the recall now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight your addiction teams that third party advertiser for various treatment centers and play some networks individual results will dairy visit your addiction team dot com forward slash\nABC News\nI'm Scott Goldberg two days after eleven people were shot dead during a Sabbath service in spite of Pittsburgh synagogue the suspect was in court slang\nFace and all business the heavyset Bowers entered the judge's questions with a simple Yes sir outside the courtroom U.S attorneys Scott Brady\nOur investigation of these hate crimes continues\nPowers will make his next court appearance November first in the meantime drugs to flight risk you'll remain jailed without bond ...
