role in creating this fiasco that has consumed her campaign\nLike a dumpster fire\nDepending on what you read Elizabeth Warren stumbled is facing a backlash created a fiasco or even quote started a whole new controversy this week when she released the results from a DNA test showing she has a very this the Native American relative\nShowing you she claims to have a very distant Peruvian Mexican or Colombian relative there's ... there's no a Native American DNA in that sample\nBeside sharing says many comparisons heavenly images\nIncluding Senate majority atmosphere\nThat just for this

Rosenstein\nJoking when he talked about wearing a wire into the oval office\nI don't think he was not in the least uh it's up to Ninety two percent who say no yeah that's his story though when he's sticking to it\nWhen he talks to reporters seed doesn't want to talk to anybody on the house judiciary or the house intelligence committee so he's he's a stone wall on them but he invites reporters and who are sympathetic or all left pipes\nAnyway uh so the the globe wrote this story about the lives Warren was a you know getting getting all the bad the ... the the bad info out before she runs for president before it was a total of indication three days ago now it's now she was just getting all the baggage out of the way\nAnd then they mentioned me and the story and about how I tried to get her a DNA sample back in the back in the first campaign and twenty twelve\nAnd I grabbed her and I threatened to to figure out some way to get her DNA so what are the first you can imagine Steve one of the first you're reading the comments again aren't you how I I wanted to see but there were that it's worthwhile for this one from Mike\nBe for three four three hopefully why enforcement will take notice of how we cars invasive tactics\n\nHow a car you stay on charged with the crime of conspiracy to be invasive\nHow do you played\n[laughter] how is it invasive she took that half off the pen signed Powell chow put the cap back on handed it back to my guy\nHe brought the pen back I removed the tap and send it to them ancestry twenty three or DNA whatever it is and uh they said not enough a saliva on it and not a for a DNA test I don't believe that's a crime\nOr aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two whereas the trial taking place how we I'd love to go and support Asians it's taking place a on northern avenue what the federal courthouse in South Boston where the Whitey Bolger trial the local court house it's called\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two day your next with highway car go ahead Dave\nFried clams on your breath\n[laughter] you know Indians love fried clams Indians ate a lot of fried clams in New England\nI was one of the and they they it all the shellfish even a fresh water or type shellfish that's where the they got massacred and the turtles falls or buy in the ah I think in the king Philips war up near a north of just north of Deerfield where I used to live\nOr what I Want you got that somebody's financing these people coming out from Central America\nWhile I mean it's ... it's cost than somebody a lot of money you know I mean somebody somebody's providing all these uh ... all these uh amenities a and food and and uh you know toilets or at says close someone's got to be paying for this\nSo cabinet wouldn't it be like if like a contributing and if they pass the crime if these people come into the country illegally\nWell I'm I'm hoping that they that they don't get into the country but you're right but I I don't [noise] I I think it would be\nKind of a stretch just like it'd be a stretch to accuse me\nIt's ... to be invasive I mean they they would just say we're contributing to a a to a group or to an advocacy group or advocacy groups\nAnd some of these things are probably church charities to you know a lot of these a lot of these churches including the Roman Catholic Church make a lot of money off resettling these refugees it's a it's it's it's almost Iraq it\nYou know in terms of making big money seems to tell you about if they do some they'd do a lot of what was Somalis in the in Maine right or they get\nOlder they get them in the Catholic charities are a large part of that and even when they when they uh they bring the ah the UAE sees when they were resettling them and flying them all over the country the unaccompanied minors there would fly 'em all over even as far as Alaska it was a Catholic charities we're helping to facilitate that\nWhy couldn't MS Thirteen pick up the bills that so many of them were ah that we're basically a MS Thirteen apprentices or maybe even made members\nAid for four or five but it's a they want to make it a humanitarian crisis you know and and the bill O'Reilly had a column this week about the humanitarian crisis he lives in Suffolk County Long Island\nThere's a humanitarian crisis there the MS Thirteen or ... there's like two thousand members in this in this one county on Long Island and it's a big urban count the obviously\nBut the the two thousand members and they've killed dozens and dozens of Americans over the last uh the last decade or so and it's just a you know no one ever talks about the humanitarian crisis of a of the crime and the drunk driving and the a\n... and the drug dealing that's being done by these uh illegal aliens we're not supposed to think about that\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two Randall your next with highway car go ahead Randall\nDoes want to know how the people like war Elizabeth Warren get Fifteen thousand votes were so now she's run the whole country guy ruin it was able to ...\nWell she got more than Fifteen thousand votes you you know it's this is one of these unintended consequences for her you know what are all political career is based on\nShe ... she was the one who was brought down from Cambridge to under Obama to set up the consumer protection finance board this is the real hack Haram agency that's a that was run by the guy from ah Ohio who's now running for governor out there with a quarter to quarter ray or something like that\nAnd uh but she was supposed to be the boss of the consumer finance protection board which is a real hacker ram a ... Republicans and Democrats everybody makes over a hundred thousand the works there including the secretaries\nAnd she was such an abrasive presence on Capitol Hill but not only the Republicans but all the Democrats in the Senate said she is not getting the job\nSo that's why she didn't become a an unelected a bureaucrat and so she got she got that sort of the political bug Potomac fever so she decided to come back to a Massachusetts in the run against the the the freshman ... term Senator Scott brown\nYou know in hindsight it might have been better if she was going to shift TV\nI that's what I'm saying I mean it's the law of unintended consequences you know I put in Kennedy Babylon to\nRonald Reagan was the host of Jeannie theater in a TV show and Bobby kennedy didn't like him because he thought he ... he was a threat so he said I Want you to fire fire him they fired him from gene theater for years later he's elected president and the rest is history unintended consequences\nHow old is your parents are becoming hard of hearing and keep saying what did you say are you experiencing hearing loss fearing help express can help with FDA registered hearing aids go to a hearing help dot com and use promote code how were you to get FDA registered hearing aids for Seventy five dollars down and fifty dollars a month\nThanks thanks for the call Roger well what was the nice that that was a nice bottle like he delivered I he's he's totally right about the uh the Social Security I Do remember in two thousand eight or two thousand seven when McCain and Ted Kennedy we're pushing their last or\nTheir their last immigration bill they that this the one that that failed they ... they were going to allow uh illegal aliens to use their corners then run up while committing identity that\nYour eye if we're in American citizens citizen we'd go to prison for identity theft but they were going to get to use the those quarters that didn't work quote unquote work\nAs a at for Social Security and and at one point\nPresident Bush was suggesting that illegal aliens would only have to put in twenty corners which is five years to vast for Social Security you and I have to put in forty coroners before we get even the slightest payment\nAnd then of course as you know they there's also talk up periodically about means testing because uh you know they say well there's not enough there's not enough money in in the pot for ah for everybody to get the benefits they were promised but of course\nA lot of that money they they say it's different but it's really all in the same pot a lot of this SSI money is going to the people who aren't citizens even if Social Security is and I think Social Security they can get it they can get it too but SSI that's what they\nWhen the uh when they they bring over their parents and then they didn't they claim that they've broken with their uh with their their children who are American citizens or who have green cards they put them on this the emergency welfare sometimes it's SSI\nAnd so someone who never worked a day in this country is getting SSI\nAt well and it's coming out of your or my Social Security pot that supposedly for us I'm tired of all this I'm really really tired of it\nAnd we're we're going to talk next hour to what to do was Stuart Taylor who's who's an expert on this a Harvard admissions case\nAnd a lot of it are a lot of the problem here with the the Harvard admissions cases that the the set asides the racial set asides are for 'em or for blacks and Hispanics and a lot of them especially the blacks are for recent immigrants\nUses so these are people who came over here after affirmative action was set up so they've always had more rights than basically either a white or black native born American and yet they're children get preference over America over you know\nPeople who've been in this country whose ancestors have been in this country for generations it's ridiculous it's absurd and and and you know so now we're we're gonna we're gonna have to absorb more of these people because we feel sorry for them but as soon as they come over to the country they have more they have more rights than we do\nI I don't get it I don't understand it\nA four four or five hundred forty to forty to a cabin here next with highway car go ahead Kevin\nKelly how are you

sitting alone and Ray's Pizza or on the east one hundred and thirty eighth street when the unhinged man walk and walk that he starts rambling about leaping white people\nUh he's you're no you're not a white man you're a white boy the suspect allegedly smeared but rather than escalate the confrontation they'll check got up and move to another table and this guy sucker punch them and then slashed him with a knife and and ran out the door\nThat's that was grotesquely fat\nBut but wait but wait social justice warriors it gets worse that that that was the story in the New York daily news and the New York post but one of the TV stations has a different twist on it\nUm ah the guy his name is Chris Bell check he told NBC New York for that is friends initially figured he was attacked for his sexual orientation upon hearing of density and he's gay\nOh my God you got gay bashed bill six set his friends asked him no I said I didn't get gay bashed I got bashed because I was white\nWell that's a different twist on this story isn't it a he was yelling about how evil white people were before a assaulting speaking of hate crimes\n... another reporter has died but this isn't a this is in Istanbul

each other\nHow come this story isn't getting a a round the clock attention I mean this is a journalist it's been it's been a not murdered and again and it didn't happen in a foreign country it happened in New Jersey and the guy was on a Saturday he was an American who got killed and yet\nNo interest in it at all I think one of the great stories about the uh Elizabeth Warren controversy was by a guy named Eli steel in a in a on Fox\nAnd I guess he's half black half Jewish\nAnd he says what fascinates me about war and as I could easily have walked the same path as her my skin is white but I was born to a black father and a white Jewish mother I also have Native American DNA\nMy sister and I knew that if we allow ourselves to be defined and defeated by racial hate we would pay the higher price mini checking the box when it came time for me to enter the world of identity politics and submit my college application I left the race boxes blank\nI knew if I use my race to move ahead in life I Would become beholden to race I would've allowed race to define my fate an act that cannot be reversed\nThat is the trap warned fell into this is a ... again very thoughtful piece\nFrom the very moment she claimed her small amount of Native American ancestry isn't identity politics virtue race to find her and her career at every turn then as we just recently witnessed this path led to her being exposed as a fraud before the entire nation\nWhat a sad fate\nBut that's not the worst of it warns claim of Native American ancestry has made her complicit in identity politics institutional racism the powers behind identity politics have long abandoned the hard work of helping impoverished Americans climb out of poverty and into the middle class through education ambition and hard work\nToday all that matters to many universities is whether they have enough of each racial and ethnic group with minority status represented in orange case universities didn't care that she had blond hair blue eyes and never lived on a reservation there were more than happy to add another body to the Native American category upping their diversity bona fides\nWhy couldn't war and see what I saw why couldn't she see she was enabling the illusion of progress that did absolutely nothing to uplift the lives of those living on reservations and why couldn't she is someone who claims to be a social justice in racial equity advocate see the very cycle of institutional racism that she was perpetuated\nSometimes the answer is simple\n... identity politics made it possible for warrant to use race as a form of power to advance her career ambitions\nBut the active striking a bargain with the devil blind to warrant this truth if identity politics derives its power from racing only race that how can it ever truly move us Americans beyond race to a better and more just\nSociety [noise] it should come as no surprise to a very racial power that's boost warrant eventually became a corruption\nConsuming her career and worse Harris\nGood face he lies steel box and how we saw [noise]\nSort of interesting you should ask during depositions in this case drew fast than the president

[laughter] I really do that but\nYeah no it's very clear that are discriminating in history just clear and it was interesting that ah that you know when it came up she didn't just she hadn't hit seven so I think it was similar yeah they just say yeah that was terrible that was a long time ago we don't do that or are they said gee you know we don't know about that\nOr which um I mean at the end of my article I say quality quotes by a\nBack how the president of Harvard and the current president of Yale salad the both of them said in essence we don't discriminate against anybody\nAnd those I send my article and I believe strongly were bald face flies\nA bald face flies now it's you know it it's a it's a trial issue or whether they discriminate against Asian Americans versus everyone else so let's assume they don't for the moment\nHow can they say they don't discriminate against white applicants when they are quite public\nThat if you are a non white applicants in particular African American or Hispanic or you get a big boost in terms of F ... scores grades or you get jumped over the heads of a white applicants who are not only heart better qualified academically but who are um last\nI'll I'll give you I'll give you another example that I Hope they get into it this trial and I think they've already gotten into it a little bit with these uh these these are emails from the guy from the Kennedy School saying thanking the dean of admissions for letting in some rich people into the school\nSo if if I have the final at yeah they probably why I'm a white guy I was in high school in Massachusetts I didn't have a chance to go into Harvard 'cause my parents couldn't give a ten million bucks but a guy who probably got ... got a lower on the SATs the me whose parents could give ten million bucks\nHe was admitted to Harvard rice so I Am I Am I not a victim of\nOf a financial law as socioeconomic discrimination\nWell yeah and since you are but there's not there's no law against doing that to you\nThere is a law against racial discrimination you know the same thing they give they give preferences to legacy so called you know children alumni yeah and you know that's money talks type stuff um but\nUh I'm like a racial preference as they get ... those preferences are not as big as the racial preferences but more importantly and the reason is cases in court is that the civil rights act in Nineteen sixty four titles sex sick says no racial discrimination is a lab period in federally funded a\nUh educational institutions in Harvard has one of those\nWere talking to us Stuart Taylor junior he's the author of the lead story in the Weekly Standard though this week about a Harvard on trial and he's also the author of a\nCoauthor mismatch how affirmative action hurt students it's intended to help and why universities won't admit it one thing I learned in your story which I didn't know is that I a huge percentage of these are black and to a lesser degree I guess Hispanic set asides\nGo to the children of recent immigrants I mean these people these are people who've come in\nAt the country since affirmative action was instituted yet they're still being treated as if there's some kind of oppressed minority even though they've always had an adjunct on certainly white people and to a lesser degree black natives of the country right I mean how is this was this era I Believe they're\nNot one of the um a a great scholar in Syria Peter ... professor or a has a nice book in which he observes that are more than half the people who qualify\nFor racial and ethnic preferences in college admissions generally more than half of them\nAre recent immigrants from the children of recent immigrants\nI'm a you know Hispanic or whatever you sound a lot a lot of from Africa or from the west indies and so people who came to United States uh\nUh presumably to take advantage of all the opportunities favorite ... offered her being treated as though they were having a press class right and getting given given given a big burst over folks like you\nKnow it it doesn't seem fair to me Mr Taylor or did I mean it's too late on me but at the uh it didn't seem fair at the time and it it doesn't seem any more for your now what what about the uh I saw something by one of the left us the writers for the New Yorker will say\nWell you know maybe they're on to something the uh the the group students for fair admissions\nBut this is just a Trojan Horse by some conservatives who want to do away with affirmative action and we do need some affirmative action or\nFor raw oppressed groups and it's so therefore the whole case should be thrown out even though even though certain a poor or Asians and poor whites are being discriminated against [noise] yeah\nWell there's um you know that there's not a whole lot of merit and that\nIt is true that people bringing this lawsuit their ultimate objective if they can get it all the way to the Supreme Court\nIs get rid of the whole system of racial preferences for blacks or Hispanics et cetera that that throw them and objective but it's not their immediate objective their immediate objective and they're supported by a whole lot of the Asian American groups who are who see their own interest in this is to end the system of\nRacial discrimination against Asian American applicants that they see that they claim Harvard does and all the big university do they ... maybe Cal Tech which is more than forty percent Asian American but either way so yeah it that you know I notice guide are brought to lawsuits\nYou know he's got some white supremacist he's a guy who thinks hey this country was founded on principles that include no racial discrimination of course we had slavery at racial discrimination for a long time so we adopted civil rights laws to put an end of that sort of thing so why are we still doing it\nThat attitude you bring a lawsuit to and by the way since Asian Americans are traditionally ... oppressed minority group those are the people that this system of racial preferences is supposed to help so they make you know very a suitable plaintiffs her case\n... as the one I think you have to why\nThat's why they're following it looms elite\nI think you had the quote the famous quote from John Roberts in your story or the way that end racial discrimination is the end racial discrimination I mean it seems that cut and dried isn't it\nYeah yeah he's a very concise fellas sometimes John John Roberts you need it for a long time\nOr it was it it's been ... it was true is still true to some extent with the legacy of slavery and discrimination that left lasting scars on a lot of black people and black families and that may be a ... you know admission systems needs to take a cab to that but they've gone a most are the kids are apart from the immigration thing\nOr the vast majority of the black kids to get in the car Harvard based on racial preferences and the other places\nAre pretty advantaged the poor black people or the children are black cab drivers or their children are Chinese laundry workers you know blue collar type ... racial preferences and Harvard cops firefighters yeah that is\n... you're going to be afraid football player or if you're an Irish guy for ...\nOr you got to be a son of a black lawyer and a black cocker and went to a fancy New England prep school\nNow they take a lot of them and you know the reason they take 'em I don't mean to suggest that they are biased against or blacks or not the reason they take them is that blacks who has\nThe best academic preparation the ones who might not flunk out right away tend to be more advantage classes so fine uh that don't claim you're doing this to help the oppressed masses they're not doing it to help the mass press masters the extent they claim they are that's a fraught\nExactly what the word Taylor thanks for being with us and maybe we'll check back in with you as the
