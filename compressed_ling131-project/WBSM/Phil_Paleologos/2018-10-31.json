perfect smiles dot com Steve what's the polar question one of the results are\nDo you want to complain about the options that I gave in the poll now or after I'd give them give it just give us the options I'm voting for I I Would vote for her she's a as my favorite Halloween you have the would not but I but I don't have that choice I'm voting for him in at\n... uh what's the best Halloween candy we're giving the options Reese's peanut butter cup resist ... cat Snickers Milky Way peanut butter M. and m's butter finger three musketeers star burst one hundred grand and M. and m's crunch role does get old milk doesn't whoppers\nAnd right now ... butter cup is a clear winner with forty percent of the vote Snickers is in second place was Fifteen Percent or six percent like your I'm an ... and by the way no one has voted for starters\nListening to that a list makes me a almost feel nostalgic for homemade oatmeal cookies from other family down the street that was too cheap to buy the the good Hershey's Kisses or the M. and m's or something\nA four or five hundred forty to forty two we'll be back with your calls in just a moment um how we are [noise]\nAt the synagogue is in terms and invaders and invasion for this tragedy is working at cross purposes merit at fast so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified gang migrants ... again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nHis narrative well you know the the\nThe alleged shooter also hated Jews kind of like the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee who's a congressman from Minnesota and the candidate for attorney general\nIn the Gulf for state right but\nYou know you can also compare him to what was that Julie sweat and that was that her name the one who accused Brett Kavanaugh of spiking the punch at the high school parties\nShe was she was three or four years older than Brett Kavanaugh but she went to it she went to public school rather than a private school but she hung out in the same same social group with him and she knew\nThat he spike the punch not just with grain alcohol\nBut with ... both in other words he had he had access to\nMultiple date rape\nStyle drugs that are the most high school students don't have a I don't have access to one of them but he had access to multiple once so now someone they J Michael so this comparing Trump to the guy who spikes the punch this is this is one of their fall themes I guess of the Democratic party Republican spike punch\nStranger rape using the word responsible as though it's black and white you know if you're a kid at a party and used to fight the punch with a bunch of grain alcohol are you are responsible and some kid gets drunk and goes out and commit to a DUI\nI mean you know that that's inevitable truck President Trump has been playing with fire for years and his supporters have been playing a kind of a devil's bargain that well if we support them while overlook the bad stuff well this is the cost the bill has come do\nWhen you play with fire when you aggravate a situation like this when you pander to white supremacist and say well there's good people on both sides of a neo Nazi rally what effect is going to happen so I think this focus on responsibility as though it's some kind of a legal cases may be a mistake ...\nWait a second is the spiking\nI'm playing with fire me it's hard to play with fire you don't want to play with fire when you're spiking the punch because the punch\nIs liquid it's going to put out the fire grain alcohol you can catch on fire [laughter] you can't do it but but once you pour the grain alcohol in the punch\nYou you're probably if you drop the the fire into the punch it's probably going to go out unless you really really spike the ... it's not really punch it's grain alcohol with a little hunch were sprinkle that have for four or five\nHundred forty to forty to reverse the city and wants to know who's spiked ... punch Robie being the governor's son Robie Baker who's been accused of roping a woman on a Jet Blue flight that's that that case remains unresolved supposedly Scott your next with highway car go ahead Scott\nHey how you how are you good good\nSo I had a ... a little argument with a with a person last night the non voter and he was just all over ... you know comparing it you know having to practically Whitey Bolger you know and I mean it is talking about a bankruptcy back you know way back and\nFor you receive a president he's the he's saying that Donald Trump is the cause of all the division of the country\nEven when Donald Trump was running his campaign people are blaming it all and I see the country divided into four sections so it's a Republican Democrat non eligible\n... voter and I told this guy said you know voter\nScott zero why are you are you encouraging the sky you shouldn't be telling them you know what do you got the right what's his name what's this guy's name Rae\nRae Rae you got the right idea don't vote you know what a waste of time it is to go vote yet that's what you should be you know we don't get an argument with him\n... oh I was horrible and I said to him I said you got Trump in because you didn't vote so how do you like that\nWhen he was oh and all but one thing to do and Scott did try to get them to vote he's not going to do the right thing if he goes down to the poll he's going to go out and cancel your vote out you know sometimes yeah you're right you're right you sometimes you got to turn the other cheek here just walk away thanks for the call Scott palm your next with our car and go ahead Tom\nHow we how you doing good good\nHey I'm calling from Keene New Hampshire I Am a refugee formerly from left a\nThirty Years' ago yeah\nAnyway I got a couple of ideas of

going to do the way that the Israelis would do it by creating them with water cannon and fire hoses\nAnd actually firing tear gas canisters into Mexico of course the Democrats Democrats wouldn't like that at\nAll it seems to me Tom you gotta it seems to be the best thing to do would be the quote just close the border and say you don't have a mission to an executive order and say there's not going to be any more rock border crossings between the United states and Mexico until Mexico confront this uh play upon the United states of America\nRight I mean when he when he threatened the to ah to to end the the new trade agreement that succeeding NAFTA they ah they they snap to it briefly anyway you know I mean I think I think we have a lot of leverage here that uh that that hasn't been really I'm\nA deployed it well enough yet and and I hope I hope he's got something in mind then again I was\nIt was happy to see Mattis the defense secretary mad dog said today that uh the u._s. a military has never used\nAs a uh as just a a a tactic as a gesture you know that they're that they're ... they're going down there to actually do something and that's the stop this uh this invasion from coming into the pun into the punch I'm [laughter]\nI'm looking at the er at the text messages to stop the invasion I mean how is this any different than what poncho V. it that\nMeans ... they're going to be
