dollars\nNow I don't know if one one billion would have been the largest or not but they're saying that one point six billion I I heard it on ABC News and [noise] excuse me and I I saw it on the

are taking a chance to win a billion bucks and I get it I understand\nAnd the questions always come up what would you do if you won the jackpot so I Would be foolish if I didn't ask that question what would you do if you won one point six billion and let's cut that in half\nAnd say that you really only will get Mm just a poultry eight hundred\nMillion dollars if you take the lump sum and then of course taxes when it's\nAh let's take a unearned income let's call and learned incumbent around\nThirty thirty five percent so let's just say a third of a hundred thousand ... no no no no no no no no

J. max with video that after the man had been in there for half an hour and somebody could have stopped him um you know there's a very easy solution repeal this law you know you want to create something that has more boundaries where you know there isn't this automatic presumption of\nAny man is allowed to be in any space a and you have to prove that he's not supposed to be there um I I think that you can you can create a solution by repealing the law and coming up with something better if you if that's the direction\nI Would say this is you know first of all the\nVideotaping anybody in any\nBathroom or whether it's of your biological or um the way you feel is against the law absolutely so we already have a law in the book for that you write the under the\nLaw again you know that we already have a law against doing anything against anybody in any kind of bathroom and so you know people say well you know a transgender person could be harassed for being in a bathroom that harassment is off with also already illegal prior to this law\nSo you know anybody harassing anybody in the bathroom because of their gender identity or harassing anybody\nThat was already illegal as well and so you're you're you're sort of setting up this is this additional um level of scrutiny for business owners and women um you know to protect theoretically to protect transgender people when it's not necessary if somebody's being harassed that's already illegal\nSo I I guess I'm I'm I'm On the side that I don't think\nGovernment should have been making a law so sweeping is is I Believe that if the state believes they need to make such a law they can do it for state facilities\nAs cities and towns can do the same for their and then you know if you were planted fitness you can decide as a business owner what's going to be right for your patrons are not\nGoing back to the planet fitness type of of businesses right now\nHave you talked to any of them and have they seem ah whether it be women or men making a decision not to use a their locker facilities or dropping their membership because of a along like this\nUm I have not I know that there was a um fitness group that had oppose the law um during its passage\nI'm In the legislature that lobbied against that um they do not recall the name um but I I saw it in the in the um the lobby reports that were were posted on line up the secretary of state's office\nUm but I I have not been and I have not personally been in touch with anybody from any kind of um fitness group or anything along those lines but you know you think about uh you know they're not as popular as they were a couple of years back but curves which is theoretically a gym that\nThat women do chew that you know they they are specifically for women the idea being women you know don't necessarily always want to exercise with men uh around a now under this law you couldn't have eight eight curves that they would have to admit I'm\nYou know men transitioning to be women or men that identify as women and so you're you're in order to accommodate each of you know an individual who was\nI'm a self identifying as as a woman um you would have to then make all of those other women at the curves uncomfortable they are seeking out this experience at this GM's specifically because\nThey don't want to exercise with men and then you have somebody that that may be um you know in a ... male demanding to to access to exercise\nWhat ever happened to the idea maybe make three badge each one male one ... one Mitch ginger ... yeah well\nThey go occupancy are seeing increasingly now um books\nOr a businesses are constructing a rest rooms that do not have a you know multiple toilets installs but they have um you know just one place to go to the bathroom with um you know a a ... and and and either you know someone\nOf any gender and can use it\nUm but I think the concern is is like I said further downstream in terms of what happens with with battered women's shelters what happens\nWith locker rooms a you know or places\nLike that what happens um we saw case out of milk and a Massachusetts uh the other that that was the broken the news the other day I'm about an individual that demanded a Brazilian wax that demanded that his it you know a bikini wax essentially\nUm and the the spa said well we don't we don't do men and your anatomically mail you have\nMale genitalia and he he said well no I'm I'm a woman I identify as a woman so you have to treat me as a woman and because these service women you have to touch me there even though you're not comfortable and the women were\nYou know understandably that's not what they signed up for when they when they became it when they started this this business uh you know what do they do now they're in a position where I'm this fellow or this individual\nFiled a complaint with the attorney general's office\nAh you know basically saying demanding that they waxed him even though he has male anatomy and they're not comfortable doing that and you you still have this individual who's\n[noise] well [noise]\nI Know what this law is really about um this law\nProtects transgender people in public places like restaurants shops\nMedical offices and of course also using the bathroom in locker rooms and those places [noise] um the opposition likes to make this just about the bathroom but public accommodations meat means a lot more than that\nUm and then the last two years ah since this law has been passed I haven't seen a difference in my day to day um and there has been no uptick in public safety incidents since the law has passed\nSo that's what your side said Chanel said that uh there was an incident up and will burn where there was a little girl in the bathroom that are\nUm apparently a guy tried to go in while she was in there\n[noise] um the ... will\nBurn 'em I haven't heard of that incident um [noise]\nI Know that she did mention uh something about the T. J. max incident and plane ville [noise] um where we know it was like about a year ago a man was in the women's bathroom and he spied on that woman while she was using the facility or he was not transgender\nAnd he did not claimed to be\nTransgender so he doesn't have any ... uh um protections on the law even if he claimed to be transgender um he was arrested and prosecuted as he should have fun and I mean this law does not allow people to um basically um\nCan conduct criminal activity\nAnd that's interesting that you would bring that up because of the fact that\nIf you are claiming to be you know committing fraud basically trying to say that you are\nSomething that you weren't there's already a law against that and in in what you're trying to say here is this protects trends genders allowing them to use a facility ...\nKnow why don't we scratch a bathroom in locker rooms from the bill\nBecause those are areas of it I Can't speak for you but I Would think that you would rather be changing with with women as opposed to maybe a man who thinks he's a woman or not really sure and you know if he's kind of staring at you that's not a crime\nI mean I'm sure you're you're a fairly beautiful looking woman I'm sure you get stares when you're going to stop and shop and some of the other stores what would that be like in the locker\nRoom I mean it is I don't think that we should\nA scratch out bathroom in locker rooms from this law specifically because I have transgender friends um I specifically I have this friend who has told me or that he has been kicked out of both bathrooms and the opposition would say that\nHe would need to use the women's bathroom since that was the gender he was assigned at birth [laughter]\nUm but the thing is that women kick him out of the bathroom more often than men do so when my friend and I are going out to a restaurant or to a ball game or something there's this anxiety that he has about going to the bathroom\nOr it's something that we take for granted we can just go to the bathroom do our business wash your hands and leave and\nMy friend can't do that then there's this anxiety ... around that and also it's like sometimes they even have to think oh now I have to leave early I\nHave to leave dinner early or I have to leave this ball game early because I have to rush home to use the bathroom where I Know I'm not going to be harassed well\nIsn't that a choice issue though when you're transgender you decide that you want to be a man if you were born a woman or vice versa\nIt's not a choice it's basically just to ask a question to you so that\nIt's better understood like when in your life that you know that you were a man\nWhen I was born or or like you know when I was old enough to know\nSo I mean when you asked that question to people I don't know where there's people I mean I'm saying I I\nAsked that two people and it's really hard to pinpoint a time in your life where you knew that I that I don't I Can't pinpoint a certain point in my life where I knew that I was a female it's because of its inherent\nUm so that's the same for trans people or it's not a choice\nIt's um this misconception that is a choice but in reality um it's the same\nA misunderstanding that people had one like the gay marriage thing our marriage equality was happening so it's like people thought that being gay or being lesbian was a choice when it it isn't a choice it's who you are\nUm [noise] I don't know I'm\nOne day you can decide that you are a male the next day you feel differently and you're female it does sound like a choice\nI Would have to disagree with that\nEven though you are making a ... you you may be indecisive but you're still a choice\nIt's an inherent to who you are\nGets in him or to who you are so there is this one part of the law which I think is a huge stumbling block the I'd certainly like to hear your comment on ... any attempt to block a man from entering a woman's locker room dressing room or bathroom\nCould result in individual penalties of up to fifty thousand dollars or a year in prison\n[noise] so the law does permit for fines but only if there's multiple incidences of documented discrimination over a seven year period [noise] so\nWhat does that mean I mean I Know what seven years is documented in ... that that sounds like a slippery slope [noise] well I mean it's the same thing\nThat um other\nUm lies of discrimination or penalties like I'm\nSo basically these penalties have been on the books for years\nIn the form of other laws like racial discrimination so it's not really is a slippery slope let's documented discrimination would be if someone basically made a claim I'm or reported an incident so let's say a\nI'm a business and I keep on discriminating\nAgainst transgender people and they keep making claims and reports against my businesses over a seven year period than I Will be fine\nSo if I'm understanding you correctly since the law has only been in effect for a little over two years\nNo one has been fined fifty thousand dollars or sent sent away for a year as of yet yes that's correct it are there any businesses under the gun because of this [noise] to your knowledge\nUm no not to my knowledge\nWhat if we just closed down these multiple facility bathrooms in locker rooms and just make a separate and it's going to be expensive but separate locker room so people can\nJust go into a locker changing area toilet area so you don't have to put up with this because it sounds like\nIt sounds like in order to remedy one problem we're also creating another\n[noise] so you set yourself it is expensive um to put this mandate on businesses especially small businesses it would create this costs on them um so it's it's not realistic to\nLike to change all bathrooms or at an additional bathroom and adding an additional bathroom is also I'm not the solution because now we're alienating a group of people just because of who they are\nUm and and making them we're giving them a facility I mean we're alienating them and saying hey you're different you have to go use this other bathroom because we don't feel comfortable with you being here\nNo it's giving you because you didn't feel comfortable being there\nAt ... I like I said it it's it's alienating a group of people let's open up the phone lines zero eight nine Ninety six zero five hundred thank you for your patient so low Iran with anti bell San Diego\nWhere morning I Can't believe my ears which was first Freud tricky\nCarolina or Missouri just dizzy Gillespie birthplace and the annual South Carolina jazz festival or you have a a a lunatic or as a guest today who's talking about bringing a transgender man in a restaurant with little girls in their uh you know you're luckier in Massachusetts\nMassachusetts were selected by a vis a militant lesbian married without or from the square marriage dot com have you been to that website\nWhat can you can you get onto asking a question of places\nThat is made up of loan affects how can you have this Laura tick on the air without somebody a competent to debate her", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Pete Braley in the Morning", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "20"}
