immature approach to wanting to solve\nCrises that are truly are like a cancer well she started or he started or that rhetoric started it it is so immature\nSo I bring that up only because uh the rabbi was saying that hardly any of the press ever talks about the president of the United states who regularly attends synagogue he has his own\nHe is the father and grandfather to a Jewish daughter and grandchildren and his son in\nLaw of course president is very much grieving for our a Jewish community\nAnd for others just thing for say otherwise is really part of the fuel that gets evil going it's that kind of fuel that evil loves to idol on\nSo with that said and with our love and all of our sympathies surrounding our support around our Jewish community here on the south coast\nAnd of course around the country and world this Thursday evening\nYou and I are welcome to join in unity to drop the rhetoric of he started it and to come in unity\nIn love and that's how things change folks

seeking a a guy who crashed a stolen car yeah\nThey're searching for this a suspect who's responsible for crashing a stolen car early Sunday Morning\nDetails of uh that uh we also find that's in Westport the folks are really genuinely interested in pursuing the question of school uniforms now regardless of what you think about this\nThey want to talk about it [noise] school committee members in Westport they talked about\nYou know starting school uniforms most especially for the children in the lower grades [noise]\nUm so the superintendent their Gary ... said that he is ready to start the dialogue and the community find out how folks are thinking about this\nUh alternately the committee is going forward with at least exploring the idea of Westport children wearing uniforms\nAnd one side says that the uniforms would help put all the students and kind of like you know the same playing field would reduce any feelings that are about the wardrobe pro or con if you know what I mean\nKids can be pretty vicious at times as you well know\nBut are also having students are in uniforms up through great age would make them easier to differentiate from a high schoolers that's what some on the pro side of the argument are saying\nAgainst the idea of our members like a school committee member mark Carney\nWho says listen what about freedom of expression a we have to uphold a as students freedom of expression right\nSo who's right here Westport considering school uniforms for something\nThat the controversies continue absolutely let me throw out one more for you you know that a week from tomorrow is election day I Hope you do\nA in Rhode Island something kind of interesting is happening and I want to know whether or not we should start thinking about that here\nFirst of all they have ballots in both English and in Spanish in Rhode Island ah for the November six general election they have bilingual ballot it's already in Providence in Pawtucket\nCentral Falls\nAnd now wound socket wound socket will be the the latest add on to having a bilingual ballots so you know it's one ballot there's both English and Spanish on it do you have a problem with that\nUh there are are these communities already that have gone forward with it and they say it's working out beautifully\nAnd so uh the secretary of state in Rhode Island said listen it's the duty for our state to do as much as possible to stop any unfettered or you know they want everyone to vote at the ballot box All right\nAnd so every eligible Rhode Island or has unfettered access to the ballot boxes the bottom line there and wound socket by the way is going to be included now in the Spanish language voter outreach program so my question is very simple\nWe don't live too far away from these communities here on the south coast cities like New Bedford in Fall River or elsewhere but I take those two because of the largest concentration of Spanish speaking citizens\nDo you agree that offering\nLink will ballads in future elections is a good idea yes no give me a call and we'll have a cup of coffee and a jelly doughnut and schmooze about that question [noise]\nNew Bedford new than
