he he spoke with the judge he spoke with ... but I still think he's lame where we're at war with the American people why it's his daughter's wedding and\nHe wants the walk his daughter down the aisle\nHe said I can certainly be impartial and I can be independent and you know that's a response to the criticism that he has got and I'm not only are from Democrats but there are now\nMore than a thousand law school professors around the country\nSaying that he does not have the right temperament um there's a ... a retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens saying the same thing as you know retiring Supreme Court justices do not make these kinds of statements um\nAnd uh also overnight though we had the Washington Post editorializing saying that he should not be on the high court and that is unusual because Washington Post doesn't do right Supreme Court nomination editorials specially this late in the in the day\nI'm not too concerned uh overall especially about the law professors because they seem to be out in left field politically so that's that's the whole league onto themselves so that doesn't really\nYou know a bother me at all I was thinking get more of isn't this a sign of good characters for him to admitted his mistakes and apologize\nWell it's also good politics he knows that he displayed a temperament last week that was\nNot judicial and I'm right you know this is real politic right\nAnd I ... you're so right in the respect that there is for people that he has this has also for people I think we talked about this last time you know\nHere's what I don't understand yep I'm the Republicans\nThat was they control the Senate and house if they don't get judge Kavanaugh on the high court it will be some other conservative who's against roe v Wade the abortion decision why are all these Republican so dug in\nFor a man who arguably arguably\nHas a history of sexual aggression who visibly has has a temperament that was displayed a less than judicial last week who clearly\nDidn't tell the truth about such personal business as his drinking history and who condemned the Democratic party said that they were orchestrating a political hit job\nAnd he will have to deal with a barrage of political cases once he's on the court why knowing that they can get a conservative somebody who's against roe v way why are they so desperate to hold on to this particular guy [noise]\nIt's a question and I'm In fact I heard Republicans touch upon some of the plates you just brought out Michael [noise] ah I ...\nAnd might be of course that he um you know he has he's on record as saying I don't think uh there should be investigations\nOf sitting presidents right and of course this president is under investigation\nRight now are not only from the special counsel but a prosecutors in\nNew York in the southern district of New York and I don't know if you\nDid you see that New York times piece this week about on the Trump or family finances yeah I'm a powerful peace\nThey um they had three veteran reporter spend a year and a half digging into this and what they published was a story lengthy a declaring\nOutright fraud are saying that the fortune Donald Trump has amassed was mainly from his parents uh you know he he won the presidency claiming that he was a self made billionaire um that his father only gave him what he called a small million\nDollar loan according to the times\nFrom the time a Donald Trump was a toddler he received the equivalent of at least four hundred\nThirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire ended a lot of the money came because he helped his parents dodged taxes let me just say\nThat there's a difference between a daily newspaper reporter and an investigative reporter and I I was an investigative reporter for several years\nYou're not doing daily journalism they give you not only days weeks sometimes months\nTo investigate and once you have\nDone this year not only have to put your reporting your stories\nThrough levels of editors you have to put it through levels of lawyers accountants tax experts financial experts and that's what was done here they went all over this with a microscope because they're dealing with the president of the United states\nThis is pretty heavy stuff so\nIt's there is there anything illegal anxious isn't there's anything illegal here that's one thing the uh Fifteen thousand words were ... they make a bit of difference Michael\nHis it may make a difference in terms of civil procedure\nWell that's what I'm saying if there's something here or that belongs in court that's another thing but this thing uh it just goes right over the heads of every day people it really does\nGot upset when they found out next and wasn't paying taxes now the there was a if it was\nA lot about tax dodging and uh well we'll see but it was a powerful peace\nAnd um had a lot of credibility knowing\nThe all of the things that this had to go through in order to to see the light of\nDay yeah so at ten thirty this morning we are supposed to find out what the next step is going to be because they will pick a\nProcedural vote this morning on on where they will proceed write\nThem or do you think he has the votes as of right now\nMy gut tells me yes but there are scenes from reporting that says the Republicans\nAre still very nervous I I you know we both
