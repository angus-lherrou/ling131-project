then let's do it it's not to an uncontroversial opinion even though a lot of liberals are are making it a very controversial\nOpinion because so they have a stranglehold on the system right now but I'd love to see this idea gained steam\nThank you very much of ... we appreciate your thoughts let me take one more very quick phone call and that's\nYou good morning\nYeah filter to where it's come to mind under construction so whether it's education or health care or social\nSecurity or anything on the government that they run it sort of is under construction it's like great work at crews on the side of the road like how broken everything is\nYeah I'm an educator like so where do you START I mean do you start with education do you start with health care that was that ruined I mean I just I I don't know where you\nKnow it's not clear it's really not clear George ... you're right um you know it's it's a tough one but said listen eliminating the education department as a standalone I'm for it\nHey and I was always the board of ed and his local towns I was always for them I was very vocal about that as well like what do they do you know what I mean yeah I Know what they do they lobby mostly\nFor the union benefits for their their teachers and I get that and then after that you know hey we need some new computers do we need this the first I think their first\nGoal it's just me ... is to protect the teacher's not the kid the\nKid abs so lovely and let me ask you George we only have a couple of minutes here do you believe that there is a connection between education and job training absolutely floored location\nAll schools are are very popular they're tough to get into focus not easy to get into your rights right everybody\nWants to go there because some people don't want to go to continue to school and and why would you want to grab a couple of hundred thousand dollars in school that\nBy the time you get out of that debt I'm you're going to call someone who just graduated from high school is going to fix your air conditioning your plumbing is heating et cetera so let people give people choices but right now the dropout rate isn't is it working so right it's\nTalking about um they're worried about their jobs sure um and and they were saying how low the stock had gotten um\nIt's a I Can't imagine where it is now but uh I'm sure that there is a an anxiety working for the company\nThat low yeah so I was so many people but for so long series was the largest retailer\nIn the country you bet ya it was the go to store the anchor in many malls\nAnd look what's happened now when you go to a mall not only is fierce gone but so many storefronts are empty [laughter] of it and I don't\nGo very often I'm just not a shopper but uh when you go you see so many are so much emptiness\nI was mentioning ten minutes ago that's what a coincidence that I said I hate to be in the management of malls today because what do you do how do you are still not all that commercial space with why\nYeah [laughter] we we had a a a mall here owns mills mall when it opened about\nTwenty years ago it was so upscale I felt like I should take\nMy shoes off so I ... off the floor really lovely and um it went out of business for about three or four years ago it had a short shelf life of people stopped\nGoing and they just tore the entire thing down and now they're putting up a Costco\nYes yes that's that's the future I guess who knows how I was there any way to avoid what has happened to Sears\nYou know the culture is changing\nThe ants in any way I Know that\nMy son um was in sales for a number of years and he edged his way into starting a a an online business of of closing yes and\nToday he is of course one of thousands of start up companies and he's been doing it now the better part of a decade and making a a very healthy living but he's taking them\nWhat used to be people going to store exactly um and this was happening all the cells all over the world from his house in Rockville, Maryland\nYes and that's why it was inevitable I mean New York [noise] uh but the ... book did touch the heartstrings of many many folks shores is is so\nWe're looking at that we're also looking at the look of secretary of state Mike Pompeo yeah tell me what you think is now in Riyadh\nUm they are meeting about the apparent killing of the Washington Post columnist or a ... who wrote critically about the Saudi prince Mohammed bin Solomon and the Saudis have been denying it in denying that they had anything to do with it\nApparently they're looking for\nA new story today something that gives them plausible deniability as they say ... uh that\nOh they were questioning him and it got out of hand rogue killers did it and that uh it was a torturer gone wrong as the torture is okay\nUm so President Trump finds himself caught\nThis morning between what you know their denials and the truth because uh um the American intelligence agencies have made it clear to him that they don't believe this that they think that that there's no\nDoubt in their minds that it was the Saudis and that it was intentional and meanwhile we've got this huge arms deal going with the Saudis to bring\nA lot of money to this country what's more important money or morality\nI don't know if you can a nerd and reduce it to that question but I'm obviously you know both are very important thing is we'll never get the real truth because our intelligence knows what's happened and\nMany times the nice things go on you have to face reality um we can't do a thing about them we cannot do a thing about them as idealistic as we want to be as Americans\nYeah there's nothing we can do and the crown prince says kill them that's what it is it's over
