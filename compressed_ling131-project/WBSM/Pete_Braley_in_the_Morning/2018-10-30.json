synagogue where are you safe but that is the atmosphere that we have in America right now one of Baird chief one of antagonism one of\nOut shouting each other it is so important look you and I may disagree on issues we're talking them out we're trying to talk in a civil tone to each other on this particular issue we don't have a great we don't have disagreement we of\nCourse agree that there is no place for this kind of violence or any kind of violence\n... um it's happening around the world more and more and uh my thoughts on this might though is that the evil force that gains drains by us\nI'm falling into hatred and and this kind of feeling it means a kind of strange from hatred or is not just here in America but around the world\nThis is happening and I believe it is an evil force we are\nUm we are witnessing around the world um changes in population we are more mobile than ever we have people who are not only entering\nThis country but um all across Europe I'm\nMoving in from third world countries and the question is will they be embraced as people looking for a better life or will they be rejected as the other ... and unfortunately we have\nA history in this country of treating a outsiders as the other as not like us until ...\nOtherwise whether it's blacks or Jews or Italians or Irish um or Latinos um America is a tough town and we ... we extract a price\nFrom all newcomers and they're going through this now in Europe in ways that um\nThey hadn't seen before\nAnd the entire world you're right the entire world has to decide\nAre we going to figure out ways to get along with each other or are we going to raise the rhetoric are we going to raise the level of hatred um because in the process what we do is we drive ourselves crazy and that's not good for anybody\nMichael we can't really settled the immigration the populations moving problem on the backs of American taxpayers America um it's just not possible because after this wave of people\nYou'll have another one already forming and another behind that and another behind that it's\nIt's something that needs to be handled legally we have the rule of law in this country for a reason and we are a wonderful country much they have to come in legally\nAnd this is how ... ... this is why rules make living a discipline otherwise we have chaos\nWell I'm the President Obama a was you know also turn back under under his White House\nThere were many people turn back at the border the difference was we didn't hear a lot of incendiary rhetoric about it um last or over the weekend in Pittsburgh there was this huge outpouring where thousands of people\nAcross all religious and racial lines are gathered to support the victims\nBut we're told that the biggest applause line of the evening was when uh one of the speakers said we want to make it clear that immigrants are welcome to this country\nYeah so we got to leave it alone we've ... out\nIs a way to do it legally I'm ... and to um lower the the flame of rhetoric um that is a company in this\nUm we're making ourselves crazy with um with a language alone and um it is leading to um to uh\nWhat we saw over the weekend trying to rather than looking for the ways that bind us together I'm looking for ways to divide us I'm One of the things that\nMade this Bowers guy who did the shooting I'm One of the things that made him angry was that um people\nIn this congregation or were involved in the uh Hebrew immigration aids society which has help immigrants across all religious lines to come to this country\nUm that you you can make the case when you make a legitimate case about laws um but we have to find a way not to um\nTo make people I'm a crazed with our rhetoric so that he and his crazed mind\nAnd he thinks that it is justifiable to the gun and and kill people\nAnd that is a mental disorder that is a man into that as a mental\nYes but this guy felt there was justification oh\n... ... you know what I hate to simplify it but that's how mentally ill people rationalize thing you're right of course the thing of course [noise] ah [noise] I\nIt's been a rough week or so so rough but um we we almost forgot I'm about the bombs\nAnd oh yeah oh sure I mean imagine we came very close to mash assassination and um we we forgot about it as twenty four hours\nWith it there is another sign of mental illness I mean all who in their right mind does this so\nYou know [noise]\n... let me leave this note that here in our community we are I'm sharing the grief and with love and unity around our Jewish brothers and sisters here locally and
