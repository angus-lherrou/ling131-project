by this Saturday\nLet's talk about that do you think age first of all is it possible\nYes very possible very likely I think wow All right yeah yeah I'm the restaurant I think\nI think it'll probably happen if it's not Saturday on the back but All right it's in the works right now and they're going to wrap up this FBI's thing mhm and they're going to have the votes on I think Collins Murkowski\nQuake will vote for his car car mix and match and to do the hype\nWhy outlaw amazing [noise]\nAnd then do you think the ah the opposition is going to continue to you know\nWhat ever sticks out for ever they're not going to stop you know I'm a year down the road we can hear about people trying to impeach him or you know is that going to continue at non him\nWell I don't know I mean I think not I think it'll fade away I think politically which I Am most attuned to I I I say this to people this is counter intuitive\nThe winner and the cabin on K ... will be a loser on election day and the loser under Kavanaugh\nWill be the winner so let's say that but we just started to each other's true Kavanaugh gets on the bench by much much for weeks before the military right\nSo we're happy he's on the bench Republicans are happy Trump choppy everybody's happy we we want\nThe Democrats and the Democratic voters women voters they're going to be furious if this guy got her real\nAnd and they have the added thing they can use which is\nThe charge really that the investigation the FBI investigation is run by Trump and it's rigged\nShould not talk to all the people they should've talked about ... of course since out [noise] that they're going to have all the energy almost like they're going to be mad if they lost on Kavanaugh at will motivate their voters they're angry voters to vote on November sex whereas the Republicans are going to be happy\nHappy voters don't vote ... voters stay home and be interest any energy is always with the unhappy vote or the out party to people didn't get what they want they come back the next election and go crazy and\nVote and that's probably what's gonna happen here the loser on Capitol Democrats will be the winner on election but\nVery interesting was saved that holds true [laughter] I can see the logic behind it because a lot of women will be very upset\nAnd you're right instance last week again and it's you know why should we go ahead yeah yeah we could go a week ago Sunday\nTiger Woods won the tour championship is first tournament when in five years I Love that Victor yep he goes over to France\nThe next day for the Ryder Cup he can't win a match over there I mean you know why because he had to let them be one and he had a what a normal human Athens\nThat's what's gonna happen here Republicans are going to be a cap on on and all the shouting about it's going to go away by the Republicans and we're going to be happy\nAnd by November sex it'll be ancient history to Republican state one that got the guy in the court now that's not going to motivate them to come close\nBut the Democrats are gonna be\nFurious over and they're going to vote\nBut we're going to vote anyway but probably a few more of a move or\nYeah I'd love to see the TV ads ah in West Virginia [laughter] I'm wonder what they look like on both sides\nBut he's hurt a Cavanaugh I saw today a poll from western since ... thirty points there\nThirty points ... points of people more people approved cabin on the disparate it's like fifty six approve of Kavanaugh one sixth district we're looking at yeah that's why senator mansion has to vote to approve the money's gone\nVery very interesting so they're they're going to get more than enough so it's very interesting I'm finally before we talk a little sports you know [noise] uh this rice and a a discovery does that trouble you is that\nPowerful course in these crazy times\nWhich discovered\nThe the the poisonous stuff there what are they call it rice and rice\nAnd yeah yeah I

Colorado is going to be there give me a sense of the what you're looking forward to hear John you're the you're anywhere you are ...\nAh well last night I started watching that game that they and I fell asleep\nAt the time which I Do and I wake up some idiot called me up at midnight or something oh wonderful [laughter] yeah so I put\nThe game back on and watch it so one forty five or whatever it was and I saw the whole last half of the game\nAnd they Raj doing the events and they ride is a tremendous amounts or I think if you're a baseball fan yeah that was you everything about what's going on yeah getting what the hitter ought to do and the cubs can't that you know they just they got one Ron each for the last two games on\nThe season's over in ...\nHe said well when he was on the axe some joke story was managing and the playoffs they'd come back in after each other and they get to the drug and Joe Torre it'd be standing on the upper stuff and they say the guys\nWhen they can then don't go big grow small when you go small big things\nDon't try to hit a home run ball the opposite way make contact just try to go to base that ... that's exactly what Colorado good in that last in Russia it it it bank score the run when the gang\nAnd starting to my my aunt Samantha products for your Red Sox who are\nOn believable cricket team\nI don't know any of the exchange rate is while in

deal you can't be we're relying on a blueprint a blast yeah you have to really on the loans and that's why the games are so excited from the first pitch on\nSo apparently um the judge has a pretty good a command of the popularity out there right oh\nAbsolutely yeah um and I think that that is true [noise] um and you know there are certain people that think that he's fine even if he abused women because\nThat's just what people didn't is now my concern frankly and I know you will agree with me as his nastiness which got up now a lot of people say he's under pressure but I think he still has a drinking problem\nI I ...
