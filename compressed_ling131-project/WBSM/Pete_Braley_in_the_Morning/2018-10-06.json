juice bars and uh what was the one people's pressed so think\nThings are changing along those lines maybe it might be a good idea to add a category at the chowder fest that would fit that need we also brought up today the price of an oil change\nI Am\nObviously I I can see the the tea leaves\nAnd the tea leaves are telling us that people are making more money per hour than let's say five or six years ago even the state's minimum wage has gone up and next year it goes up more eventually uh it is going to probably hit Fifteen\nDollars per hour we can expect that to to happen\nBut its people make more money they seem to be spending even more\nAnd it was evident\nEarlier this week when I was with the a good friend of mine and uh she needed to get an oil change or thought she needed to get that's another thing enough itself she thought she needed to get it and will change and\nThe prices range from sixty to to Ninety four dollars\nFor an oil change\nAnd apparently that's because\nShe was told she needs to use synthetic oil\nNow I'm not sure how much it's necessary and um you know I I'm certainly not the the expert on synthetic versus natural oil or or what vehicle needs to have synthetic I that that's not me but\nYou know the most\nI've ever paid for an oil change was twenty nine Ninety nine plus tax\nAnd they think that an oil change today could cost me\nSixty dollars just say sixty that's a huge difference over the amount of times you get an oil change or are supposed to get an oil change during a calendar year that's a lot more money out of your pocket same thing with cable now we don't need cable but we we like cable we don't think that we can live\nWithout cable TV cell phones to look at all of the different expenses that we have claimed to over the past decade plus and\nNo matter how much more money you're making my guess is if you start to add up most people in the so called middle class are spending\nMore than what that\nThat income is especially after taxes we spend more on taxes and it just about anything else size zero eight nine nine six zero five hundred hello\nBrian I'm learning right\nFor first of all I Would just like to express my condolences to the solve your family passing a rouse song you know one of the greatest city council was a that ... are represented us in the city of\nNew Bedford I think I Know you went around what he was an operation like this guy probably protected the taxpayers more than any other city councilor in New Bedford history\nIt's well I Wish I got to meet him\nYeah I mean he was a great guy [laughter] ah he he he was Republican conservative or as you know as nonpartisan ... in the city or if you're an elected official but you just simply had away\nOr with words and we had a is a pencil shop and if you will when it came to the city budget that not a nickel go buy them or without\nProper huge so I I mean a a you know so anyway we'll start with those condolences or the second piece that I'd like to talk about just real quickly is what I Do understand about the Kavanaugh investigation is why they were a a list of people\nAre in the second case uh their marriage case that we're not interviewed by the FBI or not and I wish she\nUh so the second case just got pushed aside or I don't understand why the FBI would do that or the narrow scope of the uh ordered investigation by the White House ah which is a bit too narrow for my like now I'm\n... what can you do in a week\nWow I mean you you got a bunch of people and you figure the primary uh area would be um miss Ford and the secondary area would bit of ... when you skip the third because it was too bizarre but the the idea is they\nHad a list of people they they were asking the FBI\nTo come and and look at this off and that was reported by Christian I'm a poor and her investigators uh and uh the FBI never responded to ...\nI I think that that that that's going to be the black guy in the long term and the short term is going to get a loaded and today I Believe that's going to happen after the vote a on clothes yesterday\nYet uh I I agree with you do you think that\nThat's been a change in the November ... election are in favor of the Democrats\nAre I think if you were whether Republicans a one a particularly in rural areas is going to depend on the female vote and how that response comes on election day\nUh other than that uh I happened to be opposed to cap it off because of his presidential powers you\nAnd uh with the president is above the law so let's play it out let's say a ... or ... dykes to president uh for obstruction of justice and they appeal it all the way to the Supreme Court\nGuess who's going to be sitting there saying you can't indict a president while he was in office that's got to be his statement he said it before is written papers\nIt he has and I don't know how much you've listened and obviously you can't hear every minute of every show even on on on a windy\nToday but this guy has also written and spoken against the due process laws yeah so\nI you know I've I've got a huge problem here are not withstanding any of the accusations allegations he\nSaid she said but right there in black and white his votes his comments his writings tell me he is not going to uphold and defend the constitution\nIt seemed that way right but you have to remember by this goes back on a thirty year when by the new conservative movement that words are negotiated back when Gingrich was in office Richards what they want to do and they're throwing a lotta deflection\nTo the public eye and President Trump is a perfect guy\nDue to present this under the radar\nAnd what's been happening if you look at one point four trillion tax cut people have to remember that money was taken out of the federal budget now they've got covered to say well we're gonna have to cut entitlements we don't have any money they've already given it to the billionaires\nAnd it's going to affect people's Medicare Social security education everything so\nThey're on their way and uh there's some fortunately or it's going to give them a now complete a jurisdiction over the judiciary\nAnd has the uh the uh the folks that are funded by the Koch brothers keep manufacturing cases ... brought up to the Supreme Court we're gonna wash that to show Citizens United becomes an issue in the long\nTerm I think you're right hey
