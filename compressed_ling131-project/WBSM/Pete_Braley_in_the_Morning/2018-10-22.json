the south from from hazel park north to Brooklyn park the the the two ends of the cities where we're still\nSparsely populated so you had you know and about half the size of the city roughly half the size of the city from even a larger population than today about twenty percent more and uh it was it was the kind of\nEnvironment in which disease might or might spread in a dead some seven hundred or so people died as a result of the Spanish so just in a matter of months most of them in their twenties and thirties\nAnd all that just a huge calamity ... if you can imagine something like that happening today it would it would be catastrophic butter which that's so over luck because of the war because it's a way though was recorded during the war\nI and so you know I I I say all of us just because it's always been a you know fascinating topic to me and something real key chapter in New Bedford ... a history and I wanted to bring you into talk or what\nAbout ... what was happening or do we just were that foundation what what um you know tell us a ... you know set the scene in October of a on a tour of Nineteen Eighteen and one was like to live in New Bedford and what was unfolding\nWell you're right it was it was a very dark time actually a mayor was um [noise] you know if you think about it the average person was\nReally only got their uh their information from you know from newspapers and from from word of mouth from a you know hand bills stuck to a public buildings um [noise] and so you think about it the average person was hearing about you know unexpected mass unexpected death\nAcross the seas due to war and here due to the flu pandemic\nHe just never know knew from day to day who is going to be alive or not uh so it was it was a really dark time uh I bother to look up you know some of the statistics in the\nCity's health reports and uh it was an unprecedented at the time the chairman of the health department was docked in demand in the home we've named demand in middle school Lewis demand and and ah he reported that um in a it was unprecedented actually they've never had numbers like this\nSince they had been keeping records um uh he reported twenty nine a hundred deaths in the bedroom for that year for Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd over the twenty nine hundred fourteen over fourteen hundred were uh in the last four months of the year so clearly you know that was flu related [noise] and uh so they put the new bet the death rate at twenty four per thousand highest ever recorded\nUm and on this day in like Washington in Baltimore there were headlines that\nUm undertake has had run out of ... confidence because of the flu pandemic and you're right about uh you know we had tenements filled with you know large families um [noise] you know sometimes seven eight nine ten people living on the floor\nVery very dense living conditions\nAnd there were other factors too like milk you wouldn't think but you know we had milk inspectors at the time there was a lot of issues about milk sanitation um\nAh that they had just begun putting in regulations about a public um milk for sale or to the public had to be in glass bottles before that the milkman would come and he you know he'd have a large jug and he'd he'd fill your heat fill your picture\nA and sometimes milk or was never was not refrigerated from farm to to tenement\nI'm so there was all kinds of bacterial issues and that was the vector\nUm they um it was on precedent that a New Bedford closed a close churches schools clubs theaters I'm due to the flu so there was a virtual shut down for a few weeks of a New Bedford\nThe um\n[noise] and tell us a little bit about what you know at the time\nYou know this is something that was happening and not just in New Bedford but but I Know where but uh there there was only really are trickling out of news for obvious reasons small some ... some not for obvious reasons or civil war was going on in\nThe attention was folks map but there are other reasons report had to do with a\n... there there are other reasons why news really wasn't going to want to get into that I don't want to\nAs do the war um the government did not want numbers getting out it wasn't only you know a civilians it was a soldier's dropping from flu pandemic they were crowded into ships and on battlefields um and in training camps and they were catching the flue and the government it's a you know\nI'm not only in United States but Britain and ah and France that did not want 'em the enemy to know how bad the flu pandemic was even though the Germans works\nSeeing it as well so they kept the numbers quiet or you don't see a lot of headlines but Spain wasn't involved\nIn the king of Spain came down with the flu so a lot of news about the flu is coming out of Spain so that's where we get the misnomer that it was the Spanish blew a people called it the flu from Spain but in fact that it wasn't that at all it was a true world pandemic\nSo we still call it the Spanish flu but um I think I'm a lot of our college probably have stories from their grandparents um about how the flu or impacted or their homes I Know in my mother's side we did I'm at a very elderly on who said\nThat uh you know the babies were kept by the stove I'm a where the air was dry there was so afraid that the kids would get the flu and so that was you know one particular thing that uh that they used to think would help but um it was clearly a very uh you know a very dark time you want\nTo I'm going to encourage them callers to call and I know there are lots of folks in the city who have\nHad grandparents are are parents who you know during that time um experience the um the flu and have a\nA family stories to share or there may be some people out there who's uh we're we're living at the time to be a hundred years old and that there is we know there are more centenarians are these days than ever so who knows maybe we'll hear some from them as as well of course\nAs a reminder the line is a nine nine six zero five hundred ... area code five zero eight\nI'm In my own I've ... I've done my own family connection um my um [noise] my great grandfather was a New Bedford police officers thirty one years old and he uh went into a house\nI Lived on cedar grove street in a house that's no longer there it's where the um the one Ninety five on raptors to one Ninety five west I unwrap ride ripe right at the end of cedar grove\nAnd he um thirty one years old and uh he he went into a two house though there were someone had been stricken with the with the flu and set to pull a body out basically and uh uh and then he fell ill\nAnd or any he died within within a week you know and here's a he was very typical of the victim said then that was just there was a hundred years ago this month and had three kids at home and you end up going into St Mary's as a result is very it was very traumatic uh from my grandfather and his siblings\nAnd my great grandfather was a typical of the victims in the sense that a ... it's the victims curiously enough for a with this disease we're all in the prime many of them were in the primary their wives usually think when we hear about\n'em when the Centers for Disease Control give out warnings these days about a flu strains that usually targeted at those who are typically most the ... as physicians would say immuno compromised rights of the the the elderly\nUm children pregnant women and so forth but the ... this disease was sort of the inverse in the sense that\nMany of the victims were in their twenties and thirties and the prime ... uh the prime of their lives and that's the case of him and he was a you know by all accounts a and it was a police officer and he was a\nA an athlete does this strong strong guy and this and they are proud of his life and they were struck down by by this and what you know these days would be called the line of duty deaths for a police officer\nOr but there are many folks like that so if you have police officers who are dying as a as a result of it I don't know if there any other ones and the police department who died at the ...\nOn but you can imagine just how disruptive or it was a you know the sort of talk a little bit Arthur a few words about how\nUm how how this structure to city services what things were shut down things were disrupted in in ways that today would be you know just a world where would be really unsettling\nYeah well they I mean there was a certain amount of a paralysis in the last part of October due to the flu as I said the city or in most New England cities had also um [noise]\nYou know I'm adopted the order to uh to close schools churches you know church services theaters club saloons Bill Bill you know there's a lot of billiard rooms back then\nAnd um and so a bowling alleys anything republic met a including markets but people had to eat so I'm you know supermarkets were not they weren't supermarkets they were they were small markets were were a problem and and ah they restricted public funeral so\nIf you're a great grandfather had a funeral was private [noise] it wasn't a public funeral\nSo and this went on a for a few weeks um the school department or went along with the order to close schools but you know they argued that gee well whether the kids are home or whether they're in school there you know\nYou send them home to the tenements a lot of the mills were closing\nIt's just useful for us to think back a about that it's a part of your veterans past it's a part of you know we\nAre as as a city and it just it's a\nService important that we talk a little bit about that today where we're going to do is going to go to the break and come out of the break in the open up we'll talk some a little bit more of an impossible\nQuestion in the day which as you might expect is going to be New Bedford based\nUh

we're talking about this in this segment we're going to be talking about education we talked about education a great deal and a half for a while because of a\nA um it's it's one of the most important things that need the not the most important thing that we do\nAt a at in local government and in New Bedford yeah we over the last few years there's been tremendous work I've done in our school department to uh to really modernize or an effect modernize the place where the school department for many years had\nA struggles and uh oh we've got about the business of\nOf uh of turning it around and there are tremendous signs of a turnaround happening it's as we all know it's not an overnight exercise that they're you know there are challenges both financial and otherwise that were confront but um yeah the the work that is being done in the school system is a is\nEvery kid has a shot every kid has a an opportunity at a an education at the naval him or her to ah pursue what they want to pressure to pursue the American dream to make the most of their their talent and that's a our guest today is in the business\nOf throwing open the doors of opportunity especially the kids who haven't I'm having come from from march and so and that person again is or Darcy angst or the principal at a the James Congress school\nOn him walk straight a elementary school or some uh roughly four hundred students that\nI'm ... hit the ball out of the park um ah is folks have read or heard\nOf the communist school was named to a ... as one of the recently named one of the commonwealth\nFifty two schools of a recognition of combinations use me and uh so you know here you go you have this school that the only one in southeastern mass that was designated as as such one of the best elementary schools in the state but what's different is that\nYou know it's not one of these elementary schools from one of the you know wealthy suburbs of Boston it's in the south end of of the city and Seventy five roughly Seventy five percent of the students not actually a little bit more um roughly Seventy five percent of students who come from economically disadvantaged background to almost half\nOf the students in school speak English as a second language you know it's a school that is all of a hundred eleven years old that needs work as a month and reminded when I'm visiting the school have ... what about this uh\nUh but you know despite those challenges I'm\nIn the school scored an eighty fifth percentile and this and the state's accountability index and uh and it's widely recognized now is a tremendous turnaround and\nUm it's ... there was a lot of work that went into it and so I guess Darcy angst is is here to talk a little bit about how\nYou make that happen Darcy welcome to\nWelcome to my show and they keep calling just my chauffeur [laughter] well welcome to the Phil ... show 'em and uh\nAnd you're speaking to the junior varsity a a a host this morning ah but no I mean divorce that you've done has been fabulous the team has been fabulous you know I it would just be you\nKnow interesting to to take us through the paces you mean you were a you were a teacher and an assistant principal at Norman then and then you've got the principles job at a concert in a just a few years ago\nAnd there was a school at the time that was scoring in the bottom ten percent of schools I'm I'm a state wide and now it's it's a sit in and out of the park I how did you do it or do you and your team doing\nWell first of all thank you for having me a Condon teachers used to say my first year that we are kind of forgotten at school or that most people\nWho have lived in New Bedford especially where I live up in the north and I'd never seen it heard about it I didn't know where it was\nWhen I was told I was going to Congress I tried to find it and even with GPS I had a really hard time\nSo ... is uniquely sat inside the middle of a neighborhood you don't pass by um going anywhere you know in particular right not on a main round locked into the neighborhood you know right so\nAnd I think when they were saying we've been forgotten they obviously we're not talking about the location but they just really felt like you know I was the fourth principal in five years that there was a lot of turnover\nAs far as leadership went that that the staff had been forgotten the kids have been forgotten so that was kind of my first step to make them feel like they were valued that they you know that I really thought that what they do every day is very important so\nWhen I toured the building coming from doorman than this big beautiful new building I had the penthouse office on the third floor and then I couldn't get into ... and my first day because of these big ... the president gave that were padlocked and there was some trash stuffed inside\nAnd I just got the sense that this is not an elementary school and maybe they had been forgotten so the first step was to call downtown when I call or email now they're like oh gosh what does she want\nBut we got those prison gates down we painted the doors as just a symbol of there's hope here we can do this despite a lot of
