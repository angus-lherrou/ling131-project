tragedy for\nWe're both families but um the thing that really struck me as this investigation goes on\nAnd we had a Senator Jeff flake who said hey look we we can't just have a he said she said we we've got to let the FBI look into this further and so they're doing that now and we're getting some of these random\nMedia reports that are that are raising eyebrows you know the bar fight and maybe they won't most\nTelling aspect of what life in political Washington is really like I don't know if you saw sixty minutes a Sunday night\nI'm Scott Kelly I think that's his name the CBS correspondent yeah he had the Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona and the Democratic Senator Chris Coons\nOut of Delaware ... they're the ones who reached across the island or the created the emperor this for this a weeklong FBI investigation and ... he said to flake who is retiring from the Senate said to him if you were running for reelection\nGood to have done this and flake said no way and then yesterday flake said there's no incentive to reach across the aisle now the way he and Coons did he said you do that now in your opponent\nUses it in his campaign ads so this reflects the pressure and the sheer\nOf this whole process you wanna\nSearch for the truth about the Supreme\nCourt nominee okay but you do it at your own political risk you face not only pressure from the other party but from leaders of your own party who want you to toe the party line both parties both and that's why both flake and who comes\nIn in separate interviews said the exact same words in public this country's being torn apart\nSure absolutely torn apart not just by the nomination of one man who may or may not be telling the truth but because sheer political muscle shadows this whole process junk lining up by tribe not necessarily by what they actually believe\nYup Yup I will tell you this that regardless of what comes out of the expanded FBI investigation Michael it will do absolutely no good do I'll

as a choir boy a you know that that doesn't hold up at all they're describing him\nAs a means belligerent sloppy drunk we didn't tell the Senate committee the truth you know look we've\nWe've we've all you know had crazy stuff happen to us in high school and college that we we'd like to think how why did I Do that including drinking um get\nWhy could he not have said listen I worked so hard in

anymore\nI'm fifty three years old I I understand that now\nI Hope you understand that you did stuff I did stuff with part of the growing up process that's not the picture he paints that are from self and I believe\nThat was a mistake on his part of because now\nThey're throwing in\nThe drinking as a way of saying I'm well maybe that's why he doesn't remember of these\nSexual allegations that are being made now and now they're speaking with this that'd be Ramirez who says\nThat the Trump I I'm Sorry that covered all exposed himself to her um when they were in law school um if it's\nIt's very
