have to start young\nAnd that uh that age group ends at thirty six\nIf you can get the twenty eight to forty four year olds I'm I've been this isn't a scientific thing when I give the ages like that you need to start attracting those people because they are the future homebuyers\nBusiness owners\nAnd they're going to be the one spending the money on on families furniture et cetera et cetera entertainment\nAnd I I Love the crowd that I see it to see I really do that because basically there are a lot like me\nWell I don't have gray hair on top of my head because they don't have any here

told you about this place and it is you are what you eat went inside pretty nice place\nAnd\nAs I I look at it and I and I said to myself as a lot of open space here what are they trying to do what they're trying to do is bring in people with what they different type of menu they are vegetarian\nAnd partly vegan vegetarian and partly vegan\nThey have a small salad bar they have smoothies\nJuices sandwiches\nYou're not going to find any meat and I love\nYou know I I was kind of happy because I'm allergic to Jesus and I was looking around and I didn't see any\nCheese on display innocent or right now that's a personal preference as opposed to anything else but I was I was pleasing least surprised at what I saw in there they also\nI'm not trying to put them in the pa narrow bread category here but they have an area where you can\nCome in and and have a business meeting I I think partly what they're trying to do and the owners are uh one is a vegan mother and the other one is a vegetarian daughter or it might be vice versa on the vegan vegetarian\nTwo female owners and they've also opens up a section\nWhere mothers can bring their children in and there's a little play area\nThese are the kinds of things that are catching that we talked earlier about having Venus that reached that millennial crowd well\nYoung mothers are are part of the millennial crowd\nAnd for those that are working from home and maybe ... you don't want to have a business person at your house and you have a child\nThis type of place that you can go and have a business meeting let the kid playing this little play area where you can still keep an eye on her or him or hymns or their hers or the whatever they cross section to be and also\nSo again it's it's on William street is not a commercial with the place by the way some William street\nAs um you go down past Julius boutique so if you think of pleasant street heading toward the uh or think of city hall go across the street

what are the difference\nBetween a vegetarian and uh ... what is it different\nMy understanding is that with the vegetarian is you don't eat meat however the vegan not only does not eat meat but there's no animal product\nIn ... in what they eat so you won't find a for cow cheese or goat cheese because it comes from an animal they usually won't have milk because it comes from an animal eggs because the country when animals\nCome from mostly goats isn't it\nI don't ...

was she was listening because she was really interested in what role and had to say\nBut what I have noticed watching Megan Kelly whether it's during the debate with President Trump\nWhen she has been

[laughter] what else do we do wrong look what you got going on now\n\nSo I I I'm not going to go out on a limb and\nSay that Kelly did this to try to hasten her exit and get the big by out 'cause she's got a lot of millions coming to her\n\nI Am saying that this is a convenient story at a very convenient time\nThe Central American caravan another one of those very convenient stories I'm not

twenty twenty five miles fifty miles away from the border\nI Would say yes you better be prepared you don't know exactly what's going to happen\nWe're talking over a thousand miles away\nWalking most

Michigan or something that was a fraternity that had a like a gangster party and they got kicked off campus for\nThe I'm going back a couple of years ago maybe ... remember recall no no I remember the story\nI Would defend them um because they have every right to do it why not we've got to get over this stuff and then I ...\nWell you know you you you ... do they have a right to do it yes but it also goes without saying that the college university has a right to kick them off the campus for doing it\nSure but I mean I I Would rather encourage black fraternity to do a truck you're white Knight\nNot the same as it's not the same mind well because\nHistory history history shows that when white people dressed as black they wore mocking them\nOkay now you you were\nDressed as white they're mocking them to\nSay again\nOne black people would dress up as a\nWhite ... now but it and it's not a derogatory it's not a derogatory it's not historically derogatory\nThat's that's the thing\nWhy not why not allow it to be um\nAllowing it to be allowing it to be is it is one thing what happened\nIs not\nAnd the fact of the matter is when white people were white men in particular dressing up as as black men they were trying to portray something that really wasn't true\nThat's true and and what happened with that is that's read\nTo the point that people really believe that what the the white people mocking the black people love real black people were really liked that that's not going to happen with black people going out in white face\nYeah I mean it was [noise] I I guess I just I look at it through a different way than\nI Am what would you do [laughter] of course you do\nAnd that is what the whole whole bit about this is you're looking at it from a different lens I'm not saying your lenses and incorrect Lynn's it but you're looking at it from a different side of the street because you haven't been on this side of the street\nRight but I mean I maybe it's an innocent enough thing you want to turn to you you know post poke jokes or you know um\nBring some humor into ... how you perceive\nOther people comedians to it you know um\nI I don't just innocently I don't see a problem with it but it but I Do understand now the historical perspective of it so maybe the blackface is is the wrong way to do it but\nHonestly like you remember a Jamie Kennedy in or was it\nAh ah\nThe gangster them like he was a Malibu gangster now who's most wanted you remember that movie you know\n... ... oh my God oh there are other callers you probably remember that movie but it was basically about a white rich\nWhite kid who thought he was like a black gangs and it ... it was all comedy it was freaking hilarious you ought to check it out sometime but uh it's just it's it's not offensive\nTo anybody if you really look at it I Would say like well\nWhat once again in it and I brought this up what is ... to one may not be offensive to the other ... and here's the other side of that coin if if we look at two sides can when someone is getting paid good money\nTo do that portrayal\nThere is a different understanding at when a professional is doing it compared to a bunch of amateurs\nTrue\nTrue that's true um yeah I got ya me well All right movement on before I don't want to take up the phone from everybody but a right to the male bomber\nMy my opinion on it and I'll make it quick and I'll hang up and all that other people call the male bomber he was either a complete idiot or it was a set up for both [noise]\nNow what do you mean by a set up the you know it's certainly if he did it he's a complete idiot and and I think you when many of vote on that but what do you mean by a set up\nThe patch and he was the blame is placed on him to cover up for something else I'm so somebody else did it and blamed it on him\nThat's a possibility I I call it a convenience I don't not everybody can hear every minute of of every show but it's very convenient that this incident is happening basically two weeks before the midterm elections\nAnd also happening at a time when the stock market is crashing right in front of people's face and it replaces it from a from the uh top agenda the news\nRight right it's it's a distraction and it's it's way too convenient but see I\nI just I don't um I don't believe this guy acted alone one I don't believe that uh I don't\nBelieve all those stickers have been on his then for more than a couple of days because there's been a forward a son and stuff like that fades I'm there to too many holes in the story I mean there there is no post marks on the envelopes so they couldn't have gotten far at all they couldn't have gotten past that the post office she put them in\nSo let me let me ask you something how do you know there are no pulse marks on the on the lips\nThey've been showing the envelopes\nThey've been showing the pictures there'll be on the front end back six dance ... they put them over the stance\nOh that's right that that that that my ... [noise] yeah well they step\nOver the stance that you can't reuse them um but none of those envelopes have them I don't think\nThey ... they they weren't sent\nWell if I have to go back over the stories because now now that you now that you're you know sometimes you have to read a story five six seven times in order to to really ferret it out right and I don't I don't know I don't know that any of the packages\nAnd were delivered no so but it doesn't mean that they weren't address\nRight okay I mean we're I don't know where they were kicked off yeah like what what facility found them\nWell but they would all have to be in the same vicinity wouldn't they wouldn't they all have to have come or they may not have all camp or come from the same Orlando lift and I'm just going to use that ... post post office but once they get stamped\nL. or until they get stamp they don't move from that post office to another post office or into a truck or wherever they are they may go into a letter carriers bag right until after they've been stamped\nYeah that is just to sit there and um my son's nagging me as well as you get off the phone with you but uh and there's just too many holes in it to just take it more the way that they're putting it out\nAnd say well if that's the case who do you think is doing the setting up because a lot of people were saying oh this is one of those things Trump is probably doing\nThe Trump has nothing to do with ... says nothing to do with it it's definitely a whack job for one side of the other the but who knows maybe it's a maybe it's a I don't know maybe it's black block\nI don't know All right man thanks [laughter] I Do appreciate like oh five zero eight nine Ninety six zero five hundred\nPeople a\nLot of people are are speculating

I'm listening to you in ... and it it's\nA harrowing\nSo familiar hurling so for me to what I also hear about the folks coming with the American to help somebody that's pass out in the streets Katie Murphy is our guest use a registered nurse she is with the yes on ballot question number one\nSize zero eight nine Ninety six zero five hundred hello you're on with our guest\nHi um I have been a registered nurse for thirty four years uh before that I worked at sacred ... nursing home all through nursing school high school as a nurse's aide um my daughter is a nurse my nieces a nurse\nAh my back is a mess because the nursing which I I didn't even realize I fought I use proper body mechanics the whole nine nurses are so short staffed and no one realizes this except for the nurses\nUm you know I saw the whole thing on the New Bedford guide I was so upset how they hit nurses against nurses therapy against nurses\nIt's it's really sad because the nurses are so busy taking care of the patients that they never have anyone to be a voice for them and finally we have to go to the the general public to say hey please help us\nI have been oh I I I haven't been to the point where I have been totally burnt out\nWill really we have so many patients\nAnd you can't there's there is no before we had primaries can nursing and I have to tell you that was the best time because we knew a patient we we saw their skin we took care of them head to toe and then we had ordered what you've who helped us to pick patients up\nEverybody's breaking their backs how many people are out because they have not enough help to pick up these people um [noise] everything now\nIs you can we let her answer I mean I I I you where you are you going with those who say\nThat the the management makes so much money I mean if you look at it they had a whole thing and I think it was the Boston Globe about how much money and south coast the EL was one of the top ones they ... they are so top heavy and\nThe nurses have become like slaves\nAll right thank you recall I Do appreciate it go ahead or Judy I bet you agree with her\nOh well you know a thank you very much for your comments um it's it's nice to hear about a whole family of nurses I Will say it's the best job in the ...\nIt certainly is one of the toughest and I think um one point that our caller made is that it's also dangerous for nurses which you know really is not the primary part of this but I'm patients are sicker patients are certainly larger these days\nAnd she is right um nurses are becoming harmed\nMore and more frequently and and that certainly is I'm a part of this bill\nBut um I think that she makes the point that the CEOs are making enormous amounts of money and our point is there this is the industry in Massachusetts has a twenty eight billion dollar industry that money should be at the bedside taking care of patients\nYou know she she alluded to the article I think it was either in the Boston business thrown all over in the Boston Globe which talked about the multi million dollar compensation packages of CEOs\nI nobody objects anybody making good salary we really don't but you can't say that you can't afford to\nHire nurses when you're paying that kind of compensation and just look at the money spent by the hospitals and it is just the hospital industry funding the no campaign\nWell I I Would I Would say this to you I'm I ... you talk about a lot of money being made by the CEOs and I'm sure they're they're lieutenants and whatnot so what has happened in the industry to be\nI guess was licensed practical nurse COPD in um why are there more LPNs why not seeing age do pick up some of the of the slack or that that nurses are are seemingly still doing\nYou know the the whole health care team is very important and we couldn't do without any of them but when you are in the hospital as I said you're sicker than ever and you really need a\nAn educated trained professional keeping\nAn eye on you ... patients are sicker than ever as I said no one's in the hospital unless they really need that nursing care and our aids and our tax and every part part of the health team are very very important but they can't ... they're not educated or trained to do the work of a registered nurse\nFive zero eight nine nine six zero five hundred hello Europe next week Judy Murphy\nHigh high I got a question I and candy candy stripers\nI'm a a few questions here are they all volunteers um is still around oh well that's a good question and she she can answer that one first [laughter] and and that's how I got my start [laughter]\nOkay and loved it and how I I was in high school I absolutely loved it you know I Am lucky enough to work the night shift so I certainly don't see\nVery many volunteers in the hospital at night I Believe there are volunteers in the hospital during the day but I don't know if there are candy stripers but maybe in a um smaller hospitals there are now but I but there certainly are volunteers I think that um there there's a a volunteer group in in every hospital\nThat your your next question please\nWell uh I I was I just was interested in it and I thought maybe I might might have ... a prize somehow 'cause I don't I could walk to the hospital and uh you know I'm a I'm a senior and uh I'd like to do some good\nUh Judy quickly is there any way that you can volunteer what would you suggest\nOh totally said just contacting your local hospital there is always a place for volunteers in the hospital always and I think that that would be a wonderful\nThere are five zero eight nine nine six zero five hundred last caller for I guess Judy Murphy hello\nHi Katie Hi hello Hi can I mean I what I wanted to tell you are asking I when I was and they said they didn't want to open up the feel that's why they didn't hire a lot of nurses\nBecause then the wage would go down and that's why they make it so tight with um accepting nursing students in that field is it true\nYou know I think that um salaries these days are either bargain or else hospitals um I tried to be competitive even if they are not um even if they're not a union hospital they try to stay competitive\nFor track the most talented nurses and I think these days you know maybe when you when I started there weren't as many professions for nurses for women and that women can go into a lot of professions so I think that um\n... in the workplace is trying to make it more attractive to keep 'em ... Web and going and men certainly it's a it's not a women's profession anymore so\nI yeah there are quite a few in fact the the Gaston after you is is a male nurse Katie I Want you to give me thirty seconds of\nOf why somebody should vote yes on November six\nI absolutely think you should vote yes on one on November sex for patient safety vote as if your life depends on it because it very well Nate\nThank you very much kitty I Do appreciate your time and having you on the show today thank you very much I enjoyed it thank you Katie Murphy she is a registered nurse\nYes on ballot question one she works AT Metro west and also at Brigham and women's\nFor use on the scene for you\nKnow why spend thousands of dollars on expensive ER business more weight our is waiting for urgent care what your feeling ill discover a much better way to wellness discovered videos bone doctors with video phone doctors you can talk to a board certified doctored by\nPhone or video twenty four hours a day seven days a week whether you're at home work we're traveling up to Fifteen thousand doctors can diagnose and treat many common non emergency health problems it's necessary begins and prescriptions to your pharmacy in fact they've held millions of members get better\nAnd was an average wait time of justice ten minute video loan doctors provide care that's both can be a portable video phone doctors at seven seven tour for seven three eight by three\nThree one small monthly investment gives your family on limited doctors calls seven seven four seven\nThree eighty five thirty three and on line that\nVideo phone doctors dot com [noise]\nLet's see she's children's research hospital we're fighting against childhood cancer every day at the heart of\n[noise] it's it's such a rigid and and kind of a dogmatic and the way you go about finding hospitals for this effort\nAnd think about almost any time there's bound to be some nurses that are going to be ill along with other patients they call in on their shift and we have to try to figure out how we're going to take care of these patients to meet this ratio it's extremely difficult\nOne thing that I've\nNoticed the throughout the years uh bring this up during another show is\nEven when we had Obamacare Romneycare before that medical bills keep going up up up and up and I'm reading here now this is from the secretary of state's office writing this\nThis proposed law may affect both state and municipal revenues and expenditures which state owned hospitals are required to expend between an estimated sixty seven\nMillion eight hundred thousand dollars in Seventy four million eight hundred thousand dollars annually to comply with the proposed law that the state of saying this so it's not your side saying in it and it's certainly not\nThe the yes side coming out and saying something like that is that just to add more nurses well and to comply with the law\nUm it it yes because the way this bill is written it's this ratio has to be mad at all times so when you start thinking about a nurse or that needs to coffee break or to their lunch breaks you have to provide an additional staff member for that\nAnd the other thing that's that's concerning about this bill in the strict ratio of like that surge being that one to four adult times\nDuring the day shift there is a an increasing amount of work load for the nurses to get done you got a lot of antiques and then uh the ... you know a ... months ago on with that patient coming in surgery at cetera going on usually\nYou've named things start to settle down into the nighttime the workload is less this bill does not allow you to accommodate for that it is strictly a one to four ratio at all times\nSo I ... I mean that you're seeing one to four but that might be the emergency room and some other areas the ratio is hired I don't know that gets lower in in some of the other areas but it seems if you're in the maternity ward it's different if you're in ICU stiff it\n[laughter] [laughter] you know I I\nI said this numerous times I'm going to say it again I'll learn more about it but it's very very confusing\nYeah the reality is patience acuity does vary depending on where you're located so if a patient were to come into the emergency department we do try to redo accommodate for patients with high acuity in some with Laura cute or you can have patients coming in with the acute mile cardio ... or maybe a trauma type ... them\nAnd then you also have those come in with them maybe a sore throat so you know you do accommodate for that acuity in the same thing in the family centered where there's labor and delivery going on or in the war and and we accommodate for that now\nBut you say we I Am thinking south coast health I'm not necessarily thinking metro west health or was through general or or where some of the other hospitals that is there a chance that some of these hospitals are meeting the need\nI think there's always a challenge to try to do that there's about one thousand two hundred estimated date a deficit of nurses in the state of Massachusetts at this time\nWhy because I mean it's it's it's a pretty decent profession I mean I don't like blood you wouldn't give me to do something like that but um it pays All right I ... you know you're not going to become a millionaire or being a nurse but it's financially rewarding enough isn't it\nWell you know I think everybody could always make more money but show about compensation for nurses if you look at a as a profession is pretty is really good actually the benefits typically are very good compared to other types of occupation so I'd say we thought you'd be it is\nI think what's also happening as there is a large number of nurses I think I just read that it's like over fifty percent of the nurses are above the age of fifty we have a large number of nurses that are continuing to retire it seems like a kind of comes in waves\nOut when people are are seeking it as a profession but there's a large number of that are retiring and sold to the deficit is going to get even worse not better\nUm and there's just not enough of nurses going through the educational process to get the feel that vacancy bats today with if this bill is passed that's going to increase by three times the estimate is there's going to be four thousand five hundred nurses deficit in state of Massachusetts if this goes through\nTim Eisenberger he is the chief nursing officer over itself close health let's take some calls by zero eight nine nine six zero five hundred hello\nRon I'm Ryan or watch for Johnny Mae West Boyd Johnny around with Tim exam\nI'm I'm kind of on your side with this to me it seems like um\nWhere the where the comic citizen having health care costs are such an issue at all of our lives um it just seems like mowing nurses preparing you should be an issue that I think you know with the uh facilities the nurses work and the nurses themselves\nUm I think is mandating a law that the Saudis and the nurses have to walk or\nHave to conform to were just create more of an issue where we are more of a burden for the nurses and health facilities you know if these are your\nThere is a shorthand that facility and somebody or you know dies or or you know hurt real bad from it or something I I think uh I think it would get old enough for somebody would have bad PR and you know our capitalistic economy would take care of that there's no need for a wall or rule the come down\nUm that would be to the detriment to the\nTo the populace that all of us would have to suffer with higher health care costs and we don't even know if it's helping or not because interest so the individually it would be the judge of that you know\nI think you make the point let's hear from Tim thanks for the call\nYeah I I think he made some very good points first of all I'm\nEvery hospital has a a a team that help support patient care there's respiratory therapists they're slow bottom ie there's laboratory radiology technology is ... I mean that it's huge when you look at the number of people that help support care in the hospital\nHow you develop that team varies from hospitals at a hospital the ultimate goal is to take the greatest care of that patient that you can and I think that's the goal of every hospital you know I think every hospital has a little variation in how they approach that but\nBut isn't that part of creativity even in in medical care that hospital a to be doing a good job doing it one way in hospital be could be doing a great job doing it another way\nThat that's exactly right in the state of Massachusetts and I don't take my word for police look this up\nAlmost every I'm independent survey whether it's you know leap frog or others that ... that look at hospitals safety and quality Massachusetts ranks in the top five almost always\nThe last time I looked at Massachusetts rank number two in the nation for this and the only other state that beat us out was Connecticut\nSo we provide great care now um we don't need another bill that's that's guys are as helping to improve this we've got great carrying the state of Massachusetts who's pushing this this is a coming from the nursing union it's the masters the nurse association which is the union\nAnd they're the proponent of this um the other thing I'd I'd like to point out is that the union has been trying to propose this through legislation for I think Nineteen or Twenty years\nThe reason that hasn't gone through is because it's bad legislation is not the right thing to do for the state of Massachusetts so now this is becoming a public forum and it's extremely hard for the public to understand how we staff\nWay hospitals work the team work that goes into this and how that it's going to get affected by this yet along the dollars um I ... the estimates are about a bit a little over a billion dollars of increased costs and the first year that this has implemented in somewhere around like\nA hundred billion who's dollars tax dollars of who's dollars patient care of medical care dollars Medicaid dollars who's dollars\nIt's it's literally everybody I think is going to be affected by this obvious the hospitals are putting up the have to support this with that additional cost\nThat has to get passed on so the insurance is the state tax payers and everybody is going to be affected by this um and again you have to look at the need why is there a is a really in need to have an almost a little over a billion dollar increase in cost when we have great care at the present time I don't\nKnow I I we sing up I'll hold on because I I can keep going on with my my questions let's get to some of these calls ... really nine nine six zero five hundred Tim ... burger is our guest hello\nHi good morning the morning morning um I guess I won't for full disclosure I Am I'm a ... foot nation without co op over Thirty years\nI just want to thank you for bringing\nIt's the public's attention because it is a confusing do\nUm and the way you're explaining it ten is it's really good I I think you're doing an excellent job and I agree with you a hundred percent um\nThe the the way I Know [laughter] [laughter] I think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Pete Braley in the Morning", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "27"}
