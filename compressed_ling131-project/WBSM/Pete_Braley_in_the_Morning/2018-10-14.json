double your for us um [noise]\nYou bet for connected the name of the event and its plans for Wednesday October twenty fourth at the downtown YMCA\nJoining me to talk about the advantages Leslie pulling\nShe works for for for citizens and as a which is the chief sponsor really for this event and uh Jim McKay of mashed development and who was also involved with rice for homes which is another sponsoring organizations and really I think uh the foundation for this for this\nFor all of the different agencies and support organizations um in one place one location so that anyone who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless can attend the event and get the help that they need they can um\nUh be involved into different housing programs for shelter they will actually get health screens they will get dental checkups um say we'll have flu shots um at the event\nUm and we will also have donated hats and scarves that were needed 'em by a lot of the local Council on aging groups so we're very thankful for them for that\nUm they'll also be fed we're going to give them some food breakfast lunch um so and most importantly they'll be getting IDs those that qualify to get an ID or will be able to get a free id on that day\nOr so um that's a short synopsis of what happened that day\nUm but what are we done to ensure that the homeless population\nWill be your will show up\nWill be will be there and show up I guess my question because uh obviously transportation is a big deal here and I'm I'm you know some of these folks they may simply not want to be there for whatever reason a gym what some of the logistics behind getting folks to show I'm\nSure I'm One of the the first things is to make sure that all the service providers know about the event and that they can reach out to\nA you know their clients and the and the folks who who need to be there to make sure that they are they're so whether they um a lot of people do end up walking this downtown to the central location\nOr so it is near the the bus station um and so some people will arrive by bus a lot of people are by for it but then I'm there will be some of the agencies as well providing transportation so there will be a route that we've established throughout the city I'm In in to pick up people in a regular basis\nSo that will be a sort of continuous loop while the event is going on and uh people can be picked up for free um you know at those locations\nSo um those addresses if you will be provided by the providers as part of the homeless service providers networks\nAre ... so those locations are tend to be a key locations for a you know the the service provider so Packer are in you know in the north and a sister rose in in the south and um so you know some some key locations that um you know that that the population will know about\nThis event runs a nine to one is that correct correct here on the twenty fourth okay um and you mentioned some of the things that are available mhm\nUh once these folks arrive once the homeless folks arrive and ... it's an attempt really to help them in the media with some immediate needs was rich ... sharks or whatever you have those needs are\nBut it's not really I'm an attempt to also to reach out and say it's time to come in it's time to stay to kind of the weather's bad year yes it's a it's an attempt to kind of deliver that message is well isn't it\nAbsolutely Leslie yes yes I'm ... and like I said there'll be these agencies we have forty one agencies that are registered to be at the center service providers\nUm and it's everything from anyone who helped with addiction mental health they'll become friends a lot of social workers will actually be on site so seven hills will be there God's know to be there this year um but then we have the family center from the United way will be there doing the flu shot so there this is the one day where\nThey can basically come to one location and basically access all these different services to help them um basically get off the streets\nBut as we know I think the three of us know um folks are not anxious to get off the\nUntil they're ready to get off the streets and and that's a very difficult thing to get some of these people to come in and um so you've got some trained people there to talk to these folks and they'll be some uh people too\nThat you know share share the good word share them share the message\nThat's right yes and there and also to maybe relieve some of the anxiety about getting off the street I Know that there are some individuals who are you know having been in a in a shelter or um you know in a in a drawing place for for a long time I think that\nUm you know those are maybe a relatively few among the um you know the homeless population the unfiltered homeless population but\nThis event to is for people who are at risk of homelessness um you know people who are uh temporarily homeless as well\nUm so there are a lot of resources to help them get back on their feet as well um so it's trying to really um you know reach out to the entire ah you know community of people who are either homeless are at risk of homeless\nAnd then should be able to um you know get them to the services that they need in and provide a ways to begin to break down the barriers that might be preventing them from seeking additional help or seeking a permanent shelter\nUm so getting them the IDs this is one of the the you know the key things that will be offered during the event um that's important because you need a you know a Massachusetts id in order to access a lot of the services\nUm so being able to provide that is a is an important piece of this event and will continue to be\nUm the first time it was done in a twenty sixteen I Believe it was around I'm forty two um best ideas that were provided last year that went up to I think it was eighty or eighty eighty two\nUm and so you know we we hope to keep maintaining or those numbers and help

... schools just welcome to wall and I think you are right\nUm so first we'll start with a caffeine kind of give us an overview\nCaffeine what's the purpose of the resource and craft fair\nThe purpose of the fare has always been a way to get information out to our community um to help their families and meat\nAnd ah there's a lot of information that's going to be passed up that day um I understand there are a hundred and twenty five organizations participate in this a number that I saw some where\nIt's more than a hundred and forty six All right let's go to Mary Ann for just a second here\nMary in um what if some of the organizations they have the kind of a I don't want them all\nNo no um we have a wide variety of organizations that not just town organization\nIn a mall no no um we have a wide\nVariety of organizations the not just town organizations and then not just for the disabled um the town will be they're representing our youth advocate are VA benefits gentleman will be their board of health\nUm along with some of 'em the community resources of you know for the why I'm of Dartmouth they'll have a representative\nThey also will be having um Tommy's voice and the visiting nurses and visiting um rehab\nCenters so that's just a very small sampling of the number of reasons there but the purpose of this or that used to get information to people looking for information now\nPrimarily a special needs but also a lot of other things as well um\nThe factors parents with special needs children do need a lot of information and uh uh I can speak from experience and I know carefully you can to um once or your child was born there is a period of time\nWhere\nI won't say helpless but there's a feeling there of tree what do we do where do I go who do I turn to for help those kinds of feelings I think I'm I'm a parent of a special needs child and you are as well um that's all very real isn't it\nOh absolutely you know there's certainly an element of not knowing where to even start and so um and oftentimes those parents that need information the most are least likely because of the nature of the complexity of their home life due to the nature of their child disability\nOr the ones that may be the last in line to ask for help or which um is where this event comes in to play with her other things to entice them to arrive at the door I'm\nSo there's going to be people there was information on October twenty eighth of dark and high school from tend to three want anything from equipment mhm that you might need in your home\nUm special counseling tutoring um and there's also going to be Elizabeth town and she is going to be there\nTo talk about the school district ... to\nHelp\nAll students but students special needs as well um want to go ahead and tell us about that it was but what you'll Raj\nShore um so my role I work closely with the the pack and planning and organizing the event although they do\nI'm a bulk of the work and really reaching out to these organizations and gathering the resources\nBut on the day of the event I'm really there as a point person on behalf of the school department I'm I'm there from set up to to clean up so if people do have questions um they can come see me we do carve out a table in the space is representative of the ... public schools if people should have questions they can come and speak to me there [noise]\nUm I Will check in with other resources and make sure that everything is is running smoothly\nUm and like I said I'm just there to to you know assist anyone and\nMany of the ... again it's a big community event we want folks from all over the state to be there and visiting so many times families who come to speak with me or not diamonds residents but really have just general questions and are looking for some guidance so I'm there to answer those as well to the extent that I can\nThat's an important factor this is not just at Dartmouth only event now this is an attempt to help parents\nFrom all over all over the south coast\nAh to a kind of a\nCome in if you have some questions um because these problems are not just ... problems a universal mhm they're universal there in every community every child every city and this is a way to reach out and help [noise]\nSo what else is going on there I understand a one year I went there was some good easier mhm and that was very

you speak of how well your ordinary fakes will do\nAnd so that is kind of a true message there that we just received [noise] we have one more him before the message about washing the spirit and this week it's joy and that's you mustn't titles I Need the every hour\nA day or a\nNo\nNo no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no no\nNo no no no no no no I Know\nA a a\nA I'm a\nI'm a I'm\nA\nA a\n\nWell I have a man or\nThrow\n[noise] oh\nOh oh\nOh\nOh oh\nOh oh oh [noise]\nUh uh\nUh you\nKnow I\n\nKnow I\nDon't know oh okay\nSo here we are still in relations looking at the food at the spirit and that those who are influencing directed by the Holy Spirit will produce the fruit of the spirit in their life\nAnd just as a review from glaciers chapter five studying with versus twenty two [noise] but the food at the spirit is love joy peace long suffering ... goodness ate meat this Temperance against such there is no law so we are now on joy\nAnd we noted in the study before this that there is not a plurality of fruits but one fruit and I liken it to the idea of a fruit salad a fruit salad has ... usually has many different fruits in it because if it didn't and it would just be whatever fruit you put in\nAnd so we don't call it a fruit salad but a fruit salad because they all work together as one to have a taste that you need and watch [noise] so\nI'm only one proved that is made up of several intervened the interrelated graces of virtues all of which manifested well we have if we truly walk in the spirit\nProminent of course will be the virtue of wealth which we took first in our study\nAnd it was to find an active goodwill that which seeks the highest good fathers and\nI spoke about the fact that um this word that we used to live without pay is one that is an action word that we need to be ... active in our last not just um vocal in how we said we love people but we actually need to do something about it\nAnd it is that's exemplified by Jesus Christ who threw his example has taught us what love really is and I have a few verses that really talk about that in the first one is in John Fifteen verse Thirteen and scrape the love\nMan that is that a man lay down his life\nFor his friends and that of course was spoken directly by Jesus\nThen first John three sixteen hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for our breath or in\nAnd there should also be a universal motive for everything that we do and in Corinthians chapter sixteen versus fourteen assessed let all things be done with charity\nSo things like that seems to pass quickly\nSo with Paul we need to remember from Philip begins for each tells us to rejoice and the lord always and again I say rejoice and when you are joyful you will rejoice a failure to remember those things graciously given us\nWhich make for joy in our lives can explain why some Christians do not have the degree of joy flattened is delayed they should have\nBecause they're faking their joy on things instead of um [noise] on the things that they should such as um the care of other people and following in the footsteps of Jesus we need to remember what it is that produces joy\nAnd look at the sources of choice for the Christian joy is definitely a consequence of faith it comes from having a confident faith or confidence trust\nIn God and when we have this faith and trust in God that wherever we are in life is where we're supposed to be then we'll find life much more pleasurable\nAnd Philippe begins chapter one versus twenty five and says I'm having this confidence I Know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your further ends and joy of fate\nWithout faith in God in Christ we really cannot have an abiding joy and of course the biting means that is with us all the time it's really part of who we are\nWhat but why is faith is essential to joy first of all it spells the attitudes that prevent joy from occurring such as wary and I I think this is a a fault of\nOf many people I don't think they people look at it as a sin\nThey look at it as just who I Am there are certain people that wary about everything I'm from you know things that are especially things that are out of their control when you're worrying about things that are out of your control your just wasting your energy and were told not to wary\nAnd the sermon on the mount Jesus goes through um quite a few versus here which I'm going to read that tells you how even animals are taking care of and plants are taken care of\nSo let's read ... Matthew chapter six starting with first twenty five\nTherefore I say after you take no thought for your life what you should eat or what you should drink no yet for your body what you should put on if not the life more than meat and the body more than rain meant\nThe whole the files of the air they so not needed to every night gather into Barnes ... year heavenly father feed them or not much better than day which if you're by taking thought can add one cupid onto stature\nAnd why take he thought for rain meant consider the release of the fields how they grow they toil not neither do they spin\nAnd yet I saying to you that even Solomon and all his glory was not a raid like one of these where for\nIf God so close a graph of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shell he not much more clothes ... you oh yeah of little faith so here we have this wary and this doubt and fear often times\nAnd Jesus is telling us but why you worrying we take care of grass and birds and\nYou're worrying about what you need and and we're already on that we know before you what you need and what you\nWant so we'll take care of it don't worry and then in Matthew chapter fourteen\nHe Jesus is speaking on to the people and he's saying be a good cheer it is I Do not afraid she'd incidents set into him lord if it ... me come onto the on the water\nAnd he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship you walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began to sink he cried saying lord saved me\nAnd immediately Jesus stress worth of sand and caught him and set into him over to our little faith we're for did style doubt so here we see doubt coming in when I'm which kind of pushes joy out of our allies when we think that perhaps I'm not doing what I should perhaps\nUm I'm not where I should be you have these doubts in your mind but Jesus is always there with us leading us and directing us so this joy is based upon faith and this emphasizes the importance of the word of God in ...\nAnd joy because from faith comes the word of God so they've come by hearing and hearing by the word of God this word of God that we should be having a life daily produces faith and this fate intern turns to joy\nIn Romans chapter Fifteen it says now the God of hope\nFill you with all joy and peace and believing that you may have found in hope through the power of the holy ghost\nSo we're supposed to be filled with joy in the peace because they kind of go hand in hand the very teachings of Jesus are designed to give us joy because in his teachings he gives us hope for the future\nAnd if you think about um this life on earth as being something that is a short period of time I'm In comparison to the eternity that we're going to get to spend with with him\nThan you might think of things a little differently in John chapter Fifteen he's telling his disciples when he says these things have I spoken to you that my joy might remain in you and that you're joy you might be full and this really kind of tells me that as Jesus went about his life\nI'm preaching and teaching and healing performing miracles that he he was full of joy which kind of I'm kind of answers questions like why did people follow him why did they listen to him\nAnd I'm sure they were drawn to him because of his countenance and how he acted in reacted\nAnd how that he was smiling all the time\nI don't know about you but I tend to gravitate towards people that are pleasant instead of people that are grumpy and I'm I'm sure that Jesus was one of those people that\nWas joyful all the time even though you know he wasn't happy with sometimes with things that were going on around him and he understood the situation for for certain people yet he's still radiated a joy and contentment\nAnd in John chapter Seventeen he goes on to say and now come to the end these things I speak in the world that they might have joy fulfilled in themselves\nSo he's telling us disciples first of all that you know listen to me the things that have said they'll give you joy and I hope that this joy stays with you and then he tells them and I've also told the world about this joy and I hope that it remains in them also\nSo these words that we received from Jesus the examples that he gave us we need to make sure that we read and study them on a daily basis so that we too can produce this joy\nNow we also have as you know receiving joy it also comes from the results of being obedient\nObedience to the word of God fosters joy in the hearts because oftentimes when we are disobedient we find that we're going down the wrong path which leads us into difficulty and when we're in difficulty then we're not as joyful as we might be\nSo when we're following God's word when we're relying on his commandments to to lead our lives then we find that we certainly might be more joyful\nWe see an ax chapter eight ... version of a Samaritan it says Philippe went down to the city of some area and preached Christ and to them and the people with one accord gave heat on to those things which Phillip stake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did\nFor unclean spirits crying with loud\nThe amount of many that were possessed with them and many taking with praises and that we're lame and wear heels and there was great joy in that city so after Jesus descended into heaven he gave his disciples\nThe power to continue with the miracles that he had started and he also gave them the power to speak in a way that people listened and that many people um were converted and through the conversion had great joy\nAnd also as we continue on and this chapter of acts Philip continued on with the conversion of someone who was named as the Ethiopians unit in ... studying reverse thirty five then Philip open to smell and began at the same scripture\nAnd preached to him Jesus\nAnd as they went on their way they came on to a certain water and they UNIX said see here is water or hindered me to be baptized and Philippe set if ... with all find heart now may asked and he answered and said I Believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God\nA

M. presents ray land of the usa well through it's time to get your finances in order and money was darn snow\nGood Sunday morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to money wise brought you\nEvery Sunday Morning by usa wealth group [noise] imagine for a moment ladies and gentlemen\nIf that had been no Boston Tea party would we still be under the control of England run by a king\nImagine if we had no Roberts rules of order to run meetings can you imagine what meetings would be like today we had no Roberts rules of orders\nWell today our topic is going to be free masonry what is free masonry what is a Mason and it might interest is to know right from the very beginning that somewhere between one third and one half\nOf the members in the Boston Tea party which was a precursor to the American revolution which\nCaused our independence from the country of England between one third one half of the members of the Boston Tea party were masons and did you know that Roberts rules of order were written by a Mason and did you know that\nHe decided to write the first Roberts rolls of order he was a Mason because of a fight that broke out in a church the first Baptist church in New Bedford there was a fight and there was a really difficult time running the meeting and he decided he needed to write\nRules of order and rules of decorum for how to run meetings so he created Roberts rules of order right from our own city of New Bedford\nThings you didn't know\nWell this morning we're going to be talking about what is free masonry what is a Mason what do you have to do to become a Mason how old must you be and a lot of interesting subjects like that we have with us three distinguish guests first of all a attorney John marsala also known as ... Sala\nAnd he is currently master of the lodge of star in the East Village up on ... street in New Bedford for thirty five county street New Bedford\nWe have with is also Adam ... mental who's currently senior deacon of a starting these large as well and also a member of some other lodges were all members of of multiple lodges typically [noise]\nAnd we have with us and Russia are full Larry ...\nAh Larry as a past master of quitting his live in New Bedford and so first of all welcome my brother's\nUm\nShow what you believe in regarding a moral compass you're not able to um stand by your word sometimes I think is is is really the thought process\nSo right from the myth sonic literature actually if\nYou have to be a man of lawful age which is Eighteen of good report good reputation and will recommend it and you have to be able to profess a belief in God or a Supreme Being there has to be usually a single being but in our lives and starting these large for example\nAnd by the way of Larry although your past master of critic is large\nYou're also a member of starting these large turn on the east is actually my blue Iraq\nSo all four of us are um\nMembers of starting these large um\nBut we have and starting these large I Know we have a number of um Catholics number Protestants a number of Jewish members ah we have some Muslim members in our large and one of the things that I value most about our lodge in particular is the fact that there are so many different\nBackgrounds you don't have to belong to a church or temple or any of those kinds of organizations you simply have to professor belief in a single single Supreme Being which we call\nThe grand architect of the universe and the other reason that's important um is because when you take your oath to become a Mason you do so at an altar and you\nUse swear an oath of secrecy and loyalty and so forth and you do on the book\nOr that it's important to you can read the Bible it can be the car and it can be the Torah I'm ... and so forth the volume of the sacred law the volume of the sacred law thank you\nSo um it's not an organization that you must belong to a religion\nTo join and it's not meant just for Protestants which I'm at the beginning or in this country they're probably more Protestants than anything else but it's a very diverse organization\nAnd the other thing that I value I think probably most about I'm being a Mason is in large a and outside of larger if you're a Mason\nWe're all equals everybody treats everybody exactly the same you could have a higher rank but you're still um equal to everybody in the lodge as we like to say there's no higher rank and masonry than being a third degree master Mason\nThat brings to mind there's certain common terms that people here in everyday speech and one of those is on the level that's actually I'm a sonic terms deal it is when you're on that level with somebody or they come down on the level\nThat's um shows that we're all equal how about a square deal square deal I ... a third degree\nShe say you're going to give somebody the third degree weather\nIt comes from free masonry so a lot of phrases in words in our English language and our lexicon come from free masonry so being a stand up\nIndividual you have your upright individual also alludes from pre masonry as well and\nSo it's really important organization is very important historically in our country\nIt is important in our community um as I said I'm or maybe it didn't say already but a third of our presidents approximately were were masons and you know a J. P. talking about uh being equals and act on the level um [noise]\nWho was the president who came when addressed his lodge and he had to ask permission to speak was that ... you know it\nWas actually Teddy Roosevelt Roosevelt okay ... at the famous story is is that a Teddy Roosevelt um showed up at lodge and he went into the lodge room and he basically was\nJust a regular member there and the worship master who came down to talk to them was a his gardener it was hard it is yeah and so he he had the ... the president of the United states who holds the highest office here in this country\nHad to stand and ask permission from um his um his gardener now it's also just going back to Truman Truman\nWas visiting a lodge Truman Harry Truman was actually a past grand master of the state of Missouri\nAnd he was visiting the lodges president and the secret service was following him around\nAnd they attempted to walk and to watch with him at one of the secret service members or was it a a Mason the others were not and he asked the others to sit outside and they said but Mr President you need protection and he said no I'm going into the safest place\nThat can be I'm going to be surrounded by brothers you all have my back and uh that's another famous story that exists among the jury ... he'll tell you\nMy own famous story I was in a church to go to a funeral service as a matter of fact for the son of a a fellow Mason and um I had a medical event myself and I actually passed out in the vestibule are actually in the church I was carried out and I was in the vestibule\nAnd people were trying to figure out who I was I knew some people there and they're taking my wallet out of my pocket and they said do you know who you are and I said yes given my name and do you know where you are to justice is very embarrassing\nAnd they said there's anybody here that you would trust with your wallet and I said yes any Mason so that's how we feel about free masonry don't worry we trust each other we carry a each other's backs look out for each other's backs all the time very very important things\nI Want to give you a quotation I'm\nFrom Theodore Roosevelt I violate no secret when I say that one of the greatest values and masonry is that affords an opportunity for men of all walks of life to meet on common ground\nWhere all men are equal and have one common interest Theodore Roosevelt\nSo one of the things I like to do in my show is give quotations that I think are germane to the topic that we're talking about we are talking about the subject of free masonry so\nWhat we've said is that you have to be at least Eighteen years of age you have to be male or you have to be a recommended you have to be a good report you have to professor believe in a one Supreme Being a and then\nWhat's the process than to sign an application I'm Larry once you give us some information well\nIn our large uh the first thing we do is um we accept the candidate in for a dinner where he can get to meet some of the members of the lodge and a lot of the times of their rather surprised because they walk in and they meet people that they know and the first words out of their mouth is I didn't know you were a Mason\nAnd uh once they get over the fact that they knew masons all along and never really know what I'm we continue on with a pre application uh interview mhm to where we ask the person\nWhat it is about masonry that drew him to us what is it that masonry can offer him and what it is he can offer masonry as a new member\nUm because in masonry you get out of it what you put into it I'm just like anything else in life if you\nJoin anything club the fraternity and you do nothing you really get nothing out of it [noise] um so we encourage new members to get involved while we run him quite a few charities um we do quite a quite a bit of a philanthropic work and we want those members to get involved\nSo I'm once they've\nGotten past the initial interview\nThey're given an application they are a thoroughly investigated background investigation found a along with a a criminal background check and from there they are um profit for the lodge and voted upon by the membership and on whether or not they want to bring that person in as brother\nOkay so let's assume I'm Adam Adam preventable um who's our senior taken and starting these law just assume that somebody has been investigated they've indicated they want to apply now it's time for them to\nUm take degrees the how many degrees that they have to take to become a master Mason\nThere are three degrees to become a master Mason um you take them generally you take them one at a time I'm recently there has been to move in Massachusetts I'm\nComing up next year we can take all three degrees in one day like a one day cause they call it the one they clash and um do you go from being I'm\nNot number two full their degree mass may one day [noise] um [noise] but generally like I said you do them one degree at a time you started as an entered apprentice or as a first degree the second degree as a fellow craft and then the third degree you are matched Mason\nUm and it can take\nThree months it could take\nSix months if they want to spread it out a little bit mhm um there is some education that's usually involved I'm truly absorb what each degree is about um so that might put a little more time in there for somebody to reach the third degree\nOkay in fact England it takes seven years to become a nice and I did not know that yes it takes a significant amount of time or they have large periods between the degrees [noise]\nDifferent organizations different clubs within masonry that you can become involved right so some people tell you it's one night a month or it can be as many nights out of the week as a wine you can go and visit other lodges\nSometimes for for tuition traveling men so we have\nAn opportunity to visit any lodge in really any jurisdiction in the United states and around the world have you done it I I have\nI've ah traveled quite extensively I'm not so much in Europe I've I've been to lodge in Canada I've been to lodges in other states or I've been\nWarmly received by the grand lodge in Philadelphia and visited lodges there furnace I um had an opportunity to travel with um the most worship for grand lodge prince hall Massachusetts\nI'm as an ambassador of our grand lodge here in Massachusetts and have had a really great time and as as you said a brother wherever you are will reach out and do really neat things like I'd been in Philadelphia we have been taken out to dinner\nI'm by brothers in Philadelphia we've had a brothers open up their homes to us when we've been traveling on each lodge has its own unique culture its own unique flavor mhm um I I've traveled with Adam to different lives just as well and Larry may well and you\nYes and uh my one and only trip to Hawaii I did a little research before I went there and discovered that the week that I was going to be in my way\nThe grand lodge of Hawaii was going to be meeting in Hawaii to celebrate their centennial there one hundredth anniversary and at the time I happen to be a grand steward from grand lodge grand lodge officer so I got a letter of introduction from the ground secretary's office I took my ... with me\nI contacted the master of the large where this was going to take place ahead of time and I went to their ceremony and it was spectacular and they introduced me I was probably\nThat's traveling person by distance and I talk to them briefly about the important historical connections between New Bedford in Hawaii\nAnd I gave him the warm fraternal greetings of the grand master and it was really exciting to do something like that there was a lot of fun so you alluded to the fact that ... paid our lodges a visit when it came to visit I did yeah\nAnd not only that but a ... in Hawaii and history I'm a local Hawaiian became masons as well and then they split off and forms of a parallel sort of organization called the royal order of ... so they came to help celebrate the hundredth anniversary in Hawaii\nAnd they had members of the royal order of ... men wearing these beautiful decorative ... you know red and yellow and saffron robes and they came in singing Hawaiian music it was just amazing just would totally blow your mind to watch that so visiting the lodges is fun\nI've also visited the grand lodge in London when I was there there wasn't in session at the time I'm I've visited the lodges in Florida and been brought up to the east to sit in the chair because I was a past master my large and so it's fun to travel there are many benefits\nBut free masonry is not just about fraternal ism and having friends everywhere and having brothers everywhere it's also about charity so let's talk about some of the charitable things that we do that the public may not know about\nMany of the things that we do or to help children for example of a Scottish right has early learning centers\nUm that teaches kids with disabilities or learning a\nNew Yorker I does I research and in our local New Bedford lodge in our local starting to ease the combine lodges in this area put together an annual dinner for the homeless around of the time of a Christmas on\nWrote me also have our angel fun yeah which helps a cycle of whether the angel fund from it [noise] the angel fund will help um\nSupport children in need a particularly with a personal effects I'm you know\nClothing underwear I'm glasses glasses have become very very expensive and many insurance companies aren't covering them anymore and it's an ass and it's completely anonymous um it's run actually through the school systems in the principle of the school\nReaches out to our lodge um identifies um the need for whatever and we reach into the angel fun and uh we acquire that\nWhatever for said child you know I've I've uh put it in a recommendation at one point for a pair of glasses for somebody who needed glasses and has a real bad vision problem and um that young men later became a Mason in our lives as well we uh just\nDonated to an organization ... is it a than a mascot group they had a family in need a of a vehicle and we helped to acquire the down payment for them so that families get mobility van\n... for their son and I know the masons local have also been involved in gifts to give program much so and and helping with that\nUm scholarships scholarships are really big\nUm grand lodge ... gives scholarships every year usually around thirty five scholarships are given out and they can be as much as five thousand dollars the Scottish right I'm organization I'm gives out something called an avid scholarships and typically there are thousands of Fifteen hundred dollars and they help a lot of kids go to school\nNow those are primarily for children and grandchildren of masons or people who are ... themselves\nSo if you're Eighteen years\nYears of age and older I'm this is another reason to think about joining free masonry it's not the most important reason but it's another reason a reminder we are having open houses at\nAll the ... lodges across the state of Massachusetts this coming Saturday October twentieth nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock on just walk in we'll give you the address is again in just a minute\nA quick quotation from President Taft William Howard Taft the true Mason always carries is working tools everywhere nice little quotation\nBecause we're always masons you know we always try to help other people who need help\nRe I'm pretty sure nobody knows what are working towards our why don't you tell us [laughter]\nLarry go ahead we act upon the
