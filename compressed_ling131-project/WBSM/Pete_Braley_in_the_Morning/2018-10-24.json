the oh you can't put it in the box\nYet what the gentleman is right both gentlemen or rights you know what happened to privacy and ... that's right you need to identify yourself privacy there is no privacy\nBecause when I went and I even took my driver's license and I said do you need my driver's license or identification to\nProve that it's me you know sometimes it's a they ask me that you can
