to\nBurn citizens me understand the impact of small business hand on the community and that's when we looked at and helping them move around\nIn turn loan from Clinton in high demand thing to be a loan program ... products and services to give you the flexibility in the\n... you're not ready for a loan for its citizens federal credit union also operate business checking in savings account\nWith free online banking and Bill Payne along with a grain rink designed to help the same time and money\nAnd that didn't you call our business bankers today at one eight hundred four to seven by one by the way that that isn't that or I think I think\nLiterally insured by in the late ... and I'm from the equal housing and\nWould you like to the labor and best for your future saber invest your retirement\nAlive [laughter] I live right on life or\nIf you were here yeah it is if you were there to day what would life be like for you with all of this going on\nI think it significantly different because in in the day I was there which I started with Clinton is president Republican House and Senate we did still get some things done and I think today it's just a little different I think it's a you know much more combative you know I ...\nYeah no no doubt about it tell us a you know give us your sense of the FBI investigation now that they're getting the information and where does it go from here just given the general sense\nBut I don't know what's in there of course and I think it should be made public unless there's something personal with anybody in there that's not you know nothing to do with the investigation uh then I think it ought to be made public frankly and gang members both sides of the hour we're\nTo leak this today you know really a secret room or the media is going to tell the senators were the room is\nWell it will be ... no no it's not technically it'll be late drive by even a lake and\nThe fact that Ford in ... we're not called in tells me that nothing changed from\nWhat we heard because you know they heard everything from Ford and cabinet if there's anything secretly they should have told they should have told it publicly and let's give you an example park jog Dr Ford said that mark judge was in the room when\nA judge Kavanaugh allegedly a you know assaulted her and mark judge had written a letter said he wasn't in the room but he's now met with the FBI if mark\nJudge said yeah I was in the room they would call ... because I think that's a direct dispute of what he said sure\nSo I'm assuming everything's going to remain the same\nUh you know with what port and Kavanaugh said now the thing that's been raised a is are are friends of\nOf a judge Kavanaugh that have said you know they like him and everything but that he uh you know drank too much that's been raised\nBut they haven't placed him as I understand it in that room or at a party with her so therefore that will be you know particularly part of the of the case uh it's another issue for people to look at I understand that yeah but I think members\nOf leak out the Democratic side of say well well we read the report and the Republican side will say we read the report and\nIn that report might change a few people's opinion I don't know a couple here there's tons shore because we're going in with a few members undecided just a few\nWould you agree that the momentum is going his way\nOf all I think so the fact that they didn't bring 'em you know a Dr Ford or judge Kavanaugh back in would probably say it's going his way you know\nYou know I'm I've been noticing that only very liberal women have accused the conservative judge of any allegations is that by chance or\n[noise] my and my\nMy overstepping boundaries you\nKnow I think in America I'm In today's America the mere accusation\nUsually finishes you yet has you know there's not a situation where you're cleared and the mere accusation of something in a lot of cases finishes people except for example accusations and Keith ... case it was a congressman um\nIt doesn't seem to finish him the Democratic side uh unless his girlfriend file something 'cause her son came out and said that you know he has assaulted her\nHand a lot of people are saying well you know you're not quick to jump on our ... which are quick to jump on somebody else you know the public can\nYes did you hear about the Capitol police arresting ... staffers were Jackson is neat uses Jackson Cosco\n... yes I did um he worked for Feinstein and Barbara Boxer different people the fact I'm having served on the hill fact he's twenty seven year old in ... and he's got all around the officers tells me he's never achieved any real ranking\nYou know if you're so twenty seven and turning you haven't gotten a full time job but he was with Sheila Jackson Lee she's fired him now\nUm he was ... I never heard of this before but it\nWas dark and sharing personal information Lindsey Graham and others yeah ah so they could get charged with a multitude of\nThings now again it didn't really make too many headlines\nA I Wonder why says he said [laughter]\nOkay now you know it's funny you say that um\nThe a lot of the information that the FBI had I was not also you know aired on CNN a lot of this I I call it just uh you know do liberate by us there's a will\nI mean I had I had to go to Fox News to find out the story\nYeah exactly thank goodness for socks park um um what else they want to ask you about uh do do do well I have a funny one to tell you I'm but is how 'bout on your list ...\nOh my that we've covered about them you know the most of us are are mainly about cabin on\nYeah [noise] yeah do you think he's going to be in by Saturday or Monday I'm\nNo I think he is I think it's going to be fifty one forty nine or fifty fifty or five broken by the VP\nWhat do you think in West Virginia you see coming over or no\nI predict mansion will vote yes I Do too I think yeah hall is made up now [noise]\nWow you think so I mean they found no new information here when I Am so I don't know\nAnyone do you agree that anyone who says well he doesn't have the temperament and you know that one more temperament we're\nNow see my only my question if I was there I think as he said she said on the assault and the fact that um she said that doesn't mean he did it and the fact that he says he didn't I mean that's all up in the air so unless can be proved\nI Would err on the side of not holding that against their\nMhm yeah but I Will say\nThis his demeanor\nNot totally disqualifies him but I Know it was upsetting his demeanor kind of caught me off guard the other part to him and I'm not saying this would disqualify him but I don't think he's being\nCompletely honest about his drinking history I just don't I think he was a heavy drinker you know he had that monitored\nDown yeah I never blacked out yeah I had some beers I still like beer um I don't know a part of me says that he had a heavier drinking history than he's um letting on no question arises that\nThirty five years ago was heavy drinking history precluded from being on the Supreme Court if today he doesn't have a heavy just drinking history although on how\nAccurate was he in telling us is drinking history\nRight right right said that there are some red flags to me ... I don't know what I Do with it but it does\nYeah legitimate concerns absolutely [noise] um and finally we go to Ted Koppel [noise]\nAh well that happened with him well tend or said this week that CNN's ratings would be in the toilet if it weren't for president Donald Trump ... of us so I have a feeling that they should turn around and\nSaying the president you know he made a let's see he was at the national press club when he spoke to the media's coverage of crime I owned\nA boat that I think at one point in time he owed\nOh really that's funny that's really neat so [laughter] remember the name of it or you know\nYes it was um Monday's view\nNo kidding you the subject\nOf an article of the Los Angeles times because they said\nThat the shah of Iran daughter bought it\nFor me was that was the one eight [laughter] I'm actually an FBI agent yup the Iranian back quite how\nUm they were so much good stupidest could bank think Ted Koppel and that but at one point in time very very interesting my buddy thank you as always ... what what a delight to have you with us I think you\nWould you like to savor invest for your future saber invested you every time it\nSaved for your children's education call Jose multiples ... six seven eight three seven one type of advance financial group at seven twenty five state road in Westport mass as a financial consultant since Nineteen eighty nine I have experience in setting a poor when case IRAs and annuities for a variety of my clientele\nSecurities an advisory services offered through commonwealth financial network member any Estee S.
