are people who deny the human impact of it the same time for for debate over that we've got to do whatever it takes\nAnd want to hear that\nI'm not a scientist I barely got through botany one [laughter] ah but um I'd like to have our world leaders pay attention to this new report\nYou know I'm a I look at this much like you know we all have to be good stewards or otherwise you know\nIt doesn't work but uh it seems as though most of the countries of the world that are the filthy is are the ones who aren't paying attention to this\nLet's get them on board\nHow to get them that's that's the thing [laughter] I Know and\nIf you have to go the route of economic sanctions the ... you have to go but we are putting\nA planet in danger you know Michael as well as I Do when you when you start going that route you the ones who suffer are the the little folks on main street in that country\nSo [noise] well they're going to suffer the other way if ...\nSo we ... it's a liquid barely cleaning up from what happened in North Carolina and Florida is facing will it's terrible yeah I Know we you know we forget about it because no no attention spans like a yeah it's the cleaning up in

and his\nFirst day on the Supreme Court gave a speech last night that was part political giving facts to every Republican senator who helped them\nThe job uh but I thought the the second half of the speech was a far more gracious he expressed\nI'm no bitterness he said saying that he'd been tested but now the battle was over that he was going to be impartial and independent and devoted to equal justice you know I'm\nA lot of people missed it last week at Princeton University we had a couple of Supreme Court justices Elena Kagan ... Elena Kagan\nAnd Sonia Sotomayor or they spoke there and Justice Kagan said all of us need to be aware how precious\nThe high court's legitimacy is that its reputation is so important of being impartial being neutral\nAnd not being simply an extension of a terribly polarizing\nProcess what she was saying of course is that we've all been through a couple of weeks where were dug in both sides and each side suspects the other of having already made up their minds in advance\nOn cases that will affect the future of the whole country that we've got to get past this bitterness on both sides so I I was encouraged\nBy the last part of\nA justice cabin or speech I was not encouraged by uh the remarks that the president made um they were I'm not\nCalculated to be healing and I think that the country needs healing words right now to call 'em these\nAllegations of sexual assault part of a hoax set up by the Democrats\nTo say that the accusers made up their stories to call the Democrats evil people um to say that Kavanaugh had been proven innocent\nOr none of these things there's no evidence to support any of this and and making these remarks he did no favors to capping off or to the Supreme Court at a time when we need to believe as Justice Kagan said that they are above politics we know that\nPolitics is involved ... but\nThere has got to be a sense of confidence in the Supreme Court that transcends the kind of confidence or lack of it that we see in our um political parties in our leadership or the other two branches\nYou have a wonderful way of elevating where things are to be should be you know the higher the and jelly part of our humanity and then I look on the left in icy groups like ... on\nWho I'm going to make every effort to de legitimize and to just fight dirty a and I'm not going to let this go and they say well there's your conflict right now they're you know\nWell and and these are people who remember the name Merrick Garland\n[laughter] you know it may yeah who leaves me [laughter] I Know the story [laughter] yeah I mean they look we we have\nSeen a politics played bare knuckle sides and bloody now\nYeah and we we really you know we're we're hungry for people to reach toward the middle and it does not like it's coming\nSoon it will we are exactly four weeks from today at the mid term elections\nIt sounds nice but it's not a reality there's this country\nAs you well know Michael is there's this gives them there is a civil war going on\n[noise] All right my my ...
