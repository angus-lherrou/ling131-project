say this the city of Fall River has made remarkable changes\nSince the mayor took office changes for the good\nAnd things seem to be on the uptick\n\nAnd certainly mayor Korea would not be the first

word recession in quite some time little bit longer than one would expect I mean why are you saying that well\nEighty seven was that stock market crash led to a recession and of course the economy went sour on George Bush senior which ushered in President Clinton or Bill Clinton to be President Clinton\nThen of course as I mentioned two thousand with the dot com and the others so these crashes\nHappen in a cycle you know this was an average now when I say approximately every eight years that's an approximate so when you look where we are right now this is a fairly long cycle\nFebruary of this year the Dow went down one thousand points now this is after\nYears not just a President Trump thing ... years of the stock market breaking records all time high\nIn nose dived back in February and then after that the market just picked up steam Roldan we had more record highs\nWednesday [noise]\nAnother nosedive eight hundred points which is not one thousand\nBut for the past couple of weeks you you've seen a stock market that hasn't been too good and I'm Wondering\nIf we are seeing a cooling off are we heading towards the crash now yesterday the market was a two hundred eighty seven point whatever points\nBut we are looking at it and official unemployment rate national nationwide now a three point seven percent that's what they call the youth three the number that all the politicians like the ... because it's pretty basic\nThe youth six which includes a lot more factors than they used three is over seven percent\nAnd if you factor in what's happening in the retail market what's happening in the real estate market what's happening with the international trade trade deficit was higher than expected\nHigher than expected they are two hundred Seventy million a billion excuse me so look there there's some some big deficits and debt of courses over Twenty one trillion dollars\nHow do you make up the money that the dollar was down a little bit not a lot\nAnd\nEven though wages are going up just ... let's say point three percent so we can say wages aren't going up legally they are going up point three percent\nInflation is more than one percent so in other words you're getting more money\nBut because of expenses consumer debt credit cards you know that kind of stuff car loans all of these other things that are that are going on student loans let me throw that in there too\nWe are spending more even though we may be making a little more point three percent in earnings\nBut a one point six which just to make it like that one point six so there's a negative one point three\n\nI'm asking that question is the market what happened we in the beginning of a decline or as they call it a bear\nMarket or is it just a correction that happens every once in awhile size zero eight nine nine six zero five hundred also should the mayor of Fall River stay\nOr should Jae su go let's hear from you pedal low\n[noise] very very pay I'm Brian oh

two years since Donald Trump's inauguration\nAll it's done in drawing up a little bit of steady this up up up up up it's got a correct if you're gonna see these types of corrections like this week that would be a cause for more concern you know what I'm saying\nI Know that the market has been up for the past eight years and not just since Donald Trump has been in office we've had record high since two thousand eleven\nTwo thousand eleven\nYeah it's been it's been a record of John in short periods of time after Donald Trump got inaugurated actually after he was elected the day after the mafia where'd you go\n\nHuh um yes yeah I Will disagree certainly since Donald Trump has been in office there have been soaring highs\nBut I think the question is what is making that markets sore and as I understand it from people that do the market on a regular basis\nIt's because of the money that the fed printed and basically you know\nMoney that on our backs that then went to these investment bankers so they could buy back the stock if if you sit down and look at all\nThe different players in the stock market first of all you don't have as many investors let people got out after two thousand eight you have a lot of stock buybacks going on right now with what I call inflated dollars\nSo that is it ... the market has definitely gone up ... under President Obama and certainly under President Trump\nBut it seems to be artificial ... again you you look at the unemployment numbers you look at what people are spending is is the air coming out of that bubble\nOr is it just a

this\nCommission formed I Am a no vote we've talked about the mayor of Fall River was under the gun in court earlier this week or a few days ago but the latter part of the week\nSeveral counts oh let's see the government alleges that over a four year period Jay Seoul, Korea\nHas been committing wire fraud and filing false tax returns\nBut governor\nMany others have asked that Jay so step aside I'm asking you should stay or should he go\nObviously in the United states you are\nGuilty excuse me innocent until proven innocent ... minutes until proven guilty I don't know the way people are talking it it's almost as if\nJay ... is guilty because the government has come down with the indictment now I I understand that\nMitchell was on would bury the other day\nTalking about this stuff he's he's a former federal prosecutor he knows what goes on at that particular level I'm not trying to to overstep his judgment in cases like that because he's been in that fire but the the other side of me says wait a minute\nChase still hasn't had a defense presented as of yet he he says that the charges are bogus\nWell maybe they are the other side of the coin yeah I I mean there are two sides that we know of their heads and the tail but I'm going to get to that third side and just a bit the other side of the coin maybe it's the tale maybe it's\nTheir head says you do have due process you do have a right to fight jays who's been out there saying that\nThese charges of bogus but what do we normally hear from big wigs and politicians\nAnd this does not escape me\nThat yet another politician is under the gun under the magnifying glass\n\nWe saw what happened to Brett Kavanaugh now Kevin uh wasn't running for elective office but he was appointed to the highest court and the land and prior to that he was appointed to an appeals court\n\nHe didn't seem to have too much of a problem going through the appeals court process\n\nBut as far as getting on to the Supreme Court while we saw what happened\nWe also see what happens to people that are running for elective office you almost have to be squeaky clean and who among us is squeaky clean their maybe two or three people out there I don't know\nOr maybe the just born\nBut that person isn't running for office this\nIn my opinion will keep even more people from wanting to run for office look what's happening here and he looked ... may be guilty as sin\nHe may not be guilty or they could be that gray area that happens\nBut any time that you do anything you're going to be under scrutiny when you run for public office and to be quite honest with you you should be\nTo a certain extent\nUh I I can hardly wait to see what happens in this particular case but the question to you is Judy stay or shooting go the stock market big big story this week that almost being shoveled under the earth\nWent down eight hundred points on Wednesday climbed back a little bit on on friday when I say a little bit to hundred eighty seven points that's not a bad days work but it you look at the week the market was way down you look at last week a little now\nI'm Wondering are we in correction mode\nOr is this the sign that you know what's going to happen\nWe have recessions we have booms we have recessions we have booms we have recessions we have booms are we going through some type of market crash right now jobs report the official\n... says unemployment is three point seven percent the number that isn't official but a lot of people go buy it is that you six number over seven percent\nAnd when you take some of the things that used to be an official number let's go back to Nineteen sixty nine who are you calling back fifty years brain well\nThings have changed to make that old Fishell number\nAs as nice as it seems right now\nYou're you're looking at an unemployment rate of more than ten percent back when Donald Trump was running for office he was gay estimating twenty thirty percent that's Donald Trump candidate Trump\nNow all of a sudden the unemployment numbers as President Trump a three point seven percent in all of a sudden these are the right numbers\nAmazing how that works five zero eight nine nine six zero five hundred you know his administration has been under the gun and he's holding on maybe ...\nShould hold on let's hear from you hello\nRyan or got kicked off before\nSo yes I'm Sorry I don't I don't I don't know what happened but yes I'm Glad you called back\nIt was probably me when I was heading towards the accurate but iron important question for you on that question really were speaking of early on the show\nBallot question yes question too but yes we'll head grew yet\nA limit the amount of money yeah you can\nSpend on politicians um and then at the end it there are companies will not be given constitutional right\nWell it is a constitutional right to right now what this commission would do is change that constitutional right yeah\nBut we're in this country is capitalistic economy we have\nSet up a company like a a license liability company a company has its own empathy and has its own constitutional rights so if something happens with that company\nSaying there's a loss to or damage they go after the person ... anybody running the company is that companies that do that and it has its own rights\nAre you saying that that question will effect that\nYes because under the Supreme Court ruling of a few years ago\nCorporations are treated as human beings when it comes to to giving money to campaigns and basically what this this amendment would do is change that write for corporations\nThat the slippery road to go down because what are the rights would take away once said critical way uh companies right could be its own and see\nI mean where where do you know changing the right for them to be their own entity what you are doing is effectively a taking away or limiting the amount of money that they can contribute to a campaign\nOkay\nI I I hear what you're saying because it's not the money that influences people although many people do believe it's the money\n... ... it doesn't influence\nMe on how I'm going to vote it might influence other people but that's on them\nThat's on the corporation\nThat would think about what to think if they didn't have this ballot question and they wanted to go after the amount of money the company spent on politicians those companies can then take them ...\nThey're All right so this question is basically try to I I look at it as they're trying to preemptively you know or have the people vote against it so that way they can start\nLimiting the amount of money and these companies won't have any right to go to court and fight for it\nAnd you're you're you're partly correct a yes vote means that here in the commonwealth we will have a citizens commission to advance what is already in written form a constitutional amendment", "show_name": "Pete Braley in the Morning", "year": "2018", "city": "New
