Sundays Jim reload\nIt's Sunday Morning and it's time for towns where Sunday good morning I'm Jim Philips shorter show this week with a discussion about homeless individuals and families in our region\nWhat some local groups are doing to help them Bedford connect as the name of the event and its plan for Wednesday October twenty fourth at the downtown YMCA\nJoining me to talk about the event is Leslie pulling she works for for for citizens and as a which is a key sponsor really for this event and uh Jim McKay of mashed development\nAnd who's also involved with rice for homes which is another of the sponsoring organizations and really I think uh the foundation for this ah for this or that coming up on the twenty fourth so welcomed people thank you for having us and uh\nI get we're going to START I think would you Leslie and talked about what is New Bedford connect what's the purpose of this and that\nSort of African act as a one day event where we gather all of the different agencies and support organizations um in one place one location so that anyone who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless can attend this event\nAnd get the help that they need they can um uh being rolled into different housing programs for shelter they will actually get health screens they will get dental checkups\nUm say we'll have flu shots um at the event um and we will also have donated hats and scarves that were admitted 'em by a lot of the local Council on aging so we're very thankful for them for that\nUm they'll also be fed we're going to give them some food breakfast lunch um so and most importantly there'll be getting IDs those that qualify to get an ID or will be able to get a free id on that day\nSo um that's a short synopsis of what happened that day\nUm but what are we done to ensure that the homeless population will be your will show up will be will be there and show up I guess my question because uh obviously transportation is a big deal here and I'm I'm you know some of these folks\nThey may simply not want to be there for whatever reason a gym what some of the logistics behind getting folks to show I'm\nSure I'm One of the the first things is to make sure that all the service providers know about the event and that they can reach out to\nA you know their clients and the and the folks who who needs to be there to make sure that they are they're so whether they um a lot of people do end up walking downtown it's in the central location\nOr so it is near the bus station um and so some people will arrive by bus a lot of people who arrive by for it but then I'm there will be some of the agencies as well providing transportation so there will be a route that we've established throughout the city\nIn a different struggles and challenges at certain points in our lives and uh some of us have more options to fall back on when those things happen to us\nAnd oftentimes you know people who find themselves homeless um are you know they have other issues and they might not have a lot of the the same options that you know some uh some of us may have and um you know going without a home may be\nA you know the best option that they find you know is available to them at that time [noise] um so as as well as people who you know do have you know chemical dependency is who you know who do I have some mental health issues um you know might be people who are are facing domestic violence it might be people who\nUm have lost a job they might be people who are working but for whatever reason um you know find that that life has has dealt them or you know some blows that that they're not able to recover you know from fully at that time so cost of living is up these days\nUm and if you see the trends you know in terms of you know what it costs to ah to maintain a house to a you know pay for you your utilities and and all those things all those costs of living\nHas gone up um and you know wages have remained relatively stagnant over that time um so you know the burden on on more and more people who don't have the social networks and um you know other things to rely on um you know kind of creates a\nThe conditions were you know unfortunately we're we might see more people who are um on the edge of homelessness or who are who are experiencing homelessness so it can happen to all of us we can have anybody um and I think that's an important thing to remember when we think about the homeless population\nHow can people learn more about your bed for connect\nThat it's been visiting our website rise up for homes dot com there's information regarding rise up for homes in general and what we do and what its mission is but there's also a lot of information on there about New Bedford connected law\nWhich tells you about Russia problems from it just to give us a brief synopsis of what they do\nSo rise up for homes Israeli honestly you might be able to help out with us from a little bit more gym but it's almost a fundraising and the community awareness arm of the home of service providers network of New Bedford so their mission is really to uh bring awareness and kind of changed the stigma about what homelessness is\nA but we also raise funds to try to keep the emergency overflow shelter open during the you know the really cold winter nights which is um\nWhich last year we had a really rough winter with about Seventy three nights being opened versus the previous year there was only about forty two nights and early ... forty four so um\nI Can't say much better than that and that that is exactly why rise of drones exists as it is your ... on the fundraising and outreach\nArm for the homeless service providers network and also to maintain the uh the emergency overflow shoulder\nTo donate to Russia ... what do you do\nThat yet it can donate right on the Web site by that rise up for homes dot com or you can mail a check in um to rise up for homes um two hundred mile road and for a haven or to seven

commander Pete wild is with us to talk about the benefits fair and how it can help veterans and their families so welcomed the good morning Jim thanks for having me\nUm is there a particular reason why post one holding this fair right now how many folks are you expecting\nWhile we're expecting a drawback two thousand people there a reason we're doing is there's a lot of unemployed veterans does a lot of veterans don't know what benefits they're entitled to especially with the new law that just passed\nSo we're going to have people there were ... claiming that two of them were going to have a employers hiring veterans right you're right on the spot\nSo it's something just won't leave ... it'll go over well\nI'm as you mentioned there'll be a lot of all the organizations that have with information for veterans and families and what types of info we talk to my first of all there'll be hiring you know the folks there\nThere will be ... at least Fifteen businesses they're hiring individuals' a Wal Mart low is just to name McHugh Camry over the speedway\nServed pro be a lot of different uh people they're looking to hire employees and what else well swap we're going to have people who explains new laws that for benefits the car cover families\nAnd um the ah oh I Can't think of the word\nAnd other services and other services yes they could have you always good to be all runs the only organization yes we're going to have health benefits were going to have the St Louis health then there were going to have people that talk about resume writing ... can have people who visit will speech you regards to\nBenefits for your family after you've passed state planning we have some people have with healthy lifestyle I have a health health life coach comment\nI have insurance people that do business with just with the veterans we have a couple of the leader of veterans legal lawyers coming down a we have quite a few we'd better ... very well rounded a position going into despair um\nThere's a lot of evidence I think that veterans many that things may not know what's available to them especially veterans perhaps may not have been in combat that are older now and you know they're served a Vietnam Era or Korea during the Korean\nWar they may not been in combat but so they don't really know\nI mean this this is very true a lot of red veterans and leave the grays New Bedford area to not realize that they could be titled chapter one fifty which is a bill that was passed its Massachusetts the only state in the country that has it\nThat helps with the medical bills and if you'd indeed it can help you there\nOr if you need are you going into a new apartment they'll help you with you for some last month's rent a woman can help veterans they're entitled to this and these are things that we're going to have the four of them show how to utilize them and teach them the proper way to do things\nSo um why do you think that is if you don't need it the younger you don't need it you just keep on going with your life you know\nWell when I come out of the military we know that we weren't titled do these things now when did beat the brief from the military they beat in advice and all this\nShow applied to I\nDo want to say was negligent Sunday anybody's part but we just didn't know and now that we're finding out what take the opportunity to utilize and now we're hearing introduced in Congress to get involved and get him to utilize the same programs\nThe only thing that explained to me when they look in the military was things that they want they want you to know so you can read and lash isn't that the truth you know you get free health care\nAnd a dump forget ... low prices at the commissary but beyond that you didn't hear much more or less what benefits it might be entitled to it but now I think that has changed\nAnd now I mean we were and you were before I was they didn't tell you the kind of an advisor to become a target for a bullet either\nThat's uh that's true I mean right now a risk combat pay and all of those things that perhaps we're missing and by the un I have worked in the service but uh I I think there is it that was in Vietnam that\nWas a bad sign some sort of a yes that was\nThat's when the ... when you have served in the middle of the Vietnam War when\nThe government started decided to lose so many medical

D. entitled to top fifty ... hymns and the first one is the blood we'll never lose its power\nOh ooh no\n... ...\n... what we\n\nKnow a\nBit from\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh\n\nWhy oh\nWhy\n\n\nWhy oh\nOh why oh Mm [noise]\nOr that you have just provided for us in general and we thank you for that we also thank you this morning for the people that we have in our lives\nOur families are friends or co workers whoever it is that we come in contact with that makes a smile or is a blessing to us and we even thank you for those people in our our lives that sometimes can be slightly annoying\nAnd we know that there probably are is more than one that we can count\nBut even those people will add to what we need and that is sometimes we need to develop more patience or\nWe need to find or understand why it is that they are the way they are and perhaps we can help them out with information that we have with life lessons that we know and so we asked this morning that you help us to even realize those people as blessings\nWe also thank you this morning that we're in a country living in a country where we can freely open our Bible and we can preach the Bible over the airwaves and\nNot have it be censored and not have um the government stepping in and telling us what we can and cannot preach and we thank you that we have that privilege\nI also want to thank you this morning for all the love that you give to us each and every day we know that you have given us a uh the gift of salvation\nFor which we really are not deserving and we thank you for that we thank you for the fact that whether we are near you or or walk away from you that you don't push us away that it's us that pushes you away but that we can always come back to you\nRegardless of how far away we've been or how long it's been that you have such a great love for us that you take us back into the fold\nAnd we give you praise and thanks for that also thank you this morning that even though we're a very small church\nThat we have been able to for over Ninety years uh provide this area with ah the message a message from the Bible that even though we are small that we have had the finances to do so because you have\nWatched us watched over us and graciously given us what we need we thank you that we're able to do that we kept a week and we know that without you it would be impossible and this morning we again thank you for everything that you do for us\nWhat you give us this is too numerous to count the blessings that we have really\nJust X financial and do we keep you praise and thanks in your son's name on it we have another song this morning from fifty great hymns and this one isn't titled great is thy faithfulness [noise]\nOh\n...\nOh\nOh oh\nA law\n\nOr a\nOr ... years\nOld on the\n... no\nNo no you\nCar\nNo I'm a\nA\nKnow I mean by the\n\nContinuing on our team of love and going to read this morning something in title ... eleven commandment archbishop I sure will\nWrecked on the coast of Ireland and almost destitute of clothing he wanted to the house clergyman decrease the asteroid was quite we are in somewhat cold and incredulous\nHow many commitments are they are you suddenly asked thinking to detect an imposter\nI cannot what satisfy you that I Am not the ignorant and posture you take me for ... the archbishop there are elected commandments know what's the smearing comment there are Ten Commandments in my Bible\nTell me the eleven and I will give you all the help you meet there it is set the archbishop ... to ... I knew commitment I get on to you that you love one another as I have loved you\nAnd it's true we often think about just the ten commandments that we see an exodus\nJesus did give us a few more can the image that we love him in that we love each other so as we before we continue on with um what else we have one more him and this one is entitled to a fight with me\nOh I\n\nA\nA larger\nRole than a\nA a a a a\nI'm a I'm\nA ...\nA sort of ... or a no\nNews out in ... or ... I\nSaw a ...\n\n\nOh boy a a\nR\nO\nO O D a loyal to them to\nRely on like a ...\n\nI'm a I'm going to show how you know a ...\nA\nDog on a bus or\n\nA\nMan it's a\nIf a man say I love God and hated his brother\nHe is a liar for he that love is not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who love of God also love his brother so one of the\nThings that we see here is that you can't\nSay that you love God and then hate other people whether it's a particular person\nOr whether it's a group of people are certain people from a certain country\nUm you really can't say that and then say I've loved God because do you really love God at that point what is your attitude towards keeping his commandments\nWhen you do that we know we've just seen that ... to show loved to God one of things we need to do is to keep us commandments in one of his command and says that we love our brother it so it certainly is this we'll that were on that we have to make sure we stay on\nThis love includes everything and we need to demonstrate this love towards our fellow man showing loved towards those who\nNot only a brother in in Christ but we need to love everyone else also in first John\nChapter three verse eleven again this is a state it for this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another another averse and John Thirteen starting with there's thirty four\nAnd I just I'm kind of read this and the um other message I gave you a new commandment I given to you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another\nBy this show all men no that yeah my disciples if you have love one to another and really just as important if if you\nAnnounce that you're a Christian and then you're talk is one of hate and putting people down then you certainly are not showing what the life of a Christian should be and you really aren't living the life that you're supposed to\nWe best demonstrate our love toward our brother and buy a doing things for them by not putting them down and by helping them when they're in some sort of physical need in first John chapter three and we were just read a averse from there but it goes on\nIn VR sixteen here by ... perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us\nAnd we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren but who's so half\nIs worlds good and see us as sea of his brother have need and shut up his bottles of compassion from him\nHow well if the love of God and him my little children let us not love in word neither in tone but indeed and in truth so we really need to make sure that we're doing things for people when where can we can and when we're able to\nUm uh physically now this doesn't mean that you have to take every penny you have and\nEvery piece of clothing that you have in every ... every ... article of food that you have in your house and give them away and you have nothing that's not what he's saying here but he's saying that when you have\nSome extra or when you have when you have extra time even that you share it with people in need when you can give a little money when you can give\nYou know buy an extra couple of cans at the grocery store and bring them to the food pantries all of this is expected of us as Christians it's what we are supposed to be doing remember we just can't loving word you can't just say I love you I Love everybody\nWe have to show it we have to do indeed in in what we do with our lives and this also\nIncludes not just physical needs but helping others with their spiritual needs and first Peter chapter for first said it eats and above all things have fervent charity you remember that word means love\nAmong yourselves for charities should cover the multitude of sins so we can certainly help out others\nUm when they are going through difficult times\nI'm with what they should do perhaps showing them things from the Bible if they're on the wrong path and then in James chapter five starting with versus Nineteen James writes brother and if any if you do air from the truth and one convert him\nLet him know that he which convert at the center from the era of his way\nShe'll save a soul from death that she'll hide a multitude of sins so it is our responsibility as children of God to help our brother rent out if they are heading down the wrong path and again this should not be done by putting the person down\nBy embarrassing them in front of others\nThis is something that needs to be done by taking someone aside and talking to them\nBy letting them know that their their loved regardless of what they do but that perhaps if they change their ways that their life will be better and that there'll be following\nThe word of God and of course we know that part of this love encompasses loving God and keeping his commandments to repeat averse by this we know that we love the children\nGod when we love God and keep his commandments ants we again also need to show love to everyone not just\nUm people in our church or people in our family but anyone we come in contact with because love for others must go beyond loving those who have love for us\nAnd these versus I think are probably I'm One of the more difficult um versus to follow and actually act upon and I have talked about them before\nWhen we were um going over the um serving on the mount for Matthew and this is the uh depiction of it in Luke Luke ... starting with versus twenty seven but I say until you which here love your enemies you good to them which hate you\nLess than the current issue and pray for them which despite fully you shoe and onto him that ... the on the one sheet\nOff also offer\nThe other end him that take us away if I cook for ... forbid not to take like coat also give to every man they ask because of the end of him that take away that goods ask them not again and as you would that men should do to you do you also to them likewise\nFor if you love them which I Love you what thank Kathy for sinners also love those that love them\nAnd if you do good to them which do good to you what they khaki for sin is also do even the same and if he led to them of\nWhom you hope to receive what thank Kathy for sinners also lend to centers to receive as much again love your enemies and do good inland\nHoping for nothing again and your reward she'll be great and he showed me the children of the highest for he is tied to the un thankful and to the evil be therefore merciful as your father also as merciful\nAnd let's take these versus apart a little bit first of all which of love our enemies that's something difficult to do someone's done something wrong to you it's certainly different difficult to be nice to them never my love them and then it says not only are you to love them but remember\nThis word ... comes with some sort of um movement it says to do good to them which I hate you\nSo it goes beyond just ... I Love it means you need to do good to them you need to\nSay good morning with a smile you need to hold the door open\nYou need to send a card you need to whatever it is you need to do to show them that you love them despite the fact that they've done something bad to you and then it says bless them that curse you and pray for them so those people that I've done something wrong to you\nWere expected to bless them and pray for them where to turn the other cheek this is where this comes from\nWhere two um lent things to people without expecting something in return and um and the reason why we should do this because you know people that don't love God do the same thing just love your enemies do good remember it's an action [noise]\nSo what we demonstrate that we are truly the children of God and led by the spirit when out of love and again this is something we should do you know with tongue in cheek but out of love we need to do good to them that hate us we need to bless those that curse us we need to\n... for those that spite fully misuse us and when you're praying for them you know praying for something negative to happen to them\nYou're praying that they receive blessings and that um God will help you to give the love that um he wants you to and um you're not to resist them when they're doing evil your you know they're doing something wrong to you it's not that you\nLet them walk all over you obviously but you know you can accept certain things\nComedy street voters were buying a car makes you feel who has a twenty year refutation of respecting customers and

very important question\nAre you a millionaire [noise] would you like to be a millionaire\nWould you like to know how to become a millionaire that's what we're going to talk about today it's obviously not the most important thing in the world but we're gonna talk about this is an interesting subject today about how to become a millionaire so stay tuned will get a lot of useful information to give you\nWelcome to attorney Michael Coleman good morning thank you for having me my thank you for being here it's always a pleasure\nWe're going to talk about how many millionaires you've known and you're a law practice nobody wants to that but um but it's a lot of people who yeah is this is rising\nLeave a lot of people come in and they they usually fill out a client and take form that we ask them to fill out then this bank accounts and life insurance policies and investment accounts and real estate and a lot of times they're surprised actually about how much money they have\nYou know what I've noticed over the years how many people will fill out the intake information and they don't put a total on it right and it's almost like they're afraid to know what the total is and then your total it up in front of him and it's over a million dollars and they say I didn't know that you know so it's amazing well welcome to Peter Lance good morning Pete\nGood morning and good morning every one you're talking normally now but you started the show and very deep timber white the radio show voice\nNo actually I'm always indeed temper that [laughter] that's not always in deep something sometimes but no welcome people are always happy to have you on the show and yes I Am indeed timber this morning I don't know why do you ever go home and tell your wife that be careful me honey I'm In deep timber today [laughter]\nNot sure what you're saying but no [laughter] no I'm not implying I think just being silly\nWell welcome gentleman a Pete and Mike I'm and\nObviously I'm ray Lance and we're happy to be with you usa wealth group is the company that sponsors money wise but we also have frequent visits from Mike and also attorney Kenny Lance\nAnd we talk a lot about legal issues as well as financial issues but today we thought it'd be kinda funny actually to talk about\nMillionaires and so we're going to call this the millionaire show we've done a lot of research on this subject\nAbout trust and you know different types of complex trust and simple trust and ... it's a lot of legal information I have to learn and and study which I a lot of it I knew already just being around the law firm for so many years but\nUh they keep talking over and over again about how valuable uh trust is so to voice probate and passing directly to airs instead of\nTaking a very costly and time consuming process of going through probate and public so probably one of the\nOne of the most important reasons to do dress planning and typically the recommendation has always been that if you're worth more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of value of everything you own you ought to be looking at doing a trust and not just simple wills\nBut avoiding probate is a key reason for doing trust but the second most important reason is if you are worth more than a million dollars\nThere will be Massachusetts a state tax to pay if you use simple wills everything goes from one spouse to the other let's say and then the surviving spouse as a state will get hit with the estate tax I'm On the other hand if you do a trust in Massachusetts you can shelter and protect\nTo one million dollar exemptions and therefore you can have a larger state without paying Massachusetts a state tax\nBut get a check up on this ladies and gentlemen go see Mike Mike um what's your phone number\nYou can call us at five zero eight nine nine eight eight eight zero zero if you want to learn more about who we are what we do go onto the Internet at Lance law in ... dot com\nSo visit the website take some action make an appointment go to see Mike or attorney Cheney Lance and make sure that your assets are going to be protected nobody needs to pay more taxes than what they absolutely have to\nUnless you're highly paid politician probably I suppose uh then they find loopholes don't\nWrite some of the celebrities that we hear about recently they haven't done and you know someone who hasn't done any planning or just had a will and they have very large states they're going to be paying a lot of state tax to their heirs are well\nIt makes everybody in the iris very very happy [laughter] you know Aretha Franklin and Michael Jackson and who else friends yeah the Massachusetts department\nOf revenue likes it when people don't plan\nRight well let's talk about so we've already talked about the fact that I don't think that because you've got somebody else's name on account it's not part of your state it is so we see a lot of people that say well my son's name is on the account so if I die goes to him immediately right and I say you up\nAnd then they say but guess what it's included will in your state for estate tax purposes\nBecause the rule is very simple under the tax code anything that passes by reason of your death to somebody else even a life a state um that acid the value of that as it will be included all in your state mhm\nSo do some planning\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about what if some of the steps that you can do what some of the steps that you can take\n'em to make more money to become a millionaire so I'll give you a couple of examples as we're going through the show today one of which I Want to tell you\nI have a couple who works both for a utility company has been a wife both retired from the utility company but they did something that was\nThe smartest thing that anybody can do you can do it at any age but the younger you start the better and that is start saving on a regular systematic basis don't skimp don't change\nIs what you always say Pete pay yourself first so put aside from your very first paycheck to your very first job\nBut it's ... miles away twenty five dollars a week\nEvery single week if you have a company that has an automatic savings plan ... from your pay you're not going to miss it you're going to learn to get by on live without it if you do that regularly you're going to end up with well over a million dollars by the time that you retire course we'll give you some investment of advice along the way to what we\nI told my wife a week or two ago that as soon as all of our children turn Eighteen or my daughter has a long way to go but my oldest only has just under three years to go\nUp for their birthday gift we are going to give them you know all the small lump sum of money you know two hundred and fifty five hundred dollars I'm as a birthday present and open up a un I write for them and then they're going to contribute something towards it every single week even if it's ten dollars\nSure even five ... even at that young age and then when they start working and they become employed in the economy or if they continue that habit it's money that they should never touch until they're fifty nine and a half\nThey've got to be working at sixteen [laughter]\nWell they just can't open up an IRA until Eighteen oh I didn't know that that's interesting yeah that's I didn't know that you taught me something today I looked into it I'm specifically see I thought I knew everything [noise] my son has taught me something today is terrific well\nWe have to always plan we have to always save and if you do and if you start early\nSo I've got this one couple that worked for a utility company um they started very young from the very first jobs they put aside a regular months every single week when they had money builds up and their savings account they took him converted into a CD the rights today are very low unfortunately\nAnd then later they put it into other kinds of investments and when they retired and they were both sixty five or younger when they retired uh they're worth two and a half to three million dollars\nAll of one of the biggest success stories that I've seen in our office is going back a number of years obviously I'm not going to go into too much detail that\nOr this person was a firefighter fulltime and firefighters who are fulltime typically work to twenty four hour shifts\nSo the rest of the time um she learned how to become a plumber and got his plumbing license into plumbing on the side\nAnd he had well over a million dollars in liquid and you know ... uh invest of alas that sure when he retired at a very young age and received a full pension from the fire department\nYup steady and regular in early a steady in regular in early that's what makes the difference nobody gets rich overnight very few people do if they do they're extremely lucky\nI'm most people get rich and get wealthy and become millionaires because they've been just doing it very consistently there's some good books out there the automatic millionaire for example and um there's one book that I like to recommend\nThe killer there was one a quote that I saw recently from a\nOh God it's like the inventor of a ... or something like that it was some type of new technology and he invented it he said don't worry about trying to be smarter than others to become rich you only have to be smart wants to become wealthy so those are the rare cases where somebody comes up with an idea to get rich quick but\nThere's other education as well as the book that I've mentioned before and the radio to let you do it again it's by Tony Robbins um he's a self help guru but he wrote a really when I think as spectacular book and I think it's the best learning tool for learning about money it's called money master the game\nSevens simple steps to financial freedom money master the game by Tony Robbins highly recommended I bought my copy it bee Jay's I've mentioned this before\nUm [noise] one of the things you said in his book is people who succeed at the highest level are not lucky they're doing something differently than everybody else does\nIs where we say about budgets how few people we see coming the office have done a budget\nDo a budget save regular um Albert Einstein said the greatest scientific discovery in the world is compound interest\nSo when you put money aside it's going to earn some interest is going to compound and value\nI'm Mark Zuckerberg uh he's the guy that did Facebook said the biggest risk is not taking any risk in the world is changing really quickly the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks\nNow we're not necessarily talking about taking a risk right now but we are talking about starting something taking some action and doing something [noise]\nSo is your stories about millionaires who have you know made it and are successful but you never hear about all the failures they've had leading up to that so maybe they tried so many different business ideas and they failed but then there was at one idea that was finally successful\n... Peter you're very good at looking at quotations very quickly look it up a quotation from Thomas Edison\nI didn't just succeed I failed ten thousand times before I succeeded as a woman who landed up 'cause you just said I was as I'm paraphrasing [laughter] but uh yeah you have to be persistent that what you do you have to be a smart\nSo here's some quick rules we're gonna talk about today number one\nDesire wealth and dream big\nAnd obviously money for money's sake is not the most important goal that people want to have you know being a good person is probably a lot more important but if you want to become wealthy and successful you have to think big and dream big why not have big dreams as well as little dreams\nOr St Peter suggested talking about his firefighter friend why not have a job and be thinking of something else you could do on a part time basis that interest you\nAnd say you got to be very persistent about what you do you have to think a little bit bigger\nSo I think that you were incorporating ... go ahead our greatest weakness lies and giving up the most certain weight to succeed is always to try just one more time and then the other one is I never did anything by accident nor did any of my inventions come by accident that came by work\nUm and you really just not going to become wealthy if one person or both of you like to spend and are wasteful with your spending\nAnd another really important chip is that um if you don't have parents who are wealthy or see if we can get adopted somewhere else right do you like that when the\nI've said that a few times a second can you adopt me [laughter]\n[noise] no that's a joke obviously but um what happens if you inherit money\nWell I Want to give you actually something that's a combined a tax tip as well as a very important to have to think about when it comes to making money and saving money and that's what happens if you inherit an IRA so this is my tax tip for today\nI'm so when you inherited an IRA means simply this let's say you have a parents who have IRA accounts let's say it's the mother who has a large IRA account\nShe passes away it goes to the father of the father dies and then he names the kids as beneficial as well don't be ever tempted if you're a child inherited an IRA or younger younger beneficiary\nOf any kind dumping tempted to just take the lump sum of money and say while I've just inherited a fifty thousand dollar irate this is terrific [noise]\nFirst thing happens when you take the money out you're going to put aside mandatory twenty percent for tax withholding so what's five times to ten it's ten thousand dollars right away that goes\nOut for taxes immediately um and you no longer have the ability to have tax deferred growth on the remaining money you going to stick it in the bank you're going to spend that you're going to do something with it save it for your own personal retirement while I was at that point\nYou've actually incorporate it something in our office where when we meet with clients we give them a something called the stop letter so when something went eventually happens to them and their children or other beneficiaries are going through their records they're going to see this stop letter is literally a bright red stop sign\nI'm In the middle of the page and it says don't do anything with these\nInherited assets without speaking to I'm ray and Pete Lance\nI'm because there might be some you know tax consequences that you're not prepared for\nRight in the rules for inherited IRA or a little bit complicated but gosh if you get a little advice from a an accountant who knows this business or from somebody like our office I'm One of the things if you inherited an IRA from somebody who's died is\nThat a let's assume that the owner of the traditional Iran has started taking distributions there at least Seventy and a half when you must begin taking\nAnd you're a non spouse beneficiary and you want to stretch it out over your own life expectancy doesn't matter what your age is you must begin taking minimum distributions\nSo you don't think that just because you've inherited an IRA account you could wait until you are Seventeen and a half [noise]\nNo you have to start taking minimum distributions\nAnd if you don't by the way this is a fifty percent penalty so it's really important [noise] the other thing is is this a really critical language about how this inherited IRA has to be set up\nAnd so typically it's um you know Mary Smith parentheses deceased July one twenty Eighteen parentheses\nIRA for the benefit of John Smith the sun\nYou have to have this really big long name\nWe can help you set this up we do this all the time we do it every single week so you have to tight lipped correctly\nUm if you have more than one beneficiary then you have to split up the beneficial the interest is been inherited into multiple beneficial for his um but this is really important a tax rules when you inherited an IRA\nWe're happy to give you free advice on how to do that come in and sit down and we'll show you how to do it will help you do it if you need help\nSo that's our big tax tip for the today for today\nGoing back to the ten simple steps on how to become a millionaire uh I like this one a lot and I've never heard this before but I like it start viewing your dollars as employees\nInstead of you and your money or something you have to play with start seeing your dollars as employees you can keep them in employ them to work for you growing your wealth or you can fire them in other words spend them and have less employees degree a business the business of becoming a millionaire\nI liked that idea or you can say you know what you've done really well I'm going to give you a raise\n[laughter] okay [laughter] well by it wasn't than writing was well no but\nGiven raised by investing it into something that's going to earn interests exactly do\nYou get my drift [laughter] no but I'm thinking about how you can live below your means don't go out and be tempted to buy the next best thing it's out there um live below your means and make your dollars work for you\nAnd you know\nI Can't tell you how many times somebody will say oh I have X amount of dollars in cash in my closet and we're like we don't want to hear that taught tell us that and if we don't want to know and I also don't want you to be doing that but it somewhere where it's going to earn money because right now you're losing money to go against the costs of inflation\nSee a lot of people and we say we we do say that right away we say don't tell me with the money is um I don't I'm not going to put anything in my notes about this um\nYou don't want to know about it we don't want somebody to find out that you've got money that's hidden in your house which is\n... but you shouldn't have it in there now\nMaybe a little bit for a rainy day or something but\nFive hundred bucks or so which is well anyway um have a plan we can help you lay out some ... very simple goals we also have a budget form that we always like to use I like this one a number seven on the list here refused to conform ... in today's society we see\nSo many people going out and buying a thousand dollar iPhones and you know getting expensive cars and doing all this stuff because they see other people doing it and they think they need to to so you have refused to conform keep your old phone keep your old car it's okay\nYou don't have to keep up with the Joneses and you'll be much better than the Jones is if you don't go out and buy that and your wife on because you see somebody on Facebook that has just bought the new iPhone and you have to have it now you don't you can hold off on it you'll be much better off than them in the long run\nYeah because you are asked me over my flip phone please [laughter] no I actually have an iPhone\nI mean something dealing most people listening to this are not going to go out and buy a thousand dollar iPhone but it could be wrong\nIf that's going to be really interesting I mean how big can they get for one thing yeah you know his my suitcase to carry\nMy only for it's also just offensive a thousand dollar phone yeah well it is but I'm\nRight down your ideas keep a list keep a little tablet all the things that you want to do um keep a list of ideas of things you can do to save money we're going to do a more details show at some point again on how to cut your cable cost um people spend\nHundreds of dollars a month or we had a bill at one point there was two fifty to sixty a month we've cut in half\nA and there are lots of ways you can do that so we spend money that we really don't need and if you do that you'll get ahead stop smoking right don't drink as much you have to have one once in awhile\nStop putting things on credit and credit cards and um you know if you do come into a little extra money paid on the high interest stuff first\nWe'll give you an example I had people in my office or just a few days ago and we're talking about what things to pay down to get ready for retirement in fact you were in that meeting with me Pete\nAnd they said well we have an equity alone in the house has a small balance on it it's coming up on its ten year term we're gonna have to\nEither refinance it totally into the mortgage or pay it off and they said well you're thinking about retiring says step one while you're still working you have a higher credit worthiness why don't you go out and refinance your home equity line with a different bag\nPay off your existing equity line\nAnd now you're going to have another ten year term and continue to make payments so what they've been doing is they've been taking and making extra payments so let's say they had a hundred and ... or a month payment due on their home equity line\nAnd uh actually it was like a hundred and fifty and they were around ended up to two hundred dollars\nSo on the one hand they're getting your head of the game 'cause they're paying a little bit of extra payments and they're going to pay the loan off a little bit faster that's good [noise] so then I asked what's the interest rate in the home equity line and it was four percent\nAnd I said All right so you've also got a credit card bill here with the ... of dollars on it was the interest rate on your credit card it's Eighteen percent I said so stop making the extra payment on your home equity line that extra fifty dollars\nInstead would you pay your credit card bill with Eighteen percent interest\nBut the extra fifty dollars on that loan because the interest rates higher and you're going to retire higher paying that first very important you agree absolutely okay [noise] um\nAnd help you I I like to do less I like to keep written goals and encourage you to do those kinds of things yourself but the most important thing as we said right at the very beginning is consistency\nAnd speaking of lowering bills and lowering phone bills I Know what you do insurance quotes be right so maybe you can talk about lowering insurance bills for people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Pete Braley in the Morning", "city":
