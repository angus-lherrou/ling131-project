of the current treasure because of the proposed expensive move of the physical move of the lottery from\nTwo um is it a where she's going to worry so they weren't brain freeze and bring a trained for ever\nI mean since the since the beginning and the decision was made a march to move to a not go out for one lease but to go for three so instead of one rent the commonwealth and the taxpayers are going to pay three rent one of those rent is going to go to Dorchester\nThe other to rent we do not know where they're going to go I went to the August meeting they didn't know I went to the September meeting they wouldn't say I went to last\nThe last meeting for October last week and there was no mention no discussion lease is up in January and they couldn't they acted like there wasn't a care in the world\nYeah that's how the old boy system works you know that\nAnd I don't I it's it's upsetting wells can shut up you have a successful\nLottery and that money comes back to our cities and towns and when you're wasting money on unnecessary moves and you're going to triple the rent that's problematic that is that is a waste of taxpayer dollars so\nI don't know where they're going to go\nJanuary the lease expires in January and I no one seems to care yeah I mean I don't know if they're going to be squatters\nI don't I I they have sensitive computer equipment that guard the

I think that there's panic in the Republican pored over those so I think that's why you see this particular plot to try to smear Mahler yeah that's what I'm Wondering are they all\nSay they're tried to hire women to claim that from Trump ... sexually harassed them and that's now been sent to the FBI to investigate the plot maps and bus to get more and they're doing this a week before the election\nBecause they're scared of that they're going to lose the house next week and the Mueller probe is suddenly going to move to center stage\nRight after November ... and this is a last ditch attempt I think to to rail the investigation yeah by impunity character Robert ... which will not work and didn't work\n[noise] and now has the possibility of flipping back on them when the FBI finds out will concocted squat and who put the money and they were offering the women twenty grand plus a pay off their credit card debt\nWell who's who's money as a you know who is there a Trump connection Missouri Trump backer is there a Trump donor who\nDid this in order to try to get more out of here\nBefore they lose the house next week that's what's at stake here they're scared to death of his life and I I think we had to keep our eye on we're not going to hear more about this plot for a while since the FBI hold us together but it's it's clearly looks like obstruction of justice\nAnd\nWatch out
