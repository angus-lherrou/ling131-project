[noise]\nFirst of all let me thank you for listening\nMy yes you are\nGood morning sir I appreciate you taking my call um I just want to do a pipe in on this um caravan with that the way I'm it's being described by liberals I I I look at the very different way but um\nTell me how you look at it I look at it as a\nMob um you know that are willing to um you know that that are looking to uh basically invade this country and uh you know they're not even willing to you know carry the flag of the ... the country they they wish to become part of um and I ...\nI ... if they did it if ah they carried the American flag and many of them would that change your mind\nI don't think it would I I don't think it would change my mind but it it would make me feel a little bit\nUm I I guess a more understanding if or if they're if they're willing if they're willing to come the good things which we know that I mean we know that they did not\nTravel this far without support and a lot of it and um I think there's a lot of us on the rights that understand where the support came from or is still coming\nFrom um but I my my my point is that is um\nDon't think that it's our job as radio listeners or even as talk show host do a ... to think about how we're going to solve this problem we've got enough problems within the country that that we could all be working on as a ...\nUm but this one this one is is something that's kind of secular and a little bit I'm a little bit strange and the fact that um\nThat that bringing the military um other than National Guard and the coast guard into into into the fray um becomes a constitutional issue\nAnd then the other fact is is that I trust in our president I really do I trust in our president I'm\nToo um make up for what I see is the only shortfall of um of his presidency is the fact that he has not completed the wall um it was something that I voted on and I wanted that wall to be built and it's a unfortunately\nThe Democrats or in my mind you any way the Democrats have taken advantage of this and that that you know that the the biggest thing I Will get done it yet\nLet me let me stop you there king Leo ... who had his he had his three hundred the president has\n... where did you say eight hundred or so down that listen you just hit on something that is the responsibility of thinking people of citizens that's what's happened in our country is we want others to solve our problems you just hit on it\n[noise] this mob is\nExploiting humanitarian ism\nDirectly and and it's also exploiting our American sovereignty so when you have exploitation light that that's how you think about this quote unquote caravan [noise]\nAll right that's how that's how you start thinking about well then what can we do to come up with an answer now tell you what most dancers will be very disappointed very disappointing\nAnd I ask you one more question bill yeah and I'll let you go yeah\nUm the my in my mind and like I said I'm just one individual or you know from the outside looking in and um you know obviously my my word means nothing in\nMy opinion means nothing but my thought is is that I have\nThe truck I have the trust and this president\nTo take this to the point where maybe maybe we're going to see some things that that ah that that haven't been done before in any president you know I'm\nTen years yet and I I really do believe that Trump will um he will stand fast and make sure that this does not happen\nAll right let me hold you there my dear friend I Want to thank you for calling in and I want you to continue to think this is the only way that we're going to solve problems [noise] All right you have a good day bill how writing it's also going to be the only way we invent things but\nFolks the military cannot solve this problem the president of the United states cannot solve this problem\nWe cannot solve this problem only Congress can only Congress can and they simply ...\nAnd to an as you point down to ... to potentially you know on undo civility in our country and just put that in our minds that's the person to blame\nI I'm I'm trying to think back to a previous investigations of this kind because we\nYou know we hear some of these law enforcement officials now expressing great confidence that they're going to find this person or persons trying to remember I in my recollection it did not take very long\nTo find Timothy McVeigh after the Oklahoma City bombing am I correct ...\nYes but there was more of the trail with Nixon the he was he was stupid as well you know leaving a paper trail with the fertilizer and whatnot but\nI mean but Michael ... um you have a very good point I think whoever's responsible for this is very stupid war and because of uh\nHow this person left behind the evidence for has done it on purpose in as very smart is a professional terrorist\nWell what would a professional terrorists have sent stuff that didn't go off\nFor ... whatever is all about the ... ever [laughter] yeah so you know yeah so um but just as\nA ... this was scary business and\nUm I Am I exaggerating when I when I say that what happened after the Kennedy assassination set something loose in the country and that that could have been magnified yesterday\nMhm no or any time there's a divide in people's spirits there is that is all he is possible that that happens and that's that's what this is done if you think about it it has divided us as a country\nAgain we are being divided and that's part of the uh I think the strategy of terrorism keep\nDividing keep dividing you know keep getting people ah um you know and that's why I Believe the president was so right that we need civility\nYeah but he has not contributed to civility come on I mean you know calling\nPeople calling Democrat evil calling Hillary Clinton evil saying hey any guy who body slammed a reporter is my kind of guy that's not civility\n... either is Ninety percent of the coverage that has been so ... so negative and as well nationally when you compare that to the results of what's happening in this country with\nUnemployment dean low we have a good economy we have we just going up\nIt's Ninety percent negative coverage that doesn't make any sense either\nUh well it's Ninety percent positive coverage on Fox\n[laughter] look look there's there\nIs a there is a routine that goes back to George Washington\nI how news outlets been critical absolutely that's part of the job of being president holding up your policies the things that you do and say holding them up to public scrutiny every president has gone through it\nSince Washington I mean Obama had his is a citizenship question George W.
