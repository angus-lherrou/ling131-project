[noise] ladies and gentleman in our audience\nWe have a an angel who has been a loyal resident and listener\nTo W. B. S. them she turns one hundred and six years old today Thursday a Tobar twenty fifth to our beautiful wonderful Marie ... ...\nMarie only Slovak is a hundred and six years old to Jay [noise] hundred and six years [noise] young [noise]\nHappy happy birthday from all of your family members from all\nThat is true that for the ... who went in to congresswoman waters and was a detector yes Steny Hoyer democratic member you still there he's the number to a Democrat in the U.S house ...\nSteny Hoyer still there\nThe number two we used to always say I'm no bad Dr Nancy ... we used to tell study we as Republicans were very happy that she knew him for minority leader because he got elected he might've became speaker and taken over [laughter]\nElse than either [laughter] good guy right\nOh wonderful guy yeah monitor I'm very thoughtful knows the system knows how to yeah really make it work so yeah we created that center because anthrax came in the\nU.S House complex and they went in the long work building where my offices were went into for offices it was weapons\nGrade anthrax that was the real deal where if it got in the system in the war and things you know\nYeah so before you create entire\nBuilding created that center\nSo before you created that center would a package just come right to you I\nAm sure that the capital right you're right there are people haven't been to the thing if you're standing there looking at the Capitol yeah you're looking at the Capitol\nIs there are three building a cannon the Longworth and the and the Russell building back the house complex in Alaska are three Senate buildings so prior to that all the mail came directly in those three buildings in the house offices went directly in their\nAmazing you know so I'm\nAn anthrax came in and the poor the offices and we evacuated everybody put 'em all around DC in temporary offices bottom temporary computers 'cause nobody could get back him had to put everybody on line I we had to cleanse the building and forty million dollars later\n[noise] moved everybody back in the building oh so steady and I said\nThere will be no mail delivered members screened beat their fists down you're taking away our constitutional right our constituents who are like no we're going to clean the mail and you'll get a delayed by a day and you'll get it\nAnd you are going to do some of them are really stupid aren't they when they\nAll they were also some of them are making a public issue of it the study and I were denying them they were demanding their mail\nThey don't wanna radiated we told them you know you don't get your mail radiation that\nComes in and you know in fact the entire building and that's forty million dollars everybody moves and somebody could die yeah you know\nYou don't ... I Want to ask the obvious why didn't anyone thinks that somebody could send a bomb directly to a congressman's address directly\nWell what they could all in their homes you may\nKnow there is the capital before you created the security center\nWell ... ...\nYou know feel actually I mean they had an X ray machine primitive they X rayed them all the mail and stuff will get through an x-ray machine so technically they could\nProbably probably catch things with wires but that machine did nothing to catch rice\nIn their anthrax when you open the letter it's all to kill somebody or it's all through the system\nWow right right [laughter]\nWe created we we got the technology and I'm actually I got a phone call from California man flew in on his private jet a came to meet with me and\n... and some of their people my staff and\nThe male is crying and he said I'm a businessman I'm not here for money you can have the device I don't care you said this is horrible\nHappened to our government yeah and that's what gave us the idea to radiate the mail which will kill any of the powder\n[noise] amazing what are your thoughts and what do you think the message is was all these packages\nWell here's the thing um you know\nRight now I never can be copycats like deniro could be a copycat or could be the same person I Believe that I'm not an expert at just dealing with these issues over\nThe years I Believe that whoever sent all these as of today maybe not to narrows but as of today it's either the same\nPerson or the same group I Want to say that same person or same group now\nThese are primitive for example the anthrax that came into the U.S Capitol to this day we don't know where it came from\nBut it was weapons grade anthrax which means that was developed very extensively in the ... system\nMeaning probably a foreign country okay okay now there's regular anthrax you can develop and the detectable now this is kind of the same thing these are pipe bombs crude in in the sense of a bomb\nSome of them are bombs we don't know about the rest of their they're saying they looked like bombs I don't know a couple of them are bombs and they're\nType so\nPipe bomb most likely with President Trump putting all full forces on this thing which he is they're going to catch this guy or gal and they're going to catch them or group mhm I I Believe\nThen we'll know so I think the same person or group has done this up to now it will probably be copycat people they are crude a weapons they're not the case that so it's somebody that knows enough to build a weapon like that but it's somebody that doesn't do enough to be caught\nYeah well it it seems like a whoever it is is a little bit stupid because exactly you know of or some of the details that they didn't think of and just sending them\nUh the way they did a is protective bubble you know I mean ... so ... was and what do you think ... I mean this is all psychotic but uh their message is what you know that they don't ... John Brennan or Eric\nHolder or well look there's a lot of theories out there and you know CNN has basically the c._e._o. CNN has blame this on pressure on trial I Know I Know you're going\nOn Trump I'm with you they find out Trump had nothing to do with this and it was somebody that wanted sympathy for the Democratic side which could happen then the c._e._o. CNN going to be really buying himself into fake news issues if the CEOs right and it was somebody that\nYou know yeah doesn't like the Democratic side and you know they're connected to Trump and it's different I think that the president\nObviously made some very good statement saying that you know a a scoreboard cetera et cetera yeah\nOn the other hand I Do think sometimes the president does not completely fully comprehend that sometimes the things he says\nAre magnified a thousand times I'm not sure he comprehends that to be honest with ya okay ah yeah I don't think he completely gets it yet he is the president you say things um you know yeah you gotta be careful [noise]\nUm but then again it's happened on both sides you had a member of Congress who are like yes disrupt people at restaurants yeah\nI think all the rhetoric tone ought to be toned down period all across the place but to come out now and say wow this is obviously a Democrat hater and Trump this is you know yeah I think that's unwise let's see who it was from why\nLet me ask you also you know or if the or is it the Chinese who are a wire championing are listening to the ... the president's iPhone conversations what's going on here\nI used to call blackberries crack berries [laughter] there were\nTwo hundred of them in the U.S house and I had one of the two hundred and we were testing that day nine one one happened\nI was a pilot for it with two hundred other people in the entire house system\nOkay yeah and the only thing that work that day the only thing was the blackberry\nAll the phone lines died all the cell phones died the only thing that worked in DC there's was a blackberry and I remember some return Steny Hoyer nights at how are you talking to people and so yeah so we went\nFrom two hundred blackberries to six thousand blackberries and three months\nAnd um and President Obama and I I say I'll just because they are addictive record the new things on the block present bomb I Love your blackberry right\nI think after three days somebody put their hand out and said\nYou Mr President we respect you give me your phone\nAnd they took it from me [laughter] I Know you've\nDone at the Donald comments that Donald Trump on a personal iPhone\nIf we just call in right now you're three of us can listen to lose ... ... what you've got to stop it Oh absolutely I won't call it ...
