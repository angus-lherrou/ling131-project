a cup of coffee with you get ready because we're going to get you off to work on time and the kids too I promise in the meantime you know all this stuff about Indian native ancestry all that crap with a Senator Warren the one part of this\nThat truly bothers me a lot of it is spin and twist you know that but\nThe part that really really bothers me is it well the first of all let me start off by saying she was\nA with the editors of the Boston Globe\nYesterday afternoon because she has been getting slammed by Democrats of her own party\nThey are so upset with her why she did what she did at the timing of it and the results of it\nOr everyone that some Democrats not only criticize drawn the timing of the release of this report but now she's at the editorial staff of the Boston Globe hoping that they\nCan help capitalize on this backlash by making things easier and making the inroads a little easier\nHer so that aside here's what bothers me the most when she was feeling out an application she did not put down but she was Caucasian rather she put down that she was Native American\nWhen asked for her\nHer makeup she did not put down Caucasian\nInstead she put down Native American or as a law professor and that's what bothered me why would she lie\nSo they asked her that yesterday they said why did you do that that was the most stupid thing you could ever have done and the senator expressed regret\nAlright she stopped short of saying I'm\nThe ship and ancestry [noise]\nYou know this is this is a a fly back to it all depends what the definition of\nIs is\nSo here we have a U.S senator who is fighting saying that there's a distinction between citizenship and ancestry\nAnd that's why she put down Native American and not Caucasian and then she says oh I Wish I had been more mindful of that distraction I'm Sorry folks I'm really sorry\nFor her I mean that nine nine six zero five hundred\nShow absolutely\nBlatantly stupid let's go to our phone lines good morning and welcome\nOh good morning or good morning I'm calling from the country yeah and I've only got thirty three degrees\nOh my I got ten degrees more than you well and listen tonight\nYou're going to have a different the momma did you call me a liar [laughter]\nYou're going to uh have a freeze tonight and tomorrow night so be prepared for that\nOh okay as far as reading war goes he's a pain in the short a goal yesterday he's a liar yeah but I feel about it yeah thank you very much that was it in the country\nAre you go from the sovereignty of Rochester morning\nAnd say maybe there's something to ... defense ... maybe there's not enough in this investigation we should wait and see which for at least\nSix days they're going to do\nSo it was a divided city council\nIt was and at one point it it appeared that I'm\nJust wasn't going to pass and and the stock\nThat's because a counselor Steven Camaro objected under city charter rules\nTo the city charter rule motion a to temporarily remove jays will Korea than he objected to another motion to take a vote of no confidence that he objected to another motion\nOf that would have requested by the city council to drizzle Korea for him to a voluntarily stepped down basically going on record as saying that they were asking him to step down he objected to all of those motions and ah\nThey voted to adjourn until next week's meeting where I'm sure all those will be taken up again\nIn the meanwhile did they have the protests yesterday afternoon it\nWas a I I wouldn't really call it that it was a very ill organized gathering of people with ... signs and at the very very disorganized it was not worth reporting\nOn a is there a recall of yes that was\nThat was the real news out of yesterday's meeting while the city council did not take any action one citizen a says she is starting to take action in recalling or at least beginning the recall process against a mayor Korea and her name is ... a ... a rat\nWho said I've started the process for recall just this afternoon before coming in here this was a ... in the U.S citizens input a section of the meeting last night and she said nothing gets done if nobody wants to do business with you and I'm very concerned that going forward\nOur city is looked down upon with a great scrutiny because as long as this mayor is sitting while he's fighting for his freedom I don't believe he can fight for us and no one is going to take him seriously so she\nUh disseminated her phone number during the meeting and uh is I'm sure are beginning to organize efforts to gather enough signatures to recall mayor Korea just as we'll Flanagan who wasn't attendance last night\nReally yes I was recalled [noise]\nWell ah that's ah my I wrote a blog last week saying if they're going to ask him to step down they should do it you know he was elected by the people and that people should a recall him is that be the case\nOr it'll be interesting between now and next to a council meeting whether or not to the recall will gain steam\nOr keep an eye on that anything else at a very interesting Tanner very interesting forty [noise] All right my friend or we will now turn to our phone lines and nine nine six zero five hundred and ... you have to say about this\nGood morning why do good morning how are you I'm doing well thank you good\nOn this issue with with\nLaura okay yep Native American mhm I feel a criminology incorrect\nAnd the reason I say I've always felt that it should be American indian Native American because I can say that I'm a Native American not of Indian descent I Would\nAnd I am an American well\nThat would take a long while for people to start thinking like you and to change his terminology correct in the meantime what did you think about her not putting down that she's Caucasian and putting down that she's something else instead\nNATO either if you were when we wrong in doing that you put down what you're supposed to put down\nAs I have been many others have yeah in the past and you put down you're correct um correct or writing what you're supposed to yeah so I think therefore she is wrong and she was an apology and she shook gun that immediately\nI agree and yesterday was a good time 'cause she sat down with the Boston Globe and is you know if you couldn't do it then I don't know when she's going to do it but I think she passed a via an opportunity to say you know what to speaking of missteps boom\nI made a huge mistake here and I apologize and we move on now but she didn't so\nYeah I don't think they're too um you know there was according to what we heard recently on her heritage that there were a lot\nFor her to be considered really oh an Indian Indian\nSign no what you mean in fact there was a laughing stock matter when you really think about it in its entirety it's just you know a farce and I don't know who this is what I Want to know who I'm On her staff somebody had to advisor right\nI Would I Would assume so at all so I Would assume so what I Would hope so but then again fire go wherever that was\nI have I have no you are because she has done nothing for this area yeah\nAnd especially you know the local Christian Community and such yeah I feel that she her band and does and as far as a run for the presidency I think uh that's a big joke opinion\nLibya I Love hearing from bulimia counter though of that because in today's news we find out that ah she repeated a call\nThat she voiced last year she sent another letter to Noah regarding a Carlos raw fails a federal fishing permits ... so what what she did last year she just kind

ah there was a Powell there of course Democrats have criticized her for her timing and for what the report said\nUh my question is who advised her to do this and the first place but that aside when

Native American\nSo they asked her and the board in the globe the editorial meeting what the hell was this all about\nAnd you know she came up with the weakest answer in my opinion and this is I think

Goldberg I Want to ah now go after the state lawyer who is at the center of the song ... Iraq storm apparently\nThe um [noise] Mr Goldberg\nHired this lawyer and a ... a lot of us are questioning why why why would the treasure uh hire somebody from the alcoholic beverage controlled commission that is controlled by Goldberg\nAnd employing this a former assistant attorney Kate ... who's accused of withholding evidence in the case against a that a soldier for Iraq who's criminal\nAntics of led to the dismissal of how many drug cases thousands thousands so I'm scratching my head here I'm saying why the hell would anybody want to employ a state lawyer who's at the center of controversy\nAgain it's the poor it's poor management decisions that just don't make sense throughout the fourteen agencies that the treasury I I'm things decisions that just don't make sense and they're not good for the taxpayers and it's it's really something that needs to change that wife step in [noise]\nUm [noise] the rest in Iran hoping for the people of New Bedford to push me

is an auction going on we talked about this off till I got a ... we had a lot to talk about long claimed property division a services are under Mr Goldberg's um you know her\nColleagues now does what do you think about this auction of on claimed property is being handled well or what\nSo again they're fourteen agencies under the treasury one of them as an claimed funds division there's there are three point four billion dollars sitting there right now that's a billion dollar increase over last year\nThat is your money your potential money if you go on find mass money dot com you can see if you have maybe forgotten a CD or are there some type of of a savings account that you had forgotten about and you can go get that money\nThe government should be finding you and helping to put together people with their property when you will the government money they certainly find you know\nOne ... and I believe that we should do a better job in that agency to find the rightful owners of the property so the auction\nStarted off this week they are going around the state they're showing off this uh this property that is supposedly just a out there and and um you know ... ... they're gonna they're gonna knock your stuff and sell it on ...\nYep absolutely sports cards um all kinds of rats roaches it could be grandma's broached and what you're saying is I don't mind\nIt is wrong find that people unite them with their property how much has been done how many calls have been made to find out who owns that stamp collection how many calls have been made that\nThat is not our stuff that is not the government stopped and we need to absolutely put a stop to that auction until we figure out what's going on with\nWith this agency where there's a tremendous increase in the amount of\nOf goods that they're holding onto\nA I'm with Republican state representative ... oral who's vying to unseat the Democrat incumbent Deborah Goldberg is state treasurer and so you want to see this property United rather than sold off\nI Do I Do I I I absolutely think that we need to do a better job in that agency\nOf having people understand first of all that they have the money and then second of all I was at an event last night and someone said that they they had four forms that they had to fill out including a a ... a deep from up our probate or something or pretend that ten dollars\nWe need to make it easier for people to get their goods back from the government\n[noise] do you feel as though of the current state treasurer has a record that uh she she can stand on with pride or where do you disagree with her record\nA it's a record of poor management is a record of inefficiency it's a record of wasting taxpayer dollars\nAnd it's a it's a it's it's a record that I don't think the commonwealth can afford\nShe just enrolled yesterday a new college fund where she's going to be getting fifty dollars to every baby that's born in the commonwealth where is that coming from as far as trying to set up a college savings on which you know laudable idea and in in theory um but I don't know where that money's coming from\nAnd who's going to manage that money and actually when they tried it and and now what stir it was a failure because they had four thousand families that qualified only a hundred people participated well and and the only the twelve thousand dollars\nIs how much it costs to administer the program how much two hundred and sixty thousand dollars\n[noise] she sixty thousand dollars so is the sickest effect folks if you're just joining us cake or all running for state treasurer is joining me and yesterday or the state treasurer held a press conference about this\nMuch hyped seed Massachusetts a college savings program\nBut what a shoe didn't review is the two year pilot program that flopped as Paco just spoke about in Worcester\nA all she said was hey we're gonna get fifty dollars to low income families who opened the college savings account for you know newborn babies I think in what twenty something or other twenty twenty or twenty Twenty one\nAnd I guess the best way to do this is to go back to the western telegram and ... and just look at the stories there are the failure of this so my question to you is why would Goldberg have a college savings flock and go forward with that\nUh again it's poor management is decisions that just don't make sense it's throughout many of the agencies under the treasury and with this decision I I have no idea\nWell as their state treasurer so much better\nThank you for
