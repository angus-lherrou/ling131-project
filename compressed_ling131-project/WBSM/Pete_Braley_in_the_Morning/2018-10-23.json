and I'm sure he's having a blast down there are catching up with all his his former classmates\nHe's referring to it as his twentieth reunion but since I've already had my twentieth I'm not buying it\nYeah well there you go I ... you know this is a man with a Tim Weisberg he's going to keep the control some going for me I'm I'm not a well you can ask my staff and the the really technically a\nUm [noise] well pretty inept at the the technical stuff when it comes to computers and those kinds of things and I'm only as good as a as of course the people around me and thank God many of them the amount of work computer\nBut um she was funny I walked in and said these are you an early riser I said oh yeah all my life I get a a nobody really need an alarm clock to him I mean I get up a quarter of five usually every morning with a warm climate\nBut that comes from what I was a kid you know twelve brothers and sisters in our church was only a block and a half from where I grew up and um [noise] so\nI for some reason I couldn't get into those older but every morning my parents' during the week would go to six thirty mass so I'd get up get dressed and go to mess with them or six where I was up in adamant\nAnd um my brothers and sisters not very many of them were regulars doing that it was pretty much me in a regular basis and that was thought to myself why the heck did I Do that every every day and I'm right elementary school and then I realized when I got older I thought you know\nThe only time that I ever had the chance to just be with my parents alone with my with my twin brothers and sisters but there was another advantage to it because when I got home\nI was already get ready for school so I sat up at the breakfast bar and I I was the person that\nStarted buttering all the toast and you can imagine the the stack the toast that we had it with a Thirteen kids getting ready for breakfast loaf of bread a day yeah and there was no more going back to bed because I'd have one sister another coming out on a sheet where my curlers now she's part took my blouse and uh you know this was this was sort of almost a daily routine you know but uh\nAnd so these are these are facts and these are things that are happening where people are coming into the legal\nAnd a and they're basically\nYou know not all of them but a number of them are coming in and do wreaking havoc in our schools they're intimidating kids missed ...\nPercent of the problems are real wide problem in sex thousands absolutely\nYeah and and and look we're not we're the most generous country in the world look my father my father is an immigrant my father's an immigrant from England\nOr my father came in the right way and for all the these people who are who are the advocates saying oh we need to let these people in the running from this running from that how was how or seven to fourteen thousand people\nGetting across from Honduras walking\nWhat are they eating if they're not funded by George source of these other people about\nThat and and if you look at the last of them get a look like that like just Avon\nKnow and obviously healthy but could you could you walk a thousand miles and and and not eat and not drink ... in in where you get your food you know and so what's happening is these you know the George sources of the world who want America to be socialist nation\nUm have been at this for a long time and think about this these these are people what would it these are Americans who were\nIn that they're going to change the way our life is going to be in America who gave them the right to decide just because they have money that they're going to make it what they want it to be this is America where we decide what our country's going to be by are who we elect and you can't uh you can't negate all that because you are [noise]\nYou know you don't really I'm necessarily agree I mean but we got we got a other callers and I don't want to hold them\nBut I at least I appreciate your calling this is Tom Payne thanks for getting up so early on my Web I have a great day they call you they're going share good morning how are you I'm well how you doing I'm doing good thanks good\nUm I um [noise] months ago I think it was like you and\nAll this you know they share his role about this program to uh to in effect I go find me type programs to build a wall yes\nA safe then I haven't heard anything about it and you give us an update or right yeah and update on what the progress has been on I thought it was a great idea by the way and I was thinking the\nSame thing before you guys brought it out I think it's a great idea\nYeah sure what you know we went down to a I had gotten forty four share some thirty five states who go to Washington DC and uh one of the things we did while we were there was told the press conference uh up in front of the house side of the U.S Capitol at the press try and go to tell\nA Congress that you know we were all done Twenty years of total inaction um their their failure to to address and continue to turn a blind eye toward the number of for example families who've lost loved ones at the hands of illegals coming in\nUm what's not okay or you know when they knew that you know the drugs are pouring into our communities we have an opioid crisis and they sit on their hands\nOr frankly on their butts in in in some instances in the house side protesting like pitching the children instead of dealing with the issues that are affecting the families of people all over this country\nYou know we don't want our children exposed to drugs we know what addiction does to these kids and the dangers of more and more drugs coming in so we said you know what you weren't going to build this while you're not going to stop the flow a every state now is the worst state based on the people that are that are migrating throughout this country illegally\nAnd so the sheriff's who are elected by the same people all over this country are going to mobilize\nAnd we're going to join together with people that we promised to protect and we're going to find a way to get this wall built and so we started now vis a vis page it's a fun to wall dot com that's fun to wall dot com where people can go on and actually just donate\nOr to the wall and you know um [noise] I ... right before I went to Washington this past um a couple of weeks ago we um my ... one of my staff members came and said you gotta look at this a letter that just came in\nSo I looked at the envelope and on the on the return address it was from someone in Ontario, Oregon trail I open it up\n[noise] there's one in five dollar bill and five one dollar bills attached to one of the one dollar bills is a note that says please build the wall between Mexico and the United states that this is probably somewhat of modest means\nAnd I I I even a child\nBut I don't know if the child could have written as well but possibly but in either case um [noise] I lead to the we laid the five months on on the table top with the five dollar bill in the envelope took a picture of it sending out to all the sheriffs and said\nThis person represents the absolute best of America\nAnd there are a lot of us out there and ... and ... and then there sure are and\nAnd this is someone who wants but however much money they had to ... to to donate\nBig or small they knew that they were making a difference for their community and for the nation and so um [noise] we're at now I'm In just a few weeks we're over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars and climbing and we haven't really uh you know pushed this uh\nThis optic yet but it's coming soon I Know we're we're talking about um course delivering the first installment to a homeland security and um and we think once that happens of course to share some of the country you're going to be going the other media outlets and informing\nTheir constituent I've been waiting for I haven't heard anything about\nIt yeah it's coming they were just ready they wanted to get to a hundred thousand mark and then present and here we go so\nI'm I I'm going to have to go to break and we got to go to a ... we

work and stuff having having so much fun not to be in front of the rate of course she does but I'm In this next\nHour or we have a special guest in Studio and I'm excited to um to have with us uh this is a someone who has served for thirty two years ah with the personal can sheriff's office and um [noise] elevated himself through the ranks to\nThe head of our security operations and or or or a superintendent who's got a lot of responsibilities over and above the security pieces while he does a great job force and for all of you and that's a superintendent Steve Sousa Steve thanks for being here today it's great to have showers\nSo um [noise] Steve's I'm rubbing his hands will be like a list I Want to take over the Mike and want to be the ... and rather switched places because I Want to run the show and and of course he does over at our place anyway\nBut but um I thought we'd we'd start out I'm\nKind of doing a little bit of um traced back in history 'cause I think most people\nDon't really see they don't really know what we do 'em inside the prison they know that we you know that the idea that there's people who've who've made mistakes all the way a who have committed crimes ended up being re mandatory place for for a for however long\nUm [noise] that that's basically what we do we keep people in there for the time that they sentenced and then\nUm they come back out and hopefully have rehabilitated themselves will get into that little bit as well but\nWhen asked street actually was the\nPlace that people could be house up to what year did ... down with open nine Nineteen Ninety Ninety and you were there I was\nI'm going to say you weren't there at the opening of action is that fair to say that's fair to say ... she would never pass for for that that age and I'm not sure you could ride a horse or run a carriage either but but anyway um so when Ashley open\n... street in New Bedford there wasn't much around it right it was pretty much the jail in and out farmland and the sheriff had to live in the house they've it's still there right that's correct and um and of course we know Lizzie Borden was there she was and um\nBut but it started out we were we were we were housing pirates and buccaneers is that correct that's getting at the beginning and that's what was basically around so what was what was the\nWhat were the types of crimes you will be held for back then\nI probably failing to pay that public drunkenness like five bucks was a big deal oh yeah absolutely yeah it's a big deal anymore well for ... like a street it'd be a big deal but\nYeah absolutely I mean we're we're detox and on an average of seven point nine individuals per day um and\nThe most in the come in they come off\nCorrect um you know the leave\n... roughly one in you know eight individuals per day and we're running seven point nine per day and\nWe don't have the capabilities and the um the design of our facility to be doing the detox is appropriately we have a small medical unit has to wards and and for cells and we have\nFemale population we have protective custody we have people that have a medical conditions that house in these areas so to detox that many per day is very difficult in housing them as well\nYeah and and and for the critics out there that that really don't understand what what goes on in the prison you know if they want to help with perhaps they should go to the legislature and say listen you know open up ... state hospital detox you know half the court\nIf somebody's going to be reminded to any of our places have regional sites around the the commonwealth that that actually treat do detox and\nHave the the courts remained them through a secure location like a ... state hospital do their detox there once they're completed detox come to the prison and finish your time what would be the ideal correct I mean that would that the lemonade a lot of the exposure and the and the and the difficulties that prisons are facing\nAbsolutely I mean when we have somebody detox and you know they're they're sick you know they're in a housing unit with or even in the medical unit with someone else it isn't necessarily detox and then you have somebody that's\nThat's ill then you know if it raises a tension between the individuals that house there because you let somebody that's next year that may be vomiting gorgeous you know moaning and groaning 'cause their day detox and and you've got somebody that just there to you know do they time so it it would make it easier for us\nThey used to have a a location where the detox this could be completed and then taken back into the facilities and classify them appropriately for them to you know await their sense of thing or you know to do serve all the time\nYeah and and for the officers uh that that I mean you you weren't experiencing that maybe he ... no not at all ... that was sort of a a minor thing we wouldn't have made public drunkenness a lot some drugs but lots of degree we have today right\nYeah definitely not to the degree I mean you you had individuals that would would doing drugs and coming in on drug offenses but they weren't nearly um as a needed detox and the way that individuals I needed them now\nAnd and there's you know there's been there's been discussion around ... suicides are highest rate of suicides happening in jails that's no secret um I think the average forty six isn't forty six a hundred thousand one hundred thousand\nUm and so it's it's always been a challenge for all our prisons and jails across the country\nUm but what what are the challenges I mean ... the officer wants to ever come up on all the suicide\nWhat is it what are the challenges that make it more risky for the officers that we have to train them to make sure that they're looking for certain things and that kind of like what are the things that they were doing you know than we ever have you on that too\nYeah we we have a behavioral unit for in you know individuals that are um potential at risk for you know harming themselves or um behavioral issues where you know they may be a cutter or they may\nBe smearing feces or just I'm just trying to manipulate the system so we we have a specific unit for those individuals we have one for the males and one for the females wet well\nI'm actually have intensive therapy and counseling sessions with them where they'll have to do um group sessions with a clinician they'll have to do individual counseling um\nTo try to change their behavior and get them back on track to be able to go back into the general population and just serve their time until their theory the cliff with court or you know complete the sentence 'em so you know the staff are always on high alert to make sure that individuals as safe\nUm they're monitoring if somebody you know 'cause back from a visit and they don't seem to be I'm too happy or they seem to be mad about something happens yeah they'll keep an eye on 'em you know they may even go over speak to them and say is that within a right and\nYou know nine times out of tend to say I just had a bad visit when my girlfriend or whatever else are\nWe still held to cook contact mental health oh yeah we we absolutely I'm a staff as is informed that you know somebody's got to change in any type of behavior or you know if they normally upbeat and they now seem to be you know very quiet or they're not going over to the child how to eat\nYou know I Will make sure that a medical was notified using the mental health clinicians will come out to the unit speak with them or they'll have him go down to the to a mental health unit\nAnd a and have a conversation just to make sure and we and we do that whether it's somebody gets off of a phone you know that at night when they're on their recreation and there I'm able to call their family at home and they hang up the phone or they slammed the phone down and they walk away and they were all you know aggravated you know the staff will go over speak to them\nJust to make sure that you know everything's okay sometimes it's just you know they have an argument like anything else and you know and other times it's you know hey\nI'm I'm seeing somebody out so you know that can be\nVery different more difficult call of course right but you know I saw an amazing statistic that too long ago\nUm [noise] where are we sort of ... of summer for the national shares where which was packed because the the topic was suicide in prison and everybody's going for it but but what are the statistics that they revealed was that six\nOf people who are committed to mental health institutions that jails this is where the mental health institution that's what they focus on six percent of the people there commit suicide inside the institution like that never mind\nWhat the challenges then you elevate to inside a prison where are people are trained as best we can train them to pay attention to the current things that are coming up the trans the new\nYou know the the new a mental health a sort of analysis that they suggest you things you do but our people are responsible for\nThe making sure that the people are getting the programs making sure that there's there's a word or in these in their in their units that there's no problems they have to pay attention to whether you know inmates when the meats trying to create a distraction\nSo inmates can do something else trying to smuggle drugs in trying to do all these things the officers are responsible for making sure\nThat everybody in their safe but something doesn't happen to fight stone so they have to pay attention to all that in addition to this idea that they've got what Seventy and a unit yeah they actually we have up to a hundred and four and a couple of value in it so ...\nSo you know imagine I mean you know I can you imagine what it's like for a teacher in a classroom right trying to pay attention just the kids in the classroom right right and that's that's what real imagined a unit where they can move around it's it's um\nYou know it's all evolved ... was pretty linear kind of place right dark but there's a sprawling complex with different units and people can move up and down around some units or\nAn secured doors others\nAre secured more control\nSo we're gonna we're gonna this is this is I'm sure fasting for a lot of people who've never looked inside a prison in with your experience do you for thirty two years that it's a great insight you know to give people a real perspective of what's going on and what needs to have we're going to go to break we got to pay for our bills force and ah\nAnd then we're gonna come back and we're going to talk more about what's going on there and talk about the officers that\nWhat they go through and how difficult for the job is and maybe even we'll talk a little bit about the\nYou'd equities around their competition All right\nWe're him for to understand that a lot of the car

it's the the nurse comes in for their medication or document every clinician\nThat will be documented within a log book um any time somebody goes and speaks with the individual if they're asking to speak to somebody everything gets documented so that we have a record that as to what they've been doing in that period of time that\nThey want to hear so so you are a sexually for visual you see you might walk into a unit and if somebody was on I Will watch you might you know if you're sitting on a high school right in front of the glass right in front of the door and looking into the glass for that entire eight hour period\nYes correct ... they'll have a a chair that will be elevator so that they can see into the windows of the door they'll have a table with a lot of books on whether they'll be able to document all the actions that the individual is is doing like I said if they're sleeping\nWhether they're um you know sitting at a desk all looking out the window was engaging with you know I'm a medical staff person and whatever else all that is is\nIs there and it's all witness buys you know the medical the correctional staff of the ...\nYeah and you mentioned about Dr

she in fact he's he's developed as me I'm sort of a ... it's going to\nBits of everybody to I think launches network where it'll identify for the officer somebody\nSomebody that they've determined may be a suicide risk would be given this bracelet if I'm correct uh and then the officer would be alerted in the unit if the person begin that breaks it wouldn't work the officer that person a starting to\nAh get ready to commit suicide correct\nYeah he he's developed ... you know a bracelet and he's you know fine tuning you know and I believe he's going to be high limit 'em\nOn several individuals very shortly and you know ultimately it will determine you know if in individuals you know whether it's a hot rate or you know just a body mechanics if there's an indication that something elevated that they're you know getting angry or they they're um\nSanta field depression and whatever else that'll alert the staff um that that person you know maybe feeling something and they'll ... especially if that individual probably be on a Fifteen minute watch because they'll have a bracelet you know that'll give the staff I'm an advance notice that there's something vigils and how you know could happen\nYou know it's interesting when he first told me about it I I I probably like most listeners probably thought you know people were depressed I'm feeling that they wanted to commit suicide that their blood pressure would actually be much lower rate\nBut in fact when they're getting ready to at least attempt to commit suicide the this is what I think the thing is based on this technology that the pulse increases\nAre dramatically correct yes so to and then it sets off the alarm in the ... getting ready to get to the cell that I'm In that will be harmed some cells\nSo I'm working at all I

Donald Trump supported get up early we've enough though to work every day and don't sleep much right you know we don't\nRight outside of our country non US picking on other regimes that's why it's open open warfare you don't get the same protections that you do in the United states that's the way this is the best country in the world you can disagree you can say what you are and you don't get killed for it\nYeah although I you know it does become I'm sure you agree becomes very complicated when you start to get into um the the situations where we're aligned with the Saudi Arabia who\nUm of course the the purchase a lot of our our military equipment in addition to which they're obviously helping us in the situation ah over in the middle east\nI'm In turkey and and so it's it's a real it's a very complicated situation whereby we are sort of partners and then the question becomes because we don't we don't believe in doing that in our country um it it becomes a question of\nDo you stand with people who do those kinds of things I'm not saying we should we should I mean the whoever's responsible for killing anybody or to be held accountable but um I hear your point that yeah it's not our country and certainly this guy wasn't soon but we\nWe do work with those countries and we can I\nAdd that look at the Israelis go on and on about them right and you know [laughter] well ... then that is that the longstanding partner in in what goes on behind the scenes who knows right but what ... with that said um you know the Democrats for sure\nPick on Israelis all the time that I Would say Ninety five percent of you know Jewish Americans Jews whatever a vote Democrat right so\nI I understand what you're saying this is because it's about Trump they're trying to pin it on a tour and they can look that this is what this is all about almost everything in the media has been very surprised that Fox News because it because\nThis just makes you write the president that because of the ills that he wants to continue to further which we've been doing for decades this out and and I and I just find that that that's not a good reason to continue to push this story\nYeah if you well my sense is that I mean obviously is a big story when somebody gets killed and so I have never see him in and of course that's newsworthy inviting us to have the\nRight I understand no I understand it

said he was crazy now he calls and beautiful Ted Texas\nFisher well I I guess I I guess my sense would be I'm sure it would be difficult to get back to get past personal attacks but but I think you probably degrees me that it's it's always been said that politics is a blood sport it's a little different than\nThan perhaps the world series tonight when they don't they don't get to a point when they start them were gets to be that bloody but but the truth is I think in the end I'm much like\nWhoever wins this World Series you fought hard you did everything you could do you if you're really a fierce competitor yeah you can do it in more decent wages in politics but the reality is in the end\nYou have to look at the bigger picture which is I'm showing examples of coming together and I think particularly with that\nYou know a foreign place to travel from where they both were one time or another it's not a bad example for people in the country to see that okay it's mine and those those really sort of\nBlood competitive comments that went on um then in the end you can come together and you should come together in in for the greater good so I I kind of look at it from that perspective as opposed to how they each got there um and what that motivation was but what the benefit is for the country\nWell Trump was asked yesterday if he regretted all the horrible things that he said about cruising cruises family and he replied I don't regret anything honestly\nYou know in other words he's still saying that um Cruz's father helped assassinate John Kennedy\nLook I understand politics is the art of compromise sure I understand that we would all like to see\n'em examples of you know people getting along in Washington\nAnd they know they don't anymore um there there comes a distinction in my eyes between politics and selling your soul sure somebody\nMade that kind of remark about somebody in my family helping to assassinate presidents somebody if somebody made remarks about my wife I Would draw the line they're\nShort um then that's understand why I don't disagree with you I mean I I think the but unfortunately or fortunately politics people or the\nThe the view it's many of them very differently it's sort of the big reader reader good and I think it's part of the sort of the selfish part of of politics where\nBecome very focused on what is important for them and not necessarily just in this instance but overall there's too much too much focus on\nWhat really matters to the individuals and have the individuals can benefit versus versus the outcome for the people that um you know I often refer to it is too often people in politics push things through their personal political filters\nRabbit they need on that side and whatever comes out the other side is what's leftover\nWell that has been my big complaint and and many people complained about\nThis president that he puts his own interests above the interests of the country and um yeah tends to to wander away from the truth\nUm he is desperate to keep the Congress in the hands of the Republicans is saying things now that are simply not true and he's talking about riots in California\nAnd there are no riots going on in California um when asked about it he says go look for them you'll find them or he's talking about there's been massive voter fraud there's been a massive voter fraud no evidence of it whatsoever he talks about these people who are walking trying to walk\nTo the United states from Guatemala and says that there are um Middle East terrorists among these Guatemalans there's no evidence of that whatsoever\nBut that was reported I leave my that was reported on by Mexican journalist who is actually embedded in group and in addition to which the the report on the Mr team members that are that are most of them we know I've been down to the border three times I mean\nThere are ... that have been found on on the properties of ranchers down there there's\nThere's clearly a ISIS ISIS is going to try to get in any way they can into this country and um and so we would make sense I mean if you're going to get in here and you you're gonna you're gonna embed yourself into a group of thousands of people are they know that they'd be very easy for them to to to get across the border\nAnd a carry out the um\nYou know catastrophic event if they could do it and we know that there we've we've kinda been silenced and we think they there really is you know the weight Ninety three years when they hit the world Trade Center they waited until nine eleven to do it again but they were very patient and they are very patient people we've got to be on top of it\nThat's right we have to be on top of it and not make claims that are empty claims a unless we can show it to people\nAnd I sure if if they're going to make that kind of a claim proven otherwise you're engaging in fear tactics and\nThat's what's going on now in two cases\nWell when you got for seven seven thousand counting don't coming across the border um that in itself is a ... is a fear factor just looking at the if the people coming through going you know what we're coming there were crossing through these other countries were coming to the United states and\nAnd so I'm like the American people ever write my mind to be very concerned about what's going on and the president ought to be setting off the arms to make sure that that are\nThat the American people are on alert just exactly what's happening so what we were gonna have to probably ... or ... have another conversation hopefully even though the time
