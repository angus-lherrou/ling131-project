founders award recipient Daniel Lopez right to ship all ... yeah\nWell uh we should start a bit with the talking just a little bit about the history of Denison um it started and women played a big role in this started this agency didn't they\nThey did and I'm as a matter of fact the the men who had a desk and today we're really aware of this last year when we had our\nFirst Denison founders award dinner um it had it came about uh through a series of events I was researching and found out that for women a hundred and fifty years ago this year founded Dennis and uh it was founded as the women's mission society New Bedford women's mission society I think\nAnd on that entity became Dennis and memorial and um and it was the name for a man I'm which as a woman is an interesting turn of events it it suited to the times I suppose\nBut um myself and the board chair list\nNot to the extent that that men are and I'm so this was an effort to continue the the fine work up those founders and and helping the poor\nAnd I'm a ... and children in New Bedford and and honor some women who are leaders today and Danielle is among among those who was a Denison member and is now a a tremendous leader\nThe kids that I grew up with that the reason why I started going would learn to change their behavior is like if you want to be here you have to put in the ... the respect that you're about to be given in this room\nAnd I think a lot of my friends at the time really shaped up and I I it's beautiful and in in New Bedford I think a lot of things that women\nWith or leaving I struggle with bar often led astray by I don't want to say too much but a lot of times it's men in our age where we're all crazy about boys image Debbie on who was in the home or groom she's like well I'll be chasing those bizarre voice\nAnd I think that was one of the most important thing is when you were in ... it wasn't it wasn't your you weren't flirting because again I said I was ... until I was Fifteen I was well into middle school at the start high school it's when you're really starting to get into that\nBut in his room and homework room it was really a space where you would just you it was in about\nTrying to be something you weren't it's about learning doing your work and helping others because as you grow you start to know more than the people that you started with when I was a of course I didn't know much more than the kids that were there but as I grew I could actually helped I don't like\nThis is what I was doing when I was yeah let me help you and you could see that that was a thing that I got when I was there there is older kids that were helping me with my homework and it was all it's always been that tradition for them to have that it's the older kids handed off to the young kids as they grow in through Denison\nIt should be a great night the founders awards dinner November attempt at a rituals lakeside or at the uh Westport Dartmouth mine so how can folks get

navigate to to the Denison website to write their front and center with a button for tickets and all of the details of the time and place and all of that\nAnd write any closing thoughts about uh about Dennis and Daniel we'll start with you\nI think it's an absolutely great cause to come out and it would be really beautiful to understand that again if you show up its attributing to everyone's greatness everyone that's in that room in that greatness is recognized and be great for yourself every community\nI'm going to get the recipe for that dirty\nWhatever [laughter] in the dirt putting I

leadership make good choices in their life Christian welcome back thank you thank you um for those who don't know a question what is south coast young Marines\nSouth 'cause your Marines is a a youth group organization is actually a national uh youth organization\nFor kids from eight years old to complete the high school a that stresses a teamwork discipline living a drug free lifestyle\nUh you know our mission for young Marines is supposedly impact America's future by providing quality youth development program for boys and girls a that nurtures and develops its members into responsible\nCitizens of who enjoy and promote a a healthy and drug free lifestyle\nSo this program up\nAnd I think it's kind of a misnomer I think sometimes some folks feel this is a program for people who are some ... a troubled youth case who\nAre maybe than led astray a little bit in addition to a program to get them on the right track well it's a program to get kids on the right track but it's not necessarily what people with some difficulty\nAh no actually that's correct It's it's not um I like to call this a ... in my own words a good kid program\nUm a lot of times you have programs like you have youth court you have um several other uh groups and organizations out there to help kids that needed assistance and they should get the assistance\nOf yelling program or the program is not a program for youths with serious a disciplinary problems or a substance abuse issues or lengthy histories with juvenile court\nThese are for those good kids I'm like I said there's a lot of programs out there for kids who need that assistance but you don't see a lot of programs for kids that are just flat but it's a good kids\nUm a lot of times you'll find that you know these kids that do need help are getting the help but the kids that you know hey I'm just the kid I'm a good decent kid and I want to have some fun I Want to actually learn about different things I Want to have that structure\nUm they're not really out there unless they do something wrong and young marine program it's like no we want those kids we want you to be in good standing at school and at home\nHow many I'm a young people are involved at this time in the ...\nIn our unit itself we have um a total of forty two is aging from eight years old to Eighteen I'm losing ... was a current oldest marine I'm twelve of those youth are a robocall recruits or their recruit training right now they're learning how to become a young marine\nRight um there is a fee to join us yes there's um talk the talk to me a little bit about the the uh ... it's a it's a one time the or there\nIs a one time fee for the training um and what this covers is it covers um their uniforms which would be the boots trousers blouse T shirt or their cover their belt um the registration with national headquarters\nI'm trying to think what else is in the recruiting ... which is an Kevin is we actually take them on an overnight trip\nUm possibly to a military base or a to a camp site and basically it's for a lot of it's the first time they actually get away from mom and dad and they kinda\nGet that empowerment of saying I'm On my own with my peers and I'm learning you know how to be my myself how to be my own a person um [noise] and what else I'm trying to cross it covers uh [noise]\nSo the uniforms they're guidebooks uh which actually is kind of a guy who just what it sounds like a guidebook that kind of gives him a guide of how to how to be a better leader how to do certain movements and drill movements and drawing ceremony\nHow to how to dress or or their grooming standards what they should look like you know um how their hair should be kept for the males\nUm how they should look in uniform what uniforms like how it should be pressed ... be polished 'em all these things actually build character and it gives them a structure and I've found that children especially that age they really crave that structure I mean a lot of times people think kids just want to\nGo out and you know be wild and have fun but actually they really crave that structure and they enjoy it and they thrive from it\nUm so this is the one time the\nWas the one time ... that's three hundred dollars that covers all that there are um an annual fee\nAbout a hundred and fifty dollars which covers dues which would be for like um things that we'll have to recruit throughout the year I'm new guidebooks new uh\nUh ribbons are wars that they've received um a lot of times we'll use that those funds for what we call a a a fun night or funding can't meant where we'll go somewhere like either a laser getting kind of let them you know blow off steam and have some fun sure things like\nThat so and this is again this is an all volunteer staff that you have in his staff immediate chef for four or five people is that\nWe have all the stuff is uh myself I'm my executive officer image for barrel my ... which is ... doctor just ... it was actually my wife\nUm and then uh have uh several training officers um most of us are prior service I was in the marine corps a Mr barrel was in the Army National guard\nUm I have several others that were either in the Army National guard\nThe air force or Air National guard [noise] um [noise] and then I have a few parents of young Marines actually joined in that saw the program really enjoyed it and said they want to volunteer their time\nAnd uh what helps with them as um when they come in I always ask every adult what you bring to the table how are you going to help out a these kids in this program what can you do and a lot of times\nThey come out and and these parents do a lot of things they they're they're willing to actually learn and follow the curriculum that we set forth for the Marines and they find the same thing that I found that their kids end up thriving in the program they they they they they crave that ah that structure\nUm you've been doing this or we talked before a turning on the recording devices here and uh you been doing this for ten years yes ten years younger ages started before that\nOh yes you actually have an ... program started of initially started I Believe in Nineteen fifty who I'm going to be amused me mad at me if I don't know the day I Want to say it initially started in Nineteen fifty nine in Danbury, Connecticut\nUm but the actually ...

long\nBut\n[noise]\nUm\n\n\n\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nSo in this chapter of relations five we have looked at the things that um are of the flash and we did those for quite a while\nAnd now we're looking at the things that are of the spirit and we have looked at um a couple of us who are actually two and I'm going hopefully into the third one today\nBut just as a quick review we did notice in the previous study that there is not a plurality of fruits but one fruit and all of this fruit is made up of several inter related graces of virtues which are only manifested if one is truly walking in the spirit\nSo it's just not something that you can snap your fingers and have\nIt is something you actually have to work on the first one and prominent in these virtues is love which we observed as an defined as active goodwill and it seeks the highest good of others and it was best exemplified by Jesus himself who\nTruly gave us an example of\nHow we should love one another and [noise] we talked about how that love should be the universal motive for every single thing that we do and um I Know this is difficult and\nOften times there are things people events happening to get on our way to kind of push loved down and we want to go the opposite of what the virtue of love is but you'll find that if you you know pull yourself up by the bootstraps and\nConcentrate on handling things would love that they'll go a lot smoother\nThe second um virtue that we started last time was joy and this is also founder glaciers chapter five\nAnd briefly we looked at the fact that joy is in the Holy Spirit and that um there is a definition of joy it is a Greek word\nAnd that is that it's ... or delight and there is definitely a connection between grace enjoy because once joy is directly proportional to the grace that you have received or at least to the perception\nOf the grace that you have received [noise] we read that the joy of the lord is abiding and this is of course part of how we live our lives we want as Christians to be full of joy and\nAll the hope and faith that you have for your future so we have this wonderful joy is not a joy that the world's can give us it's a joy if the lord that's open to anyone who wants to receive it and we received this to to reiterate\nWe received this through things such as faith in Christ obedience to his will forgiveness fellowship with his disciples and of course service in his kingdom if you do find that\nYour life seems to be lacking joy I suggest that you get up and get out and volunteer somewhere we have many many places that you can give of your time Salvation Army gifts to give we have a\nFood truck that goes around and deliver through to people you can go to a rest homes there are many people and rest homes\nThat have no one visit them and just a you know five minutes of your time talking with someone um would certainly make their day and I guarantee you that you probably would get more joy and blessings out of it\nThan the people that you are serving so remember service is a good way to get 'em this joy in your life especially if you find that you're lacking joy and we do know that the joy of the lord is your strength\nAnd if you feel uncomfortable volunteering because you don't know people just try it\nIt really will um you really will find that your life is enriched by it and you can begin experiencing destroyed by obeying the gospel receiving forgiveness because Christ dice Russians and participating in the fellowship of Christian love\nAs you work toward bringing others to salvation and also to serving those others that you come in contact with\nSo that leads us to our next um fruit of the spirit and that\nIs that we are in tune with the spirit of God and that is of course he's that the spirit of God shoot induced peace in the children of God should be understandable in the light of the fact that they're heavenly\nFather is the God of peace and Wi Fi miss 'em expression and first that's alone in chapter five for twenty three\nAnd a very ... piece sanctify you holy\nAnd I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so we see that God himself is the God of peace and we are able to get\nA piece that passes all understanding threw him we also know that Jesus himself was called the prince of peace\nAnd this is in I say a chapter nine where it was the prophecy talking about um the coming of the savior and I say a chapter nine VR six\nFor unto us the child is born on to us the sun is given and the government she'll be upon his shoulder\nAnd his name she'll be called wonderful counselor mighty God the everlasting father the prince of peace so this was a title that was given to Jesus even before he was born\nBut you might ask what is this piece enjoyed by those who walk in the spirit and how does one come to have this peace and how can we be sure to preserve this peace and enjoy it to its fullest extent\nAnd that can really tell you right now if you're not are not experiencing this piece which I myself am blessed to experience than it really is something you should work on because\nYou'll find your life changes so much when you finally give 'em move away from what the world's expects and\nWhat the world and how would the world expects you to react and you move into this world of walking in the light 'em and um so you might want to listen carefully this morning to see how you can develop this piece\nSo um what is peace well first of all sometimes pieces to find a negative terms\nWe go the opposite to explain what it is and many people will think of peace as simply the absence of conflict\nFor example I'm Oliver Wendell Holmes said the only condition of peace in this world is to have no ideas or at least not to express them so this is you know an absence of something that shows you what pieces\nUm another definition that we have our talks about pieces he knows peace who has forgotten desire and I don't think that's true either because you can have peace and still have desires\nBut of course the biblical definition which is the one we should look at includes positive elements\nWhich I think is more important the great it is a Greek word of course and it is defined as harmony um something that works together\nIf you have if you're musically inclined at all\nAnd you hear a group of people singing in perfect harmony um it is really something very pleasing and if one just one person is often that harmony it can really spoil the whole song so harmony is something that blends together that is something that we should\nDefinitely strive for and um it is in the New Testament the tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ and so fearing nothing and content with your earthly lot\nWhatever sort that is so if you want this perfect peace you really have to remember that your time on earth is a limited time and that you have\nUm a chance at everlasting life if you believe in Christ and in that he died for your sin\nAnd so anything that comes our way on earth that might\nDisturb your tranquility if you look at it as just a blip in\nThe line of your life\nThen you can just kind of set it aside I mean it may be that its lasting years but in the span of of eternity that really is nothing this this life on earth is a short period of time we have a hard time understanding that because we're always looking at our watchers were always\nHaving to be somewhere at a certain time we're always managing our time to make sure we get something done what any turn to gee there's no such\nThing as time there won't be clocks there won't we won't have a need to say oh gee I have to be here at one o'clock so\nThis that you can have\nThis state of peace um contempt meant when you realize that it all depends not on this life but on the fact that you have a future life this harmony that you can have in your life\nSo rather than looking at this in a negative aspect and saying it's the absence of conflict we need to look at it as the piece of God and it as a condition that is positive in nature\nIn which there is active fellowship harmony between individuals' again this\nAs we've looked at these things it's not something we just sit back in the choir we have to work towards it so having to find pieces a blessing that ought to be desired and enjoyed\nLet's consider what again what the Bible has to say about it [laughter] use me so first of all what is the source of peace where can we look for it if\nWe're having difficulty well first of all it comes from Jesus who came to bring peace we just read from Isaiah that Jesus would be known as the prince of peace and in the ... and I say a chapter nine versus\nFor seven says as it goes on of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment in with justice\nFrom henceforth even forever so we can see that this this um government is going to be set up on the earth by Jesus is going to be one\nIt's going to have a justice in it there's going to be it's going to be peaceful it says there'll be no end to the piece that we will see we also know that when Jesus came he came preaching piece in ... to ten verse thirty six that says\nThe word which godsend under the children of Israel\nPreaching piece by Jesus Christ he is lord of all and again he offers us up geez that the world is really not able to give us at all I mean all you have to do is turn on the news and you'll find yourself probably your blood pressure rising and\nGetting anxious about things and the world's itself does not offer you any piece um but you can get this peace through Jesus and ... John chapter fourteen Jesus spoke to his disciples and said\n[noise] that's it I bought the ice melts to to the snow blower sharpen a shovel ready for winter\nIs the car ready or I knew I forgot something relax I already looked in oil change at my ... so we're good I'll do a free cold weather driving chat while we're there\nTires wiper blades antifreeze they check all that and more than we really are ready for winter it seems really sharpen shovels hustler and break complete dark hair church street New Bedford and muscle or break dot com\n\n[noise] so [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] the movie is streaming why are you going to go\nFrom ABC News [noise]\nMichelle friends in Saturday's massive for the Pittsburgh synagogue\nBelieve now to be the worst attack on a Jewish community in us history\nThis is the most horrific crime scene I've seen in twenty two years the Federal Bureau of investigation FBI\nSpecial agent Bob Jones at a press briefing yesterday following the shooting the suspected gunman forty six year old Robert Ballard previously unknown to authorities stormed the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh with an assault rifle in three hand gun ABC's ...

wise brought to you every Sunday Morning by usa wealth group and [noise] my name is ray Lansing good morning to Pete Lance\nGood morning morning everyone\nSo let me begin this morning ladies and gentlemen by asking you a question do you have an IRA do you have a four one K. or maybe a for all three or four fifty seven planned or maybe a smart plan\nIf you work for the commonwealth of Massachusetts or maybe a thrift savings plan if you work for the federal government\nWell if you have these kinds of plans you probably have lots of questions and what we're going to do today is we're going to talk about if you pay attention to the rules governing qualified retirement accounts which is what all these things are\nWe're going to teach you and show you how you can make more money and how you can retire much better there's so many decision points in decision rules about Irish it's complicated subject but we think it's worth talking about periodically because it impacts everybody and it should impact you\nSo today we're going to be talking about how much can you contribute to an IRA type plant wishes you invest it what about withdrawals when can you take the money out what's the difference between a roll over in a transfer\nCan you do something called in in the service distribution which means you can actually take money out of a retirement account before you retire and you can put it into an IRA account if you want to make better investments\nAnd take out funds for certain reasons out of your IRA yep I'm Still taxable but you won't have the ... percent penalty\nRight there's something called a Seventy two T distribution for example\nAnd you can do that in substantially equal payments over a five year period and then you don't have to pay a ten percent penalty\nThe lots of interesting rules and you know one of the most interesting rules I think deals with the subject of stretch IRAs and inherited IRAs and we deal with that virtually every single week in the office\nAnd were able to show people\nUm how you can make more money for children for example\nSo do you want your children when you're gone to take your IRA account your retirement account you went to check it out over five years where did you want them to have it last for their lifetime that's called an inherited IRA or a stretch IRA so we're going to be talking about that today\nI'm a little bit different or if your age forty nine in under\nYou can contribute up to fifty five hundred dollars a year into a Roth account if your age fifty in older you can add an additional one thousand dollars you can make sixty five hundred dollars\nAnd some people do Ross remember that or to contribute to a rough you must have employment income in the first place you must be working you must have income coming in it can't be just passive income have even come would be an artist yeah\nSo it has to be from employment income\nAnd then there are different rules which I'm not going to get into because we'd have everybody in the radio listening falling asleep but\nThere are limits in terms of how much income you can have and still be able to deduct an IRA contribution in the bottom line is if you make a lot of income um than the amount that you can detect will phase out\nAnd if you make a certain amount of money you also can I contribute to a ...\nA correct so there's a phase out there as well now we have those limits were happy to pass it out to anybody who's interested give us a call at five oh wait nine nine eight\nEighty eight hundred or five oh eight nine nine eight eight eight five eight and will be happy to give you a some very simple reports on how much you can contribute to a four one K. or an IRA for twenty Eighteen\nSo it is important and I guess the most important thing to tell everybody is start as soon as you start your first job start putting something aside the easiest way to do it the way to make sure that you're going to do this systematically has had something deducted from your pay if you can\nAnd then you don't have to think about it's seamless and I'm\nTalking to your four one K. at a um job that you have left to either but we'll come back to that and just a minute now um\nHappens if you work for the commonwealth of Massachusetts or you work for the federal government\nWell they have pension plans so if you worked for the common with a mass you typically you're going to have a retirement defined benefit pension plan that you can draw from when you retire or sometimes you can take it as a lump sum same thing for the federal government\nBut increasingly um people are putting money into their own a smart plans if they work for the state of Massachusetts\nAnd it's a little bit like a for all three baby it's like a four O. one K.\nSo in addition to having money put aside for your pension you can contribute more and have more detected and we do a great deal of work with showing people how to withdraw their smart plan when they retire how to roll it into an IRA we're going to come back in ... minutes\nAre you why that's important and the federal government side they have something called the tea SP at thrift savings plan that through savings plan is similar to a smart plan it's similar to a four O. one K. where you could have Monday ducked it from your pay every week\nAnd have it put aside as an extra benefits start out with something small increase it when you can afford to and when you go to retired you're going to have a very nice little additional benefit\nAnd another thing that we typically say is\nA contributor a little bit more than you think you can afford\nAnd if you go you know a month or so and you realize that you really can't afford it and you can always uh just asked to contribute a little bit less um [noise] but if you get used to it and you can afford it and you're going to just built that account that much faster\nSo Albert Einstein once said about filing his tax returns this is too difficult for a mathematician it takes a philosopher\nYeah I liked that one I like this one by a doctor Laurence Peter America as a land of taxation that was founded to avoid taxation you're right\nThat's one of the first quotations you've given me on the radio\nNow given thank you that's terrific that's I've given at least a half a dozen thought that's what one per year [laughter]\nWell I I think that in view of the fact that November tenth as the marine corps birthday we should have a couple of Marine Corps quotations today what do you think\nA share and the reason we do that and um you know I'm especially pleased about the hundredth anniversary of the armistice coming up on on November eleventh twenty Eighteen because\nMy grandfather served in World War one um he fought er he was a member of the marine corps or he fought in the trenches in France against the Germans or he was willing to Z receive the Purple Heart\nAnd then of course my dad served for Twenty years in the marine corps um both World War two in Korea and he was also wounded but he's a quotation about ... ... ... was where you will GMO yeah in the Pacific right\nSo that's the famous Marine Corps statue we use the former each statue we see four Marines together raising the flag and it's become the main statue is in Washington DC there's one in Fall River\nA we have a miniature one in our office\nFriend of mine was nice enough he actually visited ... and I'm collected into small a jar is um sand black sand where everyone in my office and brought one to you and one to me\nRight yup same for me would you ... well I'm there was a a secretary of the navy James forestall aircraft carrier was named after him\nIn in Nineteen forty five when that famous photograph came out a showing the Marines raising the flag on ... uh that was done by in a piece photographer Joe Rosenthal I'm\nJames far style secretary a navy said the raising of that flag on survived she means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years\nAnd the original picture the flag was much smaller um but it was not stage it was something that the Marines did they\nUm are posted a flag up on top of the mountain and uh the photographer took a couple of pictures of that and said oh that's a great shot and then they asked to get a bigger larger flag brought up so they could read recreate it but it was immediately after\nI've forgotten the ... well it's the icon\nIn the marine corps and the ... yeah\nMy favorite quote about the Marines is the one from Robin and Robin hurricane Ronald Reagan um I I don't have it verbatim but a says a lot of people I'm wonder if they've made a difference in their lives the Marines don't have that problem\nWell they probably have a right here and as we're talking I'll find it there are a couple of quotations that I Can't use on the radio um 'cause there are a little graphic but um [noise]\nHow 'bout Jonathan Winters that famous comic comedian he hasn't been around for a while um did you know that he was a Marine I did he said I've always been proud of being a Marine I won't hesitate to defend the corps\nBut I have to find this Ronald Reagan quotation 'cause they do have it somewhere here and we will spend a long time we want to talk next about the where you could invest your money in Iraq and so what are some of the places where you can invest your IRA Pete\nI mean what kind of um investment vehicles and an annuity I I mean you can do this almost any um but the question is what is appropriate and what isn't there are many in the bank right a lot of people start out in a regular have like a CD you can mean you can\nYou can up turning almost anything into an IRA the question is is what is appropriate and what isn't and not just what's going to earn more money for you but also the tax implications\nWell um let's start with the simplest and go to the more complicated you can have your money in an IRA in a savings account you can have it in a CD [noise] the rates are extremely low right now we typically help people\nTake money from my or savings accounts and CDs and put it into something that's more profitable\nSuch as a deferred indexed annuity for example you can have it and mutual funds it can have it in a brokerage account\nYou can have it and I mean they're simple bond fund but I wouldn't recommend it\nRight and I'm so there are a variety of places where you can put your money when you're investing\nFor one case you don't have the same kinds of choices because for one case are a company plan typically\nAnd your money is usually being managed by an outside from and they might wreck make recommendations sometimes you can say I want to be more aggressive I Want to be more conservative but basically they're going to give you a whole shopping list a whole basket of a mutual funds to invest and\nAnd so they have management fees on the a mutual fund they have a\nManagement fees to manage the overall account so you can lose some money in the management cost of the funds but you don't typically have a lot of choices until you go to retire in in a couple of minutes we're going to talk about rollovers in in service distributions and things like that\nBut suffice it to say if you're with a company to four one K. and for all three be four fifty seven you don't have a huge number of choices about where to put your money there's a company plan they have a company advisor typically and they're going to say\nUm the rule says you must take money out by a April first of the year following the er which you reached Seventy and a half so let's say you turned Seventy half of the year twenty Eighteen\nYou don't have to take money out this year you could wait until next year but if you do what happens the following year now you got to check out two years worth of distributions one for the year that it didn't make a take the distribution and then for the ... the second year as well\nWe don't normally recommend that maybe in some situations but the biggest concern is that uh you may forget if we you know say hey you can take it out um in April of ... of the year following you when you turn seven and a half um so we normally just recommend that you do it when you're Seventy and a half\nUm I always recommend it in the year which in which you reach Seventy and a half and it's it's much more are easy to remember what you do that if you have money in certain kinds of accounts you can set it up for automatic distributions\nBut um [noise] in general don't forget to take the money out when you're Seventy and a half because you will pay a penalty as well\nAnd the penalty for not taking the writing amount of distribution out from your irate account um it's a fifty percent penalty it's the largest penalty we have in the tax code so don't forget to take a minimum\nWe gave a lot of advice a lot of recommendation um it doesn't cost anything to come in and sit down and talk to us I let you talk for just a minute Pete about the difference between rollovers in transfers it's a little confusing\nBut sometimes we'll see people that want to move money from two or three different IRA accounts and they want to put it into one account\nWell this is a good way to do that is a bad way to do that the best way to do it is to have a ...\nIt's an institution transfer that's called a transfer and you can do an unlimited amount of transfers and a year from one account to another ... as long as it goes from let's say a bank to an insurance company or a mutual fund company joined insurance company\nAs long as it goes institution to institution\nThere's no difficulty with that you can do an unlimited amount\nOf rollovers a little different rollovers when you go into a bank and you say I Want to take my money out of my IRA account they want to put it into something else different kind of investment I don't want taxes withheld from it that's critically important\nSo then you take the money out in the bank gives you a check table to you yourself as an individual now you have a sixty day time period in which you can go put it into another kind of investment different banked different institution and annuity a mutual fund\nBut you can only do that once a year\nUm and it must be done within sixty days and um there is one difference where you would want to have taxes withheld and that is if you are over fifty nine and a half and you want it to disclose out that account and take that money for purchasing a new car or for whatever and then you would want to have the taxes withheld if you weren't going to her actually roll it over\nWith a normal role as if the if the institution thinks you're just catching it out the typically required to withhold taxes it's twenty percent taxes they're required to withheld to withhold if um you tell them however that you're not going to just use the money and put it in your checking account\nOr you're going to roll it over into another IRA then you can tell them you do not want to have taxes withheld from it because once they take the taxes that you can't typically stuff it back in again\nBut the important thing is\nIf you have three different bank accounts at three different uh institution is um you can't have three different rollovers the first one will be okay that's a tax free event to take it out and within sixty days put it into another institution or investment\nBut if you try to do it a second one within any twelve month rolling period the cycle is going to be taxable as ordinary income was you're really going to get stuck in pay taxes on it\nSo just understand is a significant difference between rollovers and transfers and talk to us and we'll make sure it gets done correctly so you don't get stuck\nAnd not only will you have the ah ordinary tax income taxes um if you don't do it properly but again if you're under fifty nine and a half and you're going to get hit with a ... percent path as well so if you are looking to do a roll over in Iraq how um give us a call come sit down with us we can make sure that you do it properly and you don't get penalize\nAnd Suzie Orman once said I Love the rough fire a tax free income in retirement is a truly great deal we don't find a lot of people that convert traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs because you have to pay the income taxes on the money is is if he crashed it out and then you put the money into the rough\nGoing from a Korea tax accountable false toxic\nWell the best way to do it if you want to convert from a traditional to her off and I like to tell people that\nThe only reason uh the main reason I see people doing that is if they want to leave money to children with are not going to have to pay any taxes on it at all but the parent will get stuck paying the tax burden when you convert from a traditional to a rough\nSo let's talk about something called an in service distribution um basically what this says is that if you have a four one K. at work or something like that and we've done that with thrift savings\nPlans ... than it was smart plans we've done it with for all three bees for fifty sevens but let's just call it a four one K. [noise]\nUm if you have a four one K. at work and generally most companies have regulations and their plan that say once you're fifty nine and a half if you want to take the money out of the four one K. and put it into an IRA accounts that you can do that it's a tax free event\nAnd there are a number of reasons why you want to do that or you want to think about it at least um\nFirst of all you have more investment choices than you might have and the four one K.\n'em and secondly there's something really important called a stretch IRA this is one of the most useful things that everybody should know about\nIn Iraq out so here's a question do you want your retirement account to last for fifty years or for five years for your children and the answer is obviously would like to have the money last as long as possible so stretch IRA says is\nWhen you die and you've got an IRA countless so you've named the child is your beneficiary they can take the money out as a lump sum and if they do that they're going to lose all the tax deferred nature of that vehicle they're gonna lose money they're gonna have to pay taxes on the whole thing right away\nAnd they're no longer going to be able to save that for their own retirement or they can stretch that money out over their own lifetime instead\nOver there in life that we have over their lifetime let their life expectancy\nOf fusing their life expectancy that they do that\nUm they're going to still be required every year to take a small minimum distribution ... nature of an inherited IRA account\nBut then I kind of have to check out as a lump sum and the amount that they're going to be taken out is so small that those accounts will continue to grow and grow and grow and now when your child or your younger beneficiary reaches on normal retirement age themselves they're going to have a very significant IRA account\nAnd the minimum distributions that they are required to take a dump began when they ... or reach age Seventy and a half of course it's a I mean\nSo basically what this does is it gives you the ability to keep the money growing tax deferred for beneficiaries and um we do this um we've got a case right now with a nephews and nieces inheriting money but I'm the\nIRA plan has to allow excuse me the four o one K plan has to allow uh for transfers to non spouse Bennett fisheries\nAnd most don't so the stretch IRA is absolutely the most compelling reason to do and I are a roll over like I said you can do it as an in service distribution while you're still working and some companies allow you to do it as as young as fifty five we've seen\nUm we do a lot of those were happy to sit down and explain the rules are analyze it\nAnd you can also go from an investment that maybe is is very volatile and then you can put it into something that's less volatile we don't lose principle it's principle protected for example\nSo novel on the stretch IRA as good number two the in service distribution can be good and we're happy to explain the difference as to show you how to do it\nNow let's talk for a minute about uh the complicated nature of the rules that we cover and I'm One of our former chief justices of the United states John Marshall\nSaid the power to taxes the power to destroy so we have um [noise] a long history of taxation in this country and I'm at the same time if you pay attention to the tax rules you could work with the tax rules", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Pete Braley in the Morning", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "28"}
