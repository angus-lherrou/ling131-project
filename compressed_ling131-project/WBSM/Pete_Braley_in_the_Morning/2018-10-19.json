of WB s M Ms or call in lines and um we're going to have colon anytime all are all showing us were doing some sort of a specific interview with someone\nAnyone who wants to call in please do any topic on your mind I'd love to hear one thing I Would like to know though is what are you doing this weekend\nWhat are your plans for yourself or your family your kids or any any major event that you'd like to uh tell us about I'll start with one holy family holy name a church of the Sacred Heart\nIs having its annual holiday bizarre tomorrow a great baked goods are prepared foods all kinds of ah knickknacks ah games different things going on at last all day think I think it starts at eight o'clock and goes till about five\nAnd a it's a great place to meet your friends it's a lot of people use it as a reunion each year raises great money for the church and for a holiday program so please stop by and um\nSay hello to father Bob and everyone working there and a get out and start the holiday season now that I said start the holiday season so that's a\nThat's a pet peeve I just want to go through I in July I went to a shot as one day and a spun around real quick to try and get something in almost knocked over a\nUm junior meant display for Halloween this was in the middle of July I took a picture of it because I was absolutely a confounded\nIt was by the way the reason they're junior minutes for Halloween is that the cream inside or orange gives it worked on me I bought a box I said if if if Halloween is coming so quick I better get a box I'd never give\nEach kid who came to the door for trick or treat a little junior meant right I mean it just doesn't make sense I bought 'em to eat them but the fact is Halloween started in the middle of July\nNow the other day I went to a Home Depot and it's the Halloween stuff is being moved off to the side now almost as an afterthought\nYou're bombarded with Christmas\nAnd uh this is the middle of October and I know that some stores have had Christmas decorations out since uh\nAt the end of September so it's it's this blend of holidays doesn't allow you to celebrate any up and I know it's all a mercantile type of a program they gotta marketed they want to make what they make but the fact is that if you can enjoy each day each each holiday\nUm you know you've you begin to lose lose all perspective on time so\nI'm this is appropriate having a holiday bizarre a on October twenty is appropriate it's time appropriate were four weeks away from Thanksgiving a get out there in and let's start thinking about the holiday season now do we have any calls\nWe do we have a call on the line great thanks to him and also by the way the good thing about the holidays being ... if there has to be a plus side you can go out and get something like that full skills and over there in the corner for twenty bucks on clearance and time for Halloween because they're trying to get it all out of the way for the Christmas stuff that was kind of deal\nI thought that was a Valentine decoration [laughter]\nThat actually hands in my office he around\nThat that makes sense to me that makes sense is by the way there's while I'm In the studio with him and I feel perfectly calm I Do have Taylor a surveying so if if Tim gets a ... too involved in the spooky south coast thing I I Know that I have someone who will ah will help monitor force but\nHe will certainly dig us out of that that's for sure\nSo that what what Tim is describing is a full a skeleton model with a a a wig on sitting on the couch smiling I'm I hadn't really noticed the temple you're absolutely right that that's a great Halloween prop\nIt's also a great for the HOV lane yeah oh yeah absolutely nobody's gonna pull you over with that he went to college here\nYes blues All right\nGood morning you're on WBFO them with a mayor Scott line\nThe line with a high a lawyer ...\nOff of that I talk to you or yeah or it's more like a lot\nOf well we'll try and do that yeah calling it during a break and we'll we'll try and do that sure\nOr ... of of a threat because I got a problem with the ABC\nOh well you know what I tell you what ... more than happy to call me but I I have to tell you that my uh do you have a problem with something like that I Want you to call a John Mitchell's office the mayor's office and talk to them I Know that they can do a heck of a lot more about any issue regarding the city that I can and I think they're\nMore than happy to help of but\nBut that would be a a\nNine seven nine fourteen ten is a the mayor's office or I won't\n... fix cars that called and wrote about it\nWell you you know ... ... let me let me tell you there's a lot of hard working people at ABC and they uh they are trying their best at all times and I I think that you just uh make sure you keep your your\nPlaying on a um musical instrument a ban have your kids involved in those type of ah activities it's really great and a big big uh type of a family\nUh activities so we really appreciate that\nAs far as um the weekend goes as I said oh I'd love to hear what people are thinking about uh for this weekend was supposed to have\nA I guess if a decent weather a little bit of rain but decent weather all weekend and um I'd love to hear about how people are getting getting ready for this particular weekend I'd also like to hear if anyone's got any specific\nA travel plans coming up as far as uh uh the upcoming holidays it's always interesting to hear always uh always fun\nNow we have been through a a a a\nI Would say a great number of a controversial issues are both locally uh specially what's going on in Fall River right now with the mayor of Korea a nationally internationally um and we have an election coming up now in less than a three weeks\nAnd I thought I I just I emphasize especially a early in the show this morning when hopefully we've got people getting ready for work or school drive time\nOr how important it is to uh be involved in this process by voting and I I have no\nA preconceived notion now anyone's going to vote and I'm certainly not advocating or that someone vote one way or another when I say this it's important to exercise your right to vote it's important to make sure that you do vote\nAnd um get caught up on the issues make a decision whatever it is if you feel strongly about it tell other people about it that's what happens on WB SM all day long people a voice their points of view but the fact is that uh it it doesn't make a lot of sense to\nA chime in from the sidelines unless you're involved in the way you get involved is by are becoming informed and then voting on for candidates on referendum Z whatever it might be\nA way obviously if you have to be registered to vote 'em sit and you if you haven't taken care of that then it seems to me that's something that you need to do and I believe that the deadline for this ah for this election has passed but it's never too late to register to vote because there's always an election coming\nBut you got to get registered to vote no where your polling places understand when election day is understand the times at the polling place roping off very easy things things we do all day long\nWe know when our Dunkin' Donuts is a is open or when our supermarkets or when the doctor might be open whatever the post office it's not much different knowing when to polling places open and where it is\nAnd then you go and it takes just a few minutes and your exercise your right to vote under under our ... American democracy and this is something that I think are absolutely\nOr is your ah nah don't normally you're right but your responsibility as a citizen\nIt also makes sense to do it are in full view of your kids so they understand that it's going to be their responsibility it's their inherent right or to vote as a citizen and ah that's that's the way I think you have an impact that's the way you\nI'm all for everybody chime in any position you have but please you got to exercise your right to vote allies I was coming in this morning I heard the uh\nMake a ball or whatever it is mega mega them best meal and what it is a mass power or whatever it is I don't know I don't play I'm not sure yeah well it's it's it's up to almost a billion dollars as I understand nine hundred a million dollars\nAnd um you know it it seems to me if if you're if you follow something like that you know you got to buy a ticket if you follow politics you know you got to vote\nWon't you do if you won the ... the mega millions whatever you'd immediately go to a warmer destination well\nFirst of all I Want to say what everyone says when they win the lottery and that is\nThe lottery the money that I just one will not change me I'm going to be exactly the same than most people quit their job and within within a seven or eight months or in some sort of a counseling rehab or whatever and all of the ... the money's gone they've gone nuts but\nI think if I Won that kind of money I Would not change I'd be exactly the same I Would just uh being in you know rehab and counseling within seven months for whatever the whatever into predilection was\nAnd you wouldn't have to deal with the cold because you can go wherever you wanted and speaking of the cold we have Chelsea priest from ABC six on the line for a good she's going to tell us about what we can expect from the forecast morning Chelsea\nHi guys good morning to you how is everyone today very good show a little chilly we ran a\nStory on the mega millions is on and about um yeah if you were to win to hire an accountant and if a team of financial planners immediately but also I call it\nThe rock that way they that much money we every\nNow and Chelsea I'm when I make a statement if if uh either him right when you will never work again\n[laughter] so I don't know that much money that much money I don't think that you\nKnow as if in fact this is one very few people in New Bedford would ever work again I Would take right downtown and start distributing it would I Would tell us I Can't\nEven fathom that amount of money but you're right I Would probably escape someplace what\nIt actually leave now tell us about why is it cold or this early in the season and what do we have to look forward to here\nYeah we have we've had a series of cold front come through at this week and it's this one of the year that the jet stream starts to move a little bit differently in the summer it left a lot higher north after Canada as well north of us we don't really get at\nCool kind of Arctic Aaron not quite in the Arctic or just yet but at the jet stream start to shift that as with the daylight hours we use a cooler temperatures started to come in we've had a series of cold front come through at this week yesterday was it's really cold and windy\nOr the wind didn't help us at all obviously that this morning still cold upper twenties and thirties less when\nDo we feel like the upper twenties or whatever it is are started by the wind chill factor but the marketing and we will rebound\nWas national separate high it's close to fix the\nWell that's great to hear was was um how about what the World Series coming this this coming week is whether I Want to be warmer right\nNow so exciting and it looks like we will be in the mid ... next week from ... to ... feet agrees below average but nothing crazy and it looks like we should have some fairly dry weather I think that she's dating line\nThan Boston Good to have maybe a shower on on Tuesday but it doesn't look like anything that's going to be impacting\nOne is that when when should we actually get our first frost has ended last night qualify as a ... a lot of\nThought that was the end that growing season came to my boss I thought I thought a lot of us right after the after twenty to thirty there was the phrase warning for most of us the hopefully if you had any of your your sensitive plants the broth as inside if you're trying to hang out of a little bit longer but obviously it's mid October we get hang on dealer\nOr places that much longer to it but I said well below average that tend to agree to laugh\nThat's not good try it asked June July what you saw at the winter would look like you said it's too early to tell so now it's a cobra what someone or look like\n... climate logically speaking and looking at some of our our forecast that look like a right now things a slightly warmer than average and when we look at precipitation data that next month maybe a little ...\nBut it's still warm enough that it would be wet and then kind of things look a little bit average as we head into into the next three months or so and that's kind of a really broad spectrum forecasts but it does look like we should stay little a little bit warmer this weekend or this winter\nCould show last on um which which put you on record now are we going to have a white Christmas\nWhite Christmas I'm going to say All right now\nOr a militia Tobar twenty and writes I have let him keep track of all this would\nBe OK write it down will say well it's tougher up here actually through south east math right the temperatures\nAre still you know we usually don't really get into a snowy period until January and February so will say I hope I'm wrong it's always nice to be a little snow at Christmas a little\nI Hope you're wrong about the February partner just never come all\nRight I'm okay with that I perfectly fine with that too\nAnd and choices or anything else that you would like to share with us as well as the over there they are but\nThe weekend a few showered tomorrow breezy\nTomorrow an cloud that none of wash out though and then we're back from cold temperatures there's another call coming to a mile of the Sunday I be a little bit cooler\nWe're talking about frost again are no\nAh looks like perhaps Sunday night into Monday morning another round of ... start to our work week and then other not it looks like the overnight lows in next week will be staying a little bit warmer Monday morning will be our coolest my next week\nTo voting season seems to seems to ah expenditure should uh people shouldn't be rushing to take their boats out at this point\nNo I mean I think that we still have some decent weather obviously it's cool boating I Know my dad took the bowed out but that's because he does all the work himself so he likes to get that done before it gets too cold out on the books over the water but he's you know we've ended our season we've taken it say\nAbout water temperature now where are we\nAre starting to drop where we're still in the upper because he's looked at ease and that's why a lotta times at this time of year coastal areas right along the coast is a little bit\nWarmer but um you know each and every day we're losing daylight that at Santa without day five eating like that extended amount of time eating the water temperature will keep dropping but it's still in the uh yeah because he's about sixty degrees out so not terrible\nGood good so I Know you've got to get back to a show singer\nOh well I still

door open they're winning your employees higher and we hear that and then I knew the one that's not only good for business but good for the community here\nFirst citizens we understand the impact of small business has on the community and that's when we were invested in helping them around\nThat denials became ludicrous and now we're told the Trump White house and the Saudi royal family\nAre searching for what they call a mutually agreeable explanation that avoids advocating the the Saudi royal prince Mohammed bin Salman or he's one of President Trump's closest allies and they're\nYou know he's already ready to spend billions on a an arms deal that's very dear to the president's heart\nWhoever's responsible for this gruesome grotesque killing\nA clearly underestimated the overwhelming response of countries around the world it it's not just horrifying that it's the murder of a human being really what we're talking about here is the attempted murder of freedom of expression\nWell let's let's so let's talk about look let's I\nDon't want to use a word let's let's talk about how this plays out over the course of ah the last several decades we have had a a\n... ... inappropriate I think relationship with Saudi Arabia for quite some time uh you know the first time I really had Saudi Arabia on my\nRadar was back during the Nixon administration in the ... gas or rationing as a result of OPEC uh uh reducing its its ah I'd put a they held us hostage and with gas we have a gasoline we have a\nA over the years developed by the technology and and um exploration develop their own source of oil to the point now where we're one of the larger producers and we're not a as dependent as we were on OPEC or Saudi Arabia for oil\nOr Saudi Arabia's heavily implicated in nine eleven uh and that's you know just if you just say the nationals it's heavily implicated done I'm not\nAnd on the government but we've always had this uneasy relationship and it goes back administration to administration I Can't think of any president who's ever sat down and look the Saudis in the eye\nSaid that that's not going to happen or we're not going to you know we're not going to a condone that\nAnd it seems that this is now brought it all to a a major had\nIn our country has got to make a decision as to you know what what happens in a consulate doesn't stay in a conflict what happens in an embassy doesn't stay in an embassy and I know there's protocol and world court and all types of a a ... you know international standards that that you're you know your sovereign uh your country basically is\nIs a sovereign entity when it comes to ... to ... or a\nOr an embassy but there was a murder committed a turkey you know which I also I'm not going to say listen great let's let's side would\nTurkey on issues but turkey seems to have as much knowledge about what went on in that constantly it is as a people within it and someone's gonna have to be held accountable and the chips are going to fall where they may whoever's accountable is got to be held accountable and the Trump Administration\nHas to take a strong stand on this period\nWell you see that happening we'll see we'll put it this way I haven't seen it yet well I Would\nLike to hope that of what they're worried\nYou know if they impose sanctions for example the Saudis are saying whatever you do to us we're going to do deal which means hiking the price of oil which means as you alluded to before\nYou know are we going to have gas lines again or if not gas lines certainly a a hike in a in the\nPrice of gas whenever you go to the pump a nobody wants that but we want a fence of morality and I'm ironically of course the show is last column that he wrote just before he was killed\nWas about the freedom to express your opinions and um you know that final column ironically he wrote about a friend of as a reporter in Saudi Arabia who wrote a column critical of the Saudi Government that reporter to show the road\nIs sadly now serving an unwarranted five year\nPrison sentence for criticizing the Saudi Government to show you never knew how much worse his own fate would be so uh yeah this is not just about the killing of one man it is an attempt to kill or the expression of an idea\nAnd that's what has additionally in\nThe early ... who here's what I said oh Michael what with the Saudis do\nDoes not a on a day to day basis resonate with us when when they got you know they they're they're humans right human rights record is is atrocious either their treatment of a woman within their a kingdom is atrocious but let's let's look\nUh if if you look at it as the idea of killing ... the idea of freedom of speech we want to make sure that we\nKeep that uh is the first Amendment rights are extremely extremely strong in the United states and I know on a day to day basis we hear hear fake news we hear that I you know the reporters are a terrible people whatever Miami enemies of the people\nYeah the the fact of the matter is that without freedom of of ah expression without the free press uh our country will be a uh the people in our country will be dramatically and negatively affected so we need we need it free source of\nCommunication information regardless of whether it's right left center or whatever you you've got to have you got to respect the people do it the journalists who do it\nOr the amateur journalist who attempt to do it the bloggers whatever it might be everyone's got that right I\nDon't think that right is recognized quite fast\nIn Saudi Arabia but we do know that they the murder has been committed\nA ... by the way no one at this point I think continues to say we don't know what happened everyone knows this this individual has been murdered in the counseling someone's going to be held at Fifteen people are out ah for the murder if the guy open the door and knew there was a murder than he's an accessory if the princes involved\nOr he's got to be held accountable and our government can't participate in a cover up to this I mean it's just it's on ... to me that we're sitting here trying to come up with excuses\nFor for an atrocity like this is this if you look at it in a in a certain way there should be at the Hague was someone was someone making an argument right now that there's got to be you know international an indictment sank by the way the sanctions\nThat is for something like this were were involved in the trade war where I'm where I'm questioning whether or not it has any\nA real uh the literally at this point but the idea of putting sanctions on Saudi Arabia\nOr seems to me to be only the logical thing to do and uh I I think we've been show we're we've been putting a chokehold on OPEC\nA by opening up our production I'm not really a this is not Nineteen Seventy three anymore Seventy to where we got to worry about a rationing or anything we can we can easily I'm\nMaking economic statement here as well\nYou're right and I'm ... and in terms of the moral statement and and in terms of freedom of press to me it showed how tone deaf\nThis president can be one he gave a speech last night and joked about this congressman from Montana Greg Gianforte who body slammed a reporter from the guardian Ben Jacobs\n... back in Trump was saying you know there's great and the guy that can do but body slam is my kind of guy you know in the same week that we're wondering about the murder of a journalist and he's making jokes about by the body slamming a journalist\nIs that it's you know that that's that's ... ... ... in ... I mean that's the kind of thing where you look at it you say that is no need for this it's embarrassing it's on tone deaf it's just it's\nCompletely out of touch with what's going on internationally and how you are you know how your to conduct yourself as president the the other the other question that I have though is uh uh just very very quickly any feeling on the election coming up\n[noise] you know I have to make predictions um\nThe polls have been proven wrong over and over particularly in the twenty sixteen election uh I I guess the general consensus is that the Democrats will get the house back but uh it's looking more and more like the Republicans will hold on to this\nType ... got to get out to vote and we'll we'll see what happens with Michael thank you very much a delight talking to your same here stay well\nAnd take care it will be right back with more in just a few moments\nAnd one of America's most compassionate talk radio towns these these fourteen twenty\nYou when you're maybe after the rights die you can rely on the comprehensive maternity services at Harvard Medical associates in Dartmouth and New Bedford seven board certified obstetricians I'm part of your community and it provided that carrying environment for women for more than Twenty years moms deliver locally and uh hawthorn dot there is on\nCall twenty four seven to deliver your baby her personalized maternal a newborn care Bible eight nine nine thick three nine nine one\nWhen it comes to finding a trustworthy company for a real thing signing and windows so many of my close personal friends recommend blow a mosquito\nDo you when you're ... off to the right star you can rely on the comprehensive maternity services at home foreign medical associates in Dartmouth", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Pete Braley in the Morning", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "19"}
