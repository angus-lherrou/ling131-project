true I I mean right now I'm a rich combat duty pay and and all of those things that perhaps we're missing when are you and I were in the service but uh I I think there is a it was in Vietnam that was

the one who does it all me sometimes need to accept what people are\nDoing in the community so it's community important community is very important there's no doubt that when we ransacked the pages of the Old Testament we find pictures of profound community\nThere was a day by day quality of can't can't know ya which is Christian fellowship a communion with God or more commonly with fellow

they move away sometimes you never see them again they can be there to help you in your time's up loneliness\nBut what can you see that there's going to be true family is usually the true love that

M. presents ray land of the usa well through it's time to give your finances in order money wise starred snow [noise]\nAnd good Sunday morning list\nWelcome to money wise brought you every Sunday Morning by usa wealth grew\nThe question that like to ask this morning as we start is what happens in this country in the year twenty twenty six if we run out of money to fund the Medicare program that's what the current projections are right now Medicare is going to run out of money and twenty twenty six three years earlier than expected\nAnd that means of course that our government is going to have to do something\nBecause we can't afford to run out of money to fund the Medicare program which pays for health insurance and many other programs for millions and millions of Americans\nSo this morning we're going to be talking about Medicare it's right now what's called the open enrollment period when I talk a little bit about the funding site of Medicare although that's of concern to some people\nUm it's an important issue in Medicare Social security\nFor example did you know that in our federal budget right now defense spending only counts for sixteen percent of our total budget people think that it's a lot more than that\nSocial Security counts for twenty four percent and Medicare Medicaid\nThe chip program counts for twenty six percent of our federal budget so the Medicare program and the Medicaid program or the largest single component of our federal budget and yet we all has to be very confusing time trying to\nSort out Medicare and find out what were eligible for and what are the best programs to cover\nI have to say that I find it to be one of the more confusing the areas of everything that we talk about on the radio so with me this morning is uh my partner in life my wife and a noted attorney attorney Kenny Lance good morning setting\nGood morning to you and everyone out there\nAnd said he does a lot of work in the Medicaid area protecting people's assets if somebody has to go to a nursing home uh for example\nIn real quickly if you want to reach tend to eat anytime give her a call at five oh wait nine nine eight eight eight zero zero we have another special guest with us this morning Ellen Hall H U L L Ellen is the outreach coordinator for the dark with the council on aging\nWe have to if we can't cut spending that the federal level and we have a lot of entitlement programs\nAnd if the economy doesn't grow consistently and rapidly to produce more tax revenue\nAnd if we don't have more people coming into the country to grow the population on talking about immigration a little bit then how do you keep feeding this budget this huge deficit\nAnd how do you support the government well the only way you're gonna do it is to raise taxes so there's a lot of things at play here\nUm well let's talk about the Medicare program so to any you know from your own experience\nThat when you reach sixty five you must sign up for Medicare insurance that's the first thing\nYeah sorry if you don't you have a penalty later ah unless you're covered by our employer so it's very difficult situation for people who just don't get around to let our forget\nSo here's a quick tip on the sign up period there is a seven month initial enrollment period and it begins with the three months prior to the month in which you reach age sixty five it includes a month in which you reach sixty five\nAnd then it extends to the three months after the month in which you reach sixty five that's a seven month period which you can initially sign up\nAnd a lot of people confuse this and they think well I haven't started Social Security yet so I don't have to sign up for Medicare that's wrong piece of information\nThat they think that because I have to sign up for Medicare that's the time to sign up for Social Security as well\nYeah and they are unrelated they're two different things uh we've done special programs just on Social Security in the past for a whole hour and we'll going to do that again before alone but they're not related so you can apply for Social Security at age sixty two if you choose to not usually the best thing to do\nAnd then when you reach sixty five you must sign up for Medicare\nNow tend to you mentioned the penalty or the penalty for people who don't know they don't send you a bill and say you owe us money rather they increase the cost of what you have to pay for paying for Medicare insurance and it's for the rest of your life so it's a serious penalty\nThat seven month window to sign up initially is critically important the other critically important thing is what's called um I actually have dropped the name for a moment open in the open enrollment period thank you\nWe are now in the open enrollment period and this is another important thing to think about Medicare so if you're already on\nMedicare or insurance and Ellen I assume your perhaps yes and teddy is receiving Medicare and I receive Medicare [noise]\nWell there's a couple of really specific things were going to talk about with Medicare insurance number one they don't cover everything\nAnd most people have a supplement program of some kind of thing my supplemental insurance which picks up a lot of things that Medicare does not believe that costs to be like a hundred and forty eight dollars a month and that's about typical you know what yours is sending\nA ton of not exactly but it's about that yes\n... that's more on the higher range you can get them non considerably less\nAnd it depends on what you want covered it's the question of what are you a medical issues how often do you go to the doctor ... because the lower your co pay the fewer times you want to have to go to the doctor\nHas it with a lower pay you're going to have higher co pays you're going to have to get referrals to doctors from your primary doctor's\n'em and lab work a lot of lab work is not covered totally and he would have settled there are more out of pocket with the lower fees\nOkay so if you pay less for the supplemental insurance and you're going to pay more for out of pocket cost or conversely I guess if you pay higher per month like I pay I Believe a hundred and forty eight dollars a month then they'll pay less out of pocket correct and I you know I I go to doctors you know periodically\nI still pay a deductible is when I go up a a ... our co pay when I go because it depends upon my supplement insurance\nWhat in what the plan is and\nIf people have to decide when they're going to sign up that's one of the biggest things is how often do I go to the doctor ... there are people who are sixty five sixty eight Seventy\nOnce a year that set them so they're looking at why should I pay a higher premium when I go once a year and so I pay a high at the duck double\nSo it's a matter of balancing out of what where you are medically\nWhere it's very much like looking at the Medicaid program you don't know what's gonna happen\nThe next five years so how do you plan and with Medicare you don't know whether you might need a specialist and two thousand Nineteen so do you sign up for the more comprehensive plan or do you save hopefully money\nYou know I I I have to say I was talking to a couple of people in the office um or even this morning and the last couple of days as we're getting ready to talk about Medicare on the radio\nAnd I said this is probably one of the most complicated areas that we touch and we are very knowledgeable and very expert in many many areas of the law in finance taxation than he does is take plenty of Medicaid winning nursing home protection\nBut this is an area where I Would imagine most of the people listening today really just don't understand that because we deal with it a lot and we struggle to understand it is very very complicated\nI mean the simple fact that Medicare and the federal government sends out this hundred and twenty three page booklet\nAnd by the way less pages and uh say Chinese French Dutch Haitian Creole Italian Japanese Korean polish Portuguese Russian Tagalog tag along goes in Vietnam is a little blurb publications which basically tell you\nIf you don't understand the English and the hundred and twenty two pages contact us and we'll send it to you and your native language so a an army to use all soon here\n[noise] wow it's complicated is the devil\nAnd this is a complicated time so this open enrollment period which has already begun and I think it ends what December seventh December seventh so between now and December seventh there were very important reasons why you might want to consider switching your Medicare coverage\nSo during the open enrollment period every year you're allowed to sit down and make a change so as you mentioned Ellen maybe somebody signed up for a less expensive program and all of a sudden they're finding themselves going to the doctor more and it's costing them more money out of pocket maybe the surge switched to a different kind of program\nThat's this is the time that they need to sit and look at their bills from last year he men where they are medically right now\nDo they flush see that they are going to be increased visits to the doctor and um they have a problem that's occurred than they really do need to sit down and evaluate reevaluate\nThe puck plan that they have\nAnd that they need to really do before they come to see a shine officer\nBecause the shine offices most of them half about an hour to see and in that time they don't have the ability to go over all the different plans and sit and talk with you about everything that are involved in it\nSo one of the things that you do Ellen and we're talking with Ellen how who's the outreach coordinator for the council on aging and our with our Jarvis council an age and I guess is the right time at the council on aging I'm you help to coordinate and set up the appointments with shy and counselors correct and that's really important because those appointments or free aren't they\nYes these are volunteers ... people don't understand that shine\nA coordinators are of volunteers who go through it pretty extensive um schooling classes that they have to go to they have to pass tests to be able to get certified and then they come and volunteer their time\nI Know it is a great job they do so these are people shine counselors or people who are number one very well trained number two they're volunteers\nAnd number three they're there to help you if you're listening today and you're struggling with the cost of health insurance is struggling with the cost of medical bills and you're wondering\nAre you in the right program or the best program is right for you you need to sit down with the shine counselor and we're going to talk in a couple of minutes about where you can find a shrine counselor because they're in virtually every community in New Bedford environment than for have in\nUm West Point Westport you need to sit down and it's worthwhile doing this every single year they're very busy right now obviously\nIt's everybody should evaluate their policy they have every year but and they should do it before the open enrollment date [laughter]\nHow you want to improve it in the area and they will help you to narrow it down to pick out a few plants but it's your decision in the end is what you can afford monthly for your premium\nAnd what the important things are to you\nI think one of the toughest things is to know\nWhich is the most basic plan that works for you I received yesterday from Harvard pilgrim a big fat envelope bones one a day I received but this one\nHad all kinds of information about hearing aids center reduction and cost but what I can get through Harvard pilgrim for hearing aids for dental services all kinds of things that I really didn't even know I had and I wonder whether I fully need\nSo as Ellen says it's really tough and you have to do a little homework to compare plans\nAnd everything for the work that you do must be very gratifying because you're explaining what programs and services are available that people might not even know\nWell that's the biggest thing is I Do a lot of work with children a lot of them from out of state who will call that they have parents uh who they feel are getting to the point they need some assistance\nAnd that's what we do we go out we do home visits we check on people's we assist them and finding the help that they need including help with their health plans\nThat um it's just mind boggling mall that um different programs that are around that people don't know about from town to all the towns have different programs as well uh to assist their citizens from tax abatements\nReally proud to Dartmouth last night at its fall town meetings um I shouldn't say last night it was a couple of days ago but they voted to approve a mental health advisory housing program\nSome way whether that's really an needed service and I'm proud that they followed it that way\n[noise] well um we do a lot of to help our senior citizens in this country in general we do a lot in this area um I remember reading at one point I'm\nA description that said you can measure the value of a country by how well they take care of their senior population but it's expensive costs a lot of money to give you a quotation from John Sununu the former governor of New Hampshire\nIt worries me about our unwillingness to really address reforms and modernization and Medicare\nThis thing was designed thirty seven years ago it's actually a little older now\nIt has not evolved to keep pace with current medical technology and so that's a lot of what you see right now but I Wonder you know how many times do you go to a doctor's office for example and you feel like you're\nYou know a little machine you get your five minutes or your ten minutes with a doctor and then other than that you're seeing a couple of assistance a couple of nursing assistants and things like that and sometimes if it isn't done correctly you feel like you're a little machine you being run in and out\nAnd it doesn't matter what your ages or anything else but it's a reflection of the stress the sun the medical community today\nAnd the insurance industry has it today but how do you pay for these things and um it's a serious problem\nI Want to give you something from um Al Franken Al Franken was a senator from\nNorth Dakota South Dakota somewhere out there for good words from I don't remember uh he actually resigned because he got caught up in some of the scandal stuff with the Republicans eliminate Medicare America will become a country which you can never retire\nAnd once you physically can no longer work year desperately poor until you die so the Medicare program is critically important as his Social Security\nAnd I'm not trying to be political and making these statements these are just from quotations I had researched her own one sheet\nThis is from Mike Pence or vice president I oppose the Medicare prescription drug entitlement I opposed the wall street bailout I opposed the stimulus bill that was the whole\nQuotation and then there's one other quotation I Want to give my last political quotation from Joe Biden I'm former vice president\nSocial Security is not the hard one to solve Medicare that is the gorilla in the room and you've got to put it all of it on the table so\nPoliticians one by one are aware of the desperate situation that we're in\nAs I mentioned earlier it's projected right now that Medicare is going to surpass its budget uh and run out of money theoretically and twenty twenty six which isn't that far away\nBut at a local level it's real important to evaluate what you've got I think it was two years ago to any that you and I went into dart with Council on aging we went in together we met separately with different counsellors different shine counselors\nNow we know a lot about this stuff but yet we felt it was important to go in and sit down with a shine counselor and it resulted in us making changes and which programs we went with\nAnd as you say it was two years ago and I'm Ellen well remind us that we should look at this every year and it just takes time that most people don't have or don't take ...
