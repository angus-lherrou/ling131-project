Thursday\n... ... and then we can go further into the championship series and then the one hundred fourteenth World Series and I hope we're going to be in halo there good morning\nBack so the question I Want to repeat it please\nOh he was thirty percent of men have watch on their desk\nAnd not that statue pictures of the girlfriends\nAnd not a picture of their girlfriend but you would think that that was the answer right are you doing OK\nWell all of a sudden you may not be far off if they're married [laughter]\nSo New Bedford new start seeing the\nSame [laughter] six zero five below their I\nWell here's what's going to happen first of all I promise you there'll be fifty phone calls a new allegations against judge Kavanaugh [noise] uh I Know this from the impeachment of Bill Clinton when Larry Flynt offered one million dollars\nPer member of Congress if there was a scandal right yeah I remember there were multiple calls\nOn everybody all the Republicans you know it happens there were two or three legitimate scandals that came out but probably hundreds of phone calls so the FBI will look at these and probably\nDismiss the vast majority unless there's something of substance they will take a look at it I think the big thing they're going to do which is interesting is that what ... talk to mark judge officially he'll either\nYou know confirmed that the the judge is telling the truth or maybe he won't I don't know I have no idea you know that's a step in the in a direction of the fence\nAnd confirms some things Dr Ford says or maybe not a so that's what they'll do but I think there's gotta be eventually a time limit because look these things can go on\nFor ever so we know of three allegations that are out there for three different women and I\nBelieve there was a lobby he looked at now I have personal opinions on these allegations and I think the sweating the allegation um\nI don't think anything will come of it uh because if he if he did and participated in what she is alleging ten different parties ten different lines of gang rape let me tell you something that had been out there through the mouths of about twenty people you know\nMy ... years ago oh sure sure of that one I don't believe that\nYou know let's see what some credibility that Dr Ford has or not or what happened or not you know\nLike I said I've talked to Alan rat and her about this year a friend of mine I have some opinions among the entire thing and I think are frankly not trying to take anybody in the story but I think\nUh all of them years ago uh we're into some heavy heavy drinking\nYeah ... you think there was a well\n... taking a majority here ... ... there\nWas something out there may be lingers today I don't know I don't know ... ...\n[noise] very very interesting observation you know in that question was ah in my mind as well\nYou know whether was Allen Allen ran a recovery as you know of\nCourse absolutely I mean uh we have a tendency to look at things a little differently you know I don't use the political up\nA eye glasses to make a judgment about these stories but also when I heard about these about ... I said well we're both ...
