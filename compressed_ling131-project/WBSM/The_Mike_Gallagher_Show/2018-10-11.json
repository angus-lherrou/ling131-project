anger when they hear mark has opinions but the one thing you're going to get here on WB is I mean you're going to get local people with writing opinions\nSubtly done in six zero five hundred all seeing eye what are you going to be now like any little stuff here in the diesel career indictment\nI'm reading now about his involvement with investor number two I think the first pages I was reading they detail investor number one ranked investor number two he assured them that he would not be taking any salary or compensation in connection with snow al off\nAnd in the business plan it made no mention of any kind of compensation for ...\nAnd it referred to snow Alice operations in costs as inexpensive and negligible so then investor number two decided to invest in fifty thousand dollars in return for five percent equity in the company shortly after that to the thousand dollar check landed in his bank account he used\nAnd only half of the money to pay off personal loans that make payments in his personal credit cards pay for personal travel with his then girlfriend and make personal charitable donations like you mentioned before [noise]\nWow so think about this for a second he's he he's living on his credit cards then finding a a guy to give money credit cards down I go to his girlfriend of noise running this racket you know so now he's ... he's being a big deal with her with other people's money but\nHe didn't get to go around and be a big deal\nYou know who he reminds me of stands out with the human fund remember Seinfeld ... where\nHe says I'm going to be a philanthropist I'll take other people's money and they'll have to then they'll give it away and then the people have to like me for it\nThat's that's that's Jason ... allegedly is taking other people's money and making ... making because George ... stands like donations I'm from the human fund snow out money for people yeah fellow money for people flying chicks around a baby\nHe's got a Mercedes and and um and he's he's giving charitable donations way your kids these like John ... ended up not dimes to children to the other people's dimes\nOh he told investors are three and four that when he was in college he had developed packaged and sold an apt to a venture capital growth in Cambridge who then sold it to Facebook\nAnd that is false [laughter]\nFall off and that would be fault yeah so so what I'm going what I'm putting together here is as I mentioned earlier um\nAnd if you like to talk to us about this you can fiber waiting on an six zero five hundred I have the all seeing

[noise]\nWell I think as we've seen this office during the past especially with crimes by public officials that involve money and obviously most of them do a as I like to say about the federal government were slow but we usually catch up meaning at the end of the day it's extremely difficult to heart hide those kinds of crimes\nWe take them very seriously you know I I Know you hear a say that a lot but what that means in concrete terms is that you are an elected official and you commit some kind of fraud we will go after you even though the dollars involved might be a little less than what we would do in the usual fraud case\nRun of the mill fraud case with a private citizen one of the things we look at how much money is involved is it worth of federal charge if you're a public official that amount is going to be lower we're more willing to take on those kinds of cases because you can't have public officials engaged either in\nCommitting fraud or in their constituents are unwilling unwitting or I'm In using their position for personal gain and obviously we've seen those kinds of cases as well\n\nI'm Sorry I don't understand the question [noise]\nIt isn't that we ... this was intentional fraud\nThe alleged he knew exactly what he was doing meaning he's on the one hand he's spending the investor money he's soliciting the investor money he's spending the investor money and then when asked by the investors he is reassuring them the money is being used for the company that the company is in good shape\nWhen he himself knows that that is not the case that he has spent sixty five percent of the dollars involved on his own personal expenses or other business ventures instead of the one venture in which these investors invested which was Noel\nInvestigation's ongoing I can tell you we have not made other arrests in this case\n[noise]\nAh we received information implying that uh the mayor was misusing funds in relation to his campaign and that is what led us to look into what he was doing\nWas ever\nKnow it was just a prototype\nNo my understanding is that\nAll right we'll come back to the crust McCarthy show um [noise] if there's anything more breaking from the U.S attorneys who you're monitoring it will will will cut back into it but we didn't ... you got the gist of it uh there's a lot to digest there tell you what when you take a very short break and then when we get back we're going to take your phone calls at five await nine\nSix zero five hundred win the gold has a couple of interesting things in there why was he in Bridgewater he was arrested in Bridgewater if you notice that um\n\nDo you notice the investigation how'd you how'd was there the arrest but there's nothing in this indictment about hug each then they say this is an ongoing investigation there's a lot to talk about it a lot to break down sticker on her fourteen tornado we'd be similar to the latest\nOn the Jews will Korea indictment and arrest he is right now she lives in belt list in the basement of the Joe milkweed courthouse in South Boston\nButtery in New Bedford freak so\nYou like to save her invest for your future saber invest the time and\nSave for your children's education call Jose ... six seven eight three seven one type of advance financial group at seven twenty five state road in Westport mass as a financial consultant since Nineteen eighty nine I have experience in setting up for one case IRAs and annuities for a variety of my clientele\nSecurities an advisory services offered through commonwealth financial network member any S.
