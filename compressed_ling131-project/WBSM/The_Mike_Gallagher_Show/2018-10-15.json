I grew up with her mother and her an uncle's themselves a little bit of nepotism I guess there but I mean that's pretty neat right\nSummertime by electrical brawl I yeah I mean look I'm more into Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley and things like that that songs written for me but I heard it and I thought the that's the same stuff\nI hear all the time on the radio but I mean it seems I mean as a complement you know the professional music just to keep a New Bedford and it's kind of a neat song right for kids happy\nUpbeat if not you know not not only is depressing songs it's fun so anyway I talked to we play some local music as bumpers today just 'cause we got a lot of local town near you think about John Cassidy and the beaver brown band you know you've got to all kinds of you know good good music you know\nAnd will play here's bumper music as we go along I'm All right so what do you think of Elizabeth Warren\nGone liberals if you're out there and come on give it to me given to me those folks who called the fake Indian I'm not sure I use that term I'm not sure I didn't\nNot sure I didn't I I always felt well here's my thoughts I said here on the radio if you read through the entire Boston Globe store they talk about the fact that she ... her staff won't say whether or not she first\nHer staff won't say whether or not she first took a test before she took this very public test\nWell of course she did I mean she wouldn't have she's not she's very smart lady and and I might disagree with on things but you know\nShe's not stupid in the sense that she wouldn't have put this out there if there was any doubt so obviously she probably took a a test for which is a right which is absolutely her right um to take one privately as you or I could do you know Johnny one note like no one says my friend\nUm he uh he mentioned he took he took one I'm a hundred bucks you put your swab your cheek or your saliva and um\nThey mail it in for a hundred dollars they come back with a very ... you know the profile\n\nWe see ads for all the time and television so she did a very public one but I'm assuming she didn't want privately first to find out what the answer was going to be [noise]\nSo does it satisfy you look it keeps it keeps your story intact\nRight I um\n\nI've always felt the issue wasn't really whether she was Native American Indian use the term what what was that they're not just telling the truth right isn't that really what the issue came down to that that you know she'd heard this legend well\nPretty much\nFalls in line with Philip she's very very very little Indian blood enter\nUm\nCould be as little as one five hundreds\nAnd they say that they seem to test suggests she has ... Native American history okay it's still there is there a gray area they're a little bit if you want it to be a gray area there's a gray area\nBut it looks pretty hit you know what it does it simply\nIs in line with what she said which is that she grew up thinking she was a Native American she has a Native American blood shed some story about a great great grandmother or great great great great grandmother something to that effect you know someone way down the line who should never met was was Native American okay I mean I I I think that this test\nVindicate her story now does it vindicate\nThe fact that she lifted herself as a Native American in a book you know\nNo\nNot really not really um\nBut it also doesn't condemn it it doesn't isn't this isn't the type of evidence that we hang someone on okay see here here here's what I Do\nI I wasn't gonna condemn cabin on based on the uh based on the very tiny\n... well now there was no evidence and and now I'm not going to condemn her um because you produce the evidence that sort of indicates right I mean Kavanaugh's calendars were perfect but they ... they showed hey he wasn't really around well the shows she's got some Native American blood not a lot of it but it's consistent with her story and so\nGood ... I'm not sure not voting for when I was in voting for ... if it came out you know I mean I'm I vote on the issues generally sometimes on the personality\nOn the personality from friends with someone and they're a Democrat I probably ... I actually have friends that you and you're a Democrat to vote for you there's a will there's no doubt about it I probably help you I probably have helped 'em but you know with her I ... I I'm I'm not\nIn full is warm but this Indian thing didn't wasn't\nOne way or the other now it takes a lot of you know this is the danger of for instance that independent candidate Dr Sheila the danger for him if he was running his whole campaign on I'm a real Indian she's a fake Indian\nThe danger when you run a campaign like that is it now you\nUniversities to assess minority professors she did list herself in that and then she took herself out of the book to as ... as the Boston Globe\nThe paper I read so you don't have to a point out that you know what what happened why did she didn't take her name out well\nBut I Do think by and large this has brought the issue up again\nBut it's probably put it to rest unless something else comes out I but I don't see it um I think it's put to rest and I also will tell you this she\nSmart because we're getting this stuff all out so here's what you do if you're running for you have an idea about running for another office by the way you should write me a check if you're thinking about running for office right now and I'm going to give you some really good advice stuff that wins elections\nI'll give you a second to to get your checkbook out but I'm just going on the on a system yeah did you feel this is valuable information and you're a politician\nCheck if you're going to run for higher office so maybe we're going to switch parties you have to switch parties to get some bad stuff about yourself out there you know\nQuestionable stuff in the in her case that the taxes you know that she over inflated the the\nAmount of money she donated to charity in the fall of closed ... not a huge big deal but it but it's out there\nShe's getting it all out now because why she's going to shoot she believes you're going to win the upcoming election for US Senate and so then she can say that stories old and I've been reelected by making such as reelected me knowing that full information right it's just a great way to like the people have decided that's not a story stop bringing up that that's what you do in politics\nIf you got your eye in a bigger office so you're a Republican now but you're in a district that you know is going to be Democrat\nOr vice versa you're a Democrat and you know you're gonna it's gonna be a Republican\nDistrict that you're going to run it you want to switch parties and so say you're a select ...\nAnd you got to run for state Senate you go well I'm going to switch the Republican Party now get reelected in the spring as a Republican so that way when my opponent in the primary challenges me on your just became a Republican you know yeah I Know that's not true I've been a Republican for a long time in fact I was elected as a Republican you might say for my selecting seat so that makes sense\nSoil is Warren is doing is she's getting all this stuff out now anticipate because she got a lot for president well she loses the Senate US Senate seat against Jeff deal what does it matter doesn't matter if you never know what President\nBut she's assuming hey I'm going to be reelected the U.S Senate and I'm going to have all anything that's bad about me or controversial about me out now get reelected and then be able to say it's not an issue my constituents knew about it they reelected me overwhelmingly\nDo you see my point hey stick around we'll be right back you're fourteen

represent posed ideas and policies is a foolish idea\nBecause ah when they get sick when the public gets sick of that guy they can throw the rascal out and then bring in somebody else and then the other party and the same polices it policies are getting implemented anyway so it was another you know a\nAcademic or a politician who's a fooling the public\nOne as you know he he couldn't believe how angry certain people got with them for some writing that book because he thought he was he was doing everyone a favor by exposing by telling the truth and he he he was bragging about it wasn't an explanation was bragging\nHe was telling everybody how there were screwing everybody over he was\nIn ... but he also endorsed the concept of it yeah\nYeah he's Bill Clinton's favorite professor mhm [noise]\nUm okay so I'm calling about the show the mhm okay mainly for years I've\nHad a tremendous interest in the middle east because my father lived there for years he worked in um the Arab states and you worked in Iran he was there when the uh Iran's hell and uh so it's always been interested in there they're not um monolithic they're like our country where they have many\nGroups correct and beliefs so really what we've been seeing for years now is um\nWhat when Trump went over it stuffs explain from Trump\nWhen Trump went over in two thousand Seventeen in may he when he went over to the Arabs and he basically said everybody remembers when all this is a big success in the\nMedia he went over and he said before I go solve the Arabs Iranians problem go talk to the Iranians like you guys got to solve your problems in the Arab state\nBecause Qatar the small extremely wealthy though a lot of a wealthy some art but it's hard to explain the wealthy it's a small peninsula and they were fostering revolutions\nIn many of the other Arab countries they they support the\nMuslim Brotherhood and political Islam so they were paying to get Libya Tunisia Syria um Sudan your mind\nAnd they were on their way to destabilize the UAE\nUnited Arab Emirates and they were under way to to destabilize Saudi Arabia\nAnd uh so Saudi Arabia and the UAE we're fighting back in Bahrain for fighting back against um Qatar\nThe tumbling over there talk to the Arabs first the end and and you know knew what was going on and then if you remember he made a trip over to Qatar he told them to cut it out stopped the bus during the revolution\nTop support for political Islam step support for um the Muslim Brotherhood [noise] so what you got to know about ... by the way is that ...\nIn his Muslim Brotherhood Muslim Brotherhood that's right political Islam\nHe was a ... show his so we we you and I were wrong last week about he he's a cousin about nine to ... the the arms and you know you\nKnow ... yeah but I said I said somebody is enough\nAnd if you can show in and the other thing is I just want people to think about this for a second just think about before that's a psych nurse continue and I'm going to what you don't you think about something for a second why are we being\n... jammed into our heads JFK journalist get killed ... unfortunately killed all the time why does everyone now know about this girl was there was something going on here there is someone I ...\nI can tell you what it is so for a number before the Arab Spring the first spring with the Prague Spring and and that was in Czechoslovakia we don't have a ... in where we have a slow that yeah we have the Czech Republic but\nThere's various color revolutions right yes\nThey're the same thing is happening around the country and they're trying to undermine the United states too so we have a vested interest in knowing what's going on but sorrows went over after you know uh and taught to the\nThe Marxist or the the um [noise] communism in Czechoslovakia and they talk to the last communist leader ... ... was his name and um the he was a playwright\nWith law humble ... right\nRight he was a playwright and he basically told source you got to work with the media control the media and then present stories that everybody thinks they're seeing something that you want them to learn right\nNow is using ... was accomplished you I thought it was an anti communist\nHigh now see he was the last communist leader but he he became the first um capitalists leader I Would just didn't I was in Prague there this summer to try and live there\nJust because a friend who wanted to go there and I went I learned a lot took they took the communism bunker tour um but ... but he was a playwright and keep that in mind is there is constantly narratives which are stories and a lot of them are on true stories and they put them with their with their well placed\nJournalists were really close spies her really active\nHere and that's the only ... ... ... ... it was a spy ...\nRight and in fact his history if you look at it he was a journalist pre nine eleven in Afghanistan when they were having their war and he was a friend of\nOsama bin Laden [noise] right right right and he was big on the Muslim Brotherhood he still is\nHe backed up um he back by his journalistic writings he backed up uprisings abroad and reforms at home in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia the thing about him is um he he in Saudi Arabia\nHe does he's not welcome the the young prince who's now in office you know the crown prince\nHe knew what was going on here there was that family either has you know while hobbies hobbies you know extreme um [noise] the extreme Muslims Islam Islamic who don't give a ... who don't respect who don't allow\nOther Mormons your neighbors it'll hottest basically right so I mean we wouldn't want to a bunch of ... in your neighborhood ...\nThey can't tolerate anyone\nElse's religion but they also have the other big problem they have is is this um this political Islam is another danger and they believe in um the Muslim Brotherhood so within that country this new prince has come out by the way the next prince uh didn't that the other prince\nIt can be in control has a drug problem so apparently for the health of the nation of the kingdom are they sort of decided they needed this new prince western educated who doesn't have the power to run it\nCounted backing him and he knew that they were being threatened from within the kingdom within their security forces within a and it sort of took everybody by surprise including our Marxist people here in the last ... this new ... took over they wanted the drug addict running\nOut of their ... ... ...

whole thing\nOff the air is chocolate Fillon I pointed to the to the Russians as well as they look at the time you're you're a long time student a politics in the news and you ... and you've been involved just there's there's a reason this story is being pushed so hard I felt\nThat I felt that myself right and uh so when you had brought it up and yeah and then there's a few people I talked to this weekend felt the same way so that the idea is yeah there's something\nGoing on here uh and uh we're just going to be real careful uh as a nation on how we handle is I mean there was one report or this or that said well you know how many a journalist isn't going to take a can be killed before you do something with Saudi Arabia and that that was pretty hard hitting you know\nSure and uh but but with them\nOn the surreal law the president has always said he's gonna leave nations along they've they're going to operate within their sovereignty and that center and he's not going to mess with that Syria law as you know ... it's very difficult uh a scenario to uh uh try to undermine like Mr Jody has\nAlready pointed out various things\nUh from the Saudi Government regarding that but he was also still loyal as a Saudi Arabia and in the sense that he didn't like or give up his citizenship or anything he was just felt more freedom and and commenting on what was going on there\nSo you know that this thing the one that plays out I just got to play out in the next month or so\nOh yeah well it's interesting as you as you sort of alluded to who the hell can you trust between the Turks and the Saudis I mean where where where am I coming down I mean you know yeah yeah ...\nExactly you gotta wait you know just gotta wait\nIn in in the middle of the major decisions are being made by big

got a lot of attention\nRight a lot of tension I bet you couldn't name without Googling it\nAnd I'm just being honest you I'm not trying to diminish this guy's death shortening significance of it [noise]\nBut can you name another foreign journalist who's been killed 'cause there's a lot of them there's a lot of them why can't you name can you name American\nJournalist who were intimidated or killed in Russia\n\nYou probably can't I Can't I I Do know there was a guy from Forbes for instance I don't know his name now but I Know ... name\nToo so who who's pushing\nThe stories so hard and
