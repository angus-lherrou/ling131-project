you for calling in\nAnd works or how are you today I'm doing well thank you\nIt's interesting what the um uh the Republicans a prosecutor prosecuting attorney that are asked questions or a doctor for it or you know said that her summer he was basically this was not only not a A R charge herbal offense but it's not\nA charge herbal offense but it's not not doesn't even fit the realm of of what a charge bowl offense would be because of the time any any window and no facts and big holes in gaps and um and the funny thing is is that the kind of doesn't matter for for this judge unfortunately for judge Kavanaugh because\nNow that it's opened up to the FBI all it's gonna take is you know a lot of people pointing a finger with knowing your window and and like you said this is a job interview so if you have someone come into a job interview that\nYou know you've hurt somebody took drugs that you heard somebody was an alcoholic or you heard\nYou might go well you know I'm looking at another candidate much in\nYour window around this person so there's no chance that this judge is going to get past I mean not even\nNot even close I mean it's it's a Murkowski and those guys are going to find enough reason for doubt they are because they're already have cars so they get kicked it out to the FBI that that they're not\nWilling you know there there are so weak they're not willing to stand on on a principal and uh and I at this point he's done I mean there's just no way they're going to kick out where you want to do they're going to have more Michael ... type people come out and\nIf enough people are pointing a finger he if he I don't know if you've ever been appropriate court probably a quarter to quarter here say this is the same thing I mean it's just a matter who has a better story that has nothing to do with facts\nInteresting [noise] so you think uh it's all over for judge Kavanaugh let me ask you this is it is what happens to his life at this point because\nHe can't even go back to record it this way\n... I mean they basically destroying them completely exactly her including a judge\nYou have to be an example their person um to get to those with those places and um\nI tend to think that a person that uh you know your legacy as a person is how you live your life every day and I think there's enough people around him that know how he lives his life every day I'm so for all these other innuendos to come out without any facts\nI Would put a I Would put a calendar with every day's lived his life on the on the board first and say all of these\nDays my really good days right he's gotten to this place is banned because he's been an exemplary person and I think that uh this is all crap unfortunately\nIsn't is a shame isn't this terrible that uh we will allow this is this the new standard I mean this is a very scary it is\nWell we we've we've definitely set a precedent that you know some of these uh highfalutin or for politicians that were watching and if you're you know you're looking at these up and coming super left wing or super progressive er and now it's socialist\nThere you know they're going to take the gloves off they're going to if they get into you know Maxine Waters is going to get into power on a ... uh if if the Senate switches right and that's going to be a scary thing because she's on ... ... do you think that Kavanaugh's enhanced sees wicked on hands\nShe calls for for other people on the street to go and harassed the other side\nMembers and should not be anywhere near the seat of power right disgusting person\nInteresting yeah ah I ah you know what I'm hoping somehow that or\nThis or the new a chapter the FBI investigation turned up nothing but I'm I'm I'm also a realist and you're probably right there's probably a hundred people out there\nReady just throw whatever it is rotten into a that a cesspool that is now\nThe only way he could survive it would be as if there is a overwhelming um road bottle from the FBI that\nOnly are where you know ... they would have to come out and basically say that Dr Florida is a vigil liar that her story\nHer background is not what our foreground story is and they won't they won't do that I mean there's no way I mean I Know that that's the only way you'd have to say okay this this whole thing is turning\nIn his eye doctor Ford's testimony but I mean I personally thought you know she's a liar in your once a liar you can live on a lot of things because she lied about two or three things while she was there\nOr what you were saying before she got there so whatever it is still all and you can do so whenever\nYou know you started off by mentioning the the litigator and all of this and asking some very interesting questions one of which\nWas a she established this fear of flying BS which I thought was just like oh my God a ... this this Dr Ford is wrong\nYou know and she is ... that well I'm I was fearful of flying out to to Washington to be interviewed because I have this fear of being in airplanes and bench the litigator dabble issues that will act that she's been all over the world well here\nHere's the question I Would have asked her I Would have said pretty simply I'm Glad you're here and I'm Glad you're testifying I'm and I'm Glad you're you want to bring us up because you don't want this person to become a federal judge because of the things that happening in the past since the Maryland does not have a statute\nOf limitations would you be willing to get on a plane or in a box and go down to Maryland and charged him with the crime of a a sexual assault and rape but according to the if I Would like to see on the spot if she would say yes I'd like to actually\nGet out of respect for the okay now now you're an adult you put it out into the public you're you're as exposes are going to be a lot of protection around you and if you're willing to charge him because there's no statute of limitations then you got let's go\nYou know if you're not willing and treasure and so this was all political yeah right absolutely this isn't about justice this is a politics yeah because it was about justice will be going to Maryland to charge him with a crime\nWell that but then they would turn up the whole would accept this without any kind of evidence you know at the catch twenty two forever yeah\nExactly so I appreciate always hearing from you or you know you're one

[noise] in a way [noise]\nAll right we'll come back to the show that's a not judge Kavanaugh that was Matt Damon a on Senate live less I thought he did pretty good job and I remember something here's why it's pretty good they have to and this is why I I I Love set in their life\nThey have to write that stuff on the fly they just heard that\nThe day before I mean they were right there to ... I mean I Know some of that material right to self it was a little bit odd some some of the stuff [noise] um [noise] but you know I mean look they had it on friday they had to have it on the air by Saturday um\nAnd they had to get the stuff lined up so anyway I got to be a pretty good job of getting if you support judge Kavanaugh and I generally do um I haven't seen anything yet that proves he did anything truthfully I'm\nJust haven't seen it I really I mean I I haven't seen it but and I think he probably should have got some more sleep before his ... before he testified on friday although I don't know how he would have made under incredible stress\nLike no one's ever been under quite frankly before where someone's coming out with the crazy affidavit that he's a gang rape is giving ... leads to other children he was a child somehow ... curing quite loads and home to run gang rape parties in ten at least ten times\n[noise]\nMeasures someone said that about you you know you would you would not like that so anyway and the cabinet due to ... I think he did in many ways what he was when he needed to do getting out there being strong\nDefending himself saying I'm not going to withdraw I mean it was his opportunity to punch back a little bit and I I don't mind a guy who punches back now I Know there are people who do people who don't think that's the right tone and temperament that's the latest talking point now how do you come out and been subdued they would have said\nThis is what would've happened they would have said if I was being accused of that I wouldn't be that Tom cause I've literally heard people say that before about other people to go now he if you called me a rapist I be so angry he's not angry enough\nThat's what they would have said and I mean that's just how politics works unfortunately currently they would have said Kevin always just to calm and collected I mean he was being called a gang rapist [noise]\nHe was being accused of by a woman of sexually assaulting her he denies that if he really didn't do it he would have been much anger I would've been much angrier I Would have much more emotional that's what they would have said\nThe fact that he he acted angry and emotional day when no he he doesn't have the tone and to have meant to be on the Supreme Court and if that's that's what happened to the game that's [noise] that's called framing and if that's what you do politics I run a bunch of campaigns I Know that's what you do you take something and you make it sound worse\nThan it is it's not been the fact that people buy into it I get it I buy into somebody look I like I'll\nAnything I I Will buy you got a good story I'm buying I might you might take a little while for me to sort it out\nChristina lousy forge testimony felt I mean I was riveted riveted by it I mean we're sitting here playing on the radio oh sucked right into it\nAnd I said to someone actually who is here I said well I'm gonna have to read the transcript to really get a sense\nBecause I'm I mean I Believe women generally know if I thought about it I Would say well of course there were a woman who I of course there are men who lie\nBut when I see a woman claiming she was sexually assaulted on television and I'm watching or listening to it\nOf course because I'm a human being I'm going to be sympathetic to her and I'm going to generally believer\nI mean I'm I'm fully convinced something happened to that woman is just that there's nobody else who says it was judge Kavanaugh and they're even putting the witnesses that were there people she named who claims with their\nRight but I mean when you watch the thing\nAnd analyze them and go forward now it's very hard for me to do anything that happens thirty six years ago in a place I I've never been to around people I've never met\nI mean I've been in Washington DC but you get my point but in my own experience\nThe timeframe that Cabot cabinets about seven years old\nBut the technology didn't change too much of the way people communicate\nAnd the rumor mill same\nAnd while I didn't grow up in the wealthy suburbs of Washington DC yeah grew up on the free town of lake so we did All right we drank our brains out right\nAnd I knew how gossip work that I knew about how high so and so hooked up with a party with this one or social going to fight with that wanted to see so and so but so drunk social threw up we knew all that stuff\nBut in my experience I've never been to a gang rape I've never been to a gang rape but I remember there was one in New Bedford when I was a kid\nWho was a reason sometimes I couldn't walk to channel six news at six o'clock with my parents because they get out of the room for a second right 'cause it was all over the news what I'm saying is in one little town in America New Bedford grading

other stuff I think that he probably would have been better served if he left\nThat out and and he did it was real cool and calm and just stay in this case I wouldn't want to I think we might have been more believable and I think more people working on it saying\nWell look I don't do you think if he had been calm they would have said he was too common seem to guilty I mean I think he's I think he's damned if he does he's damned if he done\nWell in my experience is that\nYou know I'm like for example\nWhen he was testifying there wasn't much up in this way and about and I'm from the Cape those satellites and uh it was like four or five older people there you know I Would say the ... plus\nAnd people got the talking about it and what not and I you know kind of played in the middle 'cause you don't want to play their money\nYeah no exactly and I and and I think\nIt's a tough subject writing me some very tough subject I'm trying to play it could break down the middle of best I can hear\nRight right but anybody and everybody in that particular and burger place\nWas\nYou know saying they believe you know they really get in a but whatever reason you know they believe that they really believed that you know\nUm that that that she was assaulted by him I'm I'm not saying anything that I I Know it's a weak case but uh I I I feel bad for him because\nI'm so accomplished and somebody says that a bow to God what if he gets nominated and not any time even look at that man you got to think of\nKnow the allegations that will but absolutely\nYeah I mean and um I don't know I think that you just move on and find somebody else you know\nThat may be what happens um you know but let me ask you a question ... ... you so\nI'm In school I'm In that camp as I was mentioning earlier on when you tuned in that I watched I found it very credible ... in in the sense that if I see a woman\nExplaining how she was sexually assaulted I'm going to believe her because I'm a human being and that's just how I'm caught you know right now when I ... if you go back and take the testimony of heart\nAnd you look at facts we will you go you say well this things very very weak um because she doesn't remember where she doesn't remember when I just remember how she got there how she left and the witnesses she she claims will there say say they didn't witness anything like that\nUh now I Am fully on board with the fact that people many many many women do not report sexual assault guys probably don't either\nRight on the other stuff that happens in prison and things like that which is the only reason I even remotely obey the law not I'm not afraid to go to prison I'm afraid of what might happen to be in prison 'cause you know I'm pretty good looking but I'm the\n... the vast majority of of of as I understand is Texas also don't go on record as well I don't really have a problem with the fact that she didn't report it I'm all those years ago because I think that's\nUnfortunate very free common I'm just that when you you start to look at the case it's pretty weak and then you say All right so who's he and you say well All right there's the guy is cut this latest exemplary life\nAnd he's had all these FBI investigations all this other stuff and nothing like this is never come up as an adult in his life I'm\n... ... yeah you know I've done a lot of things that I'm not proud of my life I'm sixty six years old\nAnd if he did the FBI check on me right now with Vassar flying\nI haven't been through one um I ... but not FBI\nI'm telling you that you'd be shocked at what they come up with I mean maybe you heard me say before I never had an FBI background checked on me but I Do know some people that had one in particular sticks out in my head which was a kid who I met three times I had lunch from three times he was an intern in an office where my brother worked\nContacted me and said he had to give my name to the FBI because he may had him write down every single person right\nI Can't remember what a friend of mine was applying to the to the police department they came banging on outdoors right a neighbors' doors asking questions [noise] um and I think I think it'd be shocked at what they turn up\nNo no no I haven't this is new to that but I mean there there is there's so many things that\nYou know that happened that you know me myself but I Know that made\nIt so that is one way and FBI can find out something that nobody else knows about myself\nWell of course but that's not this allegation right this allegation is there are multiple people there you know what I'm saying yeah of course you're right I mean if you shut the rock to a store window when you're eight years old and ... never got caught and never told anybody about it yeah you get away with it and I'm not making money but I'm just saying that that was the first individual crime\nOr you're coming from but did you watch sixty minutes last night\nI watched a portion of the interview with the two centers yeah if that's what you're getting\nRomney how many um you know a lot of the Senate the lake\nLake for like like\nA mini Rome when he said his phone was blowing up hundreds and hundreds of emails kind of like a woman that he's known and grew up with that with confessing to him about how they were sexually assaulted and they never told anybody until\n... right now totally believe in have had the ... same experience in my own life\nAnd also the the whole theory about why didn't you say something about four and all this stuff I I I think that it's a proven fact that you know women you know women have done that\n\nThis is why I don't really like democracy this is why I don't really like people's other people's opinions I mean this is too serious matter to not know what your dog all but people wanted to call three younger she was a man they've never met on the sexual assault because we're going to sorority\nHey folks the hours up but
