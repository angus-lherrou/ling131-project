[laughter] good one\nI Would get the the you\nKnow it's funny [noise] so uh what else do we bring to the plate other than some DNA to have you had any outrageous\nNo not this week I'm really I'm Catholic and one Lenny do you have one [noise]\nUm no not offhand um that I can think of right off the bat but no Mm Mm\nI did notice one interesting factoid the other week yeah um the uh city council anomaly city they cut the city budget by six hundred and eighty five thousand right because they had too much appropriated um but you know and I mentioned is that ABC disposal they're looking for basically\nA hundred thousand ... the difference if I remember correctly that's another that's been thrown around which means that the council took away the extra money that they might have had if push comes to shove and they end up having to spend it\nThen it becomes an appropriation process not a transfer process what they should have done was lead the money right it in the budget and see what happens later because you cannot appropriate\nAfter you've set a tax rate ... in\nThat time is coming down the pike here within monitor when that when I Do it but I'm going to stay within about forty days forty five days and at that point you have to you cannot appropriate then only transfer and their opportunity to transfer from a surplus somebody would have been taken away\n[noise] I have a question I mean I I don't know the answer to it but ... isn't there's someone that advises the council on these things like you know I ... I've heard you said that things like this before on the show way you'll say oh what they should have done was this so I Would assume there's got to be someone there that is advisory\nCheat financial officer aries guy and he's very good but he takes his marching orders from the mayor and my suspicion is the mayor has said repeatedly that he will not pay them one dime or that he basically just\nMade you have an aside from that just the action of what you were saying about when you can't appropriate after and so on so that's\nThe that's the law you can't do it but wouldn't you wouldn't have been advised like do you think they knew that when they did that\nWell I Would think that the ones who have been there a long time with no that that's just kind of form or actually is very good on finance yeah ... he's also they have been that long enough to know how it works yeah um\nBut they took away their opportunity to have a surplus somewhere because\nAt the spring of the year when they do have a budget and the city departments that short a transfer from budgets that have something left over yeah and that's a very simple process that goes for the council and the thing that's all done and ah but appropriations or to the budget has to be done before that and and so it's going to be very interesting\nTo see what happens and waiting to see the outcome of this court case I think everybody else's across the country\nWhat I understand that awful lot of cities and towns like getting into this and they're really gonna watch this one\nDo you know when when that's coming to I\nBelieve it's in December from what I've heard I've heard this on the radio because I you know I don't I haven't talked to anybody about it otherwise but I think it's December which is really a rite of at the end of your calendar year\nMhm [noise] ah I'm In about an hour and Fifteen minutes mayor in Fall River is going to give a statement and what if you were advising ... Korea what advice would you give him when he\nStepped down\nWell you know it's funny because when it first happened I thought well you know he's a Democrat so\nIf he was Republican you know you're guilty prior to any kind of um proceedings and stuff like that so ... what just happened with Kavanaugh\nI'm with that whole thing I think that applies to him too\nMhm so if you're in thought of being as guilty in something I Do think the fed and not going to pursue a case it unless they have some serious stuff\nUm I Know he might have to step down for a little while you know ... ... what is it George ... years ago I'd I'd heard that he served a jail cell council position so\nI don't know if he's going to take a page out of that book but that's that's no good today would you tell him to fight or he can still fight but I'm Talking about stepping down from ... well I'm home will fight to to stay in that spot a theater or\nNo he's going to have to step down um there's no way that he's going to be able to effectively govern a city and to do two things at once 'cause the city council is not going to trust in many cases and\nI have to really resign or have an because it's better if he does that then have them on a seven votes over there get rid of him by the way it's interesting they have that in their chart because I don't believe we have that over here\nI Know we don't we don't have a recall either over here no we don't\nAnd that was debated some years ago and they wanted to raise also salary in the mass salary and they wanted to put a recall petition and along with it\nI'm not sure Peter if the wording of their home rule uh or or their charter actually gives them permission to do this is going\nTo be talking about it tonight that's why they're having their hearing\nIn Fall River I I don't know what the rule is over there but the term of a mayor is it two years in Fall River or is it for believe it's two years over there too yeah because I think if you go to a four year system liquid going to be doing then maybe something like that in place might be warranted\nThey didn't do that over here either no sort of they protected themselves come on yeah\nWell that they did I think [laughter] I think it's another thing to look at it now because of the kind of going into full year terms so if you have someone that or something like this comes up you do have the back door with ... who can do something about it because of a four year term you know you know so they might want to look at that and I'm\nGuessing the bond rating agencies informative I must be having one hell of a time because it shows the government between you know finding and gone and\nWhat's his name gone and now this one's going to have trouble that the ability and the government is not a not too

also\nFoot that thought all these shared by certain investments\nThey were missing funds a domino effect you know\nIt's bad but not the end of the world if we take action and fix it out\nSo this was in two thousand sixteen\nOf two thousand sixty\nSome six days after this email\nI hired an accountant\nBased on the c._e._o. slash advisor number one device\nTo address any and all\nFinancial concerns solo\nWhether it was I owe taxes\nWhether it was there was money that was missing whether it was like\nSix days after I was in for that we need to fix it up\nOne hold one nine months before I knew of an investigation\nI engage in a formal letter\nTo fix all concerned it's\nBased on what the advisory explained to me\nThe folks who are listening to change or Korea them air for the indicted Mira Fall River giving his press conference\nWhich may surpass his previous press conferences as more bizarre may still exist\nBut it's so well I I had just come in here to see if if if you heard the same thing that I heard he just said that the U.S attorney's office is in on the conspiracy\nAgainst them yes he he allegedly us attorneys' offices are under the control of lift that I'll name names here he's blaming Ken final final yeah but you can follow whose wife is a state representative\nWhich is a nice job like this is the Trump Administration is starting the Obama administration aides the indictment came down in the Trump Administration other different story but in fact he's alleging the U.S attorney's office is part of the conspiracy of political conspiracy to somehow just raise Korea\nThis I got I got a question the strategy\nI gotta members lawyers worked on something with many of them for me just say I'm not going to be with the ... you\nKnow they're gonna be resigning from this case I suspect\nAll the apps or was on the house\nWhite made you on your own fears are folks\nSo well was also an eye\nThe real apple app store\nAnd I bet you there are many people in this rural\nAverage consumers everyday people\nThat download this do all that\nBy show of hands how many people in this room\nEven a report as a sellout or their fault\nDownloaded from the apple app store\nStates in the indictment\nWas not a consumer products\nThat is just simply not true\nThat in fact I'm going to show you that for two thousand uh Thirteen and ten thousand Fifteen\nProgress on this uh was\nThat eventually what became an idea\nLanded in two thousand\nFour ... this is the crust across the shown fourteen twenty would be a similar looking to the live press conference of mayors jays will Korea who's been indicted and let's keep it in context books he is fighting for his life right now his political life\nUm tonight there was a photo of this new form of or city council they can remove him from office or to the charter so\nIf they believe is incapable of doing the office this is a political speech but he has alleged the U.S attorney's office in on the conspiracy to destroy his political career I had the direction of Ken viola I'll name the name he hasn't will go back to Washington DC\nWell what happens when you go to New York city\nWhat happens when you go to problems\nAnd you want to see the business posts\nAssumes the burgers\nWhere you don't even know the business exist [noise]\nWhat's so how did it have you on the news feed life's life's phase of life where\nThe walls and fitness posts from those services\nOne easy to follow\nWithout you having to do the business let's say a pizza shop\nAs a pizza special today I I've read that out I was on Facebook\nWell that's the only got to go to my followers was no oil isn't something post from your favorite they automatically\nAnd put it into a newspaper ... that was discovered will by anybody that had yeah\nSo that's the general just [noise] oh that's the physical out that you have earphones\nWorld as opposed to store\nProgrammers of I saw\nThat ingested all of that ad date\nYou see the business goes for oh do\nYou see you can do it as well\nYou can do the same thing and I'm On a show you that today\nSo I think by the end of this presentation\nThe slow I was I guess\nI feel like investing in Jay's company now I didn't really want to put a great company ... really was I still don't understand why it didn't make it listen to to change their career explain how snow our work\nAnd I plan flocks\nTo take advance was funny\nWithout some tension and a deliverable\nOf an ad on yes\nIt is you saw before I even show you the presentation\nMay have in this role went up\nOrdinary citizens\nThat had this out on their smartphones pros I\nWorking out in ...\nAs a series of events over time\nNecessarily go through all of them today\nAs us attorney said it would sell out\nBut rather my campaign [noise]\nIn fact the value of his products\nIn fact led to the band they meant\nBy me of this product\nFor example if just pull away from this I'll keep monitoring it but I don't think we need to see another investor presentation I don't feel comfortable giving letting him give you an investor presentation here on fourteen twenty dubious em given the allegations of what he does to investors and why I say that if he's pitching its product right now he's explaining 'cause you could see\nWhy people invested with him right he's very convincing very dynamic young man a juvenile Korea is when he tonight and they have a vote as to whether or not he will stay as mayor\n\nA normal production he's gone I suspect he's gone but I'm Talking to people who know the day to day is over there in Fall River they say now he's probably gonna make it they're not going to take them out and then as soon as\nThe governor and lieutenant governor have called on him to resign congressman Keating is ... ... has has called on him to resign and do the right thing congressman\nShut a and don't\nWith respect to criminal matters a tick dealer or simply a don't comment because it and he is the reason why a criminal quiet may have a very valid defense\nAnd depending upon how the trial develops a that defense has to do with just based on what the prosecution is present\nAnd when you go public and you make statements that are clearly going to be used against you know a box with a at the trial or your dramatically limit or the defense attorneys ability to adjust the case or based on\nUh what's developing\nA secondly I'm I think that uh when you try to explain the reasons why you're not guilty in a public setting\nA you really take away your best weapon or at trial with\nIs basically your theory of the case or your argument as to why not guilty and what you're doing is you're allowing the prosecutor a preview into the defense\nOr that allows the prosecutor put on his case or her case adjusting uh for the anticipated\nDefects it's a very\nBig he was there a to open up a yourself to argue your face publicly when your liberties going to be at stake or want to\nGo to ... we're speaking with Attorney George Li entire is giving us commentary in broad sense on the developing a issues over there for river with the mayor uh George again not speaking specifically to this but does it make any sense strategically to challenge the U.S attorney's office and to make them part of a broad political conspiracy\nNot unless you've got to prove it in court and uh I think and and uh it's a\nIt's a tough task to do in any case to allege I mean you see the president doing it over and over again or in the media for smaller is even released its report I think that's a bad strategy a but a legal strategy\nAnd um I don't think it ever makes any sense uh outside of ...\nAnd now there are times and frankly we did it in the Arab Hernandez case a wheel allege\nThat the police a failed to adequately investigate that the police had focused on Aaron because of who ... was that they didn't focus on a who the real perpetrator was because they want it to Napa big fish um\nAnd uh so there is there are times when it's appropriate to use that in court but again\nA he needs to understand that or any defended the sun to stand\nA that they're in they're not in a in the realm of a public relations or what should be a because frankly the most important thing for any defended a is to be found guilty and talk to end up going to jail\nUh so I uh again with any of the defendants that I have represented\nAll will continue to represent as time goes forward my position and I think virtually every defense lawyer that I Know a would have the same or posture with respect to the criminal defendants are not talking about the case the time to talk about it is to put up or shut up and that's of course\nGeorge ... or ... can you hang on for ... I Want to get back into this press conference he see what's happening thank you\n\nI understand the enormous powers of central financial resources\nOr the government ...\nMentally physically social work I still am so proud that part of a shaking hands going to be talking [noise] figuring out how do we continue to make this place [noise]\n... what is more\nAnd I will love food to come out and I think there's going to be a lot of people that will be about [noise]\nA lot of people that will be there [noise]\nThat was a career he's still speaking as Prescott sort of go back to George Li entire who's a giving up some conference George um he he's a challenging the the government and I noticed in his belt conditions I think a standard you're not supposed to reach out indirectly or directly to witnesses\nToo many of them are influenced them connect statement he just made it a lot of people are going to be embarrassed you could that be construed by the U.S attorney's office to be reaching out indirectly to the witnesses\nNo I don't know okay ah I don't I don't see it as that look\nAny defendant has the right and should come out and unequivocal e they feel that ... to be the truth\nOr however they want to handle it\nTo vigorously denied criminal charges against them\nAnd to steadfastly maintaining their innocence and I am a you know in certain circumstances the political circumstance I understand that politics are that are going on and but the bottom line is that you are in a serious\nA if you're in a serious criminal that or any data or that has a criminal nature to it a bold goal needs to be focused in your energy needs\nTo be focused on defending yourself you know court of law\nAunt or frankly uh what's said outside of the court of law uh sit only be used to hurt you won't help you in the court of law and that's why the general advice is all defense is is do not discuss your taste publicly\nUh and uh you're ... you're certainly titled should declare your\nInnocence uh till proven guilty and uh uh I I don't subscribe to at all or the theory that simply because someone is indicted or as so many have a ... at that age plus you'll\nDo I agree with you I Know I agree with you and we tried to emphasize that or I actually wrote a piece saying David ... innocent till proven guilty that's very very important part of a ...\nRight and far too many people in it frankly it's a difficult when we're eating out jurors we find jurors watch yeah which is the process by which are able to watch the jurors which is fairly new at Massachusetts the extent that we could do it now\nBut well we try to weed out those jurors and you'll be surprised at how many your question or if you're trying to see the jury who will tell you if the government indicted than they must be guilty\nAnd ah I'm not going to be able to get away from that prices so you know part of the selection process is to uh look at these you're say make or was not overly influenced a by\nIt and then I then or by their view of uh the righteousness of law enforcement versus the criminals offended or to try to make sure that they get a fair trial\nWe've ... we've been speaking with George George I do take a break here um but I Do want to see first of all thank you very much for for responding so quickly to my request that you come on the program to give us some some commentary at a distance about this with your experience when I look for the call and you as a as a matter of progress is okay picked\nAny St George thanks again that was Attorney George Li entire ah for New Bedford and who's very very experienced in the criminal system representing defendant's um and I thought it was important we bring that in Jesus Christ press conferences anyone can take a quick break we'll be right back turned fourteen twenty WBAI some\nBatteries in New Bern leak so going forward being twenty and do you but you\nMetro PCS is now metro buy T Mobile [noise]\nNow you get new plans with unlimited high speed data a month long all into the mobile networks [noise] check out the new metro buy T Mobile today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro buy T Mobile\nDuring congestion a fraction of customers even greater than ... per month cleanup just reduce the metro customers may notice review speeds versus on the moon\nWould you like to savor invest for your future saber investigating retirement\nSaved for your children's education call Jose ... six seven eight three seven one type of advance financial group at seven twenty five state road in Westport mass as a financial consultant since Nineteen eighty nine I have experience in setting a poor when case IRAs and annuities for a variety of my clientele\nSecurity is an advisory services operate through commonwealth financial network member N.
