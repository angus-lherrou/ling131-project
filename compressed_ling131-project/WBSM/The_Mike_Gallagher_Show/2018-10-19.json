I enjoy when first calls I think you've hit on the joke this is my opinion yeah yeah I I think so too I think he's just I think he's trolling\nUm but uh yeah I don't agree with a lot of that the ... school stuff and I think you know and I'm pretty offended by it but you know it's yeah ... that's the defense why are you doing yeah right exactly yeah that's why you're saying um\nSo yeah I think that that um we should just we were trying to lose a warm\nWeather you like Elizabeth Warren ... those are the more I I think objectively you know say that you really blew this one\nI think so yeah I think this is pretty bad and she's getting a lot of backlash from the Native American community if she had just done the test\nThen she would have been I think you're right you should have been finding that you made it this big publicity stunt because she's running for president\nSo um yeah I think she really lose one I think that now it's just going to be worse it's going to be it's just going to be worse just going to get even more who are now people are going to say even though I guess it's not an accurate representation of how DNA works and I'm not sure really sure how it works it's a complicated thing\nYou know average eighty and I was at another PHD or or a doctor but um it's against like it's not accurate to say oh she's only one one thousand or something like that but that's what people are going to say no one's going to no one cares you know when you're doing\nWhen you're doing a elementary school math fractions and you're doing a high school biology DNA people's eyes glaze right oh yeah of course yes that's just what you get into the whole thing about how the United states people are going to switch the state's rights you know just ... but when people are laughing at you lose its yeah ...\nAnd she really got the I mean I saw David Axelrod for example came out against or oh you know yeah just\nSay you know they were that if you know David Axelrod on your side I mean right\nNow there's a big time Democrats those you don't know in ... in in in there they're angry with her because it's so close to the to the\nGeneral election yeah and she brought this this issue up and it really really not happy hey if you're if you're if you're not I'm able to get through you get through and then we dropped the call give us a call back we may be having a little bit of technical difficulty some of the lines may not be working exactly right but I'm not sure if that's the case\nBut I think we've had a couple of people who we didn't I didn't hang up on

solid she's still in progress so she's still a a a Democrat in the Senate so I mean it it gets to the point now where like you know we're trying to win back the majority and it's like I'll take I'll take I'll take Joe Manchin don't take whoever I can you know you take it where we can get to see you can get the majority because that she's a vote\nFor Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader and that's that's actually what I Want I'm a you know she is actually you know she's not she's qualified to be president she's definitely qualified I mean before she was before she was a U.S senator she was a you know she was a Harvard law professor and I think she was the third most cited\nUm she was the third most cited attorney in a publications about consumer protection law she's very you know she's she's a she's a leader in that field\nAnd she was almost chair that because there was Protection Bureau and help Obama set that up so she's definitely qualified to be president she does a lot
