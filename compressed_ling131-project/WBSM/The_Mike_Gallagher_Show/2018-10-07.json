I mean a lot of different things problems\nBecause stomach can function up to its potential\nAnd we could go through every single nerve coming out through\nJust fine in that way and there can be break down at those levels\nDoes that make sense I mean it's like common sense it makes sense doesn't it just like in your house go ahead you can flip one of those witches and guess what you won't use that part\nNow thank God at least that when your spine does that it's not a hundred percent blocked right thank God at least some flow goes through but I Do how much to the forty wants to go through\nTo your stomach or to your heart your lungs\nAnd ... and and tell me listen\nIf one of those parts starts to break down what happens\nMaybe there's high blood pressure because it's the heart maybe there's what respiratory infections and problems because the lungs maybe ... ... and and guess what there was a prescription for each one\nI don't know but there's a pill for the symptoms right there'll be confused drugs are for the symptoms of a problem not for the cause of it\nSo that makes sense so chiropractic is the only thing chiropractors are the only ones on the planet\nCorrect ... they will actually are trained to detect missile I met on this mine and then what correct it bring it back to normal severe buys actually functioning and healing normally\nAt a hundred percent the way it's designed to\nListen we don't steal anything your body's designed to do that itself\nYou know people say thank you for telling me I didn't heal you she know guts set that up not me\nYour body heal itself\nBut what if the thing that's trying to heal you and help you function is blocked than what\nCauses trouble right\nThe last time you went to the doctor and were fooled up your prescription\nWhat was the actual causes the problem is it the lack of the purple pill\nIs that why your stomach not working\n'cause my stomach working okay in fact it's working great and I don't have a purple pill I don't have to take that\nBy the way when you take your blood pressure and fulfill that\nYou know renew that prescription what's The Cosby high blood pressure\nWell because I don't take high blood pressure medications and mine's fine\nSo there's something that's causing it do you get that what is that does anybody care\nI I Hope you do I mean really you've got to really start thinking a little more um\nDeep deductive Lee right I mean like let's get to the cause of the problem and not just cover up the symptoms of the problem\nHow much more evidence is needed\nThat the medical paradigm that the that the the idea that better chemistry\nSomething in a pill bottle\nWell is that true\nSee the drug paradigm\nIs not working just look at it\nThe number one even even just side effects from drugs alone side effects from ... prescription drugs the number three killer in the ... in the United states\nThat's according to Lucian leap from Harvard Medical school\nAgain if if it's a healing art [laughter] that doesn't sound very appealing to me if it's killing\nHundreds of thousands of people per year or dying from a ceiling art is not a healing art in my eyes if that's what's happening first do no harm [laughter] right right so the wellness revolution is here and it's safe and it's effective and it's less expensive and it's less suffering\nWe need to start taking advantage of that\nAre you taking advantage of that I I Want to I Want you to I Want your family to take full benefit of that\nBecause again\nWhat makes more sense to you\nTell me tell me if it really does make sense that you would cover up the symptoms of a problem and not get to the cause of it\nWhy do you need to keep ... new in your prescription if it worked [laughter] it it it's not it's actually only fighting against the symptoms the cause remains otherwise you wouldn't have to keep taking\nDoes that make sense and so again there's so many things that can cause your spine to actually ... fate and start to block\nOr cut down on the healing messages\nThe innate intelligence the flow of power in your body\nWhat are some of those things number one stress\nOh you don't have that here [laughter] [noise] I Know that's the number one number one is stress and then\nSleeping positions vending twisting falls car accidents sports\nSitting too long working at computers carrying heavy objects even the birth process itself could be the first ... so if those are the causes than who could have subway station who\nWrite anybody could have it\nGot to tell you it's not just that when you get a missile I met in your spine in fact you could have a missile I'm your spine listen you can\nWell I'm In your spine and not even know that it's there right now\nAnd you say well no it's pinching the nerve that it's got to be painful right only sometimes\nIn fact research shows now only ten percent of your nervous system even perceives pay a hundred percent your nervous system has function it does something\nBut only ten percent has pain perception\nSo you could have a problem that's irritating or putting pressure are blocking your nervous system and not feel it at all\nIn fact that's the majority\nOf the people who don't feel it at all\nThat's why research shows now you should periodically have your spine professionally checked\nHave you had that checkup\nYou may not even have known you should have that\nI'm here to tell you that's the most important checkup you could ever have\nIs to get your spine and nurses some professionally checked by someone who is trained to do with that and the only person on the planet that's trained do that is a chiropractor\nSo now's the time to get your spine in her system professionally checked\nIs an appointment to get your spine nurses muted consultation examination and ... X rays\nAnd normally that could that could be hundreds of dollars and so in our office our purpose\nOur vision is that everyone at least have their checkup\nTo see if they have this problem to see if they have civilization blocking the power that's trying to heal and function and their body\nSo especially children children do you imagine trying to grow up and develop a body with blockages in your nervous system\nI mean I Can't even imagine that and yet we have\nMany children who never even been checked\nNever been checked\nListen all you needed a checkup and right now if you call now leave your name and number you can get a consultation examination including the X rays for only thirty five dollars that's it just leave your name and number on the machine someone will get back to you\nReturn to normal function I mean it's just it's amazing what the\nThe results were of this study and so they had fewer complications faster results fast recovery and lower costs I mean what more could you ask for right\nBut really the the the ... glory chiropractic a highest utilization is not for corruption is not for um gosh\nTreatment as prevention prevention it's not only to get people healthy but they're not only get them healthy but to keep them healthy it's for prevention and and and can you imagine and in fact I don't even have to imagine they've actually studied people on Medicare\nAnd they found that people on Medicare that were utilizing chiropractic care I I Wish I had that study in front of me right now here at the radio but listen they had significantly less hospitals face significantly less drug prescription\nOr utilization significantly less medical doctor utilization unless cost I mean ... it's incredible\nJust by what its prevention it's called prevention\nThere's another study from the annals of internal medicine talking about\nChiropractic increasing the recovery of shoulder\nProblems shoulder problems now again I I got to tell you we have so many people who come in with shoulder problems and some of them are already had surgery surgeries on their shoulders\nI got to tell you the vast majority of those people the vast majority I don't have the numbers they have neck problems\nEven this study talked about the there were a hundred and fifty patients studied and this and what they found was they had a surgical problems they had problems in your neck\nAnd when they started getting those adjusted they got there\nThe the better\nThe people got better and they had some of them even ... and I can tell you in our practice some of them even had surgery on their shoulders already shoulder pain shoulder but watch do you know what controls\nYou have to understand that the shoulder I used to think that it's a ball and socket\nIt's not the shoulder actually is suspended it's not even\nInside of a ... a socket or join the shoulder is suspended your arm is suspended by ligaments in muscles\nAnd then when you move it there's muscle groups that work together in the front and back in the top and the side they're all working together to create proper moment ...\nAnd so guess what controls those muscles\n[laughter] nerves coming out of the neck in upper back\nSo if there is this a lemon and loss of power are going to that area that's what causes\nAnd wear and tear causing what ten and I asked for scientists\nCrevice arthritis in the ...\nAnd the shoulder has what pain it can cause pain to the armed and ... and all these other things and guess what the problem is\nWe start adjusting the neck in the shoulder problems resolved so many times I've seen it and I'm I'm not just talking about shoulder problems we see that in people's knees\nI've had people I I mean I'm not even I'd had people who've had knee problems for years\nEven some that have had surgeries on both knees\nAnd they've come in I've adjusted them and their knees got better\nAnd I never touched their knees\nKnow some people have problems and the nice you know and sometimes the problem secondary to a problem in the hit by the lower back\nDo you have to understand the foundation\nThe foundation is this fine\nThe foundation of not only a movement but all function starts in the spine\nSo we find people with shoulder problems knee problems ankles\nT. M. J. Shaw problems elbows carpal tunnel syndrome\nAnd the majority of those the foundation of the problem the primary part of the problem is in the spine\nEven some that have had surgeries we started off the show talking about the unnecessary surgeries again even the wrist I've had people who've had their risk cut open multiple times only that the problem is even worse after\nThey come in I just their neck and there is a problem with the way the carpal tunnel went away some of those people have problems in the wrist I admit that I understand that\nBut there's so many thousands of people\nTheir problem was in their ... behind the whole time\nAnd it never got address and so obviously it's not going to recover it's not going to get better even if you cut that part open right should not be the last resort\nShouldn't car practically utilizing tried first\nSince we're\nBack to school now you know the kids are\nBack in learning and so forth\nWhen we talk a lot about school Leo says\nAnd again you know that the schools do the best they can I'm sure they do they want the best for the kids but and they have their own little checkup that they do and most schools you know who does the checkup\nIt could be the ... ed teacher the gym teacher\nIt could be a nurse\nThese are people and maybe they've had a training it might have been an hour to might even be half day of training\nTo check for ...\nIf it's my child it's not enough [laughter] not for something serious like that right a spinal condition that could be actually ... or you know become permanent if it's not detected incorrect and right away\nSo I got to tell you that's what we do\nI had years of training and decades of experience\nCorrecting ... in our office\nHigh to tell you they've they've they've actually done studies on the school checkups\nNot no one specific school that I'm gonna mention but what we know is they checked students first grade they check first graders for ... and found that fifty two percent of them had some form of ... over half\nAnd they ran the through the school screening\nLess than two percent were detected\nNo in fact for something serious like that you want somebody who's trained\nFor your child for my child I Want that and I hope that's what you want for years I tell you we we go out and the commute\nI did do screenings because people don't notice and their children they think they're okay because they went through the school screening they might be but what if they're not\nBecause I got to tell you when they grow you understand if there's ... there's ... there's more unequal weight bearing in other words there's more weight on one side of those bones as they grow than the other you know can happen now formation\nYou don't that happens it's permanent there's no correcting it\nAs permanent and not only is it permanent but as they grow and as gravity is pushing on that day by day week by week\nIt becomes worse\nAnd so the worst things I've seen is that you know they get cut open from the base of their neck down to their hips\nAnd then they put rods in there\nDo you want to know what that does to the limitation of that child's life\nAgain and all that can be prevented an even corrected if it's caught early enough\nAnd children and chiropractors are the experts on the planet and that\nAnd we've corrected Silvio says hundreds of times hundreds of times\nI'll sometimes even ... later in life but again it's it's obviously\nMore so if it's caught early\nNot only challenge you but make sure you get your children checked specifically by an expert\nI I Know that's what you want for your child what's best right so\nIf you haven't had your children checked for that I Want you to call our office and kept them checked\nThe number to call to make the climate is five oh eight\nNine nine nine four zero four or five\nThe other thing I Want to touch on again we we've already kind of touched on this once but I Want to make sure you understand and this is another study talking about a rest or being sedentary\nA college and they asked for volunteers I'm from this from this uh university and it wasn't hard because the volunteers got paid to do nothing\nJust sit around they could play video games they could watch TV they could watch movies but they actually just we're supposed to be sedentary\nSo for eight weeks these kids later on for eight weeks they studied them\nThey checked them before and they checked them afterwards and they actually found out listen to this and just eight weeks\nIn front of the television\nOr video games ...

our discussion on anybody's last week so we did yes but\nBut I actually have to clarify something like I said which is true but I ended up getting more information what happened was I talked about a particular company and I couldn't remember the name of the company\nThat had a private letter ruling about being able to take money out of an annuity with the\nRegulations that were pre Nineteen eighty six okay so before Nineteen eighty six you could put money into an annuity take your let it grow and then take your principal back out\nBefore you you had to take your interest I sold it was first then first out all\nThe government changed the regulations and now it's a last in first out so you put money in that's the first and it grows that was the last in that's what it grew by so when you take your money out of an annuity and we're talking non qualified\nDoesn't matter if it's a retirement account and Irish on that that doesn't apply to that it applies only to non unqualified money\nThe regulation now is that it's last in first out so when you take money out with what you have to take the job gains first\nAnd the reason I brought that up was because I sat with a distributor there were people that work for these companies that I run my that I place my investment business with for my clients and they come in and you know they come in and talk to me about\nSo you decide you don't want to take it up just your old seven and a half or yeah seven and a half and you decide you don't want to take the money out I don't need the income I don't want to take it up\nYou risk or the the paying fifty percent of that which would be Seventeen hundred and twenty five dollars or so as a penalty\nAnd then the thirty six hundred what you should have taken out gets added to your taxes if you took it up and you get taxed on it at twenty two percent anyway so if you do take it out you avoid the fifty percent penalty and you're just pay the twenty two percent on

here on fourteen twenty W. B. S. and so right continuing our conversation\nAbout um earn ... required minimum distributions [laughter] so I'm going to um two things one we were talking off the air just a little bit uh in the other is um [noise] there was one time only\nOh we have a we have a couple of callers uh when\nYou're alive on money matters\nAnd hello hello Tuesday\n[noise]\nI think you had her but she got lost jungle back please call again\n\nThat's all right we'll take your calls again oh yeah right the next year [laughter]\nSo um\n[noise] there was only a the first year that you're supposed to take your required minimum distribution is the only year that you can do for it to the next year you can never for any of the other ones again so\nWhat happens is let's say you turned seven and a half this year\nYou have until April first of next year so you turned Seventy and happened to those maintain you have until April first of two thousand and Nineteen\nTo defer this year's aren't they required minimum distribution what'll happen though is next year because you defer to you have to take to the one for the year that we are now in and the one for the year that you deferred\nI normally do not recommend that because it could increase the amount and put someone in a higher tax bracket\nRight we've got a caller right now you're\nAlive on money matters hello hello\nHello Hi Hi Hi sorry about that that's OK I'm really glad you're talking about this today um I'm trying to understand I understand about the penalties and the tax\nAnd all of that but could you explain what would be the reason that if you are retired that you would wait until seven and a half as opposed to take that at let's say sixty five and a half and how would you figure out\nHow much you should take it started it sixty five in Athens said\nOkay so don't hang up okay so the Seventy and a half\nIs the mandated time age that you have to start taking it if you've never taken any money before right but once you retire whether it's sixty five sixty two sixty seven however whenever you retire\nIf you then start to need income to supplement your Social Security your pension plan any other money so they're still coming in you can start\nBut but the that timeframe um you no longer pay the penalty because you're over fifty nine and a half and there's no penalty applicable because you're not Seventy and a half yet okay okay so once you hit Seventy and a half\nWhether you were taking money or not then there's a an actual\nNumber that you have to take so our so for example you hit Seventy and a half you have a a hundred thousand dollar account you have to take I Believe it's around thirty six hundred and forty nine dollars that year\nOkay so let's say that the year prior when you were sixty nine you had taken three thousand dollars and you turned Seventy and a half and you figured you were going to take again the three thousand dollars well now you're shortchanged yourself on the amount the euro mandated to take\nOh so you have to take the other six forty nine or six fifty I didn't I normally round up or you have to take that number because if you don't if you only took the three\nYou're then going to old Uncle Sam three hundred and twenty five dollars\nAs the penalty for the amount you didn't take the it was supposed to\nAll right so if I'm understanding you correctly but for seven and a half you can decide how much you want to withdraw correctly but after seven and a half you have to pay 'em that minimum required at\nLeast your minimum ninth and always you can always take more ... Uncle Sam doesn't mind that you take more they're gonna get more tax right okay but you have\nBecause at least your minimum okay All right it's all very you know a lot to think [laughter] and I didn't try to read up\nOn it so I'm really glad I listen to your show and I'm trying to get information so you know and it's a toss up do you take it now I mean you know leave it there so\nWhile I have I have some clients who based on what they collect from Social Security only\nHave started taking in Mount ... which is higher than their minimum distribution right earlier because they still aren't going to pay any taxes on what they're taking out\nRight right and I understand you do have to pay tax um you wouldn't have to pay tax depending on how much you get in a pension correct and and anything else correct\nThere's a there's a there's a factor that you also have to use when you when you figuring out your taxes so you take a you take a Social Security you multiply that monthly thumbs twelve month to cut in half then you add that have to your other income if you're single and you hit twenty five thousand or over\nAnd believe it or not the tax is probably going to be a bigger tax if you file a then the tax break that they gave you a ... depending on how much you take\nSo if you're taking if you took fifty thousand dollars out of your retirement account and there's other earnings you're potentially going to pay at a higher tax bracket maybe not all it's not everybody but maybe that's\nBurned it to begin with because you might have been at a lower tax bracket when you when you were earning ... so there's a method to the madness with this with Uncle Sam he'd be they want the tax money\nBut depending on what you're earning like I said earlier I have some clients\nWho are no longer filing because their income and so so small so little so which they don't have to file anymore and I get I get asked all the time um you know when I retire I don't have to file taxes anymore and I tell them I tell clients taxes have been nothing to do with age taxes have got to do with income\nSo a few good income a pension Social Security maybe rental income investment income dividends and so on you might still have to pay taxes even after you retire I Am one of my older client's that I've talked about quite often on the air here or she passed away unfortunately um but she was\nEighty eight and eighty eight\nYears of age she was still filing taxes every single year\nWow yeah All right so we're going to take a short commercial break if you have any questions about

[noise] so you still contributing is still a participant\nBut over the years you have had other employment at other organizations and you have taken prior for one k.'s and ruled them over into a personal IRA\nSo rolled over your prior four one K. is a new aggregated them you put them all together in one eye operate with an investment company with an insurance company with a bank wherever\nYou turned Seventy and a half you have to take your are empty from your IRA\nBut you do not have to yet take your arm the from your four one K. you can keep contributing and not take that amount out now as soon as you retire\nYou then have to take your are indie from your IRA\nAnd you're already from your ... or you could roll over your president four one K. add it to your own IRA\nAnd take the amount from that one account totaling the amount that you were supposed to take pay but as long as you're employed and you're still participating in a four one K. at work and you're over Seventy and a half you are not yet mandated to take the RMC from that account\nNow that doesn't work for all retirement accounts that works for four one K. works for a few others but that does again there's some some stipulations on other types of retirement accounts [noise] um I have a client who um [noise] I Believe it's a simple IRA\nHe can still contribute but he has mandated to take his ... distribution also ... okay so here's some common errors [noise]\nThe ... in a qualified plan like for one case for three days and so on must withdraw from their accounts annually once they reach age seven and a half\nFailing to take an armed he can lead to unnecessary tax burdens and other financial issues so it's important to understand the rules and the common errors people make so here's the common era\nI took an arm the from my four oh one K.\nThis will satisfy both the armed differ that account and the one I have to take for my IRA or any other account for that matter\nHere's what the rules actually say are on these can be aggregated for certain accounts for instance if you have multiple traditional IRAs you can take an armed from one account that equals the total amount of armed days you would have to take from all accounts\nSo if you have to traditional IRAs\nAnd each has an R. M. D. of a thousand dollars you can withdraw two thousand dollars for one account to satisfy both are um deeds\nArmed these perceptions simple IRAs can be aggregated with traditional IRAs as well\nThe same or in the aggregation rule can be applied to multiple for all three B plans\nYou cannot however it taken arm the from a four oh three B. plan to satisfy an hour I'm Dave from an IRA when it comes to ... and other non IRA accounts such as profit sharing plans you must take a separate R. M. D. from each plant\nNow this can get a little convoluted and it can get 'em a little muddy um so if you my recommendation normally is if you have\nMultiple four one K. is multiple for three days multiple other types of accounts so that you don't go cuckoo trying to figure out ways you're taken and what one applies to one and so on a roll it over into an IRA make life easier\nAnd the majority

um the various candidates all coming up in this time you're looking for your door selling last time I spoke to you you weren't ready yet to endorse or the Democrat nominee for governor Jay Gonzales have you made any decisions in that area at this\nPoint you got it I Would like to know more now today Sharon right here I got on my phone is a lot so um how convenient and how that is a ... making no\nAnnouncements today I mean obviously as a sort of\nYou know I I Am a Democrat and so you know I presume to support a dumb or the Democratic nominee and um let's not to say that I Would agree with him on every ... every manner and there are some you know some things that I agree that it's a\nYou know the current governor on some things I think he's done well sometimes I think that they need some improvement um but uh\nBetter candidate you guys just get a better plane while the gal who's got a better plan for the city I mean God that was just down the taxes and then you know raising taxes on endowments for the colleges which would ultimately mean that New Bedford residents we'd be paying more for tuition or we lose money for a for\nWe don't have a we don't have a college from one of the few ... lower your mom Massachusetts reading it in some way you can go to school but\nI Would actually I think I'd actually would would result in a net benefit to the right to manage just looking out for the most parochial sense because it's not you know if we if we if we had like two or three major universities in the middle of the city I you know I probably think differently about it but strictly from you know from um\nYou know the net benefit that direct financial benefit a prospect of a New Bedford will probably be a ... you would probably gain from them and loose but an answer to your more mature broader question um\nYeah I mean it's the city's interests first and and I think there's some things that Governor Baker has done well and there's some things that that a concern me in a\nSpecially especially as I see them through the prism of the ... of new bed for its own interests um you know there's there's um there are a number of things actually so give me give me an example of something then it's then it's kinda well I mean I'll just throw this out\nYour name him in New Bedford resident that's on a statewide board\nYou can actually I'm the only one I did because either by statute I after there is an economic cows wine but there is no there's nobody on the Massport asked development mass cultural council um you you name um the mass cc I mean you can go down the list\nI'm not aware of anybody um\nAnd those are the big boys it may be some obscure\nA state board that has representation here um\nYou know the governor's transition team there was a single New Bedford resident on that and there were dozens and dozens of people on that um you know I've raised yeah and and when they did their state wide listening sessions at the beginning of their administration\nUm was ah they did them all over the state and they get again the dozens of them there wasn't a single one held in New Bedford I mean like it's in that that to me is\nIndefensible right um\nAnd understandable um so like you know the lack of representation of New Bedford an administration is a concern that I've shared it with them at the public about it um and I and hasn't it hasn't changed so um that's why one of the things I I I often get accused of being\nYou know louder than most when it comes to advancing you know my cities in our regions interest and that's because you know I have to be I have to be more short of more aggressive in order to get the point across\nSo I mean that's just that's just one example and that's certainly a concern and it's something I've told him I said look if you get reelected and they probably will get reelected that um you know I Want I Want to see addressed and that just that there was just throw it as one example but that's not a trivial one\nHas Gonzalez align themselves with anybody from the city then that might or might\nHave had many conversations with him um and stay why can't it's all come knocking for my daughter sure yeah and uh and so I'll continue to talk to him and and um you know see we're we're that goes I Know him I knew him\nI actually didn't know him before I became mayor but I had a number of uh you know people that we knew and in in common and um and so but I've worked with him when he was with in the Patrick administration as the secretary of\nA administration and finance and um you know I've I have a lot of respect for him I think he's capable guy and so uh so we'll we'll see\nUm yes any gift deal was on the program and had a press conference in town or all throughout the area I guess I'm addressing this\nApparent decision by a Senator Warren to explore a run for the White House boy big surprise there right um well that's the ... yeah well that's a huge surprise I mean I was bowled over by that rival aren't you\n[laughter] surprised there yeah so I was there um he makes a valid point that if this war in the middle of a term\nThree years into a term for using the term exist you know what this is my opportunity this is my now this is you know I've got to do this yeah I understand that but when somebody is running for a new term\nAnd the day after they get elected\nThey ... you know start the resumes and then hit the campaign trail and everything else I mean\nThat doesn't\nShow a whole lot is back in my piece respect in my opinion to the to the voters in Massachusetts I mean we will be if she decides to run for president that kind of leaves us with one senator for at least the next two years\nAnd possibly puts in its into a situation where we are having a special election in a couple of years down the road yeah I mean she didn't she make a decision one way or the other because this isn't in the middle of the term it's decided well no I\nMean I just consider the the opposing are so I get that and I'm you know I think as a campaign you know what I'm saying that on the campaign is probably not something that you want to do I presume that she was asked the question somewhere and didn't want to come across as you know to call you on the issue of cars at work and then she's\nShe's clearly interested in the than the job and you know there was a there was certainly the start of a groundswell of support for her even in the last um presidential um race so\nYou know I I I I Would offer people that there is there's a sort of a countervailing view and that is you know if she's raising if she's might be the ... potential president of the United states um I Know that's not something that you get too excited about that but if she's\nGoing to Australia with Barbara Streisand [laughter] so Rosie O'Donnell [laughter] hang out and have to look out something that you know find the Barbie [laughter] that I'd love to see that [laughter]\nUm\n... if she's seen

capital improvement a program on one point six million dollars for a port St repairs which are happening\nAll over and that's in addition to the money that we get from the state you know up until a few years ago we were putting nothing into that and now we're putting a substantial amount and we're also getting you know a fair amount of funding from\nSome funny I should say for my own overstated some funding from from every source to do a work on roadways to uh where where there's been a lot of patching over over the years so\nUh that's happening and then there's a bigger road projects like\nYou know cause all street and union street and the the southern end of routine or you know well underway um\nAnd I've been really moving along and looking looking good looking better all the
