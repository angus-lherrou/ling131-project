him\nYes I have one question what mock as she was saying that they should have been more investigation the\nSenate more power than the FBI because they have the power of subpoena\nAnd why did it Dianne Feinstein Feinstein the\nSea and they're good at it without embarrassing dot org or judge Kavanaugh instead they made up ... this is Mike ...\nThanks for the call great question going Marcus I'm a yeah I I I don't necessarily agree with find science moved to hold a letter and wait till the last minute to pull it out that doesn't that's not to say that\nThe Republicans are there's nothing we could do you could have voted for the ... you have the Senate for another five ... oh four or five months you could've you could've had held the laundry ... a more thorough investigation once not act like the the deadline was set by them it's an arbitrary deadline they didn't need to put it there so this whole like oh they there's nothing they could have done they could have done more\nUm they could have done more to early investigate them but tactically I think in retrospect and there's no scenario in which Dr Ford doesn't revealed herself to the public and this actually gets any ... this this actually gets to gain any team any traction because then it's like oh mystery woman said this and like you know there's never happened\nIn in retrospect Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer blue there so I think\nYeah the the yeah I like I said the Democrats definitely mishandled is a little bit um you know that's not to say that that should have you know that that justifies Kavanaugh's confirmation but ...\nBut if they blew it they had and I mean there are legitimate issues particularly their early ... documents yes I read\nThis stuff yeah I've joked about it here and there but then I like first looked at I think I Would Miranda what are they talking about ... ... of course the Savage Miranda rights in the Warren Court and I skipped over it because I taught\nAnd whatever you know a kind of asked and answered settled law right right but then when I came back about no Miranda was actually a clerk on the Senate Judiciary committee or or a staffer\nWho was getting into the Democrats or Republicans council yeah you know getting into the computer yeah to see Democrats documents when Kavanaugh was in the Bush White House and helping to shepherd through judicial nominee\nHaving all lied about it he said he didn't know any new and he also lied about nominations that he made said he didn't he didn't support the nomination of Richard Pryor who would it would reduce the sentence of across burner in Kentucky\nAnd it turns out to me which is ironic need health comedian [laughter]\n... um yeah I did I see ... maybe it's ... judge prior prior to ...\nRight I feel it's called Richard Pryor what's called a judge Kavanaugh helped put Richard Pryor\nOn the bench but he nominated this probably you not only he not only a was involved but he's the one that suggested among the first place so there's like they need to lighten is on the Web and testimony in the Fort hearing to he said he wasn't he worked as bought off to a deal they didn't have any advantages he was like he was a legacy\nUm admission but that's fine like ... if you're going to but if you're going to lie about that well it's going to lie about well\nHere's the thing is I just thought they did she I think I don't know whether they just thought that well that that that people wouldn't care about or my other thing is that I I guess there are probably\nThat's probably true that people don't they don't they don't care you know this this has come down to I've seen people that they don't they don't know necessarily a knowing anything about the Supreme Court get super excited over this and I'm like there's it's just a matter of a one you know like this isn't this isn't a game with the patriots is Supreme Court seat you know and there was some serious allegations there\nI think you know I think it was a terrible nominee I get I get it on paper his qualifications you ... qualified but there's there's some there's some murky history that that would never never got addressed\nFeeling is is is the tactics of the hard left out just screaming and yelling turns people off and they really should have toned down yeah but but they did they I don't know and sometimes\nA senator has no ... you know they got to ride the way they have no real control over what the base does I mean I don't think if I don't know what they would have done to stop those protesters rights\nBut ... why is one is protesting all of a sudden an issue now is that an issue and you know there's not an issue to me I'm just saying it's it's a visual issue and you know it's it's it's it doesn't mom and pop America do like Senate protesting is not a explosive to liberals but he's screaming yelling yeah just it just doesn't look\nYeah it it made it look chaotic and and
