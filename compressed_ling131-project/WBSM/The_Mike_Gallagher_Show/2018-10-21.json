I'm not saying well you will be [laughter] I I I'm telling you\nSo don't take the chance right start living in conjunction with the laws of health and healing and then you'll reap the benefits of it so black belt each one of those things now the other option of prevention\nMean it's the option that's out there through medicine is the flu shot\nOf course we know that it's on every corner now gas stations have it you know you can pull up to the light and get one right on pretty much almost I mean they're they're everywhere flu shots so it seems like well it must be something that we should do well let's ask some questions about the flu shot OK let's look at the science is look at the reasoning behind it well\nNumber one what I Want to know is with the flu shot or with any other intervention is doesn't make me healthier\nIs there evidence is or science is a is there you know an indication that the fight get the flu shot then I'll be healthier afterwards\nThat's one thing I Want to know number two is\nWell since getting sick has to do with my resistance my immune function does the flu shot\nIncreased my resistance\nIf I get the flu shot well my ... my immune system be stronger because of it all those are questions we have to ask well let's look at some of the results and some of the studies on the flu shot up in Ontario\nThe universal influenza immunization campaign\nWas canceled it failed after the incidence of flu did not decrease when more people got vaccinated the archives of internal medicine\nHas said that they could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage\nAfter Nineteen eighty with declining mortality rates in any age\nThe American thoracic society says that children who get the flu vaccine\nThree times the hospitalizations from the flu as those who have not received it\nNothing about that right now what I just said because when you're trying to determine whether your children should get the flu shot\nJust consider that if they get it they have three times the chances of being hospitalized from the flu than it was a child who doesn't get it that's according to the American thoracic society the Cochrane Collaboration study just came out recently they\nThirty six trials\nFor the flu vaccine that they looked at\nAnd they found is ready no evidence that vaccination prevent bio transmission than adults\nLet me just say that again they said there's no evidence\nFrom thirty six trials is Lucia\nThat it actually halts or prevent viral transmission in adults and they said\nThe flu shot is no more effective than a placebo\nWell I think the placebo is a little cheaper [laughter]\n'cause there's nothing in it there's nothing to placebo right and it works just as well\nAnd the British medical journal says the inactivated vaccines\nHave little to no effect and little comparative evidence exists on the safety of those vaccines\nAnd then the Lancet which is another medical journal said increasing vaccination rates since Nineteen eighty have not lower death rates among the elderly so what's the purpose in other words among\nElderly people and immuno compromised people they say get the flu shot because you won't die right I mean you you you ... but that's not true that's not what science has shown and for younger people that they get the flu shot you won't get the flu well that's not true either because that's not what the evidence shows in fact people who got the flu shot remember the H. one in one\nYou were twice as likely to get H. one in one flew\nIf you had the vaccine the previous year\nTwice as likely so what are we saying here you actually more likely to get the flu if you get the flu shot\nAnd not only that listen\nThe flu shot has\nSome very interesting things that aren't\nToo good right we look at hue ...\nHe's a very well known 'em and honored him into a geneticist in fact these were leading one because he's published eight hundred and fifty research articles\n[laughter] that's a lot he says\nDue to the mercury and aluminum build up in the brain from the flu shot the result is cognitive dysfunction Oh yes there is still ... and most of the flu shot some of them are without now but they still have mercury and in many of them\nHe said that if you have five flu shots\nNot in the same year I mean Scott five flu shots you have a ten times higher likelihood of getting Alzheimer's disease\nWell even if the flu shot worked\nLet's just assume it but if if we assume that it worked would it be worth a trade off\nTo not get the flu but then you get ten times more likely to get Alzheimer's disease and the flu shot has again has aluminum has formaldehyde mercury cancer causing agents do you know if you took those things and dumped them somewhere you'd go to jail they'd rush you\nYou can dump it in your bloodstream but you can't open the environment\nAnd just realize those are cancer causing agents if you worked with those things in industry you'd have to have glove a mask you'd have to work under the hood and exhaust fan\nAnd those are the things that are being in fact you realize that\nAnd you may have seen this in the news during the H. one in one year a couple of years ago\nThere was a flu clinic over in Warwick and it was in the gymnasium of school and there's all these people in line to get the flu shot and someone who was administering it dropped a vile on the floor\nSo some of the flu shot was on the floor and guess what happened after that they evacuated the school and called in a hazardous waste cleanup team\nWhich is what's required because\nIn the flu shot is hazardous waste\nSo they so I don't know about you if I was in line to get the flu shot and they spilled some of it\nAnd they had to call in a hazardous waste cleanup team and evacuate the school to clean up what they were going to inject into my blood stream\nSomething seems wrong with that picture doesn't that to you I mean you don't have to be a genius to figure that out do you really\n[laughter] and now they have flu zone for babies and they're telling pregnant women some times to get this stuff there's mercury this federal this ether gelatin formaldehyde chicken embryos do you want that ends injected into your child into your baby\nI don't know about you didn't\nNot only is it scientifically showing that it's not working but\nLook at the thing that are in there that you're injecting into your family's bloodstream aluminum is associate with narrow generation\nA. L. S. Parkinson's dementia\nSo if it's a virus or bacteria\nAnd your body starts coughing to get it out or sneezing and then you stopped it with a cough medicine or cough suppressant\nWhere does the bacteria go if you stop the cough because that's your body trying to get it out right it stays in\nGinseng here medicine and drugs are designed for the symptoms of a problem not the cause of it meanwhile you could feel better sure you can get the cough\nSuppressed you can actually suppressed fever you can suppress the high blood pressure you can suppress all those symptoms whatever they are they're all symptoms you could suppress them with a pill or pills and then what\nYou're ... you're going to have a sick shorter sicker life\nI even if you're not feeling feeling better but you're sicker because now you're body's trying to deal with the cause of what the symptoms were from the beginning and the toxin of the pill that you put in [laughter] so that makes sense you'd even do that\nI think we had it right at ... had it right and then somewhere along the way we screwed up\nYou know we thought we were smarter than the bodies intelligence we're not ... I'm not your not know what is your doctor is not the body the only person that knows\nLike you know whether you need to have your fever raised or lowered\nOh I Know you want it lowered rate but\nTruly the intelligence that put the fever there is the only one that can take it away because it knows whether it needs to go up or down no one else that I don't nobody does that make sense so if we actually have symptoms we know that our bodies doing something\nTo cure itself to help itself we can suppress those or we can actually do something different we can actually\nSupport our body and do things that will help us and I won't get the second the other thing that people do when they're sick is they take antibiotics right antibiotics well we already talked about that briefly but what we know about antibiotics are designed to do what kill bacteria\nGood actor a bad one both fright\nWill listen to this [noise] the journal the American Medical Association\nPrinted article antibiotics they've done several of them but I just want to focus on this one\nWho's back in Nineteen Ninety seven I said first of all most colds and bronchitis and upper respiratory infections are viral infections not bacterial their viral infections so\nSeventy percent of antibiotics are currently being given for viral infections\nOnly thirty percent of antibiotics are given for bacterial infections Seventy percent are given for viral which they aren't even designed to do anything for right\nThe agency for health care policy says in fact there's many studies that say this in fact there are studies now that say don't give antibiotics for ear infections for example\nIs what the same effect\nIn fact the agency for health care policy found out that\nIf you had a group of sick people\nAnd they're all diagnosis same condition they're all have a cold right and you gave half of them antibiotics and the other half not yes what happened the happy didn't give antibiotics too\nWith fewer complications and less hospitalizations\nAnd every time that's happened\nThe placebo pushed formed\nAt least equal to and in some studies better than the antibiotic it and we have eighty to Ninety thousand people per year that die from the side effects of antibiotics\nMany of them are children\nSeventy percent of those according to the American Hospital Association Seventy percent of those had viral infections never should have had an antibiotic\nSad that those people didn't know they weren't informed like you are getting in form now so you can make the right decision the second thing is you don't go to the hospital you're sick you don't go to the hospital I guess we're all the ... the bugs in the infections that aren't treatable with antibiotics are in the hospital\nIn fact to point two million people get an infection in the hospital they didn't have before they got there\nAnd a hundred and seven thousand die from that\nOver a hundred thousand people per year die from an infection that they got in the hospital they didn't have when they went in\nNot a place to be with a lower immune function right so what should you do well first of all you should do all those seven keys we talked about remember\nDo those as perfect as possible now the good thing is that when we look at those seventies we don't have to be perfect\nWe didn't even have to be perfect on those to remain healthy\nNow the more that we break down on them the more unhealthy we get and the more apt to get sick so that makes sense but if we're already sick what we're going to want to do is do those things perfectly as possible so to get health into our body\nAnd helpless to get better faster\nYou've done all seven of those things in an art doing them then\nThere's a few other things one is get checked by a chiropractor\nGet yourself adjusted it's the single most powerful thing that I have found that I Know of\nTo boost the immune function\n... and there's a lot of powerful things you can do for your immune system but getting adjusted is the most powerful thing\nThey've found someone who was regularly checked by chiropractor for five years or longer they have a two hundred to four hundred percent greater immune response to someone who doesn't\nIsn't ... I mean so\nAbove all you'd want to get your spine nurses some checked\nWhether you're sick or not right first of all to prevent it we already talked about that but even if you're already sick to boost your immune function and then\nNever underestimate the power\nOf the adjustment it's not the adjustment that has the power though I should correct that it's your body that already has the power to not only be alive but the power to heal itself to repair itself to regenerate itself\nYour body has its own power to heal chiropractic literally all it does is take the interference away from that power so that can express itself fully\nIsn't that incredible the second key to getting\nOver sickness fast is\nEats them soup [laughter] he didn't expect that when did you\nKnow it's true you know your grandmother your mother all those people they were right eat soup the University of Nebraska actually did a study and they said yes it's true soup stimulates the immune system increases white blood cells\nAnd it's not the chicken you always think of his chick eat some chicken soup it's not the chicken the chicken doesn't do it\nIt's the cayenne pepper the\nThe leaks the garlic all those things are anti bacterial the anti viral your body actually takes those nutrients in and utilize them for the good of your immune system and it knows exactly how to use them where to put it right at the right time\nSo soup the third key is\nYou say wait a minute now you're getting out there I don't even I'm not even following this yeah love love of people plant pets and it's a fact that a lot of study to show even people who have plants they have pets they get sick less off\nBecause there's more loving the house and then of love and the house right we want love enough but the more love you have\nThe more live I mean love conquers everything you reap what you're so\nWe have seized the plant we have seeds of love we have seeds of lots of different things right and the more we plant of that the more we'll get back so life and death listen the Bible says life and death or the power the Tom and I believe that with all my heart\nLife and death or on the part of the time what we can assess what comes out of our mouth has a lot to do with what our circumstances are I hear so many people talking about well you know I guess I'm getting sick well I guess you are [noise] you know\nIf you're confessing that you are going to be more apt to get it\nBelieve me I you know some people are shaking their head\nFind try it go ahead start confessing negative things and watch how positive your life is [laughter] [noise] confessed positive things and you'll see\nIt's amazing in fact I ... up to assure a study with you that happened this is the truth they did it in several different places they went into a company and picked out a person at random who is healthy\nAnd they had a few people during the day designed to go up to them and say you know you're looking kind of sick today you feeling well you don't look like you're feeling the well and they actually had people go up to that person guess what happened in every time they did that they went home sick\nBy the end of the day that person went home sick\nIt's amazing what happens when you start thinking and believing in confessing things life and death or in the part of the time so we have to really be careful not to confess sickness to confess feeling\nOver ourselves and over others don't ever go up to somebody and say you're looking sick don't say that\nKnow if they're looking sick then give them something healthy you know start confessing health over them are given them give them some super I give them some you know honey some lemon you know some other things helped them to get better don't confess over them that they're sick because that makes us I mean that's really important\nOut of all that you can see though it can happen even more significant impact\nPost traumatic stress disorder camper
