All right\nWe have a lot going on or otherwise\nSpeaking of that kind of going against the grain I'm probably you haven't heard of this group it's called the Dewey Square group do we square historic square\nAnd it's primarily Democrat consulting uh gurus who have their hands and every politicians pocket\nAnd if you want things to get done in the state you go to someone like uh the the do you square group very very strong Democrat a consulting firm well\nThey've been raising eyebrows because they're representing the opposite of what many Democrats are going to do or not the nurse ratio question number one they have made over a million dollars\nIn fees you know representing hospitals and representing others who oppose question one and this is a real big\nDemocrat a consulting group so this is raising eyebrows kind of like hypocrisy right even though almost every major Democrat politician and the state has endorsed\nThis controversial measure on question one this group that normally\nYou know who who wouldn't want to dress as Diana Ross somebody you know who is loved and it mired\nAnd you know putting on makeup to dark and your skin and then the wig and you know the shiny glittering dress and all that right Megan Kelly said there's nothing wrong with that\nWell ... the whole world of political can uh correctness came down on her and for that conversation for that one moment\nHer show is on my very thin ice and they're saying now that she's gone from the today show probably in December because of this\nI think that when people say comments like that they don't understand how it's racist they don't they don't understand the history behind blackface where a character actor is or what paint their faces black to portray very you know discrimination of\nHow do I put this they were trying to portray these African American characters and not the best light and\nThat's the connotation how has that negative drive towards it so I think when people say oh why is that race if they don't understand the history behind it that way\nAnd as far as like Halloween costumes it's a little different between painting your face green to look like you know the which from within five to painting your face black to look like Diana Ross there's a difference and I think that's why we went to educate yourself that then you do understand the difference\nSo today in today's society in today's culture that's exactly what's happening and uh the word is you know just don't do it because you will be criticized or if you're a professional you probably will be fired\nBecause of your thoughts and so I think we should have a question of based around this for our audience to answer and um I think the question for tomorrow should be um is it ever okay\nFor a person of one race\n\nTo dress up as another for Halloween [noise] how's that for our question for tomorrow\nFor the class I Am a\n... again it tastefully done nothing wrong with it so the reason\nI'm I'm freezing up this way is because I haven't seen a lot of a sudden my news feed about don't let your kids dress up as um what's her name from the Disney movie\n... yes see I don't let your kids dress up as ... most of the lawyer unless you're a Polynesian does you're right\nYou're going if a kid wanting to dress up as my favorite character I'm not seeing race\nI'm not seeing you know any dividing lines there I'm just seeing a powerful young girl who sets out on a big adventure and she's a hero of the day I'm not\nSeen rate so what is the problem with letting my kids my my cousins or anyone who might want to dress up as a powerful character again tastefully so you're not gonna put blackface on a kids don't do that but if they get the daycare waking the Hawaiian skirt I don't see anything wrong with that\nTo the kid isn't seeing race a kid is just seeing a powerful female heroine and a movie\nThat's really the kids are innocent and they're just\nYou know they're just saying that the song and dance and uh\nUh You're welcome I could probably recite all these things like they're not seeing anything negative of it so don't make it negative\nRight [noise] so what do you think folks Bible eight

one of them right now it's it's fear instilled\nI I feel Chris I feel the guys because they look like little ring he didn't bombs they don't look like I mean I'm sure maybe if they did go off they may be take your fingers awful mania face or something like I mean that's serious but\nThey haven't gone off to have a going on they haven't\nGone off and they you know they're going to check everything inside out they're going to find out what every piece comes from they're going to check the DNA of the lick the stamp\nOr whatever on and on and on ... I mean it's it is a scary time in the world right now\n[noise] no it's very scary it's very scary because can you imagine working one of these officers you know\nYes and then trying to and I wanted to say ... if you ever get a chance I don't want to feel ... I'm ... and Brinkley I met him he was I I think I mentioned it before he was struck by lightning\nFlat line in the morgue Nineteen Seventy five and he went to the other side all the things that the he said they showed him on the other side of ... of coming to pass especially with the people coming in from the Central America\nYou got to read get get a chance to read that book Chris\nHis book is a everything he's saying is coming to play it's ... it's it's not hocus pocus Chris if it was you would see it was a phony just go right on the Internet downloaded a um you know his website Damien Brinkley and you will see the uh self\nDutch great stuff I appreciate that thanks\nYes and I won't see any more I don't want to hold up all\nThe way that that are calling them look I have a great day thank you so much for the call that's interesting isn't it [noise] well the only makes a living is some good points right what what is this about why is this going on\nOf course it is to scare people what's the motivational in what direction we or is this person or persons trying to move public opinion are they trying to\nVisit someone who supports the president and his angry that the things these people have said right or the you know Maxine Waters with her threats of violence against people is it someone saying to her\nWell you know you want Republicans to than conservatives to live in fear well you should live in fear that's of course the wrong thing to do\nBut to arrange people do the wrong thing or you know is it is it people who say we're not going to live in a civil society until we get our way which is what Hillary Clinton said is it someone who took that were so offended by it that they decided they were terrified them as well\nOr is it someone or ... or people who say well we're going to make the president look bad because all these people are people he's had said bad things about race CNN fake news\nEnemy of the people all those things that the president has said\nIs someone who says well I Want to make the president look bad so I'm going to do these fake bombs are bombs or don't go off anyway\nTo scare those people or to make those people are saying that the president is doing the president's supporters doing it I don't know we're going to find out what's going back to the phones thanks for holier lived to be some\nYes uh you know where does it end when I grew up when I was growing up you learn to play a game and win and lose and be proud of and if you're lost and you move on ... and uh you know\nAnd the thing is is that I'm Glad in this country that we have an ambulance we have a fire we have a place we have hospitals that don't judge they take care of you no matter what are we going to ask a person is a Democrat or Republican before we stop the bleeding no\nI think we did a lot of people need to think more about what the heck they're doing this is getting to a point where it's like I like kids like children\nDangerous children\nYes and then it's not good I mean we ... we have to pull together you know this teachers that probably amongst Tyson\nBy among families and and and associations and every they look at a baseball teams on the patriots I'm this I'm I'm the best Boston Red Sox hey what do you do on the show Bush but you know what at the end of the year they take in swat Bob so either mixed your all time anyone want us flop and be a Democrat\nOr Republican next year\nYou know this thing about Democrat Republican ... sometimes it's good that Republicans were a few years and then when the Vatican's tend to go too far the other way then we go towards the Democrats pulled us back the other way I mean it's a balance mhm balance\nNo you're right ... windows you know whoever's doing this doing this for a reason I mean it's very clear that they have a they have a motive here whether it's to conceal their real thoughts or or or to conduct you know the the real person I don't know at this point but you're right it and it's getting it's getting horrible\nYou know the sad thing is you know the sad thing is when someone\nAbout a dollar bill in your hand people do things they shouldn't be doing\nYeah yeah no\nAbsolutely no no that's that's a good point I called my friend thank you very much um\n\n[noise] it reminds me in some ways that you've heard me say here before\nI started getting concerned about this even before a represents ... a skull east was shot the conservative Republican from Louisiana who was shot 'em\nThat we're starting to look like the late sixties in the seventies in this country I think it was Ninety Seventy one a bomb went off every day in this country a political bomb they were bombing police stations they bombed the Pentagon I though the weather underground you know a lot most of the people are out of out of prison\nNor around burning door professor\nShe ... a very short sentence in jail bill airs he's out in about\nThey did bombings all over the country political bombings in an effort to stop a Vietnam\nListen I mean obviously she can't because whenever she sat offend enough people that shouldn't have a show any more so yeah yeah the first amendment right but if you if you

once I guess up as a black ... not that I can criticize all we did\nI ruin streaming up the wrong way right Chris I mean I don't know you know what the hell are we going to think about it but you know you're ready to say this woman needs to go\nNo I'm saying she's gone I'm not I'm I'm saying ... that's what happened\nYeah and and but you know go with it and and that's what brought us we could if you are okay with it and and I'm like\nWell I don't know when when the when you're on the line Chris because you know what I'm ... I'm a white man and we're going extinct\nLight away Chris when we're gone who's going to blame that that's what I Want to know because you know they're going to land on the white man for a long time for a while we're All right Chris because we're going\nBecause we know reproduce like everybody else because we're wrong about it and we pay for our children whereas everybody out her reproduce\nLike
