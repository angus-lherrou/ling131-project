once part of the Y. which is you go down to the Republican congressman on the border in Texas and Arizona the Republicans representing the border areas they're against the wall\nOf course because\nTheir land owners don't want the wall\nIt decreases the value of their land to have this gigantic federal structure going right through their land they don't want it so these congressman or against it you cannot get two hundred and Eighteen Republican Congress and ask twenty five million for the wall they've had two years to do it\nI Hope your listeners know not one dollar has been voted

point in his shoe the important issue\nNow is what's happening south of the board it's gonna affect all of our life if we don't get this right 'cause once if this is going to be the president if you don't make and if you don't make a presence of what you're going to do right or wrong it's going to set the presence of what's going to happen after this so a day before yesterday ... their interviewer one woman\nWho was coming up a woman and also a guy\nShe just give them the clinic she ... she has\nThe flu but she's much and on and say to myself this is just the flu now spread route for all those people now she's sick how many more people are sick how many more people have diseases you think Chris it they're going to come with the fascination chart seeing all the vaccination is that they received with their doctor records\nNo ... no comfort to rule countries\nThis is not just an economical crisis this is a health crisis\nPeople don't realize this is a health crisis we're forms that he'd be in the world that there's no one not ... it's not working because just like every disease it mutates so we have pots and it was getting hotter and hotter to eradicate certain diseases\nReason why we don't see it as much in this country because we separated through through two big bodies of oceans\nMhm so we have to look at this cycle ... just commonsense wise and that's why I said to you and and and I hope the military does is they they should be just protecting themselves physically they've got to be protecting the cells biologically through masks through rubber gloves and everything else\nThrough suits because they bring it home to their families they go to their communities boom it spreads like it what is it it could be just the flu Chris or it could be something worse\nYeah I can tell you that when I was deployed my army you're done to Panama they gave us a whole host of shots I was so sick\nNot two days from from from them because you know most of it's just a little speck of the disease\nI got I got I got another gun in the shoulder you know the a gun and shot and I got this giant needle I'm like I understand I was given the the vaccination for the bubonic plague which means the black death comes back I get to play all your stuff that you guys are all gone and I'm Still here\nBut that was going to Central America look one of the great part of our immigration system way back when an Ellis Island was that everyone got a and knocking\nOn the parents that guy always miss the worst thing a vaccination elation occupation of vaccinations inoculations from things that they may have had a ... you know because they weren't coming from we didn't have access to the kind of a medicine that we have here none of those one of the great things that happened and Alice island eradicated most\nDiseases like polio and tuberculosis things like that but that they there are some symptoms coming back\nMy family when they came here in in the sixties my mom and my dad God rest his soul they had guys in both their arms because because inoculations that they receive before they had\nEntered this country they ask us both on their arms of the actual inoculation yeah because they got that many needles they they got that many needles now the\nOther misrepresentation that was said it wasn't misrepresentation I disagreed with the morning so brought up a story how are Democrats are getting very angry with the left wing of the party they figure by eight percent is making all of them look bad\nNow my question to fill in everybody else's has it been ups up ranking official former president speaker of the house has she come out publicly like Trump that came out yesterday ... statement condemning antifa condemning black lives matters condemning all these organizations that cause riots\nIn in in all kinds of chaos in the country have you heard of any of them Chris step up publicly condemn those associations yes or no\nNo I I I haven't and take a call at all yeah no\nIt's not even local officials so until then they are part of a hate group\nThanks for the call 'em and so one of the things you used it I I I think generally most most activists Democrats probably aren't really excited about the stuff that's going on with the screaming and yelling in restaurants and things like that I think most of them recognized that that's not a good thing I think we have we've had guests on here ... for instance\nWho doesn't to see see any\nAny reason to do that first of all the you know it's very and it's counterproductive um\nI Can't imagine John Mitchell supports that type of behavior or bill Keating supports okay I just generally think they do they don't [noise] um there may be some that do but um I think most people who are in politics realized that that's not a smart move um\nEven if they think it's I think you can think think things are justified for instance they're probably a lot of people who think it's really justified to yell at Mitch McConnell in public because of what he did way back when to Merrick Garland\nBut it also meat but a lot of most of those people who might think it's okay or justified [noise] see it's not a good political strategy right to take a very quick break but\n\nWe're gonna take a very quick break here on the Christmas ... show and we'll be right back to play because\nThen\nWhy do you every time

to the phones good morning thanks rolling\n[noise] I agree with that Sam you're on a piece of go hey Sam what's going on let me get off the air thank you thank you\nUm yeah a couple of things I don't really uh by too much in that whole\nVersus Fonda thing we've had by attracts as kids and we had kids and you know you could buy the thing with a stethoscope and my granddaughter has one of those kids and I can remember my daughter's having one of those kids START I think that's just another you know something to be but yeah I Would want to be for the future\nSo I you know I don't I don't find it really out of the ordinary\nYeah I didn't and it may be may be something about that particular do all that there was there's different anything she'd seen before the ... maybe ... ... we're not getting but yeah it seemed to me to be pretty standard although I hadn't heard the term first response of adult but I haven't been in in the business of shopping for dolls in forty years\nYeah I Wonder whether they just kind of making a generic term for Christmas not is because there's so many emails that are ambulance drivers and paramedics and and all that where years ago and I was kidding but it was\nMale dominated type a field right but anyway the uh what do you want to think about the possibility that these so far they bombs you know thank God nothing's going on but I think it could be just a ploy to get the attention away from the marching people coming from the south\nYou could be part of that whole big plan was\nBecause we're putting so much attention on that that was in the news every single day and now it's kind of this is kind of taking the front lines of that news\nYeah look I I think Sam anything's possible did did whoever's doing this ... has has motivations that that that will that none of us the most of us don't have right because that's the bombs up so sure it could be that I think I think one will be interesting is when they figure out because there is so much evidence here one of the\nYou know one of the U.S is again one of these experts and they were saying well when when the bomb goes off most of the stuff is naturally destroyed most of the evidence it takes a long time to piece it back together do this stuff is intact and so it makes it easier to be able to track down certain things will be interesting is when and if they catch this person or persons when they\nWhen they\nAre able to figure out when they purchased stuffed with everything was purchasing the last\nCouple of days and sent to put together and sent right out there yeah I could have to do with a camera in this stuff has been sitting around for a couple of weeks or a couple of months maybe maybe have nothing to do with us\nRight I think that it was it because they are the news that said I forget what the actual item was but it was multiple things that were bought out bought but go multiple things that with the same like you said and I think if if it's the average person that's not well educated on trying to cover his tracks or her cracked the things that\nWe're going to know whether it's professionally done even though it's intentionally not working or not going off um and that that kind of makes me think that it's out of the big picture that they're trying to just get outlines of that um those people traveling up from the south\nYou know and and so I'm just thinking that so if if we find that it's not really easily traceable I think there's a lot of thought going into it than the average guy that's doesn't know how to make something work properly you know\nSeem I I think you're a hundred percent right and listen again again I don't I'm not that knowledge lump bonds I Know a little bit about investigations but it was a listener these experts and again you always wonder how much of an expert on it you know right but the person was saying that since they were\nGo off ... again assuming they intentionally not going off right so that that that that that person is left behind a lot of\nInformation a lot of evidence now if they determine that they can't do that stuff is scrubbed whether that's because the serial numbers removed or ... you know these type of things then yeah there's a lot more planning that's gone into this because of that because they have so much evidence but if it turns out to not be valuable evidence then they'll be playing it\nYeah I agree [noise] All right my friend that just called to I'm going to want to take a very quick break and then we'll we'll be right back here on fourteen twenty WBFO
