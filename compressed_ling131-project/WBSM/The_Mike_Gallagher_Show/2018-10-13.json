I was lying about his lousy batting average when he was in fact one of the best it isn't baseball and he had to sit there on hold and listen to me um he he stopped me from hitting the Yankees that guy for a time\nYeah no I was and he was he was outstanding and you know he had players but all those players were homegrown for the most part a lot of homegrown players are yeah they sign some free agency or the fill holes but the core the cores that like to call them or\nThey would a terrific bunch you can't argue with it they want a lotta titles and ah they were good\nRemember what does he said that I think I thought was really remarkable for a Yankees manager when it you know you know ... you said this might get me in a lot of trouble but nowhere with a lot of these Yankees teams be without the red Sox pushing them all these years and you know the red Sox were the second best team in baseball a number of years and never get out of that division\nThat sounds like I'm calling to show in Massachusetts I should say something nice is that when they think if you call foot there's ... there's some truth in that though I yeah I Would say you're probably right I mean it real a lot of teams pushing the Yankees over the years Baltimore had to push the Yankees true though when Baltimore\nWas go to the Yankees weren't necessarily great that is right or you know you had a a gym or the pitcher for the Orioles Jim Palmer ... that that ... of Palmer\nThey were good you know the Orioles were good for they had some down years then they get they were good again and they weren't bad or you know in the middle of this decade and went bad and Thirteen fourteen Fifteen a contenders\nAn awful this year there were just minor league baseball this year in a ... and had the year where he had a lot of protein powder and had fifty home runs and help that team [laughter] [laughter] but um so they they asked it now I was told\nThe\nThe the um Milwaukee Brewers absolutely have to win\nBoth of these home games if they have any chance to win the series because they should not be expected to win any of the three in Los Angeles do believe that\nI think the brewers have I'm ... I ... if the Bruins when today it got a shot\nThey've got to win both home games when I ...\nI think so they've got to win both um you know they they've got an excellent bullpen but you wonder how it's going to walk in games five and six if they keep using them\nYou know you get a lot of stretcher they pull them after two winnings ... or ... or two thirds or whatever it was some incredible you know he he allowed one run and they pull the guy\nHad the dirt roads pulling really quickly this year\nAnd and uh so I get the bullpen guys in and you know they would work was great hit a home run the whole thing he was a great cuts right to winnings\nYeah and then they had a a they're a big guy hater for three and then they struggled through the last two gave up for runs but he hung on for the win a they got to do it again somehow\nHave the Dodgers pushed them toward the end it should it it's a I mean if they're going to measure the wisdom says the American league wins the the whole thing but you never know\nYou never know you again if they keep using the open like this uh these guys may be hanging a little bit against five or six you know yeah but uh we'll just have to see [noise]\nSo ... so the red Sox play tonight at eight fifty what time do they play on Sunday hopefully that doesn't get in a way of the ... the Patriot oh can I don't want us to get the way the Patriot already\nHad this discussion today you did tomorrow they start at seven PM\nAh [noise] I mean new batteries these new Comcast lighted\nRemote site I go into double A. batteries faster than a [laughter] goodness [laughter] come on I got to get by rechargeable is it's all so layers\nBut you know so that they'll get a they'll get through a good three innings before the kickoff then you've got a problem kickoffs at age twenty or thirty whatever it is these days Sunday night\nIt doesn't seem right\nNo it doesn't seem right at all well and I understand they gotta get they have to get the um Sunday Sunday Night Football Sunday Night Football and the patriots were scheduled long time ago nobody knew the red Sox for sure we're going to make the playoffs and of course you have to make sure the west coast can watch these games or it's convenient for them as well you get a hundred million over there so I get it\nAnyway it's going to be a busy weekend for sports and the unknown and we have a great local a rivalry a UMass start with is going up to Bridgewater state for the homecoming game today yeah yeah but the ... the man ... Jean Louis ... kid Jimmy\nWhoa whoa that kids good mhm Houston Texans flown down a last\nYear as junior to take a look at them and the patriots had a scout there to look at them last week or ... I'm Sorry two weeks ago I think he's got over a thousand yards already receiving isn't about seven touchdown playing division three that's well they overlooked it was a look\nI Know that sometimes that happens sure sometimes kids don't blossom 'til they get a little older\nWe'll give Jerry Rice yeah played division to ball I mean the lousy\nBall I mean and and and Joe ... I don't care where he played I can I can see what he is\nA bill last nacho offshore last push Qatar [laughter] for the eagles but anyway um it should be a um very entertaining weekend and I bet we don't forget this weekend because\nIs there's just this this Kansas City team yeah I Know Bela tricks at ten days but this is a track team and the patriots have looked to slow this year um be interesting to see if they can slow this kid down because mom's is making it look easy\nHe's got a lot of weapons will scares me is good you know it's not just homes this a lot of weapons from the tight end running backs guides you can catch the ball ... Turner's these they got it all\nI Know it's not allowed but I think we've got another scandal coming\nScandal tranquilizer gate [laughter] we have to get a little dart into tier Rick Hill and just ... I mean he does like a a a ... point one forty ... this guy is the fastest guy in the NFL they say he they loaded they loaded on often but Kareem Hunt eight us up last time\nBut Ken but they've got injuries on defense well that yeah the lousy on defense this could be attract me and you know when it comes down to track meets like this Tom Brady clock management\nAnd having played in big moments these things count\nThe other thing is they rarely lose at home although\nKansas City has to see embarrassed us a on national TV over the last three or four years and really pounded us\nIt's right so it's not an easy game with Kansas City but uh yeah I think it's going to be attract me he'll be fun to watch take the over a [laughter]\nTake the ... I was ... you know the thing is you don't know uh because if if the patriots in Belgium does have moms figured out and they say it's a matter of time before the video in the films these guys start figuring homes or if they if they rattled him early a couple of picks surely those can be a blow out\nToo I mean I don't know what to expect a scary thing could happen here\nBut it's almost like as big as this game is nobody cares because the Sox were in the American league championships\nBut nationally people love the opportunity to see the patriots take one on the chin true yeah so at that there'll be a big Sunday night audience football nationally nationally\n[noise] I don't know where I'm going just picking me up and a stretch limo [laughter] well that's not exactly true\n[laughter] we're not I won't do that but\nWe certainly will talk about uh the mayor of foreign fishing Nineteen counts or I thought he probably should have shown a bit more reference to what he's basing than to making a joke out of it or to downplay it um [noise] you know if I were advising him I Would say you know take this seriously show that the ... you know show your\nYour supporters that uh you know these are serious things but you know you can understand how the FBI could see it this way but you're going to have you done in court I wouldn't make jokes of it I think that it was really really in poor taste\nWell I I Would say that he's got some top flight legal talent go Kevin readings yeah\nCan't give out they can get much better in in a in the country actually\nAt least regionally yeah but ah he's doing high profile cases for a long long I Would have called the heavy hitter you would have\nTo to to [laughter] no I wouldn't have I Would I Would call Kevin reading to do it I I Love his ads that's all All right we're to which they got the or the ... show started here this though this goes out to a gym Phillips I'm sure you heard of us they were going to put this back over\n\nThat if he's found you gotta go mess them up something like that something to that to that effect that was a few weeks back when they first started saying I'm not necessarily a Democrat and everybody gas I think a few people on CNN fainted\n\nThey're broken glass all over the country that kinda thing and this guy does not to think like them how dare he he's a black American he's gotta he's gotta think like a progressive that's that is my problem with the Democratic party at what this is they feel entitled to the African American vote\nAnd the more they see\nAfrican American polls showing that Donald Trump is gaining favor with him he's up to I think he was up to thirty six percent the more you see accusations I'm Don Lemon on CNN just outwardly sayings of racist Donald Trump's a racist window looking he's a he's a racist\n\nI remember he was pro Nazi right anti anti do try to make the argument they use a anti Semitic\n\nThe father of a daughter who converted to Judaism\nMan who is the first president\nTo give the very pro Israel position that the U.S embassy should be in Jerusalem\nNetanyahu said they've never had a bit our ally than Donald Trump\nSo they they had to drop the Nazi thing and now they're saying he's racist I don't know what they're basing that on\n\nYou know I've seen this before in the um [noise] the Tea Party rallies before the American CARE Act was passed\nI forget his name but there was a a black congressional number from the Democratic party who said he was bit on\nThe video showed an old man yelling and the idiot um\nSome ... some spittle came out and hit the congressmen and and that did happen but it was you could just see it was clearly a moron uk thing where you just couldn't control his mouth but anyway um and they took the ball around with that there was a racist guy spitting on 'em [noise]\nUh it wasn't even looking at him just yelling at the whole congressional delegation that walked by that chose not to use the talent but to\nGetting their faces in spite the football like Nancy Pelosi what the gavel um\nBecause Donald Trump said they were also people in Charlottesville who weren't racist a part of the KKK but just one of the historic value that statue to be recognized and for crowds not to tear it down a lot of there's a process\nThis should be decided by government not mobs and he may have been right I I don't know anybody specifically but he he set it and he said it in a very\nIn a way that was very easy to put it in the context that you want it to and if you wanted to call him a racist there there was opportunity somehow I saw it but I could see how people would want to take advantage thanks for calling you're on the air\nHey Ken how are you today it's money ... ... you know I'm\nA ... then this whole thing um it's got a few points uh I like them to discuss with you want to\nKnow I've been listening to them now for a while because when you first come out and said that he was a more conservative and like Trump obviously there was a lot of blowback on that for for him personally but his message\nActually if you really just listening to the thirty thousand but you you really just saying look I'm a free man to speak in a free away and this is I'm exercising my Second Amendment right to speak\nThe way and first met me in a cave Meyerson is\nHow's it going swimming around I think he was using his speech\nRight it's not necessarily exactly what he's saying at the moment he saying it but usually punctuated with you know if you really are free person\nOr you you can you I'm doing and they and what he's pointing out of al ... a left which is coming back and say oh you can't say that you're Maxine Waters saying uh you're you're at AT Kearney your you know get back in line you know step in fact\nI'm ... you know the fact that uh this last deal with him in\nThe White House how many hardcore left people came out and and and and media Don Lemon and it sounded like old white man [laughter] whole white minutes from the south race it you know what the deal and what you say what I mean\nI Know it was terrible moment to John Lennon was terrible it was a terrible moments of Don Lemon but I have to say it is consistent with the Democratic party when an African American steps forward and tries to become\nA leader for the black community as a conservative there instantly demonized and I can go back to Dr Alan Keyes I can go to um [noise] a JAG watches that there's a number of black conservatives who are demonized and for having the audacity not to think progressive\nDestroyed yeah I I I you know and I think the fact that um\nYou know there are also now mentally illness shaming if you want to call that versus you know like fat shaming or I mean they're calling you hear these people that are not doctors they can't diagnose anything that are saying he's ... he's mentally ill\nYou all the same time it was really a synchronized you know it it they do ... they coordinate these things\nRight well I Hope that people have big eyes now see that's one thing I really have a hand I I I like about social media is that um you really can get enough\nA actual snippets to put your put the story together without having a sheltered or or distorted or but that's even changing now because Google and Facebook they're all going to censor so you're you're you're going to get a different view that's going to ... story so it it's um\nAnyway I I I like what he said I like ... what he says ... thirty thousand but you I don't necessarily agree with everything he says but he's a black man that can say you know say what he wants to say whether he was black or Chinese or whatever yeah so I think that's great\n[noise] yeah because he's black he's getting considerable grief ... if um boy I don't know if if a Tom Selleck or a trying to think of a an equivalent some music star maybe um would be a better example but I don't think did\nA tend 'em guitar player\nRight new ... New Jersey\nIt went in there and said something like that I don't think anybody bats and I\nWrite I mean there is expected ... ... it's okay to be a right wing white people because we already hate them but for a pop culture success guy that has a lot of sway with young African Americans or at least up till one point did\nUh we got to we've got to dump them we're going to get rid of them we got this is not good and he needs to just be ignored he's crazy\nRight that is you know these are the overseer of the Democratic party meeting him down for having the audacity to step out and not think like them\nWell you know and he got Maxine Waters who is now going to be on the Senate Finance committee which is a scary thing because I think she is a is a is the loose grew I mean I'm In a lot of ways and I think she's mentally ill but she's a ... you know\nI don't think she's mentally I just don't think she's ever really tried her best to study the issue is I don't I think she is intellectually lazy and I don't think she is it at all qualified to be the house finance chairwoman and she's going to be if the Democrats take the house\nRight and you can imagine the consternation is gonna be going on in those meetings for going forward or because you know it's it's safe and you have a leader that day and you know like Grassley they try to control the process and keep that on track I I can imagine that she's actually anything on track but\nAnyway Ken was good to good to speak with you in a long time listeners gotta versus\nI appreciate the endpoint I really do thanks for listening you that you know and the other thing too is the investigations to see if the deep state was framing President Trump when he was a candidate\n\nAll those investigations come to a screeching halt Democrats shut it all down\n\nAnd Chuck Schumer I don't think the Democrats are going to take the Senate back but if they do Chuck Schumer would then be the majority is the Senate majority leader and the agenda completely changes\n\nIt looks better now than it did thirty days ago for the Republicans I think the house should be expected\nAs probably like a fifty eight percent chance the Democrats will take the house of representatives back I think that the Senate I Would say it's sixty five percent or so likely that the Republicans retained the Senate and\n\nYou could tell by the silence the instant silence of the left that they they did their own internal polling and they're trying to temper\nTheir behavior since the Kavanaugh thing because the Republicans closed the gap tremendously as I said there was a slumber ring Republican base there really wasn't planning on showing up for much on election day and that may have now changed\n\nAnd the more intense the radical left yeah it's I think the the the the more you're waking up the Republican base and so it puts it into question at least\n\nAnd I kept my head straight last outlook in Ottawa structural damage I was doing and the damage to myself\nWas like whoa\nNachos contribute to my\nTo my community to let an awakening we need more of that\nPeople do resource on my Facebook page that is what I Believe my readers ...

Dr Ford there's something wrong with you your inherently evil [noise]\nUm I did believe her initially until I learned that she purged herself you know with her anecdotal about the necessary second door which was a complete lie at the door was on years before she said it went on and it was to rent out to businesses on her home\nUm and if she lied about that though the one thing you do in court is your break down the credibility of the opposition so right now\nYou know ... how can how could Brett Kavanaugh defend what he was accused them we were you there that night was I where I don't know and so the question were you there on that night I don't know which night I don't know answer the question I mean it's it's it's unbelievable how much leverage they want to give to this account\nWell a woman that made that statement about you got to believe Dr port living in the wrong yeah it'd be living in on it is that when we had a person just based on a witness or claims without any evidence of which\nI guess you weren't killed you know you you might end up in the in this in this this decay there where they have they leave you out in the ... the town square so people can throw things that

the I think the Senate panels took advantage of the fact that you don't need a proof you just need to be able to say I find\nEnough wrong where I can say no I don't want them on the court and ended up you know if we're all being honest I think they understood to hit a very terrible um\nAccount not the woman's testimony but the account of what happened to know when did nowhere to know much about anything after that Brett Kavanaugh didn't she knew she had one beer\nWalker [noise] my\n[noise] you don't know how you got home but you remember they had one beer you don't know how you got there but you had one beer so she can't remember the name before or after equally you know I I can dismiss the\nBecause you know sometimes when people get in a car accidents they don't remember anything leading up to the character you body just doesn't do it shuts down some people can handle I also I also know rape victims who can tell you everything that happened years later every single detail\nI'm so certain people react differently and and I'll give her you know the benefit of the doubt that she was so frail or a human that she just shut down and she was not rape that she was heavily groped and felt that she was going to be killed or rape but she was not raped and\nTo me ... another thing as an investigator I'm looking at how serious of rape attempt was is that his friend jumped on him knocked off a Kevin from her and then they started wrestling and laughing she was able to walk out of the door freely how serious a rib attempt are we talking about here\nWell the problem is you got
