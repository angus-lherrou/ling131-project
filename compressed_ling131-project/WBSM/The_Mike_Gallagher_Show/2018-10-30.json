don't you are filled with people in on this\nSo there is a woman and now she's in all of her but to put it in high school she was the coach field hockey coach and one of her former athletes they grew up very special bond very strong friendship over the years ah\nThe midfielder was even a bridesmaid in the wedding in two thousand eleven\nAnd so recently last six months or so\nI'm a rare kidney disorder has led to kidney failure and without hesitation this former athlete went through all the testing to see if she would be a match and to help her former coach out\nTo find out a while later she was a match and she kind of kept it from our code for for a little while until she could figure out how to tell her and she wrote this nice little nap if you will like a journey a timeline\nKind of talking about her medical journey and how she's come so far and then basically breaking the news to her hey you're going to get to continue this journey because I'm going to donate give you my

what's gonna happen is is\nWhat would you like to see\nStopping stopping I I think they're going to be processed processed anyway and I think many of them are not going to end up coming to America\nAlso I think that's a little fear driven however\nI think that you know you're saying we can't solve all the problems in other countries we can't but we can we can work with other countries to try to\nI agree mitigate what's going on agreement of course in a lot of these other countries that are having\nSuch issues candidate is having problems too with with immigration\nI'm ... the number one uh violate or a or the Canadians who stay here a pass their visas well about ... let me ask you this and then I have to get onto the improbable question now so um [noise]\nWe have this a humanitarian problem I'm mad is it's one that you think is going to reflect badly on the United states either way we handle it\n[noise] I don't you know I I think depends on how we handle it certainly but you know the reflection\nOn the United states is is one thing the effects of of the people and you know that are that are trying to you know get a better life uh and flee violence or whatever is I think the the important thing\nI'm most of them are than involved yeah most of them are I'm leaving their homeland because they want better paying jobs there's no doubt I Would say the majority of people\nBut again we how can we settled that problem there'll be another wave after this group and then another one it's the exactly and so it's very unfair\nFor us to be in this position on this we follow the rule of law I'll tell you why put the blame on that Congress they haven't fixed the uh you you said you said it's very complex it is and they haven't solved anything so [noise]\nI invite

of this war and I I hear people say\nI Do hear fear and stuff in people's but I think they forget that we all come from I think a lot of us come from places where there was there were a lot of problems and we're seeking better lives and I and I don't think these people are are the enemy I think that it's it's a terrible problem\nNo there's no enemy here is just a you know we have to follow

neighbors\nI think we have to tell their employers you\nKnow who these people are if if they show signs\nOf of being a white supremacist this is a cancer in our society that eventually has to be wiped out but it's is it going on for so long uh and so when you get crazy people and that's what these people are crazy they're they're they're they're they're they're cool\nAnd uh they have to be exposed to when they get on the ... the social media stuff and they start expressing this type of\nViolence or to toward other Americans\nAre we as an American society has to expose them I for example did not appreciate when they're at the University of Virginia walking tortures calling out the Jewish people I didn't appreciate it when they were in Charlotte you know and and they had that confrontation there\nAre these people you know a a a a\nCancer on our society and the and they should be exposed\nTo everybody and their neighborhoods to let people know exactly who they are and that's the only way we're going to begin to fight against ... going to continue\nYou know are easier said than done you'll bad apple in the barrel Siri doesn't work when you are in an area in the south let's say Tom\nWhere I've been there I've seen them may I ask you have so yes you have\n... and I and and they still exist but they have to be exposed to people who were like you just said people in the law have to understand that segment of society\nAnd where they're from you know are they still\nHave to be exposed because they still operate under the cloud and under the protections of freedom of speech\nYou know it I Know even the ACLU protects the freedom of speech sure about what\nSociety have to know exactly who they are\nAnd we asked them to notify the employers of exactly from the ... and to push back because if we don't push back it's still gonna flowers have been the connections of political actions you know and societal rhetoric is going to continue and that's not good for anybody at America and right you know you know Tom ...\nThe further you say that that's down south but they're not they're everywhere they hide that are up here but they're here I\nMean come on ... and we were just looking for the fact that it's more prolific in the southern right\nProlific but it's also maybe more hidden in the north and that's that's the other thing about it because these people are everywhere and those social media some of the things that are that are all over the place that is what connects them\nYep that connects and everywhere and they never they never ran out themselves so they kinda have to hope that maybe the neighbors will know something and the neighbors to by the way now that these people are strange in many cases that they are the even the authorities are tracking a few of them they didn't track the barrel down in Pittsburgh he wasn't on the radar screen at the other guy had a long record\nMhm right they had an idea what about you know

taught I don't think it's a mental disorder and I think\nThat's a lot and so yeah it is a ... something that ... and and it has to do it but we systems oh we have to get to understand that\nA fellow human beings to human spirit and we should recognize that in each other rather than the color of this\nAnimal and not live as long as we're being discovered in you know we didn't know who it was at

I mean I really do and and\nIt's not because I support President Trump I Would feel this way if I supported President Obama I don't think I've had occasion to express this except\n... go on a similar matter but I have had the opportunity and again I'm not quite sure was here on this radio station to express um\n\nMy concerns with people tried to exclude or humiliate President Obama\nFor political purposes you know we show that to the ... the rabbi at the synagogue is wants the president to come this mayor of Pittsburgh say he doesn't want the president of the United states to come to pay his respects to the victim of this massacre\nIn the synagogue\nI have to tell you I've never seen anything like that in my life and and just keep in mind he's the first president and the history of our country\nWho had\nHas a Jewish son in law a daughter who converted to Judaism in children grandchildren who are Jewish [noise] the first in our country he'd been honored by the state of Israel\nIt was community\nParticularly before he became president he moved the capital to\nWithdraw or our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem which by the way it was the position of the United states is just no president had the stones to do it\nEvery president that I could think of before the ... supported this verbally just didn't do anything about it so we called freebie you're I say oh I'm In support of that and we'll do it tomorrow because tomorrow never actually arrives right\nSo I I think about this for for a second ... and again I'm particularly speaking you folks that they don't like the president is that's fine you don't have to like the president\nBut he is the president I think about the way these folks who are killed are being used as a political football in their\nDeath how disrespectful that is how disgusting it is\nPeople who want to label the president an anti Semite which is beyond reason beyond reason but the president is an anti Semite right\nRight 'cause when you're warming up your muscles you're not bench pressing three hundred pounds your bench pressing maybe the bar or\nA hundred pounds depending just to get your muscles limber you know using twelve pound or ten pound dumbbells just to warm up your arms\nRight when you're using light weights\nTo warm up the ... the reason I explain it to you if you've never done it this is a little all makes sense to her in a second so when you're lifting weights and more\nYou're using light weights in little ... you know\nA more motion to get the blood flowing so President Obama\nAt the time was the sitting president he's in Poland he's in a gymnasium ... or you know like I go to the hotel gym and he's working out\nA loan and\nSomeone videotaped it guarantee it with a foreign intelligence agency and then they release the videotape of course it was edited and it made the president look weak\nIt's not a true representation of President Obama's physical strength of clear you just look at the man right but I remember Sean Hannity playing the videotaping making fun of them\nOn Fox News and I was incensed\nBecause I said why are you Sean Hannity buying in\nTo foreign propaganda to discredit the American president I mean I get that you don't like the president I didn't vote for Obama but I recognize that he's the president of the states and in and they weren't humiliating them to help America and I was really disappointed and Sean Hannity\nAnd I don't know that I've ever quite thought of Sean Hannity the same way again because I thought what a fool\n\nFor full to buy into what is clearly foreign intelligence operation to discredit the president noted states regardless of whether you voted for him and I write because the reason I say\nIt was a foreign intelligence agency which is frightening people should have lost their jobs and maybe they did we didn't hear about it at the secret service because if you can put a camera on the president at close distance\nYou can do a lot more to write the idea that the president was able to be surreptitiously filmed\nIn unflattering moment and then the fat that Sean Hannity would play it and laugh at the president because he appears a week I saw it was terrible\nI really did I quite frankly I've always thought lesser Sean Hannity because of it\n\nWhat was really I mean hey I got over I think Sean Hannity does some good work too but\nIt always thought to myself how did you see that one how did you not see that with foreign propaganda made to look may do make the United states look badly\nStrikes me when I hear people repeating that the president\n\nSomehow had something to inspire this massacre the synagogue in Pittsburgh I say to myself don't you realize\nThat you're doing the work\nOf America's enemies when you repeat that 'cause it's not true and you know it's not true and CNN he's repeatedly asking this question\nThe president refuses to to ah ah what do you know to to ah how what the heck of a say\nBasically to the president refuses to acknowledge he may have inspired the assassin right\nDegree that's what they're saying and I don't know if you're familiar with a thing called push polling you may have gotten this before so push polling is can damage by most political consulting and polling organizations\nAt least outright they condemn it on the surface secondary but what it is as you call up\nAnd one in the idea is that it's a poll and so you ask you a bunch of questions but the questions are all leading\nOkay like\nHow would it affect your what we did affect your vote if you found out a John Smith was arrested for drunk driving would it change your opinion of John Smith you found out he uh\nMurdered his wife right I'm trying to be trying to exaggerate here a little bit for the purposes but it's more subtle than that but it's not that much more subtle and the thing is they're not really interested in the results they're interesting getting in into certain people's heads manipulative people people who are easily manipulated\nThe idea that John Smith you know the rest of a drunk driving beats his wife kills puppies whatever or that President Trump\nInspired the massacre at the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nYou see but if you ask the question the right way over and over and over again\nYou're drilling into people's heads\nAnd that's what they're doing here and it's insidious\nAnd the fact that some of you are falling for\n\nWell it doesn't surprise me because you're busy right but there's a lot of people who are busiest Tom point out there's a lotta people do I don't know the connection between Donald Trump in the Jewish community and probably already had a little bit of putting their heads has been going on for years but almost three years now they've been trying to tell us Donald Trump's an anti Semite\n\nAnd this has been a long developing seem of anti American anti Donald Trump propaganda\n\nAnd the fact that the shooter himself didn't like the president because he's favorable to Israel into the into Jewish people\nIs\nIt's not even brought up and so here we are we're with\nPeople were massacred in a synagogue in Trump's political and foreign opponents are trying to divide the country along with fake fault line the claims of president as an anti Semite and is responsible for inspiring that murder\nOr tell you what would take a

I guess right except the ...\nI just wanted to put a different spin on it the election you know I I remember the board of elections and this year she got early voting yes\nSo I was asked to come into town hall I've got it twice now one last week once this week for three or four hours and I thought boy this is going to be really boring you know I'll tell you what I'm like amazed at how many people are taking advantage of early vote really\nI'm telling you I went in there yesterday and it was a stream of people\nAny other way they're going huh any sense of what they're doing what they're thinking\nNo fear because they get the ballot there and they give it to me and I feel that they go oh\nI'm sure to be at how many people and there's you know we found a little different I think you're better because it's tax\nTime in Freetown people walk them to pay their taxes but then they look and they go with this and it's like early voting and like oh we can vote now and I'm like yeah if you want to [laughter]\nUnder telling you it'd be interesting\nTo see how many people who can advantage of early voting on this election cycle I think it would be an interesting thing to look into that maybe you should check it out\nOh yeah no I I Will and I ... and they they normally do a study and I I Know the nationwide they're saying that the uh Republicans are up but it doesn't necessarily mean anything because there's still a lot of time left so but that's that's interesting right people first free towns gonna go more Republican I just saw that yeah there's\nNo doubt about that but I'm just amazed like I say I thought I was going to sit there I'm In my\nYou know reading a book right not so while people\nI think really like this idea that I don't have to go to the older than I Want I can just walk in the air and they're in and out and that's the end of it\nAnyway it'd be interesting to track\nHey absolutely thanks a lot I used to call ... thanks for the update yeah you've early voting I mean I I've always or almost always done it by absentee you know go in and I don't bother haven't mailed me the ballot just go in to town on vote [noise]\n[noise] but it's good to good a hole appears to be a good thing we're going to find out it is expensive is expensive to put on but isn't that interesting to go into town hall to pay their taxes and then they they can vote\n\nA lot of people don't like paying taxes or they don't like it didn't say that way\nBut it it's not like your income tax where they take it out more than most people's cases they take it out of your paycheck every week your property taxes you're gonna write that check you feel that fight even if you think it's all worth it I'm\nGonna have an impact on the election in of itself right All right five oh eight nine and six zero five and let's see what's out there to morning thanks for holding\nYou gotta like a a guess like John dentist who Ken has a respect for the host broadcaster that he will correct him about his opinion about a certain game or whatever mhm uh you gotta respect that in a man a and of course you only find that in in a man and a woman or\nYou've never been record by a woman ... you got to you've ... you've never been corrected by a woman\nOh oh you are\nLike for it because it's based on emotion see that they can't base\nThe thing I've logic because there were a little bit less of women we we cherish\nThat women were like Trump Trump cherishes women what did he say about what we cherish women and the women turn out for a massive numbers but we also cherish the host broadcaster because he points out the following about Texas\nYeah again he needs clarification he said you know this guy's not going to win a Texas well the other thing that has broadcaster mentioned is that it's a we listen to talk radio we become informed or because of of\nThe host but more so because of the color broadcasters yeah that's right that's\nRight and I like to uh uh you said maybe but the thing is certainly is because of the color broadcasters\nMore than the house because the color broadcast a yesterday psych nurse long summer sun brought up the taxes voting and how if you vote for your guy accounts is nine for the other guy is called a vote flipping and of course they're not talking about in the media\nYou won't talk about it you're afraid that by a\nUs why literally have
