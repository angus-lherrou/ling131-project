stars up there at Fenway maybe they're having their all star game and their million major league scouts are watching all these guys\nAnd the red socks on ballpark of course they had a little different idea and they have this eye doctor set up somewhere in federal law\nAnd each of these kids during practice speech brought off the field and taking them to be examined by the I doctor who's got some fancy fancy machines that we test your eyes will\nAh that can determine whether you will player can quickly I ate\nHundreds of a second intense of a second what were those can distinguish between a

that are now for my cake probably year are on the red Sox and this doctor forget his name he has a world championship ring from the last Red Sox\nChampionship because they'd give 'em out to everybody to train and the doctors I'm worried about it and he's got one because of his role with these I test\nThat's so interesting wow yeah yeah yeah well\nLet me see uh let's see how good the eyesight is in these battleground states my buddy or\nWe're going to find out a lot of stuff in two weeks I'll get on with you two weeks from now and thank God this thing will be over for a while and there'll be some counting still growing on\nEverybody's got a million thoughts about it I'm\nInterested in an interview this morning about governorships and I think the Democrats are going to win some key states\nIt's for governor Trump hasn't spent any time on the governorships he's trying to hold a shuttle says big bang which makes sense but states that Trump won two years ago for president Florida Michigan Wisconsin\nOhio all have open contested\nGovernorship races and and Georgia such a fifth wheel and I'm In three of them I think the Democrats are going to want to get one Michigan I have a real shot in Wisconsin where at in Florida Bay\nAnd they're even in both Ohio and Georgia and the reason this is important fell for twenty twenty for Trump himself right is that the governor controls the election machinery in a state\nAnd you don't want the governor against you obviously and\nThe governor also is a huge player in the redistricting and twenty\nTwenty percent to system and then twenty Twenty one and twenty twenty two they aren't participating with the state legislature and redrawing all the legislative districts and the congressional districts and show governors are important and\nI hate to see us losing states\nWhere we've had the governorship but we're going to lose some of them this year\nBut the early voting seems to be a cording to some of these news stories yeah I'm just going over them real quickly they say\nThe Republicans are doing great\nRight exactly yeah\nWell maybe I don't know what will say well that's why you just wait for two weeks right when I look that up because I saw a thing on TV Republicans are great\nAnd then I found another story said no actually the Democrats you're doing good so I got all high levels anybody know what's going on and it really doesn't matter when you vote in matters how you vote if you voted the wrong ... whether you vote early or vote on election day got an add it all up and then we'll find out\nYeah\nI'd love to know your thoughts on this uh seven thousand ...\nYou know people trying to come up from Honduras Guatemala and what do you do with this thing and they say another one slamming now I Know none of their own data before\nWe have we have um every few months they come up and that is why we have a big presence on our border of our president I Would do a couple of things that\nI don't know if they're getting done or not I'm not a one well I've worked backwards I I Would talk to Mexico and find out what\nWe gotta do to get them to stop them after all their cross across from Guatemala and Honduras into Mexico right why is Mexico letting them crossed into their country at all why not just keep 'em out\nWhy don't they have a wall on their southern border good question because they won't let these people stay in Mexico their wedding in trends burst Mexico\nTo get to our southern border now at at our southern border\nAs I said they've had this happened what just a few months ago and we've got border guards ready to let some man\nWho allowed to come and most won't be letter\nThey'll have to turn around and go back to whatever but and some will try to sneak in a more rushed them a lot of them will apply for asylum and will be considered right on the spot whether they qualify or not but I think\nThe best way to cope with the problem is to prevent it and the first place and that is don't let the Caribbean ever get going and get up here Mexico ought to stop it and could we do that government to stop it\nHow am\nI right\nWouldn't you rather pay them to stop this but then have to pay all this money to support these people feed these people get\nBetter care of them ever click on the lawyers for the court cases no pain them and they come on I ... I was paid Mexican plus\nThat Trump has a decent relationship with the outgoing government of Mexico which has another month to go and he says he got a good relationship with President elect Obrador takes over the end of November I Believe\nWho who got elected by being anti Trump but maybe that doesn't matter maybe you can work with the guy I don't know but\nIt seems to me it's on Mexico to stop this fall it's in their country before it gets here stop it\nInteresting turn them around walking back\nYeah yeah absolutely that's a great San I Hope the president is working on that line ... ...\n... and a political because it's a great issue you're asking me about it on TV constantly ah scares the hell out of many Americans all my God these people are going to invade us and it politically for the midterm she could not have better visual every day on the news two weeks ago\nSome guy girl you know whatever maybe or someone from the military give them a shot to showcase their skills 'cause he was that that's not good\n[laughter] you're right and you know what else I'm Glad you mentioned that or is he a draw for young people that we want to get a inspired by baseball\nI don't know not really for er handful of people and I don't know if the if the red Sox organization has to pay him but that money would have been better given to charity I mean the ... sort of a nice touch but that without a tune I don't know what was going on [laughter]\nHe was off to\nThe was off but uh you know you're going to vote you know it's funny I\n[laughter] I totally disagree on a lot of things but you know one thing what these people these immigrants these waves of people that want to come in he keeps saying and it aggravates me\nIt's best for the Republicans are Republicans no it's best for American you know there are bad people there are a few bad people coming over there are kids that haven't had immunization they'd put our kids at risk\nThey put our area at risk when they come across like this because we don't know who the hell they are so it's not good for just Republican it's good for American\nAnd this is what jumps all about make America great again not make the Democrats or the Republicans great again that's what Obama did that's what he does when he speaks\nIt's about him and his legacy it's not about the people of this country I'm maybe I'm far off on this but I don't think so\nRight and no no I agree [noise] the thing is\n... what is Mexico doing about this whole thing\nWhere do you expect Mexico to do they send their own ... you know prime child overhear themselves yeah there in the I think Trump sold the rights sort of tap your cut off funding to Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala and you say hey sorry you're getting not a penny\nFrom our country if you said if you do these kinds of of things in Mexico the same way\nI mean I Know it just surprised to find her play with Mexico because there's some trade involved and so on and so forth the Mexican government's been sending people over forever what made you think they're going to stop all\nYou know a good point and so\nBut uh yeah anyway uh in in the ... everyone's got to do their part but absolutely you've got to put a um you know border security there a National Guard troops because if you let this go you have a waves of this continuing to happen if you shut this down hard now it sends a message\nThat's the thing and if you don't ... your word is the buzz word it will continue on and on and on and on\nYeah and you know I Know you guys were touching on early voting and that is it I don't particularly care for it if you can't ... election isn't important enough for you just show up on the day that you do then sorry not everybody travels on election day that's a travesty but the biggest thing is I vote in ... I don't even up\nSo I don't even have to do a license I can pick a street in ... I could throw a name out there and vote away no id no nothing it's disgusting\nYeah best Dartmouth you should see some of these polls another stage there's one or two hour wait in line so you know ... we're not used to it around here but there really is a long wait for many many people would they won't show up to vote and that could hurt us\nYeah and I do think that ... was ... I think the governor will probably um the the ... for Florida any way that the you know that I don't know his name the black\nA running person running their only because he's the environment is huge I don't know what's going on with the bacteria or something\nSomething go ride Florida that issue is going to help him but I don't agree with Scott I think that I think Scott gonna pull that out now for this just a train wreck and and again you heard what the hell is not right\nNow and he's not very good at that very lax is very low but\nIt'll drag them across the line is this is what we're settle for a politician I mean how would you how can that even come out is not that great but oh well hey there's only a hundred senators that run our country like I Want the best and the brightest and oh by the way a little bit more aimed at either\n[laughter] charge let me hold you there buddy out a lot going on [laughter] hey you [laughter] well at night I six zero five hundred and I'll get to your phone calls next\nElection season is here watch to make life on do you see us in Phoebe subscribe to be a silver for young you too [laughter]\nIt's not very nice casino you can we\nLaying down\nAnd every Saturday sent a letter you can win in Grand\nHotel chain retailers and gift card\nLook at him just off interstate one Ninety five and reached when people are different and is now your\nJoin us are your kids thinking about college for maybe a career in engineering coronary arts or allied health\nAt greater to Bedford folk that were among the Massachusetts public schools that are leading the nation wide repairing our students with a strong academic foundation and technical experience\nClass we offer other things kids like to do in high school for music drama dancing animal or what's your destination greater New Bedford regional vocational technical high school\nPreparation passion persevering apply\nOnline at ... dot edu\n... show is Rosie by flagship insurance continues no new for news organizations forging Tony ... interesting\nAbout are the unions there and the Dodgers crossing the hotel picket line by sneaking in the back door of the rich Carlton\nAnd to the ... was saying you know here's one of the the largest ... most successful unions in the world representing these professional players and the they cross the picket line by sneaking in the back door of the rich Carlton ...\nNine Ninety six zero five hundred hello they're\nProbably going to I don't feel hey good morning you afforded us the last laugh Oh thank you you gave\nUs the best laugh when we're in Arkansas\nOh you mean what I saw the picture of you for a wide sitting on a storm or all we know the older ... and I said I had all nice young woman she brought her father\nAre [laughter] risk give serve more joy oh I hate it was the last ally that\nLove a good job that was funny I I ...\nIt or not [laughter]\nOr you had a good time did you yes thank you yeah it was great to Kentucky Arkansas yeah Arkansas\nYeah oh yeah yeah that's a great great having a little less than a bluegrass music down there it is yeah\nWe shame blue grass is a country music in the you know yeah yeah it's funny a\nCountry music plenty of are grits down there\nPlenty and ... and everything now\n[noise] [laughter]\nI had um American right there [laughter] oh my God I saw bumpers you're you're never believe it's spelled out the F. word All right\nWell more and then it was founded by gun control so you you you imagine that in your mind is is a yeah ask you a ... gun control show\nYou that bumper sticker on the expressway in Boston that's for sure\n[laughter]\n[noise] oh my goodness [noise] so how are you man\nDid you get better and very very fuzzy um I haven't been able to listen much on the radio I get a chance to call and talk to the sheriff on my way to work yesterday\nUm listen to the mayor a little bit when he was on a busy missing a lot of talk radio\nOr just getting more I see in the news at night you know as far as politics go uh she used to be time for me but it's going to start winding down and back on my regular schedule now Saul have a more tied to a\nTo listen to all this stuff that's going on is very important time to be the selection coming up\nAnd um you know a lot of things going on with this crowd of people much and I would see I'm already so I don't know I'm a little bit suspicious on what my suspicions could go on either side to me it's been such a great thing could a President Trump I'm starting to think maybe somebody on that site", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "24"}
