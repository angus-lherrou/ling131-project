after\nYou know so I I didn't see what ... what these people are looking at so I mean every election the only consciousness Democrats have\nIs a race card get the people and great get the people fighting okay that's that's the ... and the whole and that's it we can set that's the only thing that they use that platform at all that to show the American kids and people water we're going to do if we look\nAt the Democratic pot and listen I used to be a Democrat until\nThe last election okay I voted for Clinton I voted for Obama OK mhm but this is not the Democratic party unused okay I'm a

the far left wing [noise]\nNo I I look I think the Democrat Party is really hurting yourself I'm In an attempt to to bring out their base because they're not talking about the things people care about people care about jobs\nThere's family being safe and trying to have an enjoyable life so maybe that is um you know make sure you have enough retirement money make sure you're really on a vacation every year or two you know things like this that may may may meal that you know help your kids buy a house help your kids go to college\nThese are things that matter to people and the Democrats used to be very good at that but they've lost their way\nAnd you got to remember one thing all black people what Republicans until the until the early seventies\nMartin Luther king Republican Martin Luther king in his father were both Republicans\nYeah there were there were all Republicans there were there were anti the the ... the sleep you know well you know owners back then which was all Democrats do it while Republicans but somehow\nIn the seventies when they give them that great deal and send them to the suburbs and change everything around and give them everything for free and this is what's happening today but man I don't I don't get it I don't see what the races and then it just because\nMaybe it's because the way I was brought up which is you know uh but my my daughter my kids at the same\nThey don't see they don't seek call it they just they went to school with all these kids to school\nWith Spanish Chinese black African everything so they don't see it so like I said that racism only comes up at every election soup to four years that's the only time it comes up so they consider the crap\nHey thanks for the call my friend don't be a stranger how can I take it out there enjoy this beautiful weather um I'm going to I've got a do you know I've got about forty minutes here on the other and berries going to come up and I'm going to get out there I think it's a good day in writing ride my bike bicycle\nBicycle well it's also a good day to talk of congressman William Keating our congressman we've got some things going on down in Washington I'm fascinated with this show the um\nAssassination kidnapping murder a will will if the Congress and describe a horse but I'm curious about the foreign policy implications of isn't as we know that's one of the things you talk about the congressman here quite a bit uh also I Want to get his take on part of his district would just Fall River genome where he has released the congressman\nHas released a statement on there's a couple of days ago we haven't had a chance to speak about it yet so windows ... will ah let's go to the card and a good morning person can you how are you sir\nOr good morning Chris if I sound a little horse at that time I ever campaign I think where your voice or to go and maybe I should have joined during the bicycle or something today that we're heading out to ... a nice day to be on the Cape\nWell the long ride down but certainly we worked on for years there yeah in terms of some infrastructure that are facing the inevitable a crushing ways of that area so uh it's great something we've worked out for for about four or five years is coming to fruition so\nDuring the trip down so congressman you of course are are are in in Washington you know you know the foreign policy that's really part of your [noise]\nYou're a platform is your expertise in foreign policy and of course you you know the foreign affairs piece from you talked to us about just to show the um ... what are the implications for a marathon seems like this is ... ... I Will say I'm I'm a ... suspicious in the sense that it showed prominent\n... in the dialogue right now we're talking about your perspective on what do you think\nWell on the news first broke or one of the things that we've talked about the importance in foreign policy it's important to maximize\nBipartisan a relationship so uh the the committee is foreign affairs that I'm the ranking\nMember out where the chairman or is a Republican frankly a Republican Tea Party\nMember from Texas a tadpole or he and I I immediately got together uh and issued a letter a bipartisan letter or to the Saudi officials saying we want a information immediately want to clear investigation or were outraged with what occurred uh and so\nWe did that immediately it's been you know that's been followed suit by so many other people are in a bipartisan basis or in Congress both in the house and the Senate or this is extremely important\nUh it's not just the case of a you know person with a permanent residents of the U.S that was a journalist for the Washington Post that\nWas going to uh the turkey embassy to get some documents he needed to get married\nUh and to have this occur and it's quite clear now or you know with different sources that unfortunately uh he was killed 'em now they're going to find out how much\nI'm an implication that that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had in this directly\nOr more and more information is coming out of the turkey the Turkish government where are their even identify some of the people are that come over just proceeding that visit to the conflict by\n... uh and included I think are important they are the top forensic doctor a who's a very close to uh the crown prince as well so that's not a person that would typically come over so to me is I'm looking at\nThe evidence that's coming out that is a critical portion of it took US government with allowed in they found\nA toxic materials\nThat were painted over a it just recently so the circumstantial evidence is not good\nAnd it's important to the U.S\nThese strong here uh we have a last journalist ourselves or we looked at as the beacon a of a fairness and honesty and\nFreedom of the press around the world and we're also looked at it as a beacon of a human rights so this is a this is a big deal\nI think that the arms sale a\nWhich was exaggerated by like Chris that we keep hearing a hundred and ten billion dollars I the only fail that's gone for the proposed sales only four billion dollars\nSo it's nothing that approach is that right I Would find that that's in jeopardy or in the Senate but more so uh this call's bipartisan calls in the Senate or for sanctions possibly to be introduced here so uh this is trust in the middle of as you know\nAnd we've discussed before a\nOne or the cauldron of unrest right in the middle east and a Saudi Arabia has been a ally of ours against Iran or we've given them resources in a controversial war in Yemen\nUh yet uh here's here's where we're going to come out are we going to stand up for what we've always been as a country\nOr are we going to let a temporary alliances um you know have the day\nWe're speaking with congressman William Keating a about the murder of the journalists are to show 'em congressman ... what do you think what do you have any sense I Know it's still early here in the investigation but what the Saudis were their claim is they were interrogating him a easier is there any or even\nMet that yeah I don't know that now\nLeaking that's leaking okay okay um is there any sense of ... what the Saudis were after or why he would be\nKilled he was he was quite critical of the crown prince people that have been critical of the crown prince did not farewell ah and ah he was a particular thorn in his side writing articles that were critical to his actions\nThe way he got rid of his you know the other members of the royal community and the way he uh you know was a catalyst for cutters the blockade and some of
