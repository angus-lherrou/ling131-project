T. E. ah which is a chronic traumatic to make you gonna have to help me a ... right running dramatic and ... and ... of the\nOr CD ran a stick with the acronym 'cause that's about as good as I can do\nBut the tea is been a become a big concern especially among parents it says it say I'm a ... a condition um that might can describe it a little more detail but essentially\nHad C. T. and but it's not like\nIt's not like there's there's ever been the sense that everybody was played football is somehow you know becoming demented in and and the depressed at an early age and maybe are just scratching the surface now but I think that's one line of thought but the other is you know it could could be that\nYou know it's not ... that it it's just it's a condition that really doesn't that doesn't that changes the physical makeup of of one's brain but doesn't affect a lifestyle it's hard to hard to know right now but\nUm I think there are it is it is worth thinking about and I think you're right that having\nSome sort of developmental you know progression into a there's a lot to me maybe a lot to be said about a developmental progression into into playing football much like there isn't another sports\nYou know the the tricky part to it just seems to me and you're starting to see this with some of the rule changes in the NFL you know when you get down to a football football was so much about blocking and tackling and as it is about collisions right and uh and you see you know players\nGetting flack for lowering their their their helmet on on tackled and even on blocks and you think well wait a minute just that seems pretty normal why why why people are they drunk flags for that and\nAnd so you know what I'm sure that's been that's been the reaction of a lot of players and coaches in the NFL and so now that has to get sorted through and then it has to be I Hope sorted through in a way that's very deliberate database as opposed to a ... um\nWe have a we have a call or coming into my own and grab them no right you're on the line with uh the uh the morning mirror show him the mirror in the morning and the rest of the day go ahead\nFor yes\nOr the\nFraud\nAnd away [noise]\nAnd they ... they were\n\nAll sold ... after the war so\nThis ...\nWell I yeah Arthur modern noted that it was called the Spanish flu or you got the name of Spanish or because of the king of Spain came down with flu like symptoms and so it just caught on like that but yeah the reality was that\nThat soldiers engaged in the war um yeah ... well they brought out but it it ended up here and edits hide him before the the end of the war in October of Eighteen I really had spiked in the morning and and so uh\n\nYeah well it in the you know about seven hundred people die from a from it here in uh in New Bedford which is just a remarkable figure but no I Hope people or continue to talk about uh about the Spanish flu it's a big chapter in our cities in our country is in the world history and uh\nYou know it's a last minute we wind down in the next I'm On the next the next few weeks to talk about World War one that this will be\nPart of the ... one of his to turn back to uh to my Bonner now about to talk a little bit more about\nAbout the tea your what's your sense of I mean there's you're seeing a concern out there about ... to my parents were also saying you know other friends too right through there is a decline and school age population and southeastern Massachusetts and\nIt really a lot of parts of the country that are are outside of major metro so in Massachusetts it's it's true I mean we're seeing it in Rhode Island we're seeing on Cape Cod fishing in western mass or you're not seeing it in in the Boston area in part because Boston\nYou know like other major metros is growing considerably especially among people of child rearing and bearing age the twenties and thirties and so forth and\nAnd so that so you know these concerns about CPR already are building on top of\nUm [noise] uh trends that are pushing against um you know school a enrollment and therefore sports participation and then you add on top of that you know the problems of a you know the the trends associated with kids just not playing sports ... playing\nA video games and ah being on screens and such and so it's been a frustration for\nFor lots of coaches in the area I'm sure some of whom you've you've had a chance to talk to them\n[noise] yeah I think that you know there's a couple of things in one of the coaches I spoke to who coaches both uh you know you tackle football and you fly football he mentioned the NFL has to you know figure out what what it's going to do because as you mentioned\nWhat what is football going to evolve into because you watch NFL games now and\nIt's really difficult to play defense at all you see a lot of forty forty one games and there's not a lot of defense because it's not a lot of ... you know hitting the what is what you know everyone here grew up watching so I think it starts from the top there is what are they going to acknowledge that hey football is a dangerous sport\nAnd this is how we're going to make it safer are they just going to try to manipulate the game where you keep football the way it is\nHide any issue of you know dangerousness and just make it\nI mean a lot of sense of some people would say the NFL now it's kind of a flight football league because the defense can't touch the off as we've seen actually patriots fan salt last week where\nA a a defensive line wrapped up Tom Brady and thought that the play was over and then let them go because he didn't want to flag mental ... runs in the end zone um\nSo I think it starts from there and then I think the other thing is just a on every subject is can be the answers education learning about the tea knowing that\nWhat we do know from research but what we also don't know and we don't know um what ... what a what a hit constitutes his head hit we know that um the tea doesn't necessarily mean concussions it means uh continue head trauma over a long period of time\nBut what is head trauma um that's something that scientists and researchers don't know now and\nThen on that point just to like to inject once I get it it's not limited to football rights of soccer players have no experience the same thing when they had they had the ball right\nAnd it's hockey players and boxers say oh this is something that that has been seen in all of those athletes\nThe a and the researchers are really up front about this that the reason why they've seen more cases in football and more severe\nIs because the sample sizes is more football players is is that a lot more football players and as much as we talk about the declining numbers of football football is still far and away the number one participated sport and the state it's it's really not even close it is declining but it's still\nFar away number one so there's still a lot that research is don't know about C. T. E. they've been studying it you know hands on it a oh in our backyard at Boston University uh for about Thirteen Years and he said uh the research I spoke to said you know\nThis isn't a very long time we know a lot and we were gathering a lot of data but they're still so much more to to discover and when I spoke to a lot of parents\nThey they weren't they didn't know a lot about C. T. they heard it because of Aaron Hernandez but they thought it was maybe concussion based or they didn't know\nMuch about it and I think that's something again parents coaches are regulators NFL people anyone really should just educate and learn more about this and know what we know we don't know and I think that's a a really big thing moving forward which is one of the reasons why we wrote the article was\nNot necessarily to say football's good or bad but just to say hey here's what some research is showing here's what's happening to football and then maybe we'll see what ... what happens next ... what what\nAre some of the coaches sang about um what the what the what ... minutes phrase it this way and what what what are what you're saying about the messaging in other words what are they telling parents\nThat are that it's safe that they're coaching in a different way you know a lot of these coaches played football are growing up\nAnd it's just an entirely different game which we talked about the NFL but it's\nIt's really I'm taking the head out of the game as much as possible and ah I wrote a story about this actually in Mississippi and I came up again was the Pete Carroll are tackling method\nWhere it's really using leverage where if you wrap up someone's leg and just kinda like spin just spin or just kind of collapse on them your body weight it's just going to drag them down and you're you're really just taking down there\n... it is easier said very much easier said than done but the the the Seahawks practice this and actually they many of their practices are without helmets um so it's really non contact it's all lower body\nUm but then it brings up the the case that I was thinking this morning you ask a lot of NFL players and they'll say you know hit me high I'd rather be hit high then you take out my knee right and then I'm Out for an entire season so again it's\nThat's where I think the NFL and the game has to really figure out what the best way of doing this is because\nYou're right that the knees and the legs are kind of money makers but you don't want head injuries either so where where does the kind of game go from\nHere I Am in a sort of the football where everybody's play football and as you know when I was instructed fried right from the beginning that you know when you tackle somebody to get your head across\nAnd yet you know you you you drive through the person right but it's like the positioning of your your head when you tackle and then you know on the opposite and that the direction the runners is going in is this is the\nUm and we work day in day out with them and we hung out with them socially which you know definitely helped trigger the conversations that we were trying to have out there and really um it just ended up being a really great time and we learned so much from each other on both sides\nAnd it was really amazing it was kind of a weird thing to step out of the big city life and go into such a small town life 'cause I grew up in New Bedford by you know which is a quote unquote smaller town than New York or LA\nBut I was in a town of less than six hundred people so that stands for less than New Bedford in anything that I'm used to on a small scale so um yeah that's pretty much what we did and\nIt was really amazing so it sounds like a back seat is your expectations cool thing to do but it actually actually something that will shape your wife random and it sounds like you know having\nBeing immersed in a in that setting for a while and getting to know people or something that's a valuable one that's on right now in addition to being you know on TV and getting getting you notoriety\nOh absolutely um you know I said yes this project because of the subject and because of what they want it to capture I mean I was curious and I think that that was a common theme throughout\nThe whole entire project for me and the other people involved was that we were just really target we were like what is not working about this country right now\nAnd we wanted to go down there and have that conversation and I would certainly profoundly profoundly affected by this experience and I know most of the other cats remembers if not all of us were have the same feeling about it\nOh that's great that's great and I'm as soon as it already been filmed is one of these things were into all the ... the the episodes have been done and they're in the can at this point or are they is this this was a pilot and then you go from here for its popular you you do more\n... they say when you film that last um last November I'm over the course of six weeks so the four episodes that you'll need this week airing every night this week on bravo will um show\nThe ... the bigger point of what we were doing that because in six weeks you know again so much footage and you do so many activities that these people you're actually living your life with them so I imagine what six weeks of your life looks like on camera\nAround here and they have to bring it\nOut a little bit but um that's what you'll see is the manifestation of that and the four episodes and um it's going to be really great I'm really excited to see what everybody thinks about it\nOr you got to tell me that you drop drop the name New Bedford in every one of those episodes right\nOh yeah don't worry everybody knows that I Am allowed him out weather's my whole life I'm no matter what New Bedford is always a number one in my heart\nCould very well done well done ... ... and then tell everybody just so we can all tune in a ... does
