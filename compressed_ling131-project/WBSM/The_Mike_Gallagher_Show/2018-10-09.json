I just find it funny I'm you know I'm certainly glad that having a hard\nWork paid off I Do think I Believe what the president said that he was\nProven in a sense I think that um\nYou know a lot of this wasn't necessary I think the outcome was probably going to be the same but I just think that the tone in politics is really\nAnd and and I hate to just blame one party and bi partisan on this but I really do see it as one party I have never seen Republicans as long as I've been following politics and probably late seventies\nYou know on out I've never seen Republicans act like that and I don't mean to you know pick on one party but there is a clear delineation of what one party is mining for right the hype of\nVoters that they want right type of ... you know personalities that they're looking for versus the other and I just I find it very interesting that my my sort of ideas continue to be proven out yeah because\nA because that's the kind of thing the court could rule on\nI think even California would be a good example because they pass them but one thing saying that if you cooperate with ice or help in any way to it you know\nA a apprehend or a\nAn illegal alien then you can be charged while in jail and fined\nRight well that's the case there's probably some case coming out of that is going to turn up yet as to whether the government can suspend federal funds and I believe there was a ruling already somewhere on the west coast\nThat said that the government could not retail funding that was already appropriated but that leaves the door open to find that have not been appropriate right which could be a case that comes forward um that's an odd one coming up evidently hasn't to do a double jeopardy\nIn which the the constitution and the frame it didn't really specify whether you if you were found I'm innocent in a a state or local court could they be tried on a federal level\nAnd vice versa and that's coming up the double jeopardy case um and they're going to have to look and see what the original frame has actually said and what debates were held about that issue that will jeopardy issue so that the whole ... odd arcane sort of an issue but that's the kind of thing the court gets into\nHuman didn't like something like that happened with O. J. where he he had to go to a civil court\nWell that's a civil court but this is criminal yeah there's only one this is not telling them oh expires bring up another question talking about ... people mhm I'm editorialists today suggested the cabin on now turn around and so everybody ... he's not going to do I know but\nThat does open the door to a mock judge or this other guy the J. Smith mhm go around and stab suing some people\nAnd I would just I Would think that a doctor for it should be a watching herself very carefully I think she set up a goal fun to take to defend yourself well defend yourself against what might\nBe coming because the Democratic party well they've already use her she's telling to aside they'll never they'll never help her again they'll work you know they they don't they don't pursuit lost causes on that side they just try something else\n[noise] let's stay with this for just another minute because uh Susan Rice her name is coming back oh my God you want to talk about incompetent you want to talk about\nSomebody who ah really has done a lot of damage to our national security it's her\nAnd as the former national security advisor to a Brock Obama [noise]\nShe she says that she's going to decide very soon whether to run against Susan Collins up in Maine twenty twenty alright because she's a Susan Collins a betrayed women across this country\nIsn't that fabulous that she can speak for every woman across this country does she speak for you Lynn nope not at all\nAnd you know doing that it it's the same it's the same thing when you're going to make a gender lines racial lines and so on like ... we got to get away from that ... they're gonna they're gonna keep pushing that kinda stuff to\nIt's the divide people you've got to make all your decisions ahead it like it's just it drives me nuts because now I she did not speak to me I'm Glad Collins approved her speech was a little too long and say I was I didn't know where she was going at first but then I knew that it definitely was all the pluses but I was like oh my God if she she's got to stop talking to\nMe so to speak with about justice yes it was fair play ac um it was right on the money that unproven allegations apples\nYeah so that was the benchmark right there uh you know what do we are innocent until proven guilty and you need evidence in order to take that process a step higher let me um end with this and then we'll go to the phone lines\nWere talking about Kevin uh and now you know the ripple effect with Susan Rice I already\nKnow that are beyond saying who is Jay Jay Z they're they're kinda like off the road now right [noise] uh now it's going to be the a re emergence of the bill and Hillary show yes listen to this\nThere is another national

are the ones closer\nLike a\nRehash white Clinton lost and of course she's going to just really\nDidn't and we're going to go along on that same basis than maybe she's preparing for twenty twenty\nWell that was the question is election so obviously ... don't ruler out Peter that then Lynn that is the underlying question ... what is up her sleeve what are they up to\nIn order to be back on the road like a power team or this obviously has to be taken a with\nA seriousness but also a grain of salt to the same time it cracks\nMe up how these women also you know the me too movement you know they're going to be in with the Clintons and stuff after that for all the things that Bill Clinton well a lot of time and I just can't believe that we\nWere very quickly\nRight right Oh

you know we would\nAlways come back to the same subject\nYeah I Do and if\nIt's somebody sometimes a little bit over much about what parts of this but Democrats have maybe seriously overplay their hand all the\nWay because if the United States Senate by chance picks up to three or four Republicans that'll give him like fifty four fifty five\nAnd that means that if Trump gets a chance for another Supreme Court justice they'll just go right straight through bing\nBing bing interesting wow you know the the Ginsburg about four hundred years old and I'm anytime\nAt all she could pack it in

Sacha Baron Cohen who um who is America\nAnd when you listen to the news I was getting annoyed hearing the news from there it's all force fed\nPropaganda up anti Trump anti America and that never used to be ever since Trump came in and it's none of it's justified none of it's true and when you talk about that and to carry that it should have been applied to ... years ago um because he is fostering revolution he fostered it\nIn many countries before\nThe United states he came in in the nineties a lot of came in much earlier but he really took effect with that\nAnd and maybe George Bush Bush the first he took us that's slightly but became very apparent with George with that Bill Clinton an office so um they need to start looking at all the things they could easily do that it could easily go the case all the things that SARS is doing I mean I'm a nurse\nI'm and I'm able to find out the connections here um but Britain has been taken over and when I when I look back at a book ... like Winston Churchill a World War two the finest hour\nMhm I've been calling talk show host for nine years about sorrow and they used to hang up on me and says you talk about SARS were hanging up on\nThe line theme of the volume on the darkest hours is this is when they were the battle Britain\nWhen when France and Europe has gone against the Nazis and Britain was alone it says\nThat a ... a Churchill wrote this held a British people held before alone tell those who hit there too had been half blind were half ready and that was my reasoning to call radio shows and say you have you have ... you're not seeing half the country has woken up", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "09"}
