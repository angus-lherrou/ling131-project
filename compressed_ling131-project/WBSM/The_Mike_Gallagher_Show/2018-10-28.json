never forget that I\nWatch this that's three thousand people fifty five thousand people died\nFrom people who released they drug knowing it could do that and they're still working we no one would have to go look there in a building in New Jersey [laughter] we know where they are\nIs that okay I mean is that okay\nAnd we have more and more there's more fines and penalties being handed out drug

mean look at is CNN says that half of the people in our country are on at least two prescription today\nOf the people around at least two prescriptions\nAnd none of those prescriptions or even designed to get to the cause of the problem that's not what they're designed for they're designed for the symptoms of it twenty eight percent\nOf the people in our country or at least for drugs a day\nSo let me ask you this we're going to have an election pursuit if one of the candidates said hey you know what when I get elected it's all free you can have as many drugs as you want you can have as many surgeries is you want\nWhat do we become healthier if that was true would we be healthier if you could just have unlimited amounts of drugs\nNo it's not a chance no one in their right mind would even think that and yet that's what we're trying to do is get more coverage for what drugs and surgery for people which has no bearing on whether they get healthier in fact it doesn't make them healthier at All right the people who are on the most drugs that they have a ... so the healthiest\n... think about it think about this\nThe journal and the American Medical Association says that half of the serious side effects\nOf drugs aren't even known until they've been out for seven years or more\nYou know why that is because they hid the evidence in the trials we think oh it's been all research should be good to go right that how come half of the side effects aren't even known to the about seven years or longer and\nThe air may also says that twenty percent of drugs are withdrawn do death or serious side effects twenty percent\nOne in five drugs are taken back off the market they're being used right now they're going to be taken back off the market one in five because of deaths in serious side effects\nI like those odds for kids\nI don't know about you I don't think that's not okay with me\nI mentioned Russian roulette\nYou'll have a one in six chance of dying in Russian roulette\nYou have one in five if you take a drug\nA new drug is on the market one in five\nMy gosh I mean how do we ever buy in to this how do we buy into that\nWe're more intelligent than that aren't we\nAren't we\nIt's out of fear\nOne of the fears that we have one of the biggest fears if they do surveys that comes up every time is cancer\nDid you know the Congress declared war on cancer back in Nineteen Seventy one\nIt past the national cancer act we currently spend thirty billion dollars a year\nOn cancer research thirty billion dollars not on treatment I'm Talking about research thirty billion dollars a year on research and the question is how we doing since Nineteen Seventy one until now\nCancer rates are worse than they've ever been\nListening to this in Nineteen eighty five a prominent researcher named Robert ... found\nChemotherapy quote tends to make cancer worse\nHe drew his conclusions from research sponsored by the American Cancer Society and many reports and studies since that time have confirmed those results in fact a study just came out a few months ago about breast cancer and they found that women with breast cancer\nWho had it removed\nThey had a group of women who had breast cancer all of them had it removed\nSome of the group had chemotherapy some of them had radiation therapy some of them had both and some of the groups that I don't want any of that just take it out and let me go\nAnd then they followed them for ten years you know what they found if you had chemotherapy radiation or both you had significantly greater chance of having breast cancer on the other breast than the group who didn't have that done\nWhat was the purpose of the chemotherapy wasn't it to kill the cancers that it doesn't come back of isn't spread and yet what we find is it actually makes it worse\nThat's what research is showing we're seeing that none of the breast cancer but with other cancers too many studies have shown that it's not controversial in science that chemotherapy and radiation are carcinogenic do you know what that means it is a cause of cancer\nIf you were to say hey I'm healthy let me just get some chemotherapy you know what happened if you got enough it would give you cancer [laughter] and we think that if you have cancer let's go ahead and give it to you\nIt is an immune suppressor cancer is the reason you would have cancer\nEvery single person has cancer or pre cancerous cells in their body every single day\nThat some people get cancer and others don't\nWe all have\nThe capability that will have the cells we all have free radicals we have all those things and yet your immune system is it has things called killer cells that is what are called killer cells your immune system releases those\nAnd it kills [laughter] those free radicals that kills those cancer cells that kills those foreign things then gets rid of them\nYou have about ten thousand of those uh day\nSo what happens if you're getting cancer it means that it's not killing all those things that means that your immune system is not strong enough\nTo fight it all off and they start to accumulate so if your immune system's not strong enough what does chemotherapy duty immune system\nIt destroys it [laughter] your immune system's not strong enough to begin with and so we give something to destroy your immune system\nWell no wonder cancer comes back not only is your immune system still not strong enough it's weaker than it was going to start now you put a cancer causing agent in your body to\nThank goodness you know we continue to ... to search for the cure for cancer except they're not\nThe way they are looking in other words we have scientists in buildings all over the country with test tubes and their mixing chemicals back and forth saying we're gonna find this year we're going to find it no they're not it's not there\nThey're looking at the wrong place\nYou know what the definition of insanity is\nDoing the same thing over and over expecting a different result every time it's not going to happen there looking in the wrong place in fact we have the cure\nTo know where the cure is it's inside you\nI just told you that your your immune system is the cure\nIt is designed to fight off those foreign things if it's strong enough see your body doesn't need any help per se it just doesn't need any interference your body is incredible\nIt's incredibly made a drop of your blood has five million red blood cells seven thousand white blood cells and thousands of platelets\nSixty thousand of those cells could fit on the head of a PIN\nDo you do that your lungs have a half a billion tiny air sacs with the surface area get this of forty to sixty square miles if you could take your lungs out of your chest and unfold them you would have to have from here to Boston\nTo stretch them out and then the same distance west\nIt's amazing your body is incredible\nIt is designed genetically designed and programmed to seek health and wellness if it's not doing that something is interfering with it something is blocking it all we got to do for optimal health is to figure out what the blockages\nBut none of those tests compare\nAnd this is going to be such a revelation to you I Can't wait to reveal it and maybe you're thinking what could talk about what could be talking about what is the test are you ready it's\nThat test of checking your posture\nKnow is is it oh my God she's a chiropractor of course is going to say it's your posture that you should check that's the most important tests course you'd say that your chiropractor no listen I'm going to prove it to you not by a chiropractor or myself I'm going to actually show you some research I'm going to tell you about some research right now that was done\nBy a panel of PHD's and medical doctors who are studying Essure\nAnd I just want to read\nThe conclusion of the research just one little sentence of their research I want you to listen very carefully to what they say about posture because they studied it and how it affects you listen they said quote posture\nAffects and moderate every physiologic function from breathing the hormone production spinal pain headache mood blood pressure pulse and lung capacity or among the functions most easily influenced by posture\nNow I just want to spend a moment on this because it's really so critically important to your health and your welfare and maybe you didn't realize I Know your mom probably told you stand up straight\nRight sit up straight\nMaybe she didn't even realize the depth\nOf what's so important about your posture\nSo let me just show you says again posture affects and moderate every physiologic function in your body\nImage that leaves nothing there's there's nothing else it affects every thing every function in your body every physiologic motion your body is actually affected by your posture you mean the way you stand\nAnd it goes on to say that score spinal pain you could kind of relate headache mood\nBlood pressure Paul's lung capacity\nOr functions most easily influenced by posture but it affects every one of them everything which ones\nI'm you know I've already said that five times so you can see how important it is how could posture be so important\nWe have to look at this real deeper\nWhat is your posture me I mean the way you're standing but what does that mean posture is the window to your spine\nBecause your spine is the foundation of your posture just realize that right in the center of your posture at your spine right there so if your spine is straight\nThan your posture should be straight if your spine actually ships off if it bends one way or twists or shifts\nThen your posture follows it so if we look at your posture we can say hey wait a minute it's not straight what does that mean means ...\nWell big deal what does that mean watch\nYour spine houses\nYour nervous system the spinal cord it's called your life line it means your lifeline because it brings life to all your body parts\nBrain communicates with every part of your body remember three trillion bytes per second of information comes from your body to your brain in the back again through what through those nerves that go through your spinal cord so every single thing every single function every single part of repair healing\nRegeneration its control through those nerves through your nervous system and if your spine is off that's called civilization civilization was yours is where your spine shifts out of place\nIt puts pressure or irritates or gives interference to what spinal nerves or even the spinal cord itself\nIt interferes with the transmission of\nNerve impulses life force\nYou can call it whatever you want electrical energy\nIt's it's the information that meant for your body to function and heal itself it alters your body's chemistry it directly causes break down this ease malfunction\nMy goodness you realize the research that's come out on this in fact I mentioned blood pressure blood pressure yet do you know that there's some cardiologist in Chicago\nWho had that they they had a whole floor of an office building as their office\nAnd there were several ... whole group of cardiologists there that have been practicing for years\nAnd it seemed like they had this recruiting thing\nBecause in that same building by the way they were actually three other chiropractors three chiropractors in that building on different floors and they shared patience and many times there will be patient that comes in and said doc yeah I just had my chiropractic employment they take the blood pressure and it was lower\nAnd they did it again and again and again and after years of this they said wait a minute this is happening all the time people say they want to get there are just we got to say this\nA group of medical doctors cardiologist did a study and they found listen to this that if you were adjusted by a chiropractor it lowers blood pressure better than to blood pressure drug use in combination with each other without the side effects\nWow I mean that was earth shattering to them it wasn't to me it was earth shattering to know that they actually discovered it but we have seen that for two decades in fact chiropractors of scene for over a hundred years that people\nGot adjusted in their blood pressure lowered\nNo listen I'm not saying that are practically is a treatment\nIt's not it's not a treatment for anything all we do listen there's normal blood pressure [laughter] [noise]\nDo you understand that it's normal to have normal blood pressure it's abnormal for it to be high there's got to be a reason there's got to be something causing are pushing your body toward high blood pressure or wouldn't be Hi\nDo you think it's because of a lack of drugs\nDo you think that's possibly it that you just don't have enough drugs that's why your blood pressure's high no then why would you take drugs as the answer and I'm not saying don't take your drugs don't that's not what I'm saying either what I'm saying is is that really the answer you really think that\nI'm sure you don't write I mean you're intelligent you don't think that but yeah millions of people every day take their blood pressure drugs and they lower their blood pressure and yet their body the still the cause of their high blood pressure still there so you're putting the gas in the break on the same time that's not too smart\nCars go try that in your car watch what happens it's not going to last too long\nThat's what's gonna happen to you\nIt's going to blow you because your body's raising the blood pressure then you're lowering it with a drug\nIt's going to give somewhere right\nBecause you didn't get to the cost\nYou understand what I'm saying and so\nPosture affects everything\nSo people ask me all the time\nDo you think chiropractic it helped my brother he has asthma\n... will\nDo we have we've had I mean I've I've had dozens and dozens of people who had asthma and they don't have any more they just got adjusted\nI also have people who have as many still have it why 'cause that wasn't the cause something else was causing it\nRight what about my cousin he has headaches do you think ... if they have civilization does doesn't treat headaches but we've had many many people thousands who had headaches they don't have any more\nDo you understand what I'm saying listen\nThe most important check\nOf anyone including children is to check their posture to see if they have ...\nNow who do you want to do that someone who is trained\nBecause we do that everyday we check people's ... every single day and then that may lead to other examinations including X ray to confirm whether the civilization and they're not and that may need correcting because it can affect every physiologic function in your body\nYou know it's upsetting to me is there's people St Luke's hospital and hospitals all around the state all around the country as people laying in bed right now and you can go over there you can confirm this yourself just drive right over there and you can ask people\nThere's people over there laying in bed with tubes and blood pressure cops and everything else and you can ask them what's the matter with you know like I don't know they haven't figured out\nThat yeah they've done that test they've taken my blood they taking my blood pressure we did a CAT scan I'm not sure yet taken all these drugs\nBut they haven't had the most important check yet no one check their posture which affects what\nEvery physiologic function\nGood some of those people could some of those people have civilization and that's their problem\nI'm not saying could it is\nThat is some of their problem\nNo other people there with other problems other causes of course I mean you have to be more on not know that but\nSome looks Asian posture effects in moderate every physiologic function in the body\nWhat about your health issues is it the drugs\nIs that what you needed\nA you know it's like it's it's almost laughable to think that that's what people have bought

already sending advisors in Vietnam and the late fifties\nOh absolutely Kennedy was there and fifty one would chose to go and they were serving in Saigon and some of the cities and South Vietnam\nThey were already preparing um to fight the Vietnam in at that time but the French had been there before and we supported we supported the French the French gutter pretty much pushed out of Vietnam and like the fifty four and ...\nAnd um so we're funded a military weapons the men and women actually turned those weapons on the French and then later turned them on us\nSo let me let me start with Jim on this issue 'cause I Know both of you have dealt with this issue but um most recently after sixty five years we're seeing some of the boys come home\nThe nine forty six\nVoting twenty\nWeekend for twenty\nSo quite a difference though between and even though the the the times bad was very short between a conflict or the police action a Korean conflict in Vietnam I was quite a change I'm not only because all we all go I mean if\nYou think about it um by the time the war really kicks in and we're sending like fifty thousand troops are already Ninety sixty five he's right the marine corps go in there to guard the airport a pill you I mean at the plate to\nAnd uh that was the biggest um is searching the troops at the time and then it escalated after that of course after the Tet Offensive [noise]\nYou know sixty eight than it was a big boost in uh in recruitment that time the draft come in and uh you know everybody was really really going for you you couldn't go into issue when our army airborne that would be in for three airborne or the marine corps that's all they were drafted at a time you don't have to English or anything else\nYou're very different a different different um um friends in terms of the uh uh geographically and in weather wise I mean it was very hot where you were very very great gym\nOne thing that we found that that that that these people they found in Korea there still in decent shape and the equipment is also is because of the coal we had now in Vietnam was it was hot totally different the bodies would change in months but and but in Korea your last year's with a cold that was there\nUsed to get really cool yeah yeah\nSo that's that was the difference that that they do get his and better\nOh you're in for four years the U.S\nDown to four years as I got extended twice they wanted me to take a year give me thirty days often send me back to Vietnam for another year or so we'll just leave me here they were looking for a team leaders and of course the one thing that hurt the Vietnam War as\nIf you were there for Thirteen months by the time you got enough experience right and we're heads up about what you needed to do especially an field operations you were heading back to the world and another guy was taking your play has really didn't have the experience\nAt all this constant rotation of troops there right cause people to make the same mistakes over\nAnd over and uh yeah and you didn't have that rotation\nAh well ah well they ... it wasn't there also and it happened with us also then somebody would get enough\nEnough information on what he had to do and and money was supposed to do and then then before you know what he was being rotating if he didn't get wounded or killed of course and uh yeah we have the same thing and the second World War my brothers one in whenever one day when when they came out the water in it\nAnd and that's the way it was when everybody so many people in the second World War when then when the war first started in Nineteen forty one and that's when it started and they were there from then until the war ended in Nineteen forty five\nAnd so those guys learn forever and ah and and if you are in the infantry and the chances of coming home was so slight if somebody's going to get you a venture\nOh yeah so the big difference for her in Vietnam from Korea as you guys had the choppers today didn't have so absolutely and then they were huge they played a big role\nEver saw was critical especially for evacuations you know they had helicopters for evacuation but there were very crude\nIn a in the amount of a rear area support that they had for those were basically uh in in distance so if your way up on the front of your medic station was in the rear even if you had a helicopter support it was usually from a medic station\nRight to a mash units right or medical unit\nAnd those were a few and far between and Vietnam you'll probably you'll probably in the air\nWounded for oh probably about an hour or so if the weather was good because it was whether prohibitive to you know if that we've got a real low ceiling you couldn't be ... at that time I had a medic with me and he was good he was good as any surgeon that you see today\nAnybody do anything you know he's very capable so are most of the time we can keep people alive for long enough to get them back to some some super medical attention\nRight so the the conditions were very different for the two of you know you guys had to keep your feet from falling off from frostbite and I knew were constantly sweating and fighting bugs and in swamps and in jungle a muscle yeah how how would that I mean I mean the\nWater was a big issue you know you could only carry so much water and so you how to prepare your water in the field and that was always a\nKind of a sketchy situation getting water you know I carry four counties and I had a gallon blame it on my back but that's not a not near enough water not at a hundred degrees than a hundred percent humidity so that was like a big issue especially like with the Agent Orange\nAnd [noise] be fifty two bombings you know they create these big or creators of filling with water during the monsoon you see a lot of guys trying to fill the can't teams out of those you know there's no trace one on inside there are a lot of medical issues of course all the streams are a lot of streams of contaminated right I'm foliage\nAnd all kinds of stuff that can in their animals or to Buffalo's right\nNorth Vietnamese soldiers you know everybody's uh taken a turn in the stream there so\nRight absolutely so now Jim or in your situation with the weather's freezing yeah on you had to water it frees up on ya\nOh yeah what uh but they say say fairly well 'cause your campaign has run against your body that stayed fairly well and we never had much trouble getting water outside of when we find on a on a battle and now they got to bring ammunition\nHow's it going to bring water also and that was always a problem so there's times ... times I can remember being a full day probably not drinking and the water at all uh eating for ... and a half\nAnd and the worst of that that that like the like John ... helicopters if we had him in Vietnam we got to save after the guys that we lost\nWe've with most of the most everybody you're losing because they lost their black so the first thing you've got to do is you got stopped the bleeding and that's the first thing you gotta do and they're going to go into shock on you and you're going to realize that\n[noise] so are you give them a shot him off again and ah and you have to stop the bleeding and there would be so deeply quickly for you know what that route and couldn't couldn't get a helicopter and that's because we was a either shift but I'm off on a personal carrying this little further back would be a little jeep and then an ambulance\nWell one day and the evidence they always had somebody else on there wasn't there but to get somebody back\nAlive was was real difficult you know and it wasn't really the greatest thing in a while\nAnd it's a bunch of you put a tourniquet on a leg and and they were saying to me hey that tourniquets went on that link to long you better take that tourniquet on goals as like I said a bit of loses its legs in his life absolutely and I keep it down to ... to ... a tourniquet on it wouldn't take the tourniquet off\nWe've got what there's such a special guest the Korean War veteran I'm a medical Jim real fair haven also a Vietnam War a green number re George Brown now also from there have and then now we're we're celebrating the military military Monday military Monday segment you buy\nA first citizens federal credit union learn about the the benefits of the hero look out at the first citizens that dot org and we love to have have you guys call in and ask them questions\nOr because I Know after it's over you're going to say oh I Wish I had called in and asked this question so fight away not now six o five hundred I is the other number first of all I I Want to thank you both for your service a gym you know how I feel about you or not and and all that you've done um I'm In George thank you for your service\nThrough and now it obviously um it it it it was a very difficult time she was a lot of guys were heading north and a lot of guys like are we getting deferments the guys are the connections and the money and all that were you drafted or did you go into an era\nOf I I was drafted in uh I went through the cue course ranger cue course in Nineteen sixty nine and a Fort Benning Georgia um\nThere was [noise] you were going to you had a two year a draft so you'd go through a infantry actually go through a jumped school you'd be a already be moving towards Vietnam\nI'm In a unit when you got to Vietnam and everybody when you go to Vietnam they go right down the line said you're in a hundred first airborne you're an eighty second airborne you're in a hundred and Seventy third airborne\nAnd a lot of guys right from favor in high school where I went to high school I'm\nPeter Roy you went into the marine corps dropped he was killed he was home in like six months that I'm David drowned who's a hundred and Seventy third airborne right he was home six seven months to\nA you know so this is all happening right very very quickly or when that while the dropped but they needed people they need to put bodies in Arabic to fill the vacancy to keep the uh the patrols going you know I was I was pretty fortunate because the training and I had was exemplary I can never complain about the training saved my life\nSo is it everything and more you thought it was I mean you must have some expectations when you're on that plane had nowhere that way and and it was ... when you got there and now\nYou know you've been don't jumbled trained on the Panama and all you know you were climate ties already you know before you got there and like I say a lot of guys who just was shaking bakes you know they go through a basic training advanced infantry training jumped school and they were gone\nNow was it so the training was limited so you learn from your uh and CEOs once you got there you know and go to your specific mission and whatnot\nBut it'd be climate ties are not just dumped them through there that I think that a tribute to a lot of the loss of life as well and I was a training the training was what it was still in spots there and it wasn't really what it was supposed to be for all the majority of the troops that went there\nSo I'm but nothing prepares you for that first time Seventy start shooting at your house right I think that's what I find if you see a a spray those green traders right it'll start to change your perspective on things yeah\nSo now you're out there and and then you're moving around your mostly on on the ground right I mean you aren't always always on the ground okay and you just have you always be an ... or a extracted so you're looking you're basically looking out for the enemy looking out for things that you all the guys behind you or that they might encounter symbols and

like a a\nPleasurable experience at all but thank the world that people like you were down there and a ... hat off big time and it's also very interesting and I find it that is that what they about having to put you in uniform and the ... to me that\nWere you able to go and and and risk your white friends die the way you know the way you see it in the way you learn about it is is that you're lucky to get home\nAnd then when you get home you're going to put your uniform did that something that that horrendous\nAnd uh that that that was very disturbing hearing that has all you know we've heard about it over time that he wants to do you guys are probably well the Korean War that probably in the late eighties and the ...\nThe gym eighty six six eighty six Gemini and just you know I was a better a little bit more uh this is your learning right there you fix it\nThe Vietnam gentleman he probably sixty Seventy\nHours fact jumped sixty eight\nSixty eight sixty one so I just miss that\nBut it it seemed like politics all getting involved in the older we get we get to watch more and more and more and uh I think it really ever if you had to fight\nIt should be with no politics involved and it's just a clear mission to go in there and get it done and that's that can't worry about civilian civilian casualties what I see because move the walk of life that we've experienced is a tremendous and I'm sure you guys really\nAnd that but that from a perspective you like what they're ... like a very interesting conversation and thank you very much\nThanks for adding to appreciate that thank you what about ... civilians I'm In Vietnam are you guys had something a little bit different died you had civilians that you didn't know whether they were a lot of walking bombs are or what was going on there so I'm obviously you try to keep civilian casualties down right but uh you reality is\nThe the civilians were caught between um the north Vietnamese and the American troops and are done for vacation became a big problem and for the most part\nYou for your America's weren't cherry dating somebody um it would be commonplace for the north Vietnamese to come in like at night and take everything that they had to\nAll their ducks chickens pigs rice take whatever they had and use it to support the troops if they thought that they were collaborating than they were just a kill everybody ...\nWhat about in Korea where civilians ever an issue\nUh never never never run not just because they were yeah they'll probably back ah thirty forty miles okay that that's what they were so I hardly ever seen a\nCivilian around our way but we had we had a Korean service workers and we had him in the in our companies and he answered each company we had them probably had about probably about Fifteen of them\nIn the company of almost two hundred men and and that and they were good\nOr they have a good fight is and uh and and of course we use them when you have to speak to someone that spoke the language so that worked out there and when when when we went up on the heels many times on the ground pork chop them I lost my own company in less than a day and a half\nAnd uh there was\nThere was two companies that went up and\nOne one of the companies one of the offices and I met him about four years ago he wound and all the others got killed his nominee five to six officers in the company my company only officers get killed a\nWithin the first two or three hours\nYou know you go half of the people that I commend in and you go after the uh you go after the people are that are a communication with radios you and then of course the wet the medics name so we never war or anything that that state that will medics yeah yeah he hid from that you could\nGet your contract with civilians which was fairly them at the very very limited him very limited high five ... five hundred you're next on the air go ahead\nAnd go bury on Joe and good thank you um\nI just want to thank you guys for the services that are for me and my daughter ten years old I appreciate what you guys did the sacrifice you leave so my daughter in a live in a country where she doesn't need to\nKnow the things that go on and other worlds you know oh I Want to be a self Avon military Monday's I'm real excited about it um I Know my generation and uh those younger than me a very ignorant when it comes to history and it's a very important thing uh I like to read up on history\nEspecially military conflicts shapes the world\nAnd uh you know one thing leads to another world war two was the Korean War splitting up bar with Stalin the countries in there and let the Vietnam War as well um\nYeah I Do want to ask you go well first of all um I Believe the last declared war this country made was World War two and the difference between that police action was a congressional approval I think that's why it was considered police action enough\nAnd not a actual war because Congress didn't uh didn't approve of it\nI was never voted on the air and water and in either of these right you know probably for political reasons\nYeah yeah ... yeah they do and I imagine nowadays they don't have the guts to do anything ... boy um but yeah so it would be the president's office the uses executive branch to uh you know use the military as police action um but anyway ah how do you guys feel\nKnowing the conference you've been through and China always being in the background you know supplying weapons as a communist country after you know we gave them so much weapons and or at least program World War two you feel about Trump\nActually have the guts to confront the Chinese problem as far as uh you know the economical power they are and and holidays are controlled or the world or a commerce lately you\nKnow let me let me let me let the masks or running short on time but I'm too good questions there I think number one is that China was actually involved in both conflicts that you guys were they were able to China was right down to the heart of it but so so what do you think about that and the growing threat with China now\nUm everybody's looking at Russian collusion that China is what we should be watching riots right and what do you think about Trump on the stairs I sat with Jim and all of them\nI didn't vote for him and uh and well I Know he was in and I wasn't going that way and uh but once once he's done what he's done just to go to ... and not go into North Korea when no one else has done that he became a hero nobody else to do that\nAnd they asked other presidents before they went no part of that whatever the reason I have no idea why they done that so yeah I feel he's done the right thing thank God we got him because if someone is going to St our nation I was going to be him\nSo you've seen Trump now I get tough with Iran yes I've talked to all Chinese yeah and uh regardless of what you see how the press he he did have a a apparently a pretty strong meeting with today as well\nI don't know the protection of our um Internet and are are all of our\nMedia right I think is the first thing they can infiltrate our media they say now they're able to sway the elections by the advertising that they do and the amount of money that they have in the dumps into that so I think controlling that is probably the first order of business with them and once they get out of control in\nA actually a developing a relationship with a working relationship the NATO situation as a whole nother another deal and maybe Trump's right I don't know what\nOurs are the amount of money we have to put in as compared to other countries\nTo say first sucks stations for the twenty first street wide on the bill UPS and they don't do you do\n\nFor us\nBut first association\nThe names of

just move stuff along at doesn't that the public doesn't get you know see first hand you know whether they're\nDevelopment projects are there you know a different kinds of reforms that were working whether the city council it I'm just been ah we've just been plugging away\nSo what's up with that with ABC any new developments as we say less\nNo not really a I Know that you know the city has a pending motion to dismiss their their complaint and um I think ABC is due soon to\nRespond to that and I don't believe that's happened yet although I think that's half that will happen soon and uh so we'll wait that and but uh that's there'll be left in the court tens in the meantime you know we've been keeping an eye on what they've been going out on the streets and\nUm you know they've been picking up the trash and picking up the recycling and the recycling rejections to the number of 'em\nAre skeptical that they have rejected is gone way down and so or we're just ah you were making sure that I'm more spot checking them to make sure that um you know they are rejecting ah the receptor goals on a\n[noise] a on a legitimate basis and\nThat when they do reject them that they are I don't know wedding the homeowner know why they're being retracted though that's that's something that we've had to keep on on on top of them about animals continue to do that and if people think that they\nHave not been treated appropriately by ABC please let us now we haven't really been getting too many complaints in the last week but the last couple of weeks actually but but you know look at their issues just a\nYou know please the worst uh to that\nYeah I haven't seen 'em in my travels haven't seen them many if any a rejection stickers on on barrels at this point it seems as though that's level off pretty well [noise] yeah\nI think there's ... there's some I think the first day there were some there over nine hundred rejected in and its average you know\nHim and I I I think it's been in the ballpark of twenty or thirty a day now so where are they\nAll of this all all over the city you know probably more and more to than in most\nPlaces it looks like if there's a geographic concentration 'em and you know we've looked we've looked at some of the barrels are are folks have looked at some of the barrel isn't um you know there are probably some stuff in some of those barrels that that that ought not to be there and sometimes you know as I said they've rejected others that\nYou know the content only a little bit of something that's not on the list and so we're we're now we're insisting on a level of reasonable is that our think our residents and homeowners are I'm\nSo and it is an election year and um you know we've talked about this before and then and I know uh um the various candidates all coming up in this that and you're looking for your endorsement last time I spoke you weren't ready yet to endorse said or the Democrat nominee for governor Jay Gonzales have you made any decisions in that area at this point\nYou got I Would like someone else today Sharon right there I mean there's got to my phone is all I live here I Am so\nUm how convenient him [laughter] I Know making no announcements\nToday I mean obviously as a as a\nYou know I I Am a Democrat and so you know I Would presume to support a dumb or the Democratic nominee and [noise] um let's not to say that I Would agree with him on every and every matter and there are some you know some things that I agree that it's a\nYou know the current governor on some things I think he's done well some things I think that they need some improvement um but I'm\nI'm you know I'll I'll make that decision when it comes but you know I Am a Democrat so it's I mean people shouldn't be shocked that I didn't go walking with you know a number of other mayors to endorse the Republican governors um you know my\nIn my view is you know I have a party affiliation I also want to make sure that we're doing the best absolutely the best thing above all for this for the city and so you know way all those things together before I make my decision\nHis party affiliation more important than I'm endorsing the better candidate and the guy is getting better playing by the gal oh he's got a better plan for the city I mean Gonzales just down the taxes and then you know raising taxes on endowments were the colleges which would ultimately mean that New Bedford residents will be paying more for tuition or we\nLose money for a for we don't have a we don't have a college from one of the few sudden they're actually I'm at an earlier mom Massachusetts where you go to school but I Would actually\nI think I'd actually would would result in a benefit to the right to manage just looking out for the most parochial sense 'cause it's not you know if we if we if we have like two or three major universities in the middle of the city and you know I Would probably think differently about it but strictly from you know from um\nYou know a net benefit that direct financial benefit a prospect of a New Bedford will probably be a ... you would probably gained from Adam in Los but in answer to your more at your broader question um\nYeah I mean I it's the city's interests first and and I think there's some things that Governor Baker has done well and there are some things that that a concern me and especially especially as I see them through the prism of the ... of New Bedford zone interests um\nYou know there's there's um there are a number of things actually so give me give me\nBut of something then it's then it's kinda\nWell I mean I'll just throw this out your name him in New Bedford residence that's on a statewide board\nYou can actually I'm the only one I did because out of a statue and I have to Arizona or an economic cows wine but there is no there's nobody on the Massport asked development mass cultural council um\nYou you name um the Massey see I mean you can go down the list or I'm not aware of anybody um and those are the big boys it may be some obscure\nA state board of that has representation here um\nYou know the governor's transition team there was a single New Bedford resident on that and there were dozens and dozens of people on that um you know I've raised yeah and and when they did their state wide listening sessions at the beginning of their administration\nUm was uh they did them all over the state and they get again to dozens of them there wasn't a single one held in New Bedford I mean like it's in that that to me is\nIndefensible right um\nAnd understandable um so like\nYou know the lack of representation of New Bedford an administration is a concern that I've shared it with them at the public about it um and I and hasn't it hasn't changed so um that's why one of the things I I I often get accused of being\nYou know louder than most when it comes to advancing you know my cities and our regions interest and that's because you know I have to be I have to be more short of more aggressive in order to get the point across\nSo I mean that's just that's just one example and that's certainly a concern and it's something I've told him I said look if you get reelected and they probably will get reelected that um you know I Want I Want to see addressed and that just that there was just throw it as one example but that's not a trivial one\nHas Gonzalez aligned himself with anybody from the city them that might\nOr might have had many conversations with him um and stay why can't it's all come knocking for my endorsed share yeah and uh and so I'll continue to talk to him and um you know see we're we're that goes I Know him I knew him\nI actually didn't know him before I became mayor but I had a number of uh you know people that we knew and in in common and um and so but I've worked with him when he was with in the Patrick administration as the secretary of\nA administration and finance and um you know I've I have a lot of respect for him I think there's a capable guy and so uh so we'll we'll see\nUm yes any gift deal was on the program you had a press conference in town all throughout the area I guess I'm addressing this\nApparent decision by a Senator Warren to explore a run for the White House boy big surprise there right um well that's the ... yeah well that's a huge surprise I I was pulled over by that right why don't you\n[laughter] surprise there yeah so I was there um he makes a valid point that if this war in the middle of a term\nThree years into a term for you is a new atomic says you know what this is my opportunity this is my now this is you know I've got to do this yeah understand that but when somebody is running for a new term\nAnd the day after they get elected\nThey ... you know start the resumes and then hit the campaign trail and everything else I mean\nThat doesn't\nShow a whole lot of speck in my ... respect in my opinion to the to the voters in Massachusetts I mean we will be if she decides to run for president that kind of leaves us with one senator for at least the next two years\nAnd possibly puts in its into a situation where we are having a special election in a couple of years down the road yeah I mean she she make a decision one way or the other because this isn't in the middle of the term\nAnd I don't know I mean I just consider the the opposing are so I get that and I'm you know I think as a campaign you know saying that on the campaign is probably not something that you want to do I presume that she was asked that question somewhere and didn't want to come across as you know to call you on the issue 'cause that's what I mean she's\nShe's clearly interested in the than the job and you know there was a there was certainly the start of a groundswell of support for her even in the last presidential um races so\nYou know I I I I Would offer people that there is there's a sort of a countervailing view and that is you know if she's raising if she's might be the ... potential president of the United states um I Know that's not something that you get too excited about that but if she's\nI'm Joyce drill you're with Barbara Streisand [laughter] so Rosie O'Donnell [laughter] hang out and have lookouts in that you know find the Barbie [laughter] that I'd love to see that [laughter]\nUm\n... if she seen as a there's there's a you know as a legitimate presidential contender in some ways that actually you know raises or political profile as as senator right and so and that's because what\nYou know if they think that I don't know I mean if if another senator is a is um if she needs to get the support of some other Saturday for some particular bill\nAnd that senator knows that what was the Warren might become the president some day the ... yeah and I might need the president to be on board a west the things that I like to see get done then you know that uh she might just\nBe able to win over support that she was living a lie and they don't do so that's the thing I mean how many bills as she thought let me half of the fishing industry\nWell she's been support so I mean if you're asking me about her support for the fishing industry I think that's a little unfair to say she's done a ton of it is somewhat fair to say that she's done nothing for it I mean\nSo I mean she really on was a supporter of the buyout program endless was pushed that really hard um you know when they got ground fish industry really started to collapse after the\nAfter the institution of the catch share program and she did was she was certainly I'm involved the directly involved in the championing of of of um [noise] you know establishing a fund and also making sure that individual fishermen wish got something that was limited to bone on his particular\nAnd then on the monument issue I mean I think she agreed I mean I I went up a few recall I testified before the house on a on ... on monuments and um [noise] and the monument designation and\nYou know she I buy a spouse the view that has a monument designation should be\nShould be um decided through uh the Magnuson Stevens um act right the mechanisms that public you know that the mechanisms of vetting the public I'm hearing the stakeholder outrage the\nYou know the scientific I'm betting that takes place on Magnuson should take place with the the monuments because ah but\nTold away from a bright cabinet remember that and they'll ever seen\nIt haven't seen it in the early so I I'm ... this is the city's doing more street work now than it has been a long long time and that's because we've made a commitment the city council made it made a strong commitment to\nA with native to fund a through our capital improvement a program on one point six million dollars\nFor a port St repairs which are happening I'm all over and that's in addition to the money that we get from the state you know up until a few years ago we were putting nothing into that and now we're putting a substantial amount and we're also getting you know a fair amount of funding from\nSome funny I should say from all over state at a some funding from from every source to do a work on roadways to uh where where there's been a lot of patching over over the years so\nUh that's happening and then there's a bigger road projects like\nYou know cause all street and union street and uh the southern end of routine or you know well underway um\nAnd I've been really moving along and looking looking good looking better all the time and all three of them are getting\nOur you know well into the fourth quarter of their their projects or so you know those were the will be excited to see those things be pulled away the union street has got another they'll put another code of what's called binder on on on that\nStretch of construction in the spring after the chance to settle over the winter which is the proper way to do those kinds of projects that reduces cracking but that's that project is largely done now\nAnd same thing with ... and a next year the you know routine will be all done and you'll see the look a lot different than what a lot nicer cosmetically but you'll see that there are all\nYou know crossings and a number of places on division street and over on on ... and a couple of other so that's that's a that's really shaping up in in people can accept expect to see more of this as time goes for we've we've done\nI'm now is be true good planning an a commitment to this capital program they'll see the roads eventually start to to be a in a condition that you know people are entitled to it it's a few\nStreets gotten the condition there and because of their because of a lack of funding commitment over a period of time where we've we've now have a system in place that will get it back up to shape\nTakes a while to fill out the ... and ... people have very short um patients they they they want things done immediately and ah yeah so why aren't you know and I appreciate\nThe opportunity to talk about it because that's that that's exactly what it doesn't it's not something I'd once itself or an explanation of one's itself to sound bites but\nThe streets also on the flip side of the take a long time to to deteriorate but once in a ... it takes even longer to get them all back up to speed but we started where we're addressing it\nUm you know it's not just because people are talking about it's also because look you know I wasn't city I drive on the streets I see it too and and it's a it's important that we have street said that that um\nDo the job done and and you know what look appropriate [noise]\nSo um if you're Eighteen is going to be done about a year he said he'll be less than a year less than a year now can we all said and it seems that guy I mean it's going all the way down in the Clinton clearly right\nYeah yeah a ... and it'll look a lot better there'll be more aware of mental waiting and and um you know more trees it'll just it'll it'll be a lot less asphalt you know we got rid of the old I'm\nA cement to their street over passed down by the European Theater down by a by Ben rose and and so I think that was you know nobody was using that very few people were using that guy that got rid of an eyesore\nSo it's look in the way that it should be people should be able to drive in the city on on a main road like that and and have a look nice and inviting then why is one of the things that will ...\nWe're we're going to be focusing on the next you know over the next year is to to get all of a team from one Ninety five or from cause all street all the way down to go straight to look to to to be in better condition in a big part of it is nominally under the state's control the northern stretch of it but you know\nUh we need to make the whole thing look good regardless of who owns it and and if we have to step then we're probably will step and the tech tackle some of the state's maintenance load off\nAs the state's not really get into it enough or then so be it but a lot of people see that stretch a roadway and we want to 'em and residents and visitors to the city I like him and it should or should we reflect well on the city should be in a condition that people can say oh yeah it was placed takes care of itself\nSo that's the goal and the next year a lot of garbage you know accumulates in the wintertime actually I've been on the snow melts and ... so it does require work but that's that's something that we want to uh to to prioritize\nThe wrong in the dark and chaotic relationship
