would be of that they found a lot of things in the rubble it's not like that was the only thing that stood there what they found tens of thousands of item planted a lot of things\nNot gonna have to agree to disagree as they said well I don't buy that I think we're sick\nI just need evidence to go to go forward with something like that stuff\nOut there they pulled building seven how about the general William Rodriguez who is interviewed\nIn front of the commission that he's got like a dozen people have is back to the bombs go off in the basement and they don't even put his testimony in nine eleven commission\nBombs or or gas tanks as as a press bombs or bombs on gas lines\nWhy isn't his testimony in the he claims they bombed the last one twelve people have is back pulled out and

thank you good morning you're on the air can pet meant yes\nHow are you sir hey like listen to this one okay\nLadies and gentlemen boys and girls leading off for the Boston Red Sox second baseman ... that you\nKnow and obviously the the weak the weak link in that chain last night was was counselor for the night I mean he's I mean he's not the most dynamic player but he had a terrible night running the bases and I'm In at second base obviously the the a catastrophic throwing error\nHe should have that ball can yeah you know my opinion yeah\nSomething happens to some players renting cooks did not play anything like he played in the super bowl you play like a dummy in the super bowl you know ... was trying to do a little bit too much there\nAre I don't know when he was thinking you almost getting picked off as a pinch runner and then he almost over in third base getting picked up there and then he couldn't score on a sacrifice fly ... ... ... you know that's the least of the three\nOr transgressions there because you know if you're not fast enough you know fast enough but he you know he had a bad night you weren't ... second base\nWell you know I told you that last Saturday and then I say to that\nYou've got a taste added to put out there [laughter]\nYou know if you but I'm just saying I just think you need a a million and one ... to play second base to the level of of a professional game\nI don't know can I just think that uh it was one game and here's my philosophy on on that game last night if it took them eat teen innings to beat us three to two I don't think we've got too much to worry about\nWell but are you at all concerned the only scored two runs in Eighteen ... and in releasing some of our pitching staff to well we had we certainly had the rest advantage which may have been erased there may be an even thing now because you know the Dodgers had two days less rest going into the series\nAfter um they're actually able to rest in in in Milwaukee and the Dodgers played\nAnd certainly being at home wasn't advantage but does all that get a raised from the H inning game it went well into the morning\nYou know what's the biggest that they're not as far as I'm concerned what's that top for bad is over twenty eight\nYep [noise] yeah it's a concern I mean I I don't think you can hold those four down long though a long enough to lose her on a

great question I can hold their drawing in a more money and we have a situation in Pittsburgh a synagogue a there was a a an attack or eight people have been shot dead inside of sending a others have been molded but right now a ... report in their aid fatalities in the synagogue\nInside a oh in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it's a terrible terrible situation thanks for calling you are on the air high\n... high um well let's see first you want to know what my favorite for music and then I guess with the van Morrison they're more into the mystic\nCan a full force scale among my favorite um far as President Trump goes there's all kinds of intelligence some people are better than others and just talking and doing absolutely nothing where we're being misleading and we shouldn't enough of those politicians and just to have to be a door\nAnd uh actually can determine what a problem isn't a come up with several solutions and implement them so when the press with Mr Trump Morsi memorial like\nYes I mean the number of areas has solve things I was common sense that you know he's getting overlooked by the press because of his personality it's it's a shame\nYeah yes and he's a he's not going to be lying politician\nTrying to tease every identity groups out there he's he's going to say how you see that the vast majority of Americans see it that way as well okay and um [noise] it's hard for adding to the I I don't come conspiracy theories I call them\nUm I didn't even call conspiracy facts I called them a suspicion that are happening\nWe we've found out that you're getting into office for us to see how to listen to this the FBI the CIA\nAre and they've been we no wonder we are never coming to a solution is on any of the problem that is uh they've had if you look at\nYou were talking about oh you know nine eleven and their passport one of the terrorist things huh yeah here's where something has happened when Obama was an office that everyone should be wondering about um do you remember the uh\nFast and furious\nYes the the the giving the guns to the Mexican cartels to see what would happen to be a ...\nAnd all that and the FBI actually convince the Arizona a gun dealers to sell to that that drug trafficker traffickers in Mexico but they didn't trust the da da da\n... not quite sure weapons and so when people died especially the border guard carry something I Can't remember he died there were able to\nThat record the I'm done and\nThey had it so that is the Arizona gun dealer knew where that came from and so that's how the and got exposed to because a citizen or didn't trust the government and he had the record to that so then they're able to find out five hundred Mexicans were killed with with those weapons\nWell I I just want a whole different thing because the the the um the important but the federal government said that the reason hold on the federal government should the reason that they allowed for the sale of the guns was so that they could track the guns to see where they would go so you're saying that they they weren't planning on tracking anything in the private dealers did that\nThey they convince those either way how many of this has plenty of the name of the the gun dealer\nWas alone will lone wolf trading company okay\n... I'm I'm just you said in company okay was the name of\nThe of the gun dealers were salary but here's the important and we're supposed to keep track of that\nPlot because they did didn't trust the government we were able to find out he had killed five hundred Mexicans one border guard and in addition to this to other things happened after after with those guns those guns were used in Paris in one or two of those terrorist attacks where people were killed in Paris\nAnd remember the ... I never heard that ... yes that is true you can look it up high planting hemp Pamela Geller remember\nThe Pentagon where she was having the cartoons about Mohammed yup OK guys who showed up the guys who showed up to kill her two of them were killed I think and they found an FBI guy watching watching it but not doing anything about it was it was a local police\nWell so let's just put that in context hold on we'll do Don King hold on to those guns or came from from uh Arizona well I come from that trade deal I don't know maybe your rights but those two guys the Muslim Americans came\nFrom Arizona and was shot by a deputy that was waiting for trouble because it was a promise that they were going to be attacked for the contest so that's why the FBI was there too it's not like he was you know I'm a ...\nI mean I just want to put things in a context year\nOkay All right you can put into context let me ask you this here's a question how are these illegal guns done illegally by the way I'm how are they involved in Paris shooting how are they involved\nIn that that can be I I I don't even do to speak to it because I have no idea what you're talking about but I'm going to I'm going to learn ... where where did you get that information anyway\nOkay I'm no this is in over ... several years I just happened to hear it quickly once once or twice and then shut down in the media um look it up heavily gather if you're not into a compound search\nYeah and apparently going I'm I've had her on the show in the past I I understand okay All right\nYou can even somehow contact or find out where those what the serial numbers show but that was in that was I Can't remember it because it's in so many\nYears I I I'll be I'll be honest I mean I liked him but I'm going to tell you she's a little bit impulsive with information and it had to go back on a number of things so I'm not I'm and I never heard that from any other source of that's I'm not sure that that's the truth you know you know you know me I'm ... I'm a very slow to come to the conclusions on these kinds of things\nReally didn't talk to them the information I think ... can be OK\nWell why don't you do your own research on and if I had the chance I mean I'm a I Will send it to you got your email and that there will send you a look up each one and you can make your own conclusion", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "27"}
