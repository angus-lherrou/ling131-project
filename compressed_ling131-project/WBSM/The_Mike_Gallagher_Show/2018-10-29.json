I guess liberals are hard word to use because\nI think most but I Will say the hard left\nSo you get the heart laugh and then you've got to useful idiots so what's a useful idiots well useful lady to someone who doesn't have any sense of history or they don't read to pay any attention but the boy they love social media so they're out they're posting means and one of them means is being circulated is\nRegarding the\nShooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh these people survived the Holocaust and which I don't believe any did but they couldn't survive Donald Trump in other words Donald Trump is not see Donald Trump killed\nThat's what they're saying right when you say well they survive the Holocaust well the Holocaust wasn't intentional murder by the government of Jewish people and others to but but of Jews in this area right so you say well they these people are Jews\nAnd they survived the Holocaust and the Holocaust or the government orchestrated\nIndustrial killing machine of Jews right so that's your first thing I I Know I'm I ... I Know you feel like I'm taking you back to ... but this is where we're at\nThese people who are now dead Jews in in Pittsburgh based survive the Holocaust but they couldn't survive Donald Trump short order saying well\nThey're saying that the the Holocaust\nWhich was a industrial murder machine of the government of Germany these people were going to survive that\nBut they were not able to survive the Trump Trump the president of America therefore what they're saying is the government or is it is this was government sanctioned murder\nUnder Donald Trump or Jews\nKnow that that does a couple of things like well number one it diminishes the the the Holocaust totally diminishes the Holocaust\nTotally\nIt also equates the United states of America where the dictatorship of totalitarian Germany\nAnd the Donald Trump is like Hitler right he's the leader\nAnd this is a man who is the first elected president who has a son in law a daughter and children are all Jews\n\nSo you see what kind of have to be really stupid to believe that really really stupid you know like you're just not a smart person I'm Sorry you're not smart I ... I Hope I just explain to you why that thought process is wrong if you didn't get it I'm Sorry\nI Hope you'll go down in in ... and in turn your driver's license and I hope\nYou'll ask someone to become a pay because you clearly cannot handle your own finances I mean basic stuff you can't be trusted to buy a pack of gum that's how stupid you are\nAnd I say that a sadly I don't mean to insult you but I'm saying if that's what you believe you ... or you have a severe mental illness maybe you have a severe mental illness\nWhich I'm not making light of I'm not making light of the fact that you may be a ... have a very low IQ and I'm not making fun of the fact that you may have a severe mental illness both of those one one thing you might be able to do something about one I think you're stuck\n\nBut then there's the other group which is the people who are just doing this to cause problems\nRight they want to interfere they basically want to use misinformation to interfere in the mid term elections\nRight so they they they taking a horrible event by a guy who didn't like Trump this is the ... this is the shooting at the synagogue guy doesn't like Trump because Trump is too close to the Jews\nHe kills Jews day then say well must be Donald Trump's fall\nAnd why they're doing that why they why they vote because it won't interfere in the mid term elections the false information\nJust like the Russians she got a whole group of people out there in fact some of them could be Russian agents who are trying to use this to gin up ill will in this country\n\nIt's astonishing and it's astonishing\nFive oh eight nine and six zero hard to tell you what if you want to get on the air or speak to you if you have if you want to explain to me why I'm wrong\nI'm here five or eight nine and six zero five hundred taking on all comers take a quick break we'll be right back\nJourney to the you\nKnow this is lieutenant governor just in Fairfax so we have an important election on November the six Hampton Roads as an opportunity to elect the champion for our community Democrat Elaine Luria for Congress Elaine as a former navy commander mom in small business owner and\nGovernor north um and I are both supporting Elaine Luria because she's the partner we need in Congress to help create jobs and improve our schools and protect our civil rights vote for Democrats Elaine Luria for\nCongress I'm Elaine Larry and I approve of my friends\nWould you like to savor invest for your future saber invest the time and save for your children's education call Jose mouth is\nWould you like to savor invest for your future saber investigating retirement\nSaved for your children's education call Jose ... six seven eight three seven one type of advance financial group at seven twenty five state road in Westport mass as a financial consultant since Nineteen eighty nine I have experience in setting a poor when case IRAs and annuities for a variety of my clientele\nSecurities an advisory services offered through commonwealth financial network member any Estee s IPC a registered investment advisor\nThinking about weight loss surgery I'm document you in a surgeon with the steward weight control program insane in hospitals for many people they've tried diet and exercise to lose weight but just can't seem to keep it on today's surgical advances and help patients significantly improve their health and lose weight they often discontinue many of their medications\nFor diabetes high blood pressure or high cholesterol and best of all are able to enjoy more active\nLifestyle learn more about weight loss surgery by attending a free seminar with Dr ... in Germany or Fall River registered today by calling Bible eight six eight nine thirty nine forty more\n\nIt is a reminder that it's a season of as it gets colder it is the season of giving joined a button would park for operation food drop on Saturday November tens\nFrom ten AM to two PM now for the twenty six year will be collecting items to help you know the way of greater New Bedford stock area food pantries for the holidays your donation will\nBrought to you by NBC you pro group contracting and the great folks here at fourteen twenty W.

D. Salinger meant he should shoot John Lennon that guy is a different sort of mental illness then someone that has a functional depression right\nYeah okay so you recognize that there are some people who have mental illness that they they take stimuli simulation in from their environment\nAnd they are completely twisted right they think things aren't real right and then there are people who just have who people who have depression or other things like that and if they work medications and they like Ted Turner for instance who has bipolar but he's very functional right variant grades of mental illness do you agree with me on that right\nYeah okay right on the job I mean just finished my point and you can ask me anything and like I ... the flow of yours\nSo when I was saying is that if you believe\nThat Donald Trump here in America today is like Hitler\nThen you have then you have one of two things going for you or against you number one you have no sense of history and no sense of of what took place in the industrial killing machine was\nNazi Germany there's no comparison to that in in America today with Donald Trump or so you have no sense of history a person who believes that or the person has severe mental illness that's why they believe that Donald Trump is like Hitler that's what I was saying it wasn't meant to insult mentally ill people in any in any way and I don't believe it did the floor is yours\nBecause because All right then what kind of rent to own us with that person have\nThen that well I I think that they would be hallucinating they would be taking in stimulation and believing that they're witnessing something that's not what\nHe had to kill John let me because he read JD sound just catcher in the right here right or John Hinckley who shot Reagan yeah ironically doesn't show or something I ... it gets really funny is often or yeah yeah but yeah it takes is one eighty right look the guy with the pipe bombs\nRight right hazing idiot yeah he just I I think we're going to eventually find out what his full story I Know he's got an extensive criminal record seems to me that I when I look at people like that I go All right that guy's nuts\nIt's funny that the guy was extensive criminal record is is watching on to the law and order candidate you know it's it is a\nFinancial around delusional you yeah and and what he says so he sees so John Lennon\nChapman right get get a little bit of their fame Jodie Foster\n...
