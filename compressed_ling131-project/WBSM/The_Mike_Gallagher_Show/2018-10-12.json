I mean look if you watch the business channels maybe you watch them in the morning like I was on prepping for the show just to get a sense of what's going on in the economy\n[noise] UC now as you never saw before they were literally illegal where they can advertise for stock they can advertise for ... for exchange traded funds you can ever taken advertise for all kinds of it used to go do it for medals because medals were different uh you know under under cars or commodities are controlled differently you know it doesn't make a big\nDon't make a lot of sense to me to explain all but ... but all the stuff down to they can literally advertise for a particular stock that you can buy it um through crowdfunding\nType of enterprises so yeah he he well he played\nIt is it at least that we set up a a nonprofit than he could always play that Clinton game\nA liquid in cash and say oh well you know all of the Clinton Foundation is doing you know great works around the world and you're landing pages are all about sharing hills and taking care of people and building houses in Ninety percent of what was was a donated ... used to ... just manage\nThe Clinton Foundation had nothing to do with giving money to people or helping people out I mean maybe ten percent so at least it could have scammed it that way and it would have been legal\nIf well here's the interesting thing we bring up and thanks for the call my friend thank you very much at all is a great call um love to hear from my fellow free Tony ...\nOne of the things that's going on now with the marijuana industry that I've noticed and I don't think you could get away with if you do it in any other type of non profit but you'll see these non profit medical marijuana groups now I'm not saying all of them but I'm saying some of whom are doing this\nSo you have a very tightly controlled nonprofit which is not\nGoing to say it's not legal buddy doesn't that doesn't follow the guidelines of the Massachusetts attorney general\nDo you have to have a diverse bore you can't have a tightening can't be you and your wife or you and your business partner who control the nonprofit because a nonprofit he's using tax dollars right the ... they're not paying taxes on the money so therefore it is government money\nAnd it's treated accordingly you can't do that\nBut yet I'm seeing that I'm noticing these marijuana some of them not all of them some of them are very tightly controlled it which is not even in the spirit of how we do things here in common with but then the other thing\nIs the nonprofit he's renting it's real estate\nFrom the same people which is from the from from a corporation and the same people sitting on the corporate board\nOf the real estate come for controlling interest right the real estate company\nThat owns a real estate to the nonprofit as renting at the same people on the board of the nonprofit and so you have to say to yourself are they using taxpayers' dollars in the best interest of course or not\nFerris given them well folks like we're at the end of the hour if you're on hold and he likes to ... news I'd love to have you do that if you'd like to join us in

prosecute\nYou know it was someone who has experience in that world yes they say well you know I don't I mean I cover for this takes a lot of the organized crime stuff which is generally all the

six percent [noise]\nConviction rate and you know so the feds go down and they look around and then they say well let's take a pass on something you know yeah there's some there might be some something going wrong there but they've only got so many ... as you say that I as I point out that they've got a ton of resources that's true they do but they still have a finite amount of time they you know\nSo\nYou've got to decide what they what they want to go after and they try to do things that a or a slam dunk and be have a meaningful impact\n\nAnd when you prosecute a political person\nYou'd like to think that it creates a reminder to in the minds of people who are who are in public office are seeking public office that they better be on the up and up\nAnd as the also I Want
