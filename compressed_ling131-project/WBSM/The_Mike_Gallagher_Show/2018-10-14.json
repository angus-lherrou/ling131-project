call it gross stress reaction\nIt's been called shell shock wore neurosis and battled for today we call it post traumatic stress disorder and it affects one out of every five warriors returning from battle in Iraq and Afghanistan\nIs alerted that actually kills bacteria that are necessary that are foreign to your body and it gets rid of them\nSickness come from the inside out not the outside in so the best question is\nWhat's the best question hotter why\nStrengthen my immune system\nAnd the best answer is following natural law\nFollow natural law you'll have a hundred percent success\nIs normal you are programmed genetically\nTo be healthy that your body were repair that would generate that it will heal itself and the inside out sickness is abnormal\nWhy our animals healthier than we are thinking about that from it\nI mean think about this wire animals healthier there's an animal\nCalled a dung beetle\nIt lives in dung\nYou ever see one sneeze or you know catch a cold it doesn't happen\nAnd they live and dumb [laughter] animals in the wild and they all sneezing and they got cold you seem weapon their nose with the issues that cough syrup\nNo they're not sick\nThey live ... ruined with their genetic potential they live they they eat think move breeze\nThey do all those things can grew it with how they're designed\nWe're the only species that does not do that\nNow I Know you might say my dog is sick yeah 'cause you make your that you took it out of its environment is natural environment and you're making it live like you do\nIt moves like you to it probably thinks like you do write\nThe dog has taken on\nAn abnormal\nAnd that's why pets do get cancers they do get sick they do get problems and diseases in the wild they don't\nShow me show me in the wild unless it's because of pollution that we've put there and then they've gotten toxic because of that that's that's it so health requires listen health requires a healthy environment\nThe one that you live in\nWhich the main environment you live in is what your body your body is an environment it's an ecosystem so what's your body and your surroundings your body is an ecosystem it is an environment and listen to the environment of your body your body is not it's mostly\nIn human it's not human cells\nYourself listen most of the cells that are nearby are not human at all ten there's ten times more\nMicrobial cells\nThan human cells as ten times more cells that are\nNormal bacteria normal floor normal Flora\nIn your digestive tract it makes up your immune system\nWithout them we could not exist\nWe couldn't digests food properly we couldn't produce vitamins properly we couldn't fight off disease properly so in your in your you know goal\nOf a limited in bacteria and killing them and using empty antibacterial and ... and um antibiotics and so forth you're killing off the things that are keeping you alive\nYou understand nobody I Know and nobody explained that to drugs kill bacteria and they also killed what the good bacteria the ones that are in you to help you live and breathe and fight off disease and make your immune system work\nThey require\nSo when you take an antibiotic the antibiotic is not like oh there's a good bacteria no that's a bad one skill that would know that the ... the antibiotic kills what all of them well not all of them some of them survive and become resistant to antibiotics so next time if you take another one you didn't a stronger one she the mess we've gotten ourselves in\nOn track and thinking clearly and realizing that again I Can't say this enough you would design genetically and program for health wellness\nYour body's constantly repairing regenerating heal itself from the inside out so again health is normal\nIf you're not healthy if you're getting sick especially if it's getting sick a lot then something is interfering with that\nBecause you are designed to express health so again the questions we ask are so incredibly incredibly important\nHow do we boost our immune system how do we increase our resistance how do we remain healthy not unhealthy or sick but healthy\nAnd I've come up with the seven keys\nTo boost your immune function\nTo increasing your resistance and so before we start that there's got to be one understanding that we have just understand your cells never dysfunction\nWithout a stressor there's gotta be something stressing your system stressing yourselves\nOr else they'll produce health express health now that physical stress or could be physical\nEmotional mental chemical or spiritual so what happens is if you have a stressor and it could be something that's toxic to your body distressing it or it could be something that's missing you require\nWhen that happens if you leave it that way in other words if you have a stressor and you leave it there and it's not dealt with\nA symptom more signal will come breakdown will occur\nAnd that signal again guide allow signals and symptoms to come\nAnd then we have a choice we can cover them up with a drug\nI'm sure you don't believe that a lack of a drug is what causes symptoms right you don't have a runny nose from a lack of a decongestant right I mean or a stuffy nose ... you don't have a cough for lack of cough medicine right I mean I think about it\nThat's not the reason but what you're doing is trying to get rid of the symptom well what caused the symptom\nWow that's a different question now isn't it because we don't deal with what caused it we just covered up and maybe it\nGoes away but the costs still there was never dealt with right so\nWhat will happen eventually as you'll go into crisis\nAnd then your body goes into survival\nSo let's look at what can we do to not only prevent ourselves from getting sick but if we do get sick what do we do\nThe most powerful thing\nTo prevent an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure right so\nThe first wave doing that is with chiropractic care\nChiropractic care listen to this doctor round Perot amino he's an immuno geneticist he figures out how things affect your immune system\nHe found out that if someone who's been checked by chiropractor regularly for five or more years they have a two to four hundred percent greater immune response oh what does that too\nIf you ever greater immune response what does that mean if you come in contact with virus or bacteria or whatever cancer cells\nYour immune system is better off\nBetter opt equipped to fight them to kill them\nSo that you don't get symptoms that you don't get sick\nRight that's because it's healthier it's expressing better\nSo that makes sense so what does that have to do with ... well I'm going to bring a date to you just to give you an example of what how powerful\nChiropractic is now I Know you probably think it's for the cricket in the neck or a or you know twisting this\nBut let me just go to a little deeper for you\nIn Nineteen Eighteen\nI Know you've you know the red Sox won the world series that you write something very significant happened in Nineteen Eighteen [noise] it was called the St Louis flew\nTo St Louis flew a million people died in the United states thirty million people\nWorldwide\nAnd I have\nInformation from the records and the state of Iowa\nOut of all the people who got the St Louis flew in Iowa it's it's near St Louis in the mid west right of all the people one out of every Fifteen died\nWow so if Fifteen people got the flu you knew one person is like for classroom of children with Fifteen people in their\nOne out of Fifteen\nUnless you're under chiropractic care\nThe people who got the St Louis Louvre under chiropractor care it was one out of every sixteen hundred and thirty five\nOne out of Fifteen hundred medical care one out a hundred and sixteen hundred and thirty five\nHundred chiropractor care in fact\nThere's records that show there were two hundred and thirty three people that were sent home to die\nThe hospital said there's nothing else we can do go home say Alaska buys two hundred and thirty three\nThose people went to the chiropractor and only twenty five died\nOnly ten percent of them died\nNinety percent of the people who were sent home did I Lived\nSo did you realize that the St Louis flew was the savior to chiropractic\nBecause chiropractic started in Eighteen Ninety five and by Nineteen Eighteen [noise] it wasn't very well known a lot of people really didn't know too much about it and yet in Nineteen Eighteen when someone\nWhen you're breathing and the second hand smoke you don't have it spy kids get sick so often especially if their parents are smoking please don't do that to children but I Know you love them you just don't realize what you're doing\nSo please stop\nNumber three the third area\nWhich will boost your immune system is drinking clean water do you realize\nThat like three quarters of your body\nAlmost three quarters of your body is to water\nYou almost all water [laughter] [noise] so we we must drink plenty of clean water in order to detoxify herself because there will be toxins that come in they're just going outside there's there's\nToxins in the air if you can't totally avoid them so toxins can come in there's toxins on some of the food that we there's this so that our body can get toxic and\nSo we needed detoxify that by bringing more clean water in in fact\nWe shouldn't be really drinking about half of our body weight in ... of water per day so if you weigh a hundred and fifty pounds than Seventy five ounces of water is is about what you should drink\nYou know ... is the first outward sign of dehydration first so if you're thirsty um you're already beginning dehydration\nSo and you say well I'll be going to that yeah you should be going to the bathroom at once an hour\nClean and so you're bladder gets cleaned out to you know I mean we need to continue to detoxify ourselves throughout the day so again it's not that difficult I mean I I never drank enough water years ago either but now I have water with me all the time\nAnd it's not that difficult you don't have to drink a gallon it in the morning right it's about a Dixie Cup every half hour that's it that's not that hard is it you can do it\nThe fourth key to\nMaintain your health and wellness to boost your immune system so that you don't get sick is with your diet with food the food that you eat\nIt all comes down and really the bottom line is that we strive to get nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day organic if possible but nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day these things fruits and vegetables have phytochemicals and anti accidents\nIn the destroy free radicals richer precursors to disease cancer included\nAnd we make sure that we realize that our diet can bring in toxins into our body to which will decrease our immune system in our resistance including fried foods\nWhich are full of free radicals right dairy products\nMeet especially the chemical Laden drug induced hormone Laden meat that's on the ... in the supermarket if you're gonna eat meat isn't necessarily wrong with eating meat a little bit it's just that you need to get free range grass fed organic\nYou know non drugged up meat\nAnd there are places around the city\nYet that um access sugar\nIs a huge problem\nAnd as a and and there's so much evidence now that sugar decreases your immune system decreases your resistance processed food junk foods\nSo there's a lot of areas of toxins but again before you start eliminating those things ad in the fruits and vegetables ad in the clean water add in those things first\nAnd then watch what happens you won't have the desire for those other things if you start adding and the good things that's really the\nSecret the fifth the key is sleep\nHere's my secret you don't need sleep\n[laughter] I Know a few eyebrows went out no you don't necessarily need sleep per se what you need you need sleep to get around\nYou need ram now Rahm is rapid eye movement that's when your body is really supervising itself it's healing it's renewing itself at a very high level when you're getting ... it's not the ... wanted to you that you need it the quality of sleep in fact\nThe two most important things I could tell you about sleep is number one that had come in rhythm that you try to go to bed around the same time every night\nAnd that you try to get up around the same time every morning that it's consistent that's not during the week one thing and then the weekend another thing I think people are so tired at the beginning of the week\n'cause he totally screwed up the rhythm on the weekend so it's really better even if you nap during the day some time take a cat now a power nap\nThat you actually get up around the same time even on the weekend go to bed around the same time that's not going to\nTotally damage you if you're off one night you know or so but again the more consistent you are the better results that you get you're going to get so much more energy so much more immune response if you just get the right rhythm and then the second thing is getting the golden minutes\nThe most rent that's available during the day is time between ten PM and twelve midnight\nThat those are called that the golden minutes so if you're not utilizing the\nLike if you work the graveyard shift what's the graveyard shift if you work that shift over your career you'll get in the graveyard quicker [laughter] it's not a joke that's that's a fact you know ... in fact\nTen to Fifteen Years shorter lifespan for people who work that shift because they're not getting ram\nThey're they're totally interfering with the normal cycles right so again\nSleep is important to get around in the ram the way you're going to maximize that is getting better on the same time getting up around the same time rhythm and getting the golden minutes ten pm to twelve midnight ... other times but that's where you're going to maximize it\nSo boy we've gone through five keys already let's get right to the sixth one because we're really they're actually getting more and more important aren't they the next one is exercise\nYes get moving\nExercise is it's not only important to help you stay healthy it's a requirement for life movement is life movement is life lack of movement is called death right so in the wintertime you know we talk about the season right the seasons changing and a lot more people get sick in the wintertime true\nYeah less people get sick in the summer and most people think it's because of its colder in the winter not true\nThat's true you know why people move less in the winter\nIn the wintertime people move less they smuggle around the fireplace writer snuggle on the couch\nThey're not up and moving and outside and gardening like in in the summertime you get home you go out in the garden you do some gardening and mow the lawn or whatever you know\nDo do things outside\nIn in the winter you not doing that right in the winter you're cold so you cover up in ... with blanket less movement movement is so critical including\nFor your lymphatic system you know the [noise] the way your blood gets pumped through with with your heart rate your heart pump blood to all your body parts to supply nutrients and oxygen to them what about the waste the waste comes out and gets dumped into the lymphatic system\nWell there's no heart for that you know how it gets pushed out through muscle contraction\nSo if there's not enough muscle contraction and the toxins stay there and pollute you and make you become toxic and then sick\nThat makes sense so more movement equals what better lymphatic drainage and better taxing toxic elimination that's why people who jump on those trampolines that's an excellent I'm not talking about breaking your neck on their time or even just one of those many ones jumping drain slump back better\nIt's actually good for you so twenty minutes um is a start right we want to do is just get moving really that's one of the most important thing in the seventh key and the the final one for ... for this what we're talking about here is\nYour attitude and your stress levels attitude and stress it's a fact\nResearch backs this up the\nMore stress you have not dealt with properly the more sickness you have the more negativity\nThe more sickness the more pessimism the more sickness\nThat's been published and many many journals so\nWho decides\nAnd don't tell me it's your wife don't tell me your husband they don't you do\nDon't tell me your coworker oh your boss know when people say\nPerson's stresses me out no you allow them to stress you out let's take ownership I I have to do that for myself I have to take ownership I Do allow that sometimes but it's up to me it's not up to them\nRight because listen there's people\nIn office environments\nAnd there was a person that stress as people out but not everybody's stressed out by them some people just take it with a grain of salt and keep going the other day why 'cause they've decided to do that\nThat's all they that's all it did make a decision you can decide to be happy you can decide it'd be mad\nYou can decide to be angry\nIt all depends on what you prefer right there's people who have so much anger\nIn\n... springs so much joy to our lives they're loyal they're protective and smart smart as our pets might be the can't advocate for themselves especially in the event of a natural disaster\nHi I'm Shaun low\nLast year during Hurricane Harvey I saw the impact of natural disaster first hand\nMany family suffered the added heartbreak of being separated from their pets\nThat is why it's important your pet is part of your family's

political affiliation\nRight now you wanted to six you know she went under Nixon and I'm\nNot I'm not next and but I I'm sixty nine was helping me here I'm a Lyndon ... not Lyndon Johnson and Nixon was a six week some success writing to sixty eight he was sixty eight and he was elected since he was the one who's going to stop the Vietnam War that's all right yeah yeah luckily for reelection Seventy two and I'll tell you how they'll end it right that's what I was there was Nixon was sixty yeah so\nI and you weren't for how long you want to sixty nine how long we are and I was in for almost four years really has sixteen months from country to Nixon was still there were new act alright and then you add Jemma when it went over to Korea what yeah\nI went over there Nineteen uh that was Nineteen fifty three\nAnd a and uh I get home in Nineteen fifty four I spent Thirteen months in Korea I was overseas sixteen months I went to medical school and then a gene with Japan a for a month and it wasn't long enough\nSo it must have been amazing to both your gentleman I mean Korea never ended so still going on today but I mean so shortly after Korea we're already sending advisors in Vietnam and the late fifties Oh absolutely Kennedy was around fifty one\nGo to good Clearwater dot com that's good Clearwater dot com\nRichard show\nVoting twenty\nWeekend for twenty\nSo quite a difference though between ... even though the the the time span was very short between uh the conflict or the police action a Korean conflict in Vietnam quite a change I'm not only because all we all go I mean if\nYou think about it um by the time the war really kicks in and we're sending like fifty thousand troops are already Ninety sixty five he's right the marine corps go in there to guard the airport a pill you I mean at the ... and uh that was the biggest um assertion of troops at the time and then it escalated after that of course after the Tet Offensive [noise]\nYou know sixty eight than it was a big boost in uh in recruitment that time the ... come in and uh you know everybody was really really going for you you couldn't go into what she went on army airborne that would be in for three airborne or the marine corps that's all they were drafted at a time you don't have to English or anything else\nVery different a different different um um friends in ...\nSo is because of the Coley had now in Vietnam was always hot totally different the bodies would change in months but and but in Korea and the last years with a cold that was there he used to get really cool yeah yeah\nSo that's that was the difference that that they do get us in better shape and equipment is in better shape than it was in Vietnam\nSo George you are you in for four years the U.S\nUnder four years as I got extended twice they wanted me to take a year give me thirty days often send me back to Vietnam for another year or so we'll just leave me here they were looking for a team leaders and of course the one thing that hurt the Vietnam War as\nIf you were there for Thirteen months by the time you got enough experience right and we're heads up about what you needed to do especially an field operations you were heading back to the world and another guy was taking your play has really didn't have the experience\nAt all this constant rotation of troops there right cause people to make the same mistakes over\nAnd over and uh yeah and you didn't have that rotation uh well ... well they ... it wasn't there also and it happened with us also they have been somebody would get\nEnough enough information on what he had to do and when he was supposed to do and then then before you know what he was being rotated if he didn't get wounded or killed of course and uh yeah we have the same thing and the ... my brothers one in one now than when they when when they came out the water and that\nAnd and that's the way was with everybody so many people in the second World War when then when the war first started in Nineteen forty one and that's when it started and they were there some then until the war ended in Nineteen forty five\nAnd so those guys learn forever\nAnd ah and and if you're in the infantry and the chances of coming home was so slight somebody's going to get you eventually yeah\nSo the big difference for Vietnam from Korea as you guys had the choppers to date in ... and then they were huge they played a big role ever saw was critical\nEspecially for evacuations you know they had helicopters for evacuation but there were very crude in a in the amount of a rear area support that they had for those were basically uh in in distance so if your way up on the front of your medic station was in the rear even if you had a helicopter support it was usually from a medic station\nRight to a mash unit right or medical unit\nAnd those were a few and far between and Vietnam you'll probably you'll probably in the air\nWounded for oh probably about an hour or so if the weather was good because it was whether prohibitive to you know if the way I got a real low ceiling you couldn't be ... at that time I had a medic with me and he was good he was good as any surgeon that you see today\nAnybody do anything you know he's very capable so are most of the time we can keep people alive for long enough to get them back to some some super medical attention\nRight so the the conditions were very different for the two of you you guys had to keep your feet from falling off from frostbite and I knew were constantly sweating and fighting bugs and in swamps and in jungle a muscle yeah how how would that I mean I mean the\nWas a big issue you know you could only carry so much water and so you how to prepare your water in the field and that was always a\nKind of a sketchy situation getting water you know I carry four counties and I had a gallon living on my back but that's not a not near enough water not at a hundred degrees and a hundred percent humidity so that was like a big issue especially like with the Agent Orange\nAnd [noise] be fifty two bombings you know they create these big or creators of filling with water during the monsoon you see a lot of guys trying to fill a camp teams out of those you know there's no trace one on inside there are a lot of medical issues of course all the streams are a lot of streams of contaminated right I'm foliage\nAnd all kinds of stuff that can in their animals bought a Buffalo's right\nNorth Vietnamese soldiers you know everybody's uh\nAnd they're turning the stream there so\nRight absolutely so now Jim or in your situation where the weather's freezing yeah on you had to water it frees up on ya yeah\nOh yeah what uh but they say say fairly well 'cause your campaign has run against your body that stayed fairly well and we never had much trouble getting water outside of when we find on a on a battle and now they got to bring ammunition up how they got to bring water also and that was always a problem so there's times\n... times I can remember being a full day\nProbably not drinking and the water at all uh eating for ... and a half\nAnd and the worst of that that that like the like Joshua sand helicopters if we had him in Vietnam we gotta save after the guys that we lost\nWe've with most of the most everybody you're losing because they lost their blood so the first thing you've got to do is you got stopped the bleeding and that's the first thing you've got to do and they're going to go into shock on you and you're going to realize that\n[noise] so are you give them a shot him off again and ah and you have to stop the bleeding and they would be so deeply quickly for you know what that route and couldn't couldn't get a helicopter and that's because we was ah either shift but I'm off on a personal carry on this little further back would be a little jeep and then an ambulance\nWell when did that once they always had somebody else on there wasn't there but to get somebody back\nAlive was was really difficult and it wasn't really the greatest thing in a well\nIt's a but so you put a tourniquet on a leg and and they would say to me hey that tourniquets been on that link to long you're going to take that tourniquet on his own rules as like I said a bit of news is like in his life absolutely and I keep it down to ... to ... a tourniquet on it wouldn't take the ... during the cut off\nWe've got what there is such a special guest the Korean War veteran I'm a medic Jim ... have and also a Vietnam War a green number re uh George Brown now also from there have and then now we're we're celebrating the military military Monday military Monday segment ... by\nA first citizens federal credit union learn about the the benefits of the hero look out at the first citizens that dot org and we love to have have you guys call in and ask them questions\nOr because I Know after it's over you're going to say oh I Wish I had called in and asked this question so fight away not now six o five hundred I is the other number first of all I Want to thank you both for your service a gym you know how I feel about you or not and and all that you've done ah I'm In George thank\nYou for your service through and now it obviously um it it it it was a very difficult time to lose a lot of guys were heading north and a lot of guys like are we getting deferments the guys are the connections and the money and all that were you drafted or did you go into an era\nI'm I I was drafted in uh I went through the course of the ranger cue course in the Nineteen sixty nine and a Fort Benning Georgia um\nThere was [noise] you were going to you had a two year a draft so you'd go through a infantry a T go through a jumped school you'd be a already be moving towards Vietnam\nI'm In a unit when you've got to Vietnam and everybody when you go to Vietnam they'd go right down the line said you're in a hundred first airborne you're on the eighty second airborne you're in a hundred and Seventy third airborne\nAnd a lot of guys right from favor in high school where I went to high school I'm\nPeter Roy you went into the marine corps ... he was killed he was home in like six months that I'm David drowned he was a hundred and Seventy third airborne right he was home six seven months to\nA you know so this is all happening very very very quickly or when that while the drug but they needed people they need to put bodies in Arabic to fill those vacancies to keep the uh the patrols going you know I was I was pretty fortunate because the training and I had was exemplary I can never complain about the training saved my life\nSo is it everything and more you thought it was\nYou must have some expectations when you're on that plane had nobody that way and and it was ... when you got there and now you know you've been don't jumbled trained on a panel\nYeah it'll you know you were climate ... already yeah before you got there and I'm and like I say a lot of guys who just was shaking bakes you know they go through a basic training advanced infantry training jumped school and they were gone\nNow was that so the training was limited so you learn from your uh\nAnd CEOs once you got there you know and go to your specific mission and whatnot where they'd be climate ties are not just dumped him through there that I think that a tribute to a lot of the loss of life as well and I was a training the trading wasn't what he was still in spots there and it wasn't really what it was supposed to be for all the majority of the troops that went there\nSo I live and nothing prepares you for that first time Seventy start shooting at your house right I think that's what I mean you see a a spray those green tracer right it'll start to change your perspective on things yeah\nSo now you're out there and and you're moving around your mostly on on the ground right I mean you aren't always yeah always on the ground okay and you just notice I was being inserted or a

there and get it done and that's that can't worry about civilian civilian casualties from what I see because well the walk of life that we've experienced is a tremendous and I'm sure you guys\nReally understand that but that from a perspective you like what they're ... like a very interesting conversation and thank you very much\nNicer out into a frenzy over the Internet thank you what about ... civilians I'm In Vietnam are you guys had something a little bit different ... you had civilians that you didn't know whether they were of a walking bombs are or what was going on there so I'm obviously you try to keep civilian casualties down right but uh\nYou reality is the the civilians were caught between um the north Vietnamese and the American troops in the dumps vacation became a big problem and for the most part\nYou for your America's weren't cherry dating somebody um would be common place for the north Vietnamese to come in late at night take everything that they had to hold their\nDucks chickens pigs rice take whatever they had and use it to support the troops if they thought that they were collaborating than they were just a kill everybody ...\nWhat about in Korea where civilians ever an issue uh never never\nNever run not just because they were that they'll probably back ah thirty forty miles okay then that's when they were so I hardly ever seen a\nCivilian around our way but we had we had a Korean service workers and we had them in the in our companies and he answered each company we had them probably had about probably about Fifteen of 'em\nIn the company of almost two hundred men and and that they were good or they have a good fight us and uh and and of course we use them when you have to speak to someone that spoke the language so that worked out there\n'cause when when when we went up on the heels many times in ... shop you know I lost my own company in less than a day and a half and uh there was\nIt was two companies that went up and\nOne one of the companies one of the offices and I met him about four years ago he wound and all the others got killed his nominee five to six officers in the company my company only officers get killed a\nWithin the first two or three hours\nYou know you go half of the people that that I commend and and you go after the uh you go after the people are that are a communication with radios you and then of course the ... name so we never war or anything that that stated that we were medics hid from that you could\nPut your contract with civilians were ... like very very limited him very Lynn Barton high five ... five hundred year next on the air go ahead\nHey how's it going very well in general and good thank you um\nI just want to thank you guys for the services that are for me and my daughter ten years old I appreciate what you guys did sacrifice you leave so my daughter in a live in a country or she doesn't need to\nKnow the things that go on and on other worlds you know oh I think be a self Avon military Mondays are real excited about it um I Know my generation and uh those younger than me a very ignorant when it comes to history and it's a very important thing uh I like to read up on history\nEspecially military conflicts shapes\nThe world in a you know one thing leads to another world war two where the Korean War splitting up bar with Stalin the countries and there was the Vietnam War as well\nUm [noise] yeah I Do want to ask you go first of all um\nThe last declared war this country made was World War two and the difference between that and police action was a congressional approval I think that's why it was considered police action and uh and not the actual war because Congress than ah than approve of it\nYeah I was never voted on there and war and in either of these right you know probably for political reasons yeah yeah\nYeah they do and imagine nowadays they don't have the guts to do anything in Congress ... boy um but yeah so it would be the president's office uses executive branch to uh you know use the military as we ... um but anyway ah how do you guys feel\nKnowing the conflicts you've been through and China always being in the background you know supplying weapons as a communist country after you know we gave them so much weapons and or at least program World War two how do you feel about Trump\nActually have in the guts to confront the Chinese problem as far as uh you know the economical power they are and and holidays are controlled or the world or a commerce lately\nYou know let me let me let me let me ask you because we're running short on time but I'm too good questions there I think number one is that China was actually involved in both conflicts that you guys were they were so China was right down the heart of it but so so what do you think about that and the growing threat with China now\nUm everybody's looking at Russian collusion that China is what we should be watching riots right and what do you think about Trump on the stage with Jim and all of them\nI didn't vote for him and uh and well I Know he was and and I wasn't going that way and uh but once once he's done what he's done just to go to North Vietnam and not going to North Korea when no one else has done that he became a hero nobody else to do that\nAnd they asked other presidents before they went and opine about whatever the reason I have no idea why they done that so I feel he's done the right thing thank God we got him because if someone's going to straight on nation I was going to be him\nAbsolutely so what do you think you guys think about all of this whole do Russia right now [noise]\nHopefully we just we jumped off hopefully hopefully become more friendly with Russian hopefully at least at least get let's get them somewhat on our side for going against China you need another country yeah is that it wasn't Russia\nI don't know the protection of our um Internet and are all of our media right I think is the first thing they can infiltrate our media they say you know they're able to sway the elections by the advertising that they do and the amount of money that they have any dumped into that so\nI think controlling that is probably the first or a business with them and once they get out of control in\nA actually a developing a relationship with a working relationship the NATO\nFirst for the first one I don't uh

election year and um you know we've talked about this before and then and I know uh um the various candidates all coming up in this time you're looking for your endorsement last time I spoke to you you weren't ready yet to endorse said or the Democrat nominee for governor Jay Gonzales have you made any decisions in that area at this point\nAre you going out I Would like someone else today Sharon right here I mean there's got to vote as a lot so um how convenient him [laughter] I Know making no\nAnnouncements today I mean obviously as a as a\nYou know I I Am a Democrat and so you know I presume to support a dumb or the Democratic nominee and [noise] um let's not to say that I Would agree with him on every in every manner and there are some you know some things that I agree that it's a\nYou know the current governor on some things I think he's done well something so I think that they need some improvement um but I'm\nI'm you know I'll make that decision when it comes but you know I Am a Democrat so it's I mean people shouldn't be shocked that I didn't go walking with you know a number of other mayors to endorse a Republican governor it's um you know my\nIn my view is you know I have a party affiliation I also want to make sure that we're doing the best absolutely the best thing above all for this to the city and so you know way all those things together before I make my decision\nHis party affiliation more important than I'm endorsing the better candidate and the guy is getting better plane or the gal who's got a better plan for the city I mean God that was just

you know I Would probably think differently about it but strictly from you know from um\nYou know a net benefit ... direct financial benefit a prospect of a New Bedford will probably be a ... you would probably gained from Athens and loose but in answer to your more at your broader question um\nYeah I mean I it's the city's interests first and and I think there's some things that Governor Baker has done well and there's some things that that a concern me in a specially especially as I see them through the prism of this of new best for its own interests um\nYou know there's there's um there are a number of things actually\nSo give me give me an example of something that he's done it's kinda\nWell I mean I'll just throw this out your name him in New Bedford resident that's on a statewide board\nYou can actually I'm the only one I think because of the statue and I have to Arizona or an economic cows wind but there is no there's nobody on the Massport asked development mass cultural council um you you name the um the mass cc I mean you can go down the list\nOr I'm not aware of anybody um and those are the big boys it may be some obscure\nA state board of that has representation here um\nYou know the governor's transition team there was a single New Bedford resident on that and there were dozens and dozens of people on that um you know I've raised yeah and and when they did their state wide listening sessions at the beginning of their administration\nUm was ah they did them all over the state and they get again the dozens of them there wasn't a single one held in New Bedford I mean like it's in that that to me is\nIndefensible right um\nAnd understandable um so like you know the lack of representation of New Bedford an administration is a concern and I've shared it with them at the public about it um and I it hasn't it hasn't changed so um that's why one of the things I I I often get accused of being\nYou know louder than most when it comes to advancing you know my cities in our regions interest and that's because you know I have to be I have to be more assertive more aggressive in order to get the point across\nSo I mean that's just that's just one example and that's certainly a concern and it's something I've told him I said look if you get reelected and they probably will get reelected [noise] that um you know I Want I Want to see addressed and that just that there's ... there's one example but that's not a trivial one\nHas Gonzalez aligned himself with anybody from the city them that might or\nMight have had many conversations with him um and stay why can't it it's all come knocking for my endorsed share yeah and uh and so I'll continue to talk to him and and um you know see we're we're that goes I Know him I knew him\nI actually didn't know him before I became mayor but I Know a number of uh you know people that we knew and in in common and um and so but I've worked with him when he was with in the Patrick administration as the secretary of\nA administration and finance and um you know I've I have a lot of respect for him I think there's a capable guy and so uh so we'll we'll see\nUm yes any gift deal was on the program you had a press conference in town all throughout the area I guess I'm addressing this\nApparent decision by a Senator Warren to explore all run to the White House boy big surprise there right um well that's the ... yeah well that's a huge surprise I mean I was bowled over by that rival aren't you [laughter]\nSurprise there yeah so is there um\nHe makes a valid point that if this war in the middle of a term\nThree years into a term for you is a new atomic says you know what this is my opportunity this is my now this is you know I've got to do this yeah understand that but when somebody is running for a new term\nAnd the day after they get elected\nThey you know start the resumes and then hit the campaign trail and everything else I mean\nThat doesn't\nShow a whole lot of speck in my opinion respect in my opinion to the to the voters in Massachusetts I mean we will be if she decides to run for president that kind of leaves us with one senator for at least the next two years\nAnd possibly puts in its into a situation where we are having a special election in a couple of years down the road yeah I mean she can she make a decision one way or the other because this isn't in the middle of the term it's decided by now I\nMean I just consider the the opposing are so I get that and I'm you know I think as a campaign you know saying that on the campaign is probably not something that you want to do I presume that she was asked the question somewhere and didn't want to come across as you know to call you on the issue is that what she's\nShe's clearly interested in the in the job and you know there was a there was certainly the start of a groundswell of support for her even in the last um presidential um race so\nYou know I I I I Would offer people that there is there is a sort of a countervailing view and that is you know if she's raising if she's might be the ... potential president of the United states um I Know that's not something that you get too excited about that but if she's\nI'm going to Australia with Barbara Streisand [laughter] so Rosie O'Donnell [laughter] hang out and have no doubts in that you know on the Barbie [laughter] that I Love to see that [laughter] um\n... if she's seen as a there's there's a you know as a legitimate presidential contender in some ways that actually you know raise her political profile as as senator right and so and that's because what\nYou know if they think that I don't know I mean if it's another senator is a is um if she needs to get the support of some other Saturday for some particular bill\nAnd that senator knows that what was the Warren might become the president some day the ... uh and I might need the president to be on board um with the things that I like to see that done then you know that uh she might just be able to win over support that she was\nLiving a lie and they don't do so that's the thing I mean how many bills as she filed on behalf of the fishing industry [noise]\nShe's been support so I mean if you're asking\nMe about her support for the fishing industry I think it's a little unfair to say she's done a ... inside of it is somewhat fair to say that she's done nothing for I mean\nSo I mean she really on was a supporter of the buyout program and was was pushed that really hard um you know when they got ground fish industry really started to collapse after the\nAfter the institution of the catch share program in ... there was that she was certainly I'm involved the directly involved in the championing of of of um [noise] you know establishing a fund and also making sure that individual fishermen which got something in which wasn't a vigil Boehner's particular\nAnd then on the monument issue I mean I think she agreed I mean I I went up a few recall I testified before the house on 'em up on ... on monuments and um and the monument designation and\nYou know she I buy a spouse the view that the monument designation should be should be um decided through uh\nYou know the scientific research I'm sending a text placed on marriage so she took place was the the monuments because uh but\nYou know as it happened what the Obama administration I Know that didn't happen there was no process there and I was my biggest complaint she said no I'm In publicly that yeah it should have to ... which is something that a lot of other Democrats will\nTowed away from a bright cabinet remember that and they'll ever seen a\nSenior citizen recently um ... this is the city's doing more street work now than it has been a long long time and that's because we've made a commitment the city council made a made a strong commitment to a with native to fund a through our capital improvements a program on one point six million dollars\nFor a port St repairs which are happening I'm all over and that's an addition to the money that we get from the state you know up until a few years ago we were putting nothing into that and now we're putting a substantial amount and we're also getting you know a fair amount of funding from\nSome financial sit for an overstated some funding from from every source to do or work on roadways to uh where where there's been a lot of patching over over the years so uh that's happening and then there's a bigger road projects like\nYou know cause all street and union street and uh the southern end of routine or you know well one\nEighty um and I've been really moving along and looking looking good looking better all the time and all three of them are getting\nOur you know well into the fourth quarter of their their projects or so you know those were the will be excited to see those things be pulled away that union street has got another they'll put another code of what's called binder on on on that\nStretch of construction in the spring after attend a chance to settle over the winter which is the proper way to do those kinds of projects so that would have that reduces cracking but that's that project is largely done now\nAnd same thing with ... and the next year the you know we're really team will be all done and you'll see they'll look a lot different look a lot nicer cosmetically but you'll see that there are all the you know crossings and a number of places on division street and over on on rather than a couple of others so\nThat's that's a that's really shaping up in in people can expect expect to see more of this as time goes for we've we've done\nI'm now is be true good planning an a commitment to this capital program they'll see the roads eventually start to to be a in a condition that you know people are entitled to it it's a new\nTo the streets gotten the condition they're in because of that because of a lack of funding commitment over a period of time where we've we've now have a system in place that will get it back up into shape\nTakes a while to fill all these bottles and re pastries any people people have very short um patients they they they they want things done immediately and ah yeah so that's why you know and I appreciate\nThe opportunity to talk about it because that's that that's exactly what it is and it's not something that once itself an explanation of lends itself to sound bites but\nThe streets also on the flip side of take a long time to to deteriorate but once they're ... takes even longer to get them all back up to speed but we started where we're addressing it\nUm you know it's not just because people are talking about is also because look you know I wasn't a city I drive on the streets I see a two and and it's a it's important that we have street said that that um do the job and and and you know what look appropriate [noise]\nSo um you say you're Eighteen is going to be done about a year you said there'll be less than a year less than a you know we all said and it seems that guy I mean it's going all the way down in the Clinton road ... yeah yeah uh in\nIt'll look a lot better there'll be more ornamental waiting and and um you know more trees it'll just it'll it'll be a lot less asphalt you know we got rid of the old I'm\nA cement to their screen overpass down by the European Theater down by a by Ben rose and and so I think that was you know nobody was using that very few people were using that guy that got rid of an eyesore\nSo it's looking the way that it should I mean people should be able to drive in the city on on a main road like that and and have a look nice and inviting there's a lot is one of the things that will ... we're we're going to be focusing on the next you know over the next year as to\nTo get all of a team from one Ninety five from cause all street all the way down to go straight to look to to to be in better condition in a big part of it is nominally under the state's control the northern stretch of it but you know\nWe need to make the whole thing look good regardless of who owns in and and if we have to step then we're probably will step in the tech tech or some other states maintenance load off\nHis state's not really get into it enough or then so be it but a lot of people see that stretch a roadway and we want to 'em and residents and visitors to the city and I can and should or should reflect well on the city should be in a condition that people can say oh yeah\nScared of it so [noise] so that's the goal and the next year a lot of garbage you know too much in the wintertime there's you know the snow melts and ... so it does require work but that's not something that we want to uh to to prioritize Mm\nThe world can be dark and chaotic
