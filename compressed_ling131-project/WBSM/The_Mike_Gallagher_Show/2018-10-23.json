J. Simpson's and things like that so today we're going to slow it down quiet down a little bit and have a deep discussion about foreign policy before we do that we'll let the candle it's just a you know to talk of a little bit about themselves introduce themselves to the audience and I'm\nTrying to give us a a a world view here a little bit now\nTo do is can we happen to the point you have we were having a flip the coin you um who I have a coin it's a bitcoin but I have a coin a challenger ... heads or tails or do you want to give it to heads or tails for\n\nIts heads heads to start to finish the job I think we have a\nI had mentioned to about you know what he's done in Yemen drawing a sin he's not been trustworthy with us ah and he's clearly a feels he with impunity he can take these actions that's no ally for us and so when we're looking at this issue\nWho is truly our ally uh I've question and had hearings are about the Saudis because they said they were going to take these textbooks or that they're educating children with in terms of extremist activity and move it away or they're not doing it and I'm holding their feet to the fire and the whole defeated the fire on this to\nSend your congressman or the chowder Peter to ... your your answer on that short and\nSo again to our morality cannot be for sale no no doubt about it and I think one of his you're gonna find during this time together here is you know the issue of a foreign policy foreign affairs and and doing the right thing it's not a Republican or a democratic issue is not a Republican is just an American issue\nI think there's probably a lot of common grounds um uh my question is um I don't want to be short sighted about how we react we should not react to situations like this we need to respond and what that means is looking at the longer view and understanding\nOf the things that we do we do the actions were taking going to allow us to positively intellect influence and exert pressure\nUh pull those levers if you will to get these countries to behave the way we think is a responsible inappropriate and when it comes to the Saudis a couple of things um look the middle east is very unstable it's been that way for a long time\nOr we need to do everything we can to ensure it stable because nearly half the free world oil flows through the middle east the straits of Hormuz more more specifically\nUm and so we need to do everything we can um however I don't think any options are off the table relative to um exerting pressure or to get the Saudis to ah to be here\nIt's okay to this point general what will take a break a ... a crafts commercial break a hip profit a profit making enterprise but we'll be right back folks you're listening to Peter to ski\nAnd cars and bill Keating both candidates are here in our area for Congress and we're discussing foreign policy when we get back folks when discussed China will stick around here uh fourteen twenty W.

China's incursion into Latin America South America and their investments that they've made there and the diplomatic relations with Taiwan your thoughts are\nAt this is really important issue it's one that uh as ranking member on my subcommittee were involved with directly that it's just not a in our hemisphere but around the world but in our ... atmosphere for instance\nAh they built a massive hydroelectric plant in Ecuador that is thirty five percent of the country's energy that comes from that uh two nuclear plants and Argentina a\nHundred and fifty to a mile long motor way in Colombia and a connecting port in Brazil or it it has twenty three percent stake in Brazil's third largest energy for him so these are things that I haven't committee is just the ones that are noted just in our hemisphere but\nTwo things number one they're getting a footprint here I was talking to the president of of all places Costa Rica you wouldn't think and it and by chance I said is China there and he started telling me everything that's going on [noise]\nSo it's not only their presence but the way they're doing it that's important they'll go into these countries and they're short changing the way that approvals that down and everything and they have agreements with balloon payments so what happens is\nThey set these countries in giving him a deal they can't get anywhere else uh comics them local employment which they Renee gone every time\nBut then they had them this great indebtedness put into place in these countries now they have a stranglehold over the economy in those countries that serious stuff\nWhat I've done um a ritual co sponsor of the build act that's now law\nAnd what we're doing is making it easier for the United states to compete with China in these countries we just can't stop this from happening but what we can do is compete against them and be successful in doing it that's the approach and that's one of my priorities are in Congress is to do that because China represents a great threat to us economically\nUh and it'll affect our national security as a result\nI'm ... continuing here with China because they are so it was both a gentleman who point out so so important in a in such a challenge\nTo us Carson Keating we have a established better relationships with Vietnam I ... I ... ... I was shocked when other top ministers and gave them I Believe a coast guard cutter a coast guard ship recently to Vietnam and we're now building a strong relationship with Vietnam in with the idea that we can ... check\nThe Chinese to some degree or built key ports over there what are your thoughts on relations with Vietnam\nThe critical because a Vietnam is suffering from a Chinese incursions both economically and what they're doing a security rise there they're dancing or you know in the south China Sea where there is really landed dispute and I don't think it's in dispute with the aggressiveness of China's coming in\nAt taking away a Vietnam a land in property and\nA an ocean area so this is real or how do we attacked us the best way but we do it or by having a strong coalition in the Pacific and militarily or something that I think it's been under cut a little bit during these North Korea or negotiations are the strength of Japan and\nThe U.S and South Korea and particularly also do it economically and Vietnam is a key piece in that\nAre in trade which again is part of my a subcommittee it's important to develop these partnerships or to to really counter

the most important issues if you think about it we have monuments all over the city to people who because of foreign policy decisions good or bad\nNever came home so that's why it really is so so important now focusing back a little bit on our hemisphere Venezuela Venezuela has plunged into a socialist nightmare\nOne of the they have incredible natural resources yet they can't feed their people\nThe problems in Venezuela\nA are causing incredible migration problems in Brazil and in Colombia Colombia being one of our our best allies soon to be joining NATO So the impact on stabilized countries and we know the problems with the Columbia Title VII of it is now stabilized relatively\nUm it's having an influx of any foreign population in your country is destabilizing I Believe this question goes to um\nPeter I believe this question goes to you to start 'em by messed up I'm Sorry I'm Venezuela your thoughts on Venezuela what can we do about Venezuela and their border with Columbia so he said oh I'm Sorry that's okay\nThat's okay so we we've ah we've not had a very good working relationship or Venezuela for for quite a while and um they have great natural oil reserves um natural gas 'em and things like that but I'm a I think part of the ... where we have to do is\nWhen we see I'm there to be a possibility for there to be um\nI'm an unstable situation in our hemisphere um we certainly look at it globally too and we need to figure out what we can do to help influence that I'm a it's the right thing to do um but be um if you want to be selfish about it um what are we going to do to make it so that people are willing to stay um\nWhere they live as opposed to looking to escape perhaps into this country or others um that that's not good for anybody I'm so I'm you know I think\nBut each other um and also relative to Columbia look I'm you know ah I I think is a is a a friend of ours I think we need to make sure that we're I'm doing the right thing to help protect them ... were the right in the border as well and so we certainly ought to them\nAnd um you know but I think it's it's good for the United states as leader of the free world to engage ourselves to help stabilize um countries particularly ones are in our atmosphere\nTook you a few cars and Keating ... the ... D stabilization of as will the and the migration is causing in the deep state was actually in that area to you sir\nThat's one of the most important or Florida or fears issue we have right now and it's right here in our hemisphere and we don't pay enough attention to it frankly uh the scope of this is enormous uh because of the collapse of the economy and what's happening in Venezuela he was like twenty three million people over the last few years that have just\nMigrated out of their our last several years and it's really come to a head to and and a couple of places one you mentioned as Brazil that northern state in ... Brazil I think it's a a I'm not sure the pronunciation but so\nI won't know that doesn't mean the northern state in Brazil are going to pass and and uh\nThe influx there's incredible it's resulted in actual altercations over the last couple of months that you know stick fights out in the street with the the problems that are are they are the refugee camps everything that's occurring as created enormous problems are in Brazil over fifty thousand people came there and just in in a year's period\nBut in Columbia it's even more pronounced where if you see the films at the same on a a bowl of are rich you just see miles of people waiting to get over four hundred and forty thousand people have hit there just sit in about a year period\nJust crushing Columbia which is a NATO country an ally of ours uh we had a recently in August but nine million dollars of us aid to Columbia\nUh and we have a great relationship with Colombia it was the modeling is the model for us working together plan Colombia was a success it resulted in drug interdiction a result in in a stable a country that we had been civil war for decades and it resulted in economics we're their number one trading partner now\nThat's what we have to do in this area it's not just military issue for us but it's in Portland we have to invest more trade more seek out those relationships ... allies like Bolivia help countries like Brazil deal with this and hope for some stability in Venezuela where they can ...\nHumanitarian issue is just extraordinary children dying on the streets because they can't get food and medical care take your cars from Keating a this question to you [noise]\nSpeaking of keeping people in their countries are trying to keep their country's reasonable so that people will stay there we're seeing this they're calling a caravan of ... folks coming up from Central America are there are different motivations probably with each one of those people are\nBut how do we keep countries such as Honduras El Salvador Guatemala those countries how do we stabilize them what can we do to prevent if we want to prevent which is another question that this these might just this migration of population ... into our country and to Mexico to get into destabilizing effects question to you Carson\nWell there's not a question if we should uh we have to uh one of the uh areas and then I'm the ranking member of is dealing with terrorism and homeland security I'm also in the counterterrorism a committee as well\nA these are incubator for terrorist activity and unrest not the type that we are thinking of necessarily but I'm the type that will be prone to uh their own type of a a incubation ah and that's what's occurring here right in our hemisphere\nSo what we have to do is key in on what's happening in those cuts\nUh and you know we we talked about Colombia\nOr what we did there which is a great model for what we can do as a country or we can uh worked stop the introduction of drugs are and it's starting point\nA and the other thing that I've worked with two ah we'd legislation uh that's that's move forward is a you know an agreement on terrorist actions where we share information with other countries so uh I've been very involved in that aspect but it's ... these are ... I'm not saying it's there yet\nBut they'll create great instability and we've talked about the Russians and the Chinese how they've invested in those areas\nAre it's in our self interest to move forward on this it's our self interest have trade or an economic activity and agreements with these countries right in our own hemisphere before things get worse\nThan your heart's king a ... to you a message to ... just to to reiterate the caravan of migrants coming up from Honduras Guatemala El Salvador other countries in that region coming up to the United states to flee just in in many cases anyway to flee the instability on what can we do to help that part of the world so that people stay there\nSure well I think I think we need to look at a smart investment um exerting our influence financial and otherwise in those areas or to give people a reason to stay there\nAs opposed to coming here and and by the way you know I think we need to also invest in technology things like there's a program out there called ... biometric identification a transitional migration alert program\nWhich basically I'm Will help us to identify the the the bad actors if they try to get into this country um but that's encroached we need to do is we need to secure our border\nUm and that's just the fact we owe that number one responsibility to folks we elect to represent us keep us safe so we need to do we need to do the right thing to the main thing we need to protect protect our border and we need to make sure that uh um you know are not just anyone can flow into this country [noise] I'm\n\nJust ... sorry for ... I Know it's just so one of the things that we have here are\nGoing on is of course the Brexit vote right so so you have pulled out of Europe and there are discussions now about whether or not we do a separate trade agreement with the United kingdom or does that make sense out of the states what are your thoughts on trade ... doing a trade agreement directly with the u._k. well\nFirst of all when it comes to breakfast um I think that uh some of our elected officials jumped on the bandwagon almost promoting it right out of the gates and you know whether it's our relations we had with Margaret Thatcher under Reagan Tony Blair I'm with Bush I'm a I think look we need to let them\nAppropriate to put us soldiers in harm's way put them on the battlefield directive in dekalb\nWell number one responsibility of our elected officials to keep a say so I Would have to say Christmas when a U.S interests are us sovereignty and our our sovereignty and our uh\nOur country are are are threatened um where harm could come to the to the country and to the people this country um more broader than that also um that may include areas where we think that uh having stability in an era region something like the middle east on of course we're seeing today I'm is of vital importance to this to this country and to our allies\nUm but uh uh but the other thing I'd want to touch on us which equally are more important to me is\nHow we treat our veterans when they come home and we are not doing nearly enough to support our veterans when they come home after putting their lives on the line to support our country each and every day so I'm I'm very focused on that as well so it's when we have to plan but make make sure we're taking very good care of them when they get\nBack to ... cars in ...\nWell I think Congress should adopt an authorization to use military force we should be responsible or people are walking away from that and that is Congress's role and and I strongly believe that's the case and I believe in as\nA family that was a gold star family and my grandmother was the goal Scott mother uh I Know that my dad was a veterans aging for over three decades and I grew up in our

too short but but um I think you've got a lot of information there today and again could leave we could always ask a different question we could have always\nA plug a little harder but I think we got

have a comment on the debate you have a candidate you liked maybe you got swayed one way or the other or you still have a major mine up I'd love to hear about that river voting has started it started

Keating and for that uh the best way to deal with the uh bought a trouble is is to ah create stability in the central and South American countries that correct\n[noise] yeah I think that was I think it was it was important to both of the candidate answers actually\nOkay and the regards to Saudi Arabia what Wisconsin's ...\nBut he has his position there's we we can we can condone this ah or allow this to continue and we've got to take our relationship with them or a deep examination of a relationship with them\nWell sounds to me like that would be put in a relationship and jet engine our relationship with them in jeopardy potentially and if that's the case\nThen he is advocating for instability in a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the lunch stability in the middle east\nWe use them to a facilitate Palestinian Israeli negotiations will use them to keep Iran in check\nAnd we use them to fight terrorism in the middle east and we impinge on our relationship with them that's gonna create instability [noise] so it seems to me is to go to a matter of costs like ... one that shoots him on the one that doesn't\nWell that's that's an interesting point I appreciate that thank you thanks thanks for the call uh I Do appreciate that I'm you know my view of of of the world is that everyone gets treated differently according to different circumstances according to different periods of time you know I'm also by the way I just want to mention one thing\nTo do who to who caught and wondering wondering what happened we ran out of time before we get the the folks to do closing statements I'm so that was on me\nThat's why you didn't get closing statements at the end which normally you get in debates because we were having such a ... a wide ranging discussion and you know touring a world that um\nIt's easy to to start things that sometimes it's hard to finish them you know on the dime right on on on the top of the hour but we were able to get I think through every

world and I truly hope that um he will be our next congressman in the ninth congressional district\nI appreciate your comment told me ... ... what was it was anything specific that jumped out about his answers that you liked\nUm I think one of the things that we kind of forget here is that you know our relationship with our foreign allies seem to be waning a little bit and I kind of like the fact that missing that he actually was able to bring up not with what was going on with breakfast but actually the relationships in the past with you know\nPresident Bush with a prime minister Tony Blair on Mr Reagan and Margaret Thatcher\nThat just stare at me and I thought you know it's always important that kind of know what it currently going on but also I'm understanding our the history of 'em are foreign relation\nTo kind of have a concept of a grasp of history is amazingly important right if you don't have to and that's why we we do that here and I do I do appreciate you pointing out how civil they were both going to get a wonderful job in in actually discussing important issues and it didn't it stayed at a very high level and I appreciate you appreciating this\nYes I I again I

actually about foreign policy rather than you know the name calling ...\nYou know Hillary Clinton or whatever so again I thought it was a very well done and again I thought Mr could ask you a ... he's that's about\nWhat ah what do you think of a moderate though he's pretty good looking huh [laughter]\nI have a good day [laughter] but\nUm\nYeah look I look I thought if we get out of every debate like that wouldn't that be great you know I'm again I saw both the Joe and really a did a very good job protecting their ideas and as\nThe ... with a woman who just said um\nWe didn't get into the garbage in the back and forth I wouldn't have put up with that but I didn't suspect that for either one of them are both accomplished people in their own right um\nThey're both going to live here in
