enough times today really\nExactly exactly you know we have a good fit our kids when they're six months so we want the best for them we take care of them at school and and and this one year just one day yeah you gotta take care of them like yeah\nYou really do and it's incumbent upon the adults to do it because the kids I mean you know they were excited to see act as the friends got a new class and they see different across the street state there you know yeah you know you can see you can I can picture in my mind it's not\nYeah because there's nothing to do with their parents are not talking

one of these things have you don't have a reason to be on the road please don't be um you can help it but the thing is we're ... most of us a commuter time when the kids are out there so you really have no ...\nYou know you have to call you know you have a car so people just have to be so just be careful right\nOr even a you know if you go from some of the sun down that that could be fine uh but uh it just seems to be the uh the idea that oh this is a fixed they it it it really isn't but you're not going to see any government intervention is just going to have to come from the people\nYou know it's a cultural shift right\nYeah yeah the cultural shift can be promoted and maybe I'm In the city for next year we'll all celebrated on the last Saturday in October and that would be a good thing take\nTake Tom ... thanks thanks for the call now what do you think of that is it time to move it from\nThe thirty first one we seemed like we moved everything else um every holiday is now a Monday which makes sense in most cases um\nDoes it makes it look I I often think they ought to move the super bowl to the set to Saturday to a Saturday Night never make sense to me up Super Bowl Sunday when most people go to work on Monday\nNow people who know I've had a weekend scheduled before as an adult you know working weekends a couple of different places a couple different times to do it hadn't Monday's off\nMonday off for years to so Superbowl worked out for me\nBut most people don't most people have Sundays off um so it makes sense to me\nWould it make sense to move Halloween to a snow last Saturday in October I think for for two reasons top safety is a big one but also just convenience\nConvenience for the kids the parents everyone says there's obviously some people who anytime you move something some people may be inconvenienced but [noise] um\nAnd it may be the parents who go wait a second\nI Want to go out in the last sadly of ... of October because that's a my night out to ... I get to dress up like a kid a lot of people a lot of adult I'm not one of these people I'm not one of these adults who celebrate Halloween [noise] other than to give out candy to kids\n\nBut there's a lot of your particularly you know people in their twenties and thirties forties and fifties or who get dressed up and they go to parties and and you know and and they have a have a blast\nSo maybe the maybe the parents out there who are going to wait a second my kid can have the thirty first I get to Saturday anyway let's go out to the phones station rolling hill I'm do via some\nHappy Halloween Chris happy Halloween\n[laughter] when we're talking about the egg thrown in reminded me of a story that I'm fairly nice I used to work for a convenience store off\nAnd they\nTold us one whatever day the hollowing head falling not to sell eggs to the\nKids mhm okay normally you know I agree with this but that day or I should say that night I was working in it was\nPouring like\nNothing then I kind of felt bad for little ones because all they want to go trick or treating and it's pouring sure but the older kids\nWell anyways but we did have some kids that didn't want to come in by eggs and I says well I made a deal with him I said I'll tell you the eggs but you know hit the still\nYou don't have my time and it was pouring so happy that I think it it was gonna wash off any remnants wherever they were ... [noise]\nYeah I like the guy that I think that's true and I like that you made a deal with him that was smart\nYeah I just don't hit the thoughts do hit the guy and it was raining so heavy that it was going to watch the way if it wasn't raining I says I would've been nah yeah no because I Would feel bad for anywhere\nWhatever but I think they were thrown at each other because I did see him like out in the pocket walk walk and whatever and they were thrown whatever they had at each other\n[laughter] more than at any and anything you know what\nI mean sure did they didn't even didn't even break kind of funny you know knows that is find anyone break the deal and hit the store\nNo no they were no cars they will come and they were like kids that I Would say I would come into the store all that oh okay\nYou know so they were cool with that you don't get cool at home most of the kids or whatever people it pretty you know people are pretty much okay you know don't do that I you know\nBut there it reminds me of my past but never put up with kids trying to pull Tom ... like that they knew where we were all the time we had fun but\nThere was no way we would be able to go out and do stuff like that do eggs [laughter] yeah I Know there was no way [laughter] no way my parents knew where we were and all that and [laughter]\nYeah no that's a that's a great story thanks thanks yeah you when you were a kid you couldn't buy eggs at a certain point in the year ... we because I remember we had a friend of mine he worked at a convenience store\nWas great he was in high school you were to the community so that also sold beer and wine\nIt was like\nThe greatest friend have in high school ... beer and eggs and uh so he he would he would be able to get his eggs\nIn the morning I was cracking and making my social scrambled eggs\nA crack in the ... you know in the bowl and I thought this is funny I have an crack an egg on Halloween a long long time maybe tonight maybe tonight\nOh relive my youth surreptitiously get my hands on some beer\nPut a wolf man mask on and go throw eggs at cars you know I don't do that kids don't do don't throw eggs at moving cars that's not that's not right but one of our biggest stories course of the day is not just that it's Halloween but did a Whitey Bolger spending Halloween in hell\nI assume he's in how\nKids if you if you want to go is Whitey Bolger Halloween here's what you need for it could cost him you know rent in orange jumpsuit\nYou need a wheelchair or white beard a or a ... that makes your head look bald\nAnd of course a lock in a sock

girlfriend with a lady killer forum and and they killed they killed his his stepdaughter who he was having sex with as well right\nNow they're ... that's why I said it's ... you know with the way that way so you say well as in eighty nine year old man in a wheelchair your needs three guys at least or allegedly killed him um\nWe'll see how that's terrible you know three on one and he's in a wheelchair but if you think of Everytime Bolger did something he never fought fair he always ... you know used trickery in ... in a an overwhelming force to to kill his victim he never give anybody a fair shot either\nWay and then they feel they or or or\nWill they threatened to kill them they they actually threatened to kill his kid ...\n... they put that to him on a\nGlobal because he wouldn't sell them a liquor store they were white or the ... yeah\nThey did in ... in the end they came to his house and they had and he they Steve Fleming had his daughter ... sitting on his lap she was a
