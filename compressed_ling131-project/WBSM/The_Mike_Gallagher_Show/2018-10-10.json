out with anything against the president yet so although I did hear one Democrat running playing about the president just looking at a corn for ethanol and I don't know enough about it on that far\nIt's just the um he said wait a minute\nDiscuss it talk about it\nUh yeah I I don't know a whole lot about the ethanol stuff either I've heard it's not great for your engine um but I couldn't I really would never if anyone knows give me a call come fast and that type of stuff but I couldn't hazard a guess on that stuff that would just come out wrong\nOkay um I read a little bit about this I don't know a whole lot about it I Know people into crime not massive like they do in Iowa\n[laughter] but um I listen to the president is mine and they talked\nAbout was talking about this on policy and about and um he did make a couple of statements that I thought were a little off in one of them was about ... on why don't they use it for people to eat instead of using it for 'em you know\nGasoline whatever wind burn your food right and and that's that's a wrong point because for one thing it's it's made out of the crime was people do and I'm just they use it that forcing which is fermented\nAnd the rest is used for livestock so it isn't just a anything that people consume because that's not true okay you know she was fun for the animals to animal feed\n'em and the other thing about the vehicles that I read and I'm not intelligent about all these technical ... this last caller just said OK yeah but I give you what what input at that I have about it was that um\nThat what I understood it to be ways that you wouldn't put diesel in your car no would you take your regular vehicle and for gasoline in a vehicle that diesel\nWhere a same thing I Believe works the same way with this ethanol and they do have different grades of them from what I read\nCertain cause they're promising engines obviously state they can take ethanol it's not every ...\nEvery ... mate does not take this from what I read you know when Trump was talking about um he said something about other cars and other countries and now running on this end\nSo I think that was a trigger the you know that people have to understand that it's certain car\nYeah certain hours may prompt me a better warnings waste and we're one of us you know I don't know which ones that there is but from what I read you just can't pull up to a pumpkin Plath and all in your car\nAnd um and it said what to do you know if this happens to you and it was saying that you can probably take it if you did at once or twice\nThere probably would be no I'm ... and um because it said well what if you put diesel and you'd think that if somebody else for gasoline but does and it said don't drive your car\nYou know immediately habit and drained I Know somebody that app until I'm\n... and you know people have to be aware of this and it isn't just anything you just pull up to the pond and putting it guy\nIn it and another thing about price range that he was talking about like go gas is gonna be so high people ... and I don't believe that's true either um I think gas prices are\nJust made up by the markets and people you know I really don't think that there's a shot of the gasoline anywhere I I knew somebody that worked on the oil rigs and they told me you know what it was just ... sit and now and this ocean just waiting for the price of\nOil that's absolutely ... you know what you said that before he became president Donald Trump what'd you remember when when the gasoline should bite oil spiked well over to over a hundred dollars a barrel ... it's not it's in thanks for the call by revert very very interesting um\nIt's not driven by the stock market so much is driven by the commodities market because you can watch it you know I watch if you watch the CNBC or Fox Business or Bloomberg but I Do think Bloomberg and CNBC are the superior business shows Bloomberg\nReally pick if you're looking for for ... international news but the the channel a Bloomberg\nBut he just look at the commodity prices is they go along I mean oil and then a certain types of gas in certain you know this is Brent oil there's different types of oil to\n'em it's out there but if you look at that if you read the wall Street Journal um\nIt'll discuss your markets and then the certain oil that becomes a it's better for gasoline ... there's a lot there's a lot of moving parts to this but yeah of course if you have a tanker full of oil\nUm and the market is going sky high\nYou're going to sit that thing off the gamble it's certainly a gamble but that's you know that's the commodities market\nUm you get a higher price why wouldn't you know as as I remember President Trump was not President Trump is just Donald Trump or back then a billionaire self made billionaire Donald Trump he was\nI'm seeing it as soon as this as soon as the price starts to drop\nIn oil you're going to always tankers flooding into New Jersey in particular that's where they are a lot of the stuff's off loaded um to run on largest cargo at the\nPrice the highest price possible or they're sitting offshore waiting for the price to get through the highest point in the mental racing to try to beat it before it hits hits bottom anyway\nTake appropriate if you're on hold 'em particularly if you've got something on ethanol because we started this conversation and I think it's vastly I Wonder what it does your engine if it's good it's bad I'm leaning towards bad but there I Know there are people out there with good

twenty WBAI some take so much for holding your lap and to be a\nVery good Margaret hey good morning how you doing I'm I don't know that the\nEngines but as far as that goes that the reason that most countries in the world\nThat had ethanol and their gas actually stopped using it for one reason when to use ethanol you have a choice to make ethanol with corn or you feed the population what happens when you increase the amount\nOf ethanol which is made out of corn every ... every food that that that is created with corn in the United states will go up okay\nSo you're a beef prices your chicken prices all that stuff\nEverything will go up so I personally I think the reason he wants to do this because of the tariffs and China and Russia and all those other countries are not buying as much going from us part I Wonder if what\nHappens is once you start and one thing it's not going to decrease your gas prices actually going to increase it\nIt's gone from us by anyone there is what happens is once you start and one thing it's not going to decrease your gas prices actually going to increase it because the corn demand for for for ethanol will be so high\nThat there'll be a shortage to make food so it's a win win for the farmers that grow corn because everything that comes from corn to consume will go up\nAnd everything to all the corn for ethanol will also increase so both sides of the spectrum when we increase your food costs and your gasoline cloth\nCommunist man he was always a combat\nSo now we absolutely was always coming ... she started he was a member of the ... he was a member of the French Communist Party when he was in ... in ... in Paris before he came back to Vietnam so he uses his yeah\nIt was a noble idea to stop communism but consider in that that was basically in the front yard of the two biggest communist\nPowers on earth right was basically a few tile experiment from the beginning\nAnd I feel bad for the Vietnam veterans that went there and the government did not help them and it was it was absolute it it was hell on earth in central jungles I've got an uncle that got sent to the jungles of Angola because he was in the Portuguese military\nAnd that was another few time with him and colonialism just breeds horrible things a lot of the times\nTax rate front always a good call always informed I really appreciate it thank you for

com\nOkay I had um started to mention God it seems like a long time ago now that there's an article\nOr an opinion piece not articles and opinion piece from Jamie gas who's with the pioneer Institute He's the director of the center for school reform of the pioneers who they're Boston based think tank funded by the Koch brothers\nI say that just because it's so fun to say\nBy the Koch brothers also funded a fabulous PBS program on Vietnam it was just running that you have to check out you know I mean you really do\nThe Koch brothers fun of that too they find all kinds of good stuff anyway so article is called your view it's under the your view it's like a habit captain Ahab Moby Dick Mitchell is obsessed with stopping element del mar\nThese folks are very much in favor of charter schools and you know there's a charter school expansion possibility coming up the bigger mistakes you big time a charter school is one thing I didn't hear in the debate last night and I know I look I might be doing a debate here by the way\nIn the studio with Republican to ... against the Democrat Keating both running for to be our Congress person a congressman here November I Wanna do that October twenty third here in Studio live\nIt's going to be just on foreign policy I Know that they're going to go stand times debate going to be a local issues things like that but I'm doing just on foreign policy\nBut I'm fascinated with foreign policy and quite frankly I don't think it gets enough attention and it's our last caller talked about with Vietnam uh\nI don't often quote Bruce Springsteen actually I Do but next time they're gonna be looking at you write memory has a famous discussion or one of his concert he says I almost got drafted to go to Vietnam and he says\nNext time they were looking at me then next time we're going to be looking at you\nSo foreign policies means a lot plus it's jobs which trade it's important so we're gonna be doing it here in the twenty three so what I say I know about debate it's hard you can only ask so many questions of time limits last night the one thing I really wanted to hear about what charter schools and\nThe governor's debate they weren't they didn't cover charter schools but again I don't fault the host or the candidate is always\nBut there's an article today I think it's it's well written he does quote the late novelists ... el Doctorow I Wonder if a new doctor was a communist I dunno but anyway\nThey're saying that Mitchell is the is politically this is this is the part I don't think is\nIs it fair they say mayor Mitchell's political ambition is the main reason he's flinging harpoon to charter schools state policymakers should ignore Mitchell's theatrics and endorsed hundreds in New Bedford School children on Elmer do Mars waiting list first of all I Know John Mitchell\nIs the thing the act trickle about John Mitchell whatsoever\nHe's a smart guy he's an interesting person I find them to be a very good guy act like a great conversations with them but a lot of things gum related non government right I mean I like him personally\nBut not a theatrical guy not Liberace\n\nJohn Mitchell is as Liberace does I tear in theater um\n'cause argument is it against it really isn't against charter schools it's against the the budget problems that looks to cause of course the pioneer Institute in these guys are smart
