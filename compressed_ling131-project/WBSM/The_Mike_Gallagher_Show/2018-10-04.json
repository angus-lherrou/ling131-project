I could do it absolutely could do it but I always associate I give you that too I I actually photograph photograph of them together we didn't take 'em they took them for themselves they just didn't know we knew well maybe they didn't know I don't know\nAnyway I got his name so but that's beside the point you know as you know it's actually to the point [noise]\nCaught the Cubans did is they wanted to get rid of Mendez then when the dirty up Mendez and so they ... they they they started reaching out spreading stories\nThe Menendez was involved with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic you'll even hear how we car mentioned is on the air\nTo this day it's still out there I mean and this was of all the under age prostitutes\nIn the Dominican Republic bought the Cubans knew\nThey were tracking\nAnd they knew he was going to the Dominican Republic on a regular basis and they knew he had shady dealing\n... remember he went on trial for ... you didn't go on trial for having anything to do with the underage prostitutes he went on trial he beat the charges\nOf taking gifts and things like this from a friend free trip to the Dominican Republic flights in the plane and that he helped influence legislation or or government regulators on behalf of his friend he was cleared of those charges\nHe was found innocent of those charges so I don't want to concentrate on this charge of the men of sound innocent of them it's it's only relevant just to explain what the Cuban government did\n\nNot talk about interfering in an election\n\nNow it's interesting because they did this to a Democrat and Obama still went down to Cuba and believe me if I Know about this the president knew about it right\nWho am I I'm only able to repeat what's in the public domain\nAnd and believe me this is a fascinating story I Can't do it enough justice if you're interested you should really Google Cuban espionage Sen Menendez or Cuban reputation destruction of Sen Menendez I mean it's a fascinating story\nAt least to me and I think the most of you know what they did is they knew when he'll be coming and going right so they're able to figure out these dates and so they're able to play knew he would be in the Dominican Republic or had been in the Dominican Republic\nSo they reached out through their contacts\nAnd I would say unbeknownst to those contacts\nThey reached out and\n\nThey reached out and\nThey planted the story saying that ... was seeing underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic and they were able to match up the dates now I'm not going to put out the name of the group to sell for\nMark judge in in ...\nIn ah in Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a woman on a boat and he do you have this man has makes compete he went down to the docks and treat them both on\nJohn Wayne style you went down their command pillow them\nAll false all phony made up center white us from\nRhode Island senator flatulence members question about flatulence high school yearbook cabin on demand pills from the sky you went down and he beat up those guys cabin on judge this gang rapists\nSexual assault is all made up yet Senator Whitehouse pointed out there\n\nNow the FBI investigates ms Ford's allegations can't corroborated I don't know she seemed credible to me when she testified I don't know\n[noise] not me to say the FBI set it might be for the what the FBI said no corroborating evidence nothing\n\nNothing\nI don't know if the kids in ... in Kavanaugh's children's classrooms are going to find that out I don't know what's going to be anything to him but I Know kids are mean I Know kids are mean and can you imagine the abuse the cabin our children are taking\nAn innocent man\nAnyway tell you what I've been talking for quite a while let's hear what you folks have to say thank you so much for holding your lived that we'd be us him hey my friend what's going on\nMuch which will um well up because I ... I Wonder if\nYou know anything about the ah the\nDoctor it's at a college professor actually wants to for the therapy\n[noise] follow me of a for a ... a professor for one thought a therapist and polishing disclosed on this therapy sessions something about this do you know anything about that Dr that have led you can just pause stuffed\nBoy it's always great question I Do not that's a great line right who who who was a therapist what's their background\nI Wonder if she claimed which I don't hold\n[laughter] [laughter] well here's the thing the notes don't help her case because the therapists notes contain known names of of anybody and they actually contain a description of more people than\nThan Dr Ford ... later claimed or they're so actually the notes which Ford claims help her case you're actually diminished her case All right but as far as getting Muslim into the public eye oh you're saying the therapist denotes\nA no no that wasn't even [noise] okay [noise] I think maybe the Democratic\nParty got the therapist maybe she maybe she's hardly tied into the Democratic party that's why I say maybe she is when you try to maybe ...\nOr an awkward too\nMaybe she said okay let me see who can I well look look look at him on my client base to a a hate the story out\nYou know I'm like most personal on contact the party and says okay we can do this and she protected I I Believe she may be protected from being questioned about this because the client clients are talking privilege but we couldn't even ... I don't know yeah I don't know\nIt was only in and you know I think right at that oh you actually that would that would be yeah and I think she'll be protected unless she's already on withdrawing the privilege\nAnd spoken to someone else a a but I'm I'm speculating here on that but I just didn't thinking in my head that that's how it works like a bum happened to be corrected on that but look it's ... ... ... ... it's possible like here's the thing we know that\nWe know that in the therapists notes there is no names um and so\nThe ... the human food like somebody somebody tried to train with a horde woman they tried to train her on what to do when they say okay take a walk on your own CIA do unless you were stumbling around follow me\n... well there's no doubt that she received guidance from her attorney but that's par for the course yeah [noise] um so she did receive guidance from and if you notice she but she did um make statements that don't that are what are the what the female prosecutors ... wonderful\nWell I Wonder if it was somebody else's story not her and she was trying to carry it out\n[noise] oh All right so what you're saying is is there is there another person that the notes actually ... no\n... she was the whole why you didn't grow up you go off yet and you tell them that this is what happened and a boy and you do it in a believable way\nOh that's entirely possible yeah but I don't know that it was ...
