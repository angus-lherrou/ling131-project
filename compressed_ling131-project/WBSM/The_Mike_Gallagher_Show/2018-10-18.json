name the two probably\nGreek yeah you know you when you're a child growing up\nYou remember back first hired somebody told you that you race are you from Greece set ...\nYeah how did you do that well my family\nOf the same way I found out some point growing up my mother told me that we were Portuguese\nAnd Irish yeah we didn't have a back then to prove literary they write ... growing up and there were times when I groan applications for different things going ... we'll see of course he's not\nOnly for the fact that is what my mother hen foaming just like your parents told you and her parents told what\nYeah and you had relatives to back it up\nI Do yes\nSo you know that gives it the liturgy and hurts ... I understand what you're saying is her grandmother or whoever told her and so she took that family lore too hard and uh she just repeated it that this was what I was told and I believe it\nOkay here's the separation between that and you know everyone can understand that\nTwo two sitting down and on an application or to um put down that you are Native American and not Caucasian\n... that to me\nIs a huge a difference between your grandmother telling you that you're you are once uh you know somebody in the family was Cherokee to to avoiding putting down what you are Caucasian\nAnd putting down Native American filling that box with an axe with Native American so that she could get an advantage\nBut you don't that's why she did that even after\nHe doesn't matter why did they actually did it that she did it is is enough for me just step back and say wow this this woman has a a liar\nHebrew hasta\nLa schools or what she Philadelphia about fishing so\nThat whole you know no difference decision for ... or even that [noise]\n[noise] yeah because by the time they came out with those statements that was already politicized\nOr where you go that's exactly right and that's the that's where you say ... ... right\nWell this is all of all it's it's not like it was a reporter ... who won she's an American success story she grew ... or ... or Jana they'd had no money no she got married Sherry ...\nWas a struggle for school and everything\nShe's a millionaire no matter how you get now you know anybody else\nWho came from nothing like that became a success\nWill be praying for them the perfect example of how ... person puts their mind to it and and do the right things\nYou know they can become successful and you can become a senator would you agree with you on that\nI Would agree that uh her success is real and that she had a lot to do with it sure but it doesn't take away from it\nThat she put down that she was a Native American when she wasn't that that's me nuts my whole contention it's not political it's while she really told a lie I don't care why she told ally and I I could care less what people who [noise]\nYears later once this whole thing a became part of her political [noise] uh let's call it to her tapestry of course they're going to want to side with her you\nKnow I mean this is this only makes good sense that they're going to side with er Johnny\n... I don't know I have we ever seen more document that she could that um you know we are in the ... or ... or ... have you ever seen I mean do we know exactly what the question was asked\nI mean [noise] yeah yeah I we have a copy that for a while I don't\nKnow if there's a company but yeah I mean it's a she doesn't deny it in fact she told the Boston Globe two days ago it was probably the biggest mistake of my life\nWell okay so what makes you ... and and okay so it's a mistake forever\nYou know we we have a president who lies to assault fireworks or face [laughter] over and over and over again so I guess I don't know I guess maybe once you get up in the politics I maybe become a ...

Geoff Diehl refused to say if he was going to vote for him\nIn the debate it was ... pathetic\nYeah Charlie Baker is a bright person\nBut boy he was really dumb last night he's endorsed the guy and he wouldn't say whatever's going to vote for him or not and I thought what's this what's the calculation here Charlie Baker what do you what do you why you why are you not saying you're gonna vote for the guy when you've already came on to come out in force them to just supporting the whole tech it\nMade no sense whatsoever he looked flat footed in ridiculous\n\nHis Democratic opponent Jay Gonzales ... small blood Miller kept going after him on it and you could see Charlie Bass getting frustrated but it's a weird thing right just say yeah of course I'm voting for him I've endorsed him I'm voting for a move on and of course they're trying to say that because\nJay Gonzales his stances because a ... he has any association Jeff deal with Donald Trump than he must be a horrible person and how could anyone vote for them and how could Charlie Baker and endorse him it's\nThis weird thing we have in this country now where certain people think that the president if you have any association with the president and you're still kind of a horrible human being you're a racist you're you're a horrible for it's it's ... it's\nIt's the most extremist position I've ever seen taken in this country the idea that if you voted for the man who ... who who became president you somehow or a bad person was ... ... is the ... but for some reason other Charlie Baker is kind of bought into that\nOr at least he thinks enough of you bought into that he's worried about it\nSo that was a real crazy moment that debate now the good thing for Charlie rigorous that most people who are watching it\nMost people who are watching it\nThat's the upside for him than I N J Gonzales doesn't have any money to turn into a commercial but it was just ... imagine I mean there's a bigger he's endorsed Jeff deal for US Senate he's on the Republican ticket with him I wouldn't even be voting for him\nBut the idea that he did he would run from Jeff deal is ridiculous the fact that he took the bait and did it was even more ridiculous and then the other thing we have this question here in the state\nAbout transgendered accommodation it's basically transgender bathrooms 'cause nobody cares if the person sitting in a restaurant with them is transgendered until they get up and go into the same a ladies' room or as they're you know Thirteen year old daughter that's when it becomes an issue so it's really it's about\nAbout bathrooms whether whether a man who believes he's a woman can go into a woman through again I don't think many of us are worried about a woman who identifies as a man going into the men's room I\n\nThe way probably only make one trip then you ladies out there if you have if you're the difference between the men's room in the ladies' room is a it's a big gap\nGenerally and I think he'd cleanliness ended a combination but anyway I remember my friend's law from the ...\nHumans bathroom had a couch in it I mean [noise] beautiful beautiful uh you know the I\nI Know because the ... or any of it doesn't matter how I Know but so I'm Charlie but as we've this question three and I think if you're against men going into the ladies' room in address a guy in a dress going into the ladies' room\nI think you're supposed to vote no but I have to look I mean there's a question on the ballot\nIn last night's Charlie Baker and his Democratic opponent trying to outdo each other as to who supports it more jolly bigger point I donated personally to the campaign to for transgender bathrooms\nAnd I thought\nThe hell is going on in this place I'm Sorry I have nothing against people who are transgender it'll ... it'll be like oh you want to live your life [noise]\nUm I've worked with people I Know people who doesn't matter to me do whatever you want but I Do have a problem maybe I'm a Neanderthal I'll have to get my DNA tracked but I don't think men to be able to put a dress on and go into a lady from and I don't think I'm a big hit for saying it\nI think that's a fairly\nNormal thing to say I'm not against people people can live there like any way they want\n\nAnd and you know what if you had the full operation if you've made the full commitment\nOr ... or how how how would I Know that you aren't a woman right if you know you you weren't born that way you went to ... surgery or\nYou've made a some tremendous physical adjustments to your body a and and you also in your in your where you where the appropriate clothing now which is a dress or whatever\nHow would I even know that as you go into the ladies' room that you really a uh\nWe're we're at one point a man right now I think ... what we're concerned about here at least I Am not only because I'm not losing sleep but I think we just don't want children\n\nGoing into you know being in the bathroom you know you take your daughter to the mall you know let's say you're a dad obviously not going to leave a well I guess now you can but\nTake your daughter the mall she's twelve Thirteen Years old you know eleven nine I don't know young right again when it gets to be a certain age six Fifteen sixteen years old they they can look out for themselves\nI'm Still worried about them you know but uh but in terms of the ... when there were a little kid you know and in some guy an address is able to go into the ladies' room come on come on\nThat's crazy right\nI mean I worked for the person who is transgender well they were ... they weren't they just were [noise]\nAnd again I'm not trying to disrespect we're in any way so but understand I'm not I haven't paid a lot of attention to the terms some terms change take everything I say as a as men with respect okay I'm not intending to hurt anyone's feelings here if I get a term wrong my intent was to be accurate\nEven if I'm not accurate but I worked with a guy he was a guy he wore address he hadn't had any of\nThe procedures yet I guess that was going to be in the future I didn't ask him either didn't matter to me showed up to work for his interview in a suit he had a ponytail\nFine a lot of people have those seemed like a lot of work to me but whatever it's not uncommon\nThe earrings I think I didn't do the interview but I saw him hey how you doing who hire a lot of people just company\nHe gets hired his name was it doesn't matter what his name was but it was one of those\nUnisex names like you know my name's Christopher but everyone calls me Chris well there are plenty of women are named Christine will go by the name ... or you have Chris that is a gender neutral name sex neutral name whatever um I see you on hold so I'm\n\nLesley for instance is a is a name Marion his name uh anywhere you you get to this person had had a name that was\nNeutral\nBut the first day of work after being hired they should've they're an address ... beautiful floral print\nWith a big hat\nWe'd like something you'd see in on Easter Nineteen eighty but anyway\nSo we had to make a decision ... how do we I was in management how do we deal with this thing fortunately someone else smarter than me made a decision we had four bathrooms we yeah we have a couple of hundred people working in the building we'd for bathrooms to were large commercial style bathrooms you know multiple stalls multiple your nose on the ...\nThose ... stayed gender specific we had to a private more private bathrooms would locking doors the way there was a you know I think it was like a whole bathroom All right just one unit type of thing we just made those\nHe he was a minor minor in women's studies right in at UMass Amherst in the nineties and talking about who you're talking about this new one of my fraternity brothers right\nHe ... he minored in women's studies for the obvious reason he's a full blooded man and it used to wear a fraternity letters right we

didn't off\nWe also do have some great players are not team also but they don't get any of the lake accolades that did give them to use ... that's the point I wanted to make\nAnd I think you made it well my friend hey thanks for calling\nHey thank God we have a great day it was a pleasure talking to you for the first time\nGreat don't be a stranger and call again I appreciate and love of the

I think it's a strong case for Elizabeth Warren's campaign of ah lowering interest rate has been um or the middle class was armored\nI could I mean I'm Talking about how does the school function when you have a civil rights when there's a ... when the teacher has fifty thousand dollar fine hanging over their head if they say now guys go in the men's locker and you're being clowns\nI you know it's it has been a different time since I was in high school but maybe this is something guidance figures out and they they know X Y and Z or a little more personally and they know orientation they know a\nBut they can't do it this is you have I have to you have to\nI'm telling you how I feel regardless of the physical evidence in front of you so you have to build a read my mind which is impossible ... right to be able to say that I'm doing this under a false pretense and what ... what a person who's like I'm touched thinking a lot of high school teacher gym teacher what gym teachers going to put their career on the line\nTo get into this and get dragged into court and probably lose their job\nDo you what I'm saying yeah over this thing over because squeezing PJ goofing around but you but then then\nAnd just I'm just saying it it's it's good to all kinds of of peril there's all kinds of probably but we've got all kinds of people that want to ask a millennial let's uh let's see what's going on in the morning thanks for holding your lived to be some\nGood ... good morning for requests for them so we were very I mean like\nSo\nWhat happens in that\nWay you this is a real thing that you were involved in\nI was involved where I'm at a facility that worked with um a lot of atlas you sure you had\nYour that word gender ruin either daily basis we would have to ask what do you want to be called today um how are you today how are they going to draft that go on yeah\nDid you ever feel like they were they were manipulate you using it to manipulate people and and have have a good tip control the situation absolutely\nAbsolutely and I are at one point in saying that\nThe majority because when it's coming from and how many that claim them to be I'm a woman coming into the bathroom or make me what am I feeling ... as as a woman [noise]\nNo I I Know it's it's it's\nBeen good at the ... you and I mean some of them are on the verge of adult right how do you feel today and sometimes it was very ... it seems to me like a manipulative situation\nNow I work with at risk thank you for the call I worked at risk youth before and in and look again here's here's becomes a problem right it's a very sensitive situation because I don't\nWant to make anyone feel uncomfortable\nEither way I don't want to discriminate against people I'm just talking about how do we want to society how do we so I mentioned before I worked at a place\nWhere we poked out any given day or two hundred people there we had a person who was a guy but he or address and identified as well but he hadn't gone to the surgeries or anything like that [noise] we're faced with the situation I have to be a manager at the time um\nBut we had two large bathrooms multiple stalls all that good stuff those stayed gender specific\nMale and female but the way to smaller private bathroom to locking doors more like a household bathroom and those became gender neutral because you when one person when they ought to do it didn't matter who use it because they were in their alone um that seems to me to probably be the best answer\nBut when you get into schools in locker rooms and and again what about like a these gyms\nOr or or a community center you know when they have a workout room and then you have people coming and going and you have women in there you know who who want to just be able to take a shower after working out and now there's a guy in there with them\nI\nWas in this is a tough subject absolute obviously it's tough to as two males to straight males to figure out to today are straight don't don't pigeon homeless and come on now but I mean you really need to think about\nHow is this really affecting your day to day life and is this really you know your are you really affected by this smell this just the fear that you are generated because you study the fear\nIs I have no fear whatsoever it it it's it's I Wonder how I'm just very specifically thinking about um\nPublic schools is really the only thing that I think becomes an issue because as I said I dealt with it for a measure prospect of in a workplace here here in this reddish and we have locking bathrooms right it's the single stall male female whatever right we don't have an issue here\nWho we don't ... you know because we you know just not I don't think it's really I think we're becomes an issue is just kids' schools are\nPublic locker rooms and the says like why when the public you know what I mean like a ... if you go oh Jim yeah I think that stuff um begins to become\nA little ... like I wouldn't want a guy I don't have a daughter but I've had a young daughter you know juice\nSay she's swimming at the Y. rang like when I was a kid in the wintertime we went to the Y. because we like to swim but again I Can't swim here or\nOutdoors you know in a February mhm right well and you write called it's called so my parents would take up we went to the Y. and veterans getting warmer though it's ... camp earn enough call for me but uh\nI don't care about you what happens you millennials I'm outta here about twenty five maybe thirty is great can't wait for the votes to [laughter] right well I don't mind [laughter] transgendered cemeteries so uh\nYeah um\nBut I Can't imagine a little kid I Can't imagine being me a little kid going in if I was a child as a female going in and then there's a guy in the locker room I you know\nThere's a difference because you would be raising the child in a society that accepts that hey there's some people who think that or no I'm Sorry not think they know that their sexual orientation is different than there so they well you're not really an extra or their gender\nOkay you're it's still the fact that your raising them tolerable you're still using your state of mind of this isn't right where you should actually be thinking of the generation to come and training them so that it's not a weird situation it's not something to fear\nBecause you're what you're
