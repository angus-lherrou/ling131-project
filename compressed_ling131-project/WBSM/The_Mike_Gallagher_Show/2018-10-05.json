appreciate the conversation I really learned a great deal uh but uh it's your average person I'm not a hobby graduated\nUh eighty five years or walk that trend ... the thing is that's disturbing to me uh about how I see things and all these years is that this question which makes one either a liberal or conservative that\nMakes one Republican or Democrat\nIt appears to me where ... totally bickering quarreling with each other\nAbout who's right and who who all\nAnd we keep insulting each other trying to get even with each other it would seem to be like like I say on your average person ... average working guy ... the United states that we'd never probably made more than thirty five thousand dollars ... even with all the time but we're always hard working people\nYou know and uh it would seem to me that we should be concentrating on just to to what is right\nNot what fits the at the end of a particular person who says I'm conservative who says I'm April why can't we go in the middle road and be a conservative liberal because there are times when you have to\nBe conservative even amongst the poor working fast those of us are thinking that times you can be liberal or not is you know when I called John ... the a conservative area and that was\nThat all ... and I liked his color and I like going ... quickly address and concern I have to go out when the um this man\n... hero to me to to all fought for this country and the perfect example of American\nMain street person yeah and I think he's distressed over the far left for the Democrats and the far right for the

that water under the bridge do you feel as though his apology holds water\nUm I think it's a little bit too late because I think that what happens when a politicians are people such as this show when they when when they when when they basically goof up people in a ear and go look you know\n[noise] a raise in um ... village probably should've owned it down and whatnot and any stat listening you know I\nRemember one thing I've always by father\nAlways taught me this do not make decisions when you're mad right you know and that's something that you should joke\nIn huge you know for educated

have set themselves up and Hillary Clinton has no this\nAs being anti white and the anti male in this entire thing and Hillary's recent tirade against a white supremacy in Korea and relating from

I'm like oh my God so I kinda snuck into the bathroom and just stay there and yeah and then I had to call some of my friends on the police department and let them come clear the ... the pocket while I was like\nAnd get out of [laughter] yeah we have a question of your conditioning story and then I Know I didn't\nQuestion that button and I said I I you know it's been a drop something and I stood up fast in the corner stuck into my head and he never really question kind of a question you know was that your only trip to the to the hospital [noise] no [laughter] that's a that's a bomb many visits\nAllows many for the last ... yeah I mean there's a lot of it was some boxing no other people do you see other people from boxing with you you oh yeah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris how're you doing I'm doing ... where we started I just want to remind your listeners that Tom Brady off the super bowl to a backup quarterback\nYou can never let it go he's a silly you see the Phillies ego got a ... and and that's that's why I called the ... the villain from Philly you you are a very good at baseball and as I pointed out to people ... the game of mouse and you're going to talk about first of all that incredible prediction you made\nIf you remember you had me on before the season and I mentioned some teams that I thought were going to be real competitive and one of them that a lot of people didn't think I told you that I wouldn't be surprised if the brewers won all the way and all they haven't done it yet obviously but\nI didn't think they'd win the central and be very competitive I said I Would have liked to see him get a picture of the trade deadline 'cause they're pitching is not great but man that team can hit [laughter]\nYeah I don't think we've ever seen the theme hit their weight or two World Series championship but the brewers are going to give it a shot him and they both and which you know which will help them their starting pitching this kind of a goo but um you know that and you know I remember we talked about the Yankees being very good with their bullpen and a\nDaughter who was on with the I Would just go back to Bruce Bruce thing is amazing um gee what what was the last time they came this this far you know\nI'll tell my head I don't know or the Bruins long range\nThat they haven't been you know a very successful they they went to the\nDivisional series in ... eleven I Believe which is where the right now uh I think they got to one uh they've only been in the playoffs I mean if you look at their history or what five times or you know they went to the world series once in eighty two\nYeah that's what I'm saying if you if you don't know when the last interview this far off the top of your head and it's been a long long ago that\nFar it went up to a thousand eleven they were in the playoffs come\nBut they've only been to the playoffs I think twenty seven twenty eight eighty two and there could be another one but not many times that they're not a franchise that without a real historic us except for on you know as a lot of the small market teams that can't afford you know huge contracts and players and as we see the two teams competing tonight the Yankees and the red Sox obviously having those big payrolls help\nWhich which what are your thoughts here\nWell you know what's interesting this is actually only the fourth time these two teams have met in the playoffs which\nIs remarkable considering you know um how good both these franchises are historically and the red Sox actually won the last meeting Antonio for if you remember they were down three oh\nOh I remember how it and I remember text and a friend of mine who was a Red Sox fan and saying a Red Sox and seven when they were down three oh and he said you're nuts and I said just a hundred and actually happened that was also pretty good prediction\nBut that was amazing series wasn't I mean\nIt ... but you know the Yankees of actually won every other meeting other than for the only time the red Sox beat them\nAnd they um\nSo you know I [noise] the red Sox have been historically good this year as far as you know\nA hundred and eight wins but I got to be honest Chris and I'm not just saying this to throw your listeners I I actually like the Yankees and the theory that the five game series which is a bummer instead of seven but you know Chris sales still banged up a little bit and you know I I just think the Yankees bats and they're they're both and it was just going to carry the day but in a we shall see\nUm do you think it goes do you think it goes all five games do you think it's a ... a quick out\nI'm not sure I mean actually every theories they've ever played\nI Believe in postseason history except for the Ninety nine now there's one out of three so the last two times they met they went seven games they won five games I Believe five four or five Ninety nine and that's when the Yankees won smack the Braves in the world series when the British kept in the world series and couldn't beat anybody\nUm and I think one one in that timeframe but they kept losing in the playoffs and World Series but I think it'll probably\nGo five I mean I Wish this was a seven game series I mean it's kind of a bummer these two teams weren't meeting the next round where they'd get seven games to go to the world series seemed a little anti climatic\nAnd then right you know it's it's around early than they\nThe the meat but\nUh you know to be interesting\nWell and again you can hear the red Sox play tonight here in WB assembles ... by shooting supply a pre game starts around six twenty each a tonight and of course we'll be carrying the entire series here [laughter] you know the ... the red Sox and the Yankees it's just a fantastic rivalry really hasn't been interesting you say they've only met four times\nUm it's\nYeah it seems like a lot more right\nYeah they well they actually met really this is the fourth time unless you count they had a one game a and how they did the one game things this year on what was it Monday or Tuesday for the division they had one time they met for the division title okay and it was the one game and then they met in three different procedures or this is the fourth officials theory is if you don't count the one game thing which the Yankees won that one game\nThing as well and I was a late seventies I don't remember the exact year um but uh yeah I [noise] you know I spoke on your show Chris I said I thought Yankees Dodgers were the favorites with the brewers as the dark horse in the world series\nYeah now I got a kind of stick with that kind of the daughters will go to the Yankees look good and uh you know obviously can overcome the actors\nOut on the other side of the bracket the Astros are are very good team they obviously want it last year so\nLook I Know I I really like the Dodgers I always like to do of course I like to see teams that don't make it make it you know like the brewers have you seen which would be a great story yeah it's just a great story but but and I would love to see the red Sox Dodgers play would settle for the red Sox Yankees against the Dodgers I think that'd be ... years\nYou know I mean obviously if they're the Yankees are the I mean a hundred wins and being a wild card is pretty pretty I don't know if it's ever happened before I mean that's pretty weird scene was under games in those when the division at the credit to the red Sox I mean you know they've had some injuries they were able to survive them they have a great one differential in other pitching Chris Sale a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "05"}
