about a one hit All right okay but\nBesides the point um and it's a topic that you and I discuss off the air at times where you can\nSomeone's music and not appreciate their life or political views I think Kanye West is although he is a I Believe forty years old he uses millennial tactics of Long Island that old media he's um\nForty yeah you know boarding or he's forty one All right okay three long Caribbean yeah he's he's had a he had a career All right [laughter]\nUm but he's he just will use the Internet in a way that sparks it's sort of like our president where anything that this man says gets on the news for good or for bad mostly for that\nBut you don't like Trump and you were pretty upset when ... when he first came out supporting Trump right\nYeah it just seems like he was doing it just to be in just to get those headlines like um like we mentioned on Saturday Saturday Night live\nHe's out there with the red make America great again hat but there's photos of him backstage wearing the red ... hat and they call in ...\nSweat shirt which she pointed out to be folks I Know I brought that information to the ice and this is my millennial advisor who told me is I I Do end up all any all expert I Know how some extra particles go back to the phones ... Chris McCarthy show on WB if someone asks a millennial\nGood morning you're more than I have a question I'm\n\nSure ... non citizen row and if they're able to vote should they be able to hold public office\nWhat do you think that's a good question something that I I\nInside of should non citizens vote\nAble to vote and if that and if they're able to vote should they also hold public office because if it if they can't hold public office but why should they be able to vote\nMillennia what do you think good question um I think the news\nYeah I mean they are paying taxes as well so shouldn't they have the right there in the there in\nThe United states or the non citizen\nBut they're non citizens that's you\nKnow that's a challenging question I didn't know getting ready to know I don't know um you would you want to think about it amongst the things I mean if\nYou're a tourist from Germany and you come to Disneyland your pay taxes to you know sales tax tax on them they wouldn't give me the right to vote\nRight when I think um our caller's talking about people right on visas and green card yeah more illegal that's what I'm Talking about ...\nI mean you know it's I'm I'm I'm I'm Talking about someone who was leaked in illegally but I'm just saying you know they you know I've always politicians oh they should be able to write the ... and I guess they some pounds around that they want to give Laura citizens the right to vote\nBut OK I'm like okay fine but they should be on the run for public office but they can't while you're on\nWell and the only thing you do you think thanks accomplishment a that's a very good question I I feel\nIf you have a a long term\nPlace in the United states you should be able to have say\nIf you're going on between legal and illegal though I think he's always been a legal resident for a long time maybe they don't have the right to vote yes but illegals um Mm Mm you wanna get back to us I get back to you All right you get back to the folks are going to go back to the phone banks are only allowed to be if someone asks ...\nOr ... or do you live in New Bedford I Do not\nOkay so you don't realize how many jobs have been taken by illegal immigrants here in New illegal immigrants here and that that that and it takes you a long time to\nMe to say yes or no on a question like that where the in the legal immigrants should be able to do that no other country in the world\nAllows someone who's not a citizen in that country to vote and it takes you that and you can't answer that question shame on you have a good one\nMillennial shame on you say you want someone trying to think about it yeah I mean I don't want to one dollar in time can ... I mean\nThis is these are the airwaves maybe once I say something I can say oh no you can set\nIt on you and also by the way I Want to remind my audience we have a great sees a deal coming up fourteen twenty WB is em is saving money it sees the deal dot com this week you can score half price gift certificates too wicked kicking savory cheesecake over there in Westport\nFresh cheesecake made with the finest ingredients that are perfect his appetizers desserts or even a main course in my opinion [noise] get a fifty dollar wicked kicking gift card for just twenty five dollars this Friday morning at nine AM and sees the deal dot com say real arms that will sell out\nOf your life and to be a stand would ask a millennial\nHigher doing oh no\nI think that every generation need someone like Kenya last [noise] and I think his mind he thinks he feels and he's not afraid to be not politically correct\nUh and and people don't like that then that's too bad and as far as\nThe voting illegal voting [laughter] you know it's and [laughter] come on nice way to get us\nBehind democracy that we have and the man that they're willing to ask him why are the millennials why why\nIn the people it's going in the right direction but our policy leaders and our elected officials maybe are sending us in the direction of their voters\n[noise] you know I just hope we don't see that was a survivor either tight and that song was a big hit in eighty two and that may or may not have been playing at the time that up by Kevin ... Kavanaugh was at a party or not you know what I was a theme we have going here [noise] um\nWhat about these Democrat leader so who are all like in their late seventies and eighties eat do you do you embrace those folks who think they got to go to\nMean uh yeah they got there not really doing much for the the younger generations so\nAh there's been some from things that I'm listening to a lot of the ... this week after obviously all the the the hearings and everything is um term limits for senators and something that when you get\nLike a their example was Orrin Hatch a man who they people that I listen to say should have been gone a decade ago still they're still in the committee making these choices very personally\nUm we we just need to revamp some of these things that I think\nTerm limits maybe something to look at\n... how it's going to affect you know decades to come or something like that but in the moment yeah it seems like something that could help All right let's go back to the phones\nBecause only thanks for calling your landlord BSN would ask the millennial\nHi Chris Bob hey Bob Bob is eighty years old by the wayside by being\nThe one now a go happy birthday thanks ...\nThank you um [noise] I have a question for your gas um are you a Democrat or a Republican\nI'm a Democrat or a Democrat Yes sir I thought so you say like it's a bad thing\nWhile a we have too many of them around here and it seems like we're getting nothing done\nBecause of them and ah you're unsure about um term limits\nI'm ... and uh it should be that way if it's good enough for the president why isn't a good enough for ... for mayor is Congress men on the wrath\nWell I think you can you ... yeah and I think I'm I'm pro term limits I just like I like I was saying I don't know what future or like how this could be tampered I don't know what it is in the constitution that\nReally the checks and balances of everything\nThe only thing that gets me is when you said that you were burning mhm how could you be for burning\nListen he sparked revolution them a lot of young voters\nUm I think a lot of the things that he said there's a difference between saying things and showing the passion and showing a that it's more than just talking points and I think with Senator Sanders that was something that was a at least relate to his voters\nHe bought I think a millennial could learn something from us I think we all can and I have certainly Bob ... why don't you tell us about your your been in business your whole life self made man you've done very well for yourself or tell tell tell the millennial in in our audience how the last since Trump has been elected how it has affected the business climate in this country\nIt's amazing I I my business in forty years and never been better one this is one that I've got another business also and that's doing well and um it's all because of the Trump\nWhat does he done to um help grow your bill is\nDone so much matter of fact uh I have a list of the things that have done because it's it's something that I have to read it off\nBut Bob explain like the ... well well but the but the capital gains stuff in ... in some of the business the things he did with the tax code\nOh you did all kinds of things I mean I'm I'm at a loss right now because I Am I reading written\nDown ... are all\nThings are you on the help the and the military and police and you name it\nWell Bob listen yet feel free if you have time to give me and you have that information available you want to give us a call back I give you a special personal copy dispensation here\nI'm from one Catholic to another I appreciate that All right Bob give us a shell back with you if you relocate that list Bob a super successful guy a really interesting um\nHe's in eighty one as you said walk six miles a day lift weights incredible shave incredible mind a and self made and he's told us he shed some stories about life growing up poor and hard or in some of those things that that really means things that I never experience I don't\nYou experienced ... anyway uh so Bob Bob the great call and I think that sometimes people deserve a a second call when they because he didn't know I'm going to ask him that he's going to ask a millennial I turned it around my turn it around asking octogenarian\nUm\nYou feel excuse me do you you are kind of optimistic about the country\nThe like I said previously I'm optimistic about the people not so much the current government state\nYeah the ah people even coming to look at you [laughter] and he learned coming to look at ... or is it a face for radio no I don't think this millennial does All right I bet he does All right yeah ... ... talk about that [laughter] that auto cabin on\nSo did did the millennials drink like the way you hear these stories about uh about bottle Kevin uh\nYeah I mean there's the the binge drinking culture of of millennial in college and high school that I assume\nDated back to the eighties as well oh yeah I'm sort of red wine is that one goes on someone bought me these thirty beers and I can't bring them home mom so I guess I'm drinking these thirty here right right what about drunk driving to millennials they've only has learned not to drop drop 'em I mean\nI Can't speak for all there is a mess but I Know the people that I'm Around during associated we always have designated driver\nYeah I'm just because\nWe just hear all the stories and we hear the past and\nThere's some were you given that education system where it was driven in your head I was just starting to get that stuff right and in the late eighties it was just kind of coming around I think you guys have grown up around it we were just told like hey don't do it on smoking cigarettes\nTo smoke cigarettes oh no I Hope not if I Want him people use those those patterns fall or whatever they could they even ... dum dum dum it's just the tobacco industry trying to poke their whole back into\nHey young kids like how cool this is right\nRight um you don't have now to a lot of millennials for yellow yeah\nIt's it's millennials and it's it's a lower to lower like um it's poking into high school again which seems to be I'm missing the past decade or so\nSo if you're just tuning in here to fourteen tornado it'd be us and we're doing a new segment called ask a millennial women actual live millennial got went over to about ... and I'm just kidding he works here Andy adoptions and the adoption center I wouldn't know or they wouldn't know the millennial cage that just passed that might be gauge\nI went down there were playing video games I took them what about video games how important a video games to millennials\nI did them I play um yeah it's a lot of fun it's a past time\nYou know we don't watch as much cable TV as as generations before we need to fill in that time ... I guess video games or find there is no have you ever felt like it might be a school shooter because you played videogames no\nI mean right simple answer no I think people are trying to uh add two plus two and make five of that sort of stuff do you ever thought about shooting up a school like that now I'm good I mean I like people\nRight I mean I just I I I feel it seems to be like as a simple answer to a very complex question what about guns millennials afraid of guns\nUm no I think we're afraid of not um\nLike having simple simple rules around getting a gun and ... gone to a gun right and your background with it but guns there they're fine there and all of our movie media everything\nJust like come on let's have some simple background checks before you buy one\nWhich is what we have here already Massachusetts I'm now in the have you have you started looking at a key obviously you're not going to vote for all kinds of human around us about that in the upcoming election ... are you starting to look at any of the candidates on the Democrats' side do you think in Bernie should run again no\nNo I think he is the the Democrats are at a very um\nScary time where a lot of their political heads are too old\nOr their demographic nobody likes Hillary Clinton a job I'm going to be too old to\nHold for years\nI think Bernie as well so it's Abbott Lew Liz Warren I'm pro Liz ... pretty much in that same age bracket yeah but she um\nShe hasn't been in she hasn't been like the long term ... and like others okay and she seems to at least fight for the same\nThings that the younger demographic are are going to be voting for a person that I was upset that I'm kinda got the boot was Senator Franken\nI thought he would have had a good um being in the intelligence committee I thought he would have had a good time with all of this Russia stuff going on or he did he was unfairly ousted no he did it on himself he fell on the sword for the party\n... and he's off that the he's afraid to fly and that does seem to be the true and it's ... ... um I think if\nYou look at the Democrat all they do it no matter who Donald Trump will bring to the table they're going to fight this guy could from any good and Democrats all they want to do is\nIs holed up if you go to our great\nYeah Democrats would stop their ridiculous nets and get on board for a better economy\nIs there

told me\nIt made a statement prompted me to ask you a question mhm the question is are the Vietnam War\nWell tested in the United states disrupt logistics operations in the north Vietnamese and the Viet Cong flight\nI didn't say they interrupted a North Vietnam you interpret the Americans they complement of the north Vietnamese the war\nThe war protesters in the usa\nHelp the flu is the war yeah absolutely specific question audit Vietnam War protesters in the usa disrupt such an important aspect of war which is logistics how do they disrupt those operations\nIn the north Vietnamese and the and the Viet Cong fighters I think it's just a very easy way to explain away the Vietnam War when it had nothing to do things occurred on the battlefield\nWhat are you talking about west I didn't say they interrupted the north Vietnamese so they interrupt the United states is war effort in general gee op has said that who's you know general gee apple is\nYeah I Do know who is you know hey I'm totally genius who truly it'll junior high question do you you are you a question is nonsensical and tell me who generally the whole country just told me you know who he was doing and so my question I'm not going to answer your question because your question isn't what I said\nWell they said is the Americans to interrupt us war effort yes can you sit in the interim head of the north Vietnamese which is ridiculous the north Vietnamese were enemy get a clue man you don't even know what you're talking about\nSo this is the problem this caller is a\nHe knows a lot [noise] we had him yesterday trying to pathetically\nInterrogate Marcus he was so embarrassing ahead end the call now this caller just I made a remark and it's it's true it's absolutely true in the north Vietnamese accredited the anti war effort in America with helping them to feed it they said we didn't win the battle on the battlefield we want in Washington DC\nA general gee op and of course that call has no idea what general ... he's pretending he does because she\nCan't admit he doesn't know something I'm very comfortable many I don't know something\nGeneral gee op was the head of the top generals of the north Vietnamese communist wherever\nThey want us to says nothing to do with what we're talking about I just happened to mention that because we're having a millennial segment about war protesters\n\nAnd putting it all out there in in qualifying everything so that I'm not don't want anyone to think I have some inside information I don't but I'm just wondering about the stuff is I think you're wondering about it\nIf they haven't asked her questions why not and is it because\nSpeaking to an FBI agent and giving false information what the government perceived to be false information can result in charge of perjury\nAs we famously know Martha Stewart right the home decorating the cooking lady you know it was remarkably funny actually to uh went to federal prison they were interviewing her about stock broker\nCase her stockbroker had done something wrong apparently they're interviewing her she made false statements to the FBI or what they proceed to be false when she ended up in federal prison she was convicted of it obviously so\nYou wonder if Christina bloody Ford who had inconsistencies write the notes that she gave the the things that are are in the notes that she gave to her\nTherapist are different than what she claims happened she said some things in her testimony to the U.S Senate that appear to be inconsistent\nI Believe the female prosecutor who questioned her has released a report that points out these inconsistencies there are there's a a former boyfriend now again you have to take it all with a grain of salt or have to measure it all ex boyfriends ex girlfriends\nThey sometimes things that aren't\nTrue can be vindictive right we know that\n\nCertainly probably all of you out there know that if you have an ex wife and her husband right is that this was an ex boyfriend who who we are led to believe said they're Christina ... who's a doctor has a PHD in psychology\nWas very well versed in the polygraph and it actually advised at least one person on how the polygraph worked\nShow as to ah\nThe polygraph when there is this to a friend who was applying for a job in the state department it was going to get an FBI investigation and going the polygraph and then she advised that person on the function of how the polygraph worked\nAnd that would be perfectly first of all perfectly legal perfectly right I think unless you're teaching tell

Aniston Alabama at Fort McClellan at the\nUS Army polygraph Institute I was used as a test dummy\nIt's probably the first job my last job was actually qualified to do it was a dummy or use their they told me what to say and I said it but I actually lived on the polygraph so if you've ever so here's the thing if you ever put me under oath and said have you ever intentionally lied under a polygraph I Would have to say yes of course I was instructed\nBy the United States Army to do that because I was being used as a training dummy\nAnd the thing was they gave me a story told me to follow the storyline and lie about it yadda yadda yadda and I was on the polygraph she suffered complex technology I didn't find it to be\nUpsetting or anything like that which is what ... Ford set to the U.S Senate remember she said that she had all these wires on her body and then it felt and they after all these questions will tend to do was to question\nAnd having experienced the polygraph it everyone feels differently about things it's really not that big of a deal they put a wire or\nAround your chest to measure your breathing in your heart rate and then they put uh some stuff on your fingers it's not that big of a deal\n[noise] um anyway if you're on hold stick around I take a very quick break but they're very quick it's the first of the month so we're very quick on

mean other than trying to tear apart ... what else do you do and it's a terrible situation to have to try to battle against her an accusation so short of course not I don't know what you think about that but\nThat's a great question yeah so I mean you know if if she if it was devastating enough to her because I mean you know things like that happened in it all depends on the individual and how
