I'm Sorry he's not the answer\nNo he's not he's he's good player he's been helpful two years in a row now and uh you know we really can't thank them enough but if he wants to be a regular he's gonna have to go somewhere else\nHow about me I heard of the day the day I stop I said I'm not defending David Price anymore I'm done with him and it comes through in a big way\nI feel like Lloyd Christmas coming around the corner with the mini bike you know a ... and then dumb and dumber when when Harry done forgave him [noise] you know he he put together a gym here six ... six is nine strike out I mean ... for life in the playoffs and he puts together a game that really may be very key\nFor the red Sox but they're much more rested bullpen now and of course the other side of the uh the world series is a terrific series going on between the Dodgers brewers they're in the ... they're going to have a game seven which is extremely exciting and and somebody will come out of that with a lot of momentum\nTalked with a rough and hired bullpen with a title rested rattled off steam\nShips kinda wow they have done these crazy maneuvers taking a guy out after pitching a third of\nIt in [laughter] yeah I Know it's how I got to say I think baseball needed the season because it's a great not because the red Sox because the red Sox have a national following and of course that's that's necessary for good ratings but\nThis series on on the other side of the ball and the super powers of the American league all matching up against each other this was good for baseball\nYeah it's it's been fun fun ride so far Ken that's for sure right\nRight well general retired at the top of the hour ah of course we're going to talk about the caravan the the march from\nCentral America heading towards the United states Donald Trump\nOr threatening with monetary punishments the Central American government's if they don't stop this I guess is that the five thousand I always a report and I got to get into the specific so um\nThat some one hundred ISIS fighters are in the Caribbean and I've been have been detained down there so we'll we'll talk about that are just who was in that group there are I'm sure lots of people who just trying to come here and work but in the mix there are some bad people that the president\nHas some inside information to the intelligence community he wouldn't have said it but uh there's you know there's there's a lot going on here and\nYou know this whole thing with ... getting murdered in Saudi Saudi\nCitizen\nWho uh went into the Saudi Arabian constantly in Turkey was brutally murdered by Saudi Arabian officials\nAnd the of course the kings thing I had no idea and one of them is already met with a an accident and I'm sure it'll be Thirteen more unfortunate incidents but of the fourteen and one is already dead from what they're saying that accident or the ... there were arrested some people they fired some people\nInteresting like the head of the Americans after my palm pale left after questioning these the Saudi Arabian government a on a visit over there the government was ... ... us was handed a hundred million dollars\nThat badly for Trump he gets a refund from a hooker and then and then the\nA hundred million dollars because some Saudi agent was well he worked for the Washington Post and ... you know all kidding aside you know journalists have to be protected internationally\nWe can't have this that's it cannot stand but I I think this is an ... al ... I mean look at the um it's it's this real bad news for the Mueller investigation of the Russian collusion a lot of evidence that this thing is just could is they could be some serious charges against the other side of this uh and\nYou know so you get the ... thing you've got the Caribbean the ... the liberal media is trying to what I call the using these stories as weapons of mass distraction\nBecause the fact is a lot of things that Trump has promised is coming through with coming up to the election season he's able to point to X Y and Z\nA you don't have to like him I look Obama was certainly not my favorite president he accomplished an awful lot as president he's got a lot through and he accomplished a lot of his goals but you can say the same thing for Trump you don't have to like what's happening but he's got an awful lot done look at the courts or look at the taxes\nAre the immigration is being enforced as a ... I mean there's a ton of things North Korea we getting American bodies back from the north Korean War for the first time\nOr just ISIS was destroyed within the first year of his tenure um ... you know so ... you don't have to like President Trump do you have to agree he's having his way and his supporters electing what he's done so far thanks for calling you're on the air\nAnd again good morning yeah as a ...\nWorth of all I Know the Mr Philips and a very high regard within the that'd be a time for a while and a ... hour though I Do disagree with him about the than it ever interference call\nIt ... the way I see it until it's I'd tell us decided either that\nOr you can or cannot play a can or cannot after ball once it crosses the line over the wall\nAnd the players are able to grab going to play in that area and get the ball out of there if you will while fan at a fair and and you allow players to cross that line above the wall and it's actually what you're you're you're you're saying is that it's a wrestling match\nOr I don't see the game on TV I don't have a TV but I listen to it on the radio\nWhat I heard fans actually attempted to close the love of of the players that correct\nOr I I think Ryan's nodding his head I I'll I'll be honest I was watching the ball and and I was in on the replay I was I was king on what it was that stopped him from either ... or I'm On the road after\nThat the one side of the glove and they attempted to hold it over to me that flows in the world going to try and do a wrestling match if you if you don't if you don't keep the fans off the player\nWell you're what you're saying is true if you're inviting a recipe to get a player injured if if people are going to come from behind them and and go after that same voice break is rest I mean a lot of things that can happen there\nYeah but I don't know what the how the rule is written my understanding was that once it crosses the plane of the wall from the bottom of the wall to the top of all if it's you know the fences four hundred feet and it goes on that one than the fans can have access to it but I I think your logic would would make sense to me\nBecause you know otherwise you're inviting you know serious injury for not just to play with the you know the the people that are also going for the ball um so I think\nThat that that'd be that may have been what was behind the call they tried to discourage families\n... have you can't again you can't let this is like um this is like the government the judges can't stand inventing rules the legislature has to win invent the rules so that the team owners have to vote for a rule and if it needs to be changed they have to do it they're empires can't do it on the on\nThe ... I think what you mean and I would agree with you is that the judges that they the umpire should should should not\nLegislature rules but in fact as as what the Supreme Court Supreme Court they are and until until the rules change to inhibit them from doing so then they will as a Supreme Court judges so that's why we have the strict interpretation is on there now\nYeah yeah I I I again I think if the rule isn't as you say it ought to be yeah yeah I gotta I gotta look\nIt up actually the ... the wrong you know the rule by the way to do that right that that's been a interfere did he did he get thrown out of no no\nI think he did not I think he just did what was natural because he was the only thing did you watch\nThe replay once where there was three guys usually the reply start up a number of times the guy the guy with the glasses you know the guy in the blue shirt okay close ... like I agree with this caller he he closed ... glove that she couldn't catch it\nAt that as a fan of difference I don't know what it he wouldn't even try to get the ball\nYou know I just closed ... glove that banks couldn't catch it\nWhen you get them is a good chance [laughter] I'm just kidding no\nI don't know if I don't think anybody was expelled white but\nIt works both ways on that point yeah I I don't believe anybody was expelled I'll do I don't think a friend\nWas either by the way you know that the\nHome run did not costumes and the game I I Know they're saying that and talk radio down in the ... or yeah it did not cost him the game if it cost them a a a tie\nBut the Sox were about eight runs that game was eight six to finally the last summer the [noise] I mean you can't definitively say how's that game was going to go because that home on happens the pitching changes a different there's so much to even you can't even go there\nSo it wasn't exactly a bill ...\n[noise] that's right that was the ... [laughter] there's no going back from that play that's that's right um\nThat and I again I always felt bad for Bob Stanley because people hated him but he got the ground ball in the in field that's his job as a single ball pitcher\nAnd he still wants to blame for Bachmann couldn't catch it so all that gets at the biggest plane but you know against the only didn't get it done is what people say about that so hey what great call I agree with the logic on how it ought to be ruled if it's not I'm gonna I'm going to actually look up the verbatim of how that's written out\nTold her a about this a relative in their recent ancestry that was half a\nCherokee Indian and so what did you come up with this last Monday the DNA test is is the president likes to call my mother a liar I don't think so and I let me explain that I don't think that it has been established for sure\nThat those with Lawrence Taylor Cormier talked about me on the radio and said well he thought he made a great point that um you know when when a family relative tells you\nSomething if your mom tells you that this happened in Japan when you take it as gold and while I agree with that it has not been established in my mind that that her mother told her anything of the sort some of her cousins had no idea about the story of a Cherokee Indian and\nAte generations back so Elizabeth Warren was born in Nineteen forty nine the average American generation is twenty five point five years so you would go back ... generations you're talking about somebody who was born in Seventeen thirty seven\nOkay at George Washington was like twelve years old at the time\n... or ten years of George one in which you know you have the the accent his hand with the cherry tree right [noise] you know anything about anybody in your family from Seventeen thirty seven no that would do social media like I get out as much a left wing nuts around here who just completely unreasonable but um and they all apparently said they came from the the Mayflower and\nIt's just it's kind of comical but anyway\nDo you know anything about your family history from Seventeen thirty seven what about Eighteen thirty seven no right or sold so Elizabeth Warren story by the way she ... she was trying to get people to feel bad for her because she said Donald Trump said\nHer mother was a liar that's not what he said he's questioning hurry not questioning about it and by the way Elizabeth Warren's story she's calling her own grandparents ultra racist\nOh her father's parents wouldn't allow\nA marriage to her mom the herrings wouldn't allow a Pauline read to come into their family because she had a she had Indian blood in there that's what her story she called her grand her own grandparents cause you see what else were racist worry about your own insults Senator Warren\nSo horrible thing to call somebody especially if it's not true I don't know if they were racist or not but I'm just one of the worst things you can call somebody who's not a racist\nBecause people don't like racist and if you're not a racist you should not be called one I don't know but I doubt here's my point I doubt very strongly that Elizabeth Warren knew about somebody being half Indian and her family a generations back in Seventeen thirty seven\nI doubt very much that the herrings who entertain the idea of their son marrying this woman Pauline read who's ... was it was born mom\nI doubt they were so concerned about the Indian blood from somebody born in a generations back and this woman coming into their family I\nImagine they would have any idea that this was the case and as far as this family lore this this uh this has been passed on the all new not only is it not plausible but you go back to the family or her family history as they were up in Missouri\nAnd uh\nEighteen twenty four we can go back to in her relatives survived the um [noise] the rounding up of Indians who sent down to Oklahoma from Missouri and Eighteen thirty eight\nSo nobody thought that there were there was a nobody thought that the\n... that her relatives at that point going back Ninety seven years now had any Indian blood so if someone was born in Seventeen thirty seven and you go forward a generations and there's going to be a wedding in Nineteen thirty one but the family objected to that person being born in Seventeen thirty seven [laughter]\nIs that remotely plausible to you and if so please call and explain\n\nShe's anywhere she ... they think they nailed it down to she's either she between one sixty fourth\nAmerican indian or one one thousand twenty fourth\nAmerican oh I shouldn't say American indian Native American that could mean South America that could mean North America I strongly doubt at the south American heritage but you never know but he generations back we're probably talking about uh you know an eastern United States\nAnd I travel connection so I'll give her all day and let's even let's get rid of the one thousand twenty fourth let's go closer to the one sixty fourth\n[noise] um if you just go by the the grandparents involved and you know four grandparents time seven generations then you have the two parents are you talking about a hundred and fourteen people will just say she's one hundred and fourteenth American indian\n[noise] if I told you that Donald Trump was one hundred and fourteenth an honest man does that make him an honest man\nWell they can't make it lives with Warren and Indian\n\nAnd live with that that's I just did that so people that can't stand the president would understand how we're looking at all is with one hand but not that we can't stand it but it's it's a ridiculous thing she brought up and just based on the reaction by prominent national Democrats who obviously have no plans to go with her camp when she runs\nA she's gonna have a very tough time getting traction on a national platform is just not enough of their lives with Warren far left um voters to harvest a when you get you have to you know she's not close to the ... I mean I I right now just looking at the Democratic challengers for twenty\n[laughter] you know I I realize that ... you know Hillary Clinton to get back in the game I doubt they go with her again I think maybe Joe Biden would be their best get bad so far I mean so they could jump up and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren oh I that's what I'm saying I don't I I don't think Elizabeth Warren's going to be a serious challenge to the Democratic\nShe's ... she's she's already started to move staffers can you know thrown in New Hampshire the strings there\nI I I'm telling you it's a catastrophic miscalculation on her part she's not going to be the nominee five oh eight nine nine six o five minute you are on the air good morning\nWandering around high or did you watch it right\nI wasn't able to I read a lot of it um but for you or your thoughts\n... ... ...\n... how did he come across because they're going to try to paint him as you know I'm Westboro Baptist right wing super racist intolerant chauvinists kind of guy that's how they're going to do it uh it and they always do that in Massachusetts Scott Brown from the governor\nI mean I I mean I I met Jeff deal I Know Geoff Diehl um now he's been waiting and I'm from ... I'm going to tell you he's he's a good guy and I think he's a good brand I I don't know how the media is going to react I'm ... and the way that you and I I I can say that they won't react the way you and I might be on\nIt going to be very much supportive and cover you know give her the political cover adults real throughout this whole process\nWhere she ... she moved her hands are not\nWell what about how was your content was what did you ever see making any valid points but the content\n... not as far as I'm concerned because she was again a ice and police\nThat and the other and a big edge oh ... ... I ... it was indoor by it and I'm and I'm just very something like ...\nI'm like yeah two feet on the ground\nIdeas on how to read I you know of course I'm going to watch it I have yet to watch it but as I said I\nWatched in listens and I've read is the social media friend of mine um we know a lot of the same people where we grow up\nIt was great but like I say good well let's be more of these debates to and I'll be voting farm for a while [noise] All right All right thank you thank you sir I I got to tell you\nMy concern is how easily they dispose of Scott Brown who is very much liked\n[noise]\nAnd I think there's room to go after her you know she talks about how and I wrote about this uh if you go to W.

B. S. M.\nFifty nine degrees in New Bedford ... be as a news stay up to date with New Bedford news talk station fourteen twenty to be as them and get breaking news alerts with the W. B. S. M. F.\nAnd Taylor Hi Ken so talking about this Elizabeth Warren thing and I know you and I had a conversation in the hallway ... and I think it made a rather good point that\nYou can't blame Elizabeth Warren from mom told her that she is of a certain heritage it you don't question it as a child just say well I guess so because that's that's the book of records for your family lore but I think\nWhat is in question is\nDid her mom actually tell her that\nBecause some of her cousins don't know what they until this all happened they didn't know what she was talking about I never heard about an Indian and their heritage and things like that that are\nCousins grow up in her household\nNot in the hospital and it never came up at a family get togethers anything like that but\nSo I'll tell you a little bit about my family is somebody\nUh I was told when I was a child that I also have Native American blood in me okay and my cousins were told the same thing of the same side of my my mother's side of the family and uh going you know we we don't have too many family records I've never really been interested enough frankly I don't play that much importance on my heritage\nUm but somewhere down the line where supposedly a small percentage of Blackfoot Native American\nNow how far back does that go\nCould be as many as I Believe it was my grandmother's rent other\nSupport generations uh yes for generations back All right and we have to imagine going back another hundred and four years that somebody in your era what would it have any ... any any knowledge of that\nYeah that would be tough I mean can you can you name any thing about a family member from Eighteen thirty seven [noise] no I cannot write or or or certainly not Seventeen thirty seven right\nAnd it's amazing it I go to ... a lot of yard sales and stuff you'll find family bibles that are for sale and they actually have these family record mind whose owned the Bible got your uh that's an easy way to track your family and\nYeah it's amazing though that if you have the discipline to make sure each generation feels about\nA it is it's kind of cool and and of course the Baptist records ... are really some of the only things people can go back to Europe and and figure out who's who right right um unless you come from a ... as you know certain manifest like the Mayflower mhm or your your father or grand ... our our mothers are ... somebody was governor or significant historic\nA person but you still don't know a lot about the people that their kids their grandkids are great grandkids are going forward from something like that\nThat just to prove my my small and significant point here I took that when I was a kid that knowledge of my parents telling me\nI had a small percentage and I did a whole presentation to the class of what is ... and ah you know you learn a little bit about the answer and not be ancestry but they're a customs and and their origins ah and I purported myself on that culture day to be Native American or give it some some small part\nIt's always said don't be wrench\nDopey print is how we were returned his his Twitter says don't be friends\n[laughter] wants\nTo control a U.S politicians with daddy's money can't do it when I get elected hashtags Trump\nTwo thousand I mean do you want um did you want to go back and for the Trump reminds me um you know it it it only gets nasty when somebody's nationally him but he you know those are the carnivals those guys that sit in the water tank with a clown makeup on and they they harass you until you throw the ball and saw and drop them in the tank and he'd have been a great one of those guys I mean ... she is off the cuff fantastical insults\nYes it is that you want to get actually and\nUm and he hits home he reminds me of a like a bad boy everybody like the ...\nOr they should you should finish every one of his tweets with high and dry\n[laughter] [noise] um I also wanted to bring to your attention there's an article out a friend of mine sent it to me I've been looking all different kinds of articles of this put it all into one I've been finding out a gun is\nGoing to go ahead with this to log I\nKnow this is about Jim out ... okay um the the ugly\n... the name of the article you can find many sources but the by Daniel Greenfield\nWho is like well you summarized it so I don't want you to read I Want you to summarize it formed okay\nWell it's the it's the articles name and this is why I say the name of the ugly terror truth\nAbout ... ...\nYou know it was he a journalist he was a jihadist propagate\nAnd they tell you his history of how he ... bin Laden and he dealt with a\nUm they did they get the ... our Treasury Department has like a guy's name who is your biggest terrorists I mean here and he was associated with him and the and the and it tells you to his home association and how hypocritical the the media is oh saying he's a journalist like that this thing\nWell but no but ... but not in this is interesting what you're saying because they're not just saying he was just a journalist and they were saying that he was highly critical of the um of the religious enforcement of laws instead of a secular more understanding\nA passive passive government that flies in the face of what you're saying because of John us would may run in line with what the Saudi Government does exactly\nAt no he was he was big time into Muslim Brotherhood and the Muslim Brotherhood users terrorism\nYou know we saw with the Muslim Brotherhood did to Coptic Christians in Egypt once Obama help them get the power shore\nYeah he yeah they that's not our caller points out that they conveniently forgot to convert in his press and other pressed upon the Islam is that they were you know burning tobacco people Christian Coptic Christians in churches um they\nYeah he had that huge history of being very much in Islam pushing ... and the Muslim\nRight I'm going to cause I don't I don't I'm not familiar with the reporter I'm going to absolutely look into this and let's let's carry this over the next week I I you know I'm going to do my research on this because this flies ... one\nLess thing yeah there was this is a bigger story than people think because it's going to expel a certain thing like I\nCouldn't leave 'cause I could have been calls me I didn't have the\nDeep state problem they have a deep state problem and that general was part of the deep state I CIA and FBI ah got the ... to release that the one who's involved now in the murder\nOkay okay I Can't thank you and also one of them met with an unfortunate accident already thanks for winning you're on the air\n[noise] yeah I think that was Kim in ... that just tells you explains what's going on with this guy ... most American probable even have the stomach for that right there would be like yeah yeah yeah whatever\nUnfortunate that this guy how we got murdered is what anybody cares about but we didn't care about the people in Benghazi I don't understand why this is such a big story like why is everyone all worked up the guys in a U.S citizen and he threw a couple of buzz words in his reporting democracy and then all of a sudden the left of races\nWell don't forget that but he he's he's part of one of the prince of a liberal media to the Washington Post so that's that's one thing and you know somehow this is the fault of Donald Trump if you read enough of the the mainstream media coverage is Donald ... and\nThat's in there there's the there's the money lines are right there but you know\nI didn't get to see so I don't know what's going to happen there and I went in and his father was an arms deal or whatever the guy's dirty but you know because it makes Trump book bad it's but it's good but I didn't see the debate last night with um Elizabeth Warren and deal how did it end up going\nYou know that that makes two of us because I was working but I'll tell you this ah from what I everybody saying deal shocked and and it was like a ... round um\nIs she did not have a good night's is in basically all she wanted to do was talking about Donald Trump and deals reminding her look yeah we know you're running for the White House you don't care about Massachusetts but this is about Massachusetts I'm running for Senate or a senator from Massachusetts\nAnd that's not surprising is that Elizabeth Warren speaks in platitudes anyway it's oh it's all about you know the game was rigged you didn't feel that ah Donald Trump's a horrible person you know women's power but there is no issues there's nothing substantive with her your ... and a lot of other politicians on both sides right and\nThen she'll eat we we do have to get to the\nTo the to the facts but I Wonder if it's enough in Massachusetts I really do think that would send the ...\nOn both sides right and then she'll eat we we do have to get to the to the facts but I Wonder if it's enough in Massachusetts I really do think that would send a clear message to the ... not that they would get it that hey it's about issues\nIt's about American about security it's about more money in your paycheck it's that stuff it's about getting rid of you know we're trying to do the best you can against illegal immigrants I Do think that the public is waking up I don't know about the public in Massachusetts but [laughter] I mean we did have the Scott heard round the world I\nDon't know if we can do well I think the the ... honestly the reason that Scott Brown won a ... number one she had a couple of bad radio interviews which had a small parts to do with it but she but Scott Brown resonated with a pickup truck\nWhile she was saying you know God I'm not gonna go on to shake hands with Bruins fan my God what's one of the thing I Am that kind of thing but also more importantly the national Republican Party brought operatives here to make sure the notion and against to make sure that the every polling booth was covered\nAnd you know so the entire resources of the Republican Party where in Massachusetts for the for the one time that it was because of that special election and we don't have enough\nOr people in the eyes on the prize is you know during the general election when when they can't donate that sort of extra ... a help to the state\nRight and you know I just think of\nI put everything in the conflict is good for America or bad for America or good for Massachusetts are bad and I just look at those two candidates\nAnd I say if we put the warrant is is that better for all the working people here in this state or would would be a better\nThat this is almost ... this is almost a Hillary Trump thing in that are well certainly Jeff is not nearly as controversial but\nUm it it's almost as though you you've got somebody that you know you're getting and you know she's not a great US Senator she's she didn't she talks about banks doesn't really talk about Massachusetts has not helped the fishing fleet Massachusetts has not helpful river with their with their soaring water issues and that's her job and he's been ignoring that I haven't gotten really integrate from that because it's all Democrats over there they don't they don't dare\nYou know talk badly about if it's her fault\nOr that no federal money coming in to help with that terrible situation and um you know deal is an unknown I don't know if he's going to be a great senator I think he is but you know what you're getting more and so it's almost the same construct as the as the Hillary and Trump's election\nYeah and you know it's funny a coot or yesterday was hard on banker which is probably rightfully so not really endorsing them saying if it's going to vote for the ticket\nThat not all bad moment for the governor there are more for the indoors so certainly\nIt's a bad is it a bad situation for Republicans in the state I don't understand why\nWell let me Charlie Charlie relies on some democratic votes and so he knows he's it's almost a third rail for him to to to remind people he's a Republican but I mean he can't he can't go that far he endorsed the guy\nUh yeah I mean he just said the ticket he hasn't said favorable things about or or negative he's just been down in the middle on that and that this tells me the ... and they got plenty of of baggage whether you believe the situation with the sun the state police as a travesty I don't know if you\nCould say that on a ... well he certainly had no business getting into the Kavanaugh saying well his son faced a more oh credible allegations\nRight again the hypocrisy right now I'm just like one has\nUm ... and you know you're sort of given her a little air cover earlier I mean he used to say my ... and then she said well my great great great great great great grandmother how does she should've said my great great great great great\nTap on the third power [laughter] loses use that and and and\nYou know what Harvard was perfectly normal doing it and that's the bad thing about quotas you're right\nMaybe somebody really really good\nUm you know got slighted spot you would David Chapelle fan or not really\nA lot of damage to play with David Chapelle if you can believe it was was doing ... where he was George Bush and a reporter said did you wouldn't be in Iraq for the oil and he looked\nAround like wow it's so fast you know and it was just a funny thing is that reminded me when they were interviewing Howard ... says well we give her the job because he was in it but at the same thing in my mind you know [laughter] that's a good very good phone call I got to move on but\nYeah I think again thank you sir okay thank you All right your next good morning\nHi good morning to you sir Hi this is Elizabeth\nWarren thing I got a uh a few quick points\nFirst of all\nIf I were in her shoes ... well let me let me change that I Want to start by saying that if anybody thinks she took this DNA to\nI don't know what you're talking about if I've really been a suggestion but I don't think we all would fall out that she\nWas great it was great that one I think Dan is epic Red Sox normal thing yeah [noise] yeah I mean does the guy loves the game of what\n\nI mean it was a ... I mean so much weight on that catch if he does it make to catch doesn't make the case because that games or if he doesn't make the catch gets behind him gang first base rounding seconds got a clear\nThe bases and that game's over and then the series might have had a different momentum\nOnly sound [laughter]\nFantastic now in New Orleans has to isn't it I mean and\nThat's my favorite [laughter] All right\nUm I I feel good about it going to Jackie probably that's an honorable mention joke is that when he falls outside of that [noise] I Can't imagine um did you see the pictures they they tweet us ... new chair designs a Sox organization had a little fun with them no I haven't oh yeah very safe chair with a lot of\nYou know on a ... interview the vice president of a baseball operations for the red Sox ... any he asked him he goes who do you want to see in the world series and the guy goes hey we have the three best teams in America we\nKnow the American league despite the superpowers are in the American um but that doesn't mean in a seven game series they that that better team can can just expect to win and when it when does game seven tonight\nFor the national league I think it's that I yeah because well it could be Tuesday but I think it's tonight because the world series starts Tuesday yeah I Know I Know it should be Tony and by the way the world series they are cramming do seven games in a very small window of time this is not a spread out a schedule I got to be playing one right after the other I think there's I think there's I'm\nIn a seven games that might be I think it's nine days maybe at the most in between um from one day to the next while it's over it's absolutely over what's the date what's the what's the ... ... ... what's the date on Tuesday\nOr a\nWell today's today's Saturday the twenties so the twenty third twenty third is the twenty third is Tuesday the ... game seven is scheduled for October thirty first wrong it seems like an eight days there's only a one day break wow I've never seen anything like this I don't believe or the play the world so you're not a nice I'm thinking ... last\nYear they had like three or four three or four days in between\nGames\nLike between game two and three they would give them like two days off\nIt's actually it's actually nineties it's nine days like I said I obviously because but it's still one one game on the other\nPretty interesting ... expect I went to like [noise]\nI don't know I was wide open I Want to see the brewers I Do I Want to see him I'm I'm very happy for the brewers they never get involved and the Dodgers had him for some pretty good teams lately um they have the better talent they also have a bunch of problems in inside the locker room but no I'm happy for this procedure I'd like to see them advance\nTo UC ... if you see the Bruce how they ended the regular season ... ... ... ... oh yeah and like everybody I worked for like a hundred ...\n... is it going into the playoffs he had one ... another oh right yeah and I'm there to put\nThere to play the um playing games just to be in the playoffs and how they've already lost three of six though actually no they want they won they won the central that's right but the last three of the last six so a cooling off yeah I'm a [laughter] um I watch one of the games I think it was like game two or three\nA who's a manager from Milwaukee council credit counseling yep you pose a picture after five pitches can in the first and\nYeah it's uh I'm like well he's got a lot of grief also agree there what do you do yeah well he's I understand but I mean he's he's won when lord of the world series I think I think it's a lot of pressure on them I don't know if that was his best decision but um\nThat that ball club never gets this far and they are on the ... I really think that the that's the Cinderella story of the year that they should advance because uh\nIt just seems to me the Dodgers took them a little lightly and realize that they are in a heck of a fight here and uh I think it's more pressure on the Dodgers today yeah did you see did you see the play by my ...\nWhen he kicked her first ... yeah I'm like oh\nAre you serious so I went to the doctor gave her senior night at the uh dealt with high school diamonds having a terrible year\nUm it's just that there's there's no blocking this the front lines of very undersized and overwhelmed is not a lot of depth on the team is a very bad year for dealt with football coach what usually does a good job or they're not competing\nAnd a boy that bar the partial them they're they're good but they were I mean every other play was it a a personal followers ... you know there's no does it went on that same\nBit they rebuilt can\nYeah you know I'll tell you what though I'm ... I I don't like the size of the teams coming up uh the decline of interest in football um you know with the pop on a lake which I coached and was a a parent or for years there I see the decline yea this um\nThis I'm a concussion information that's coming up I don't think parents are I'm aware of the big changes that have been made to teaching in tackling and it is\nGot it's got to be I Would predict four or five hundred percent more safer or more safe than maybe Fifteen Years ago I remember getting yelled at\nWhen I played 'em up in Brockton I remember getting yelled at for not putting my head into the into the tackle you know head on had yeah they they yeah they get you know grabbing a face mask\nYou know don't move your head out of the way stick it in their um that's how that's how you were taught and boy was that I knew it was a bad idea I could I I felt that [laughter] I'll go um but now that now you hit us up using your arms you using your you do you're doing it much differently\nAnd I think it's only going to continue on that trend and the old school as they can lay meant and say what are we doing to in touch and there was an argument to be made that it's certainly not just the physical but it it is safer\nUm you know we don't want to learn about NFL veterans committing suicide because they couldn't get rid of the headache that lasted for twenty five years and that has that's been happening so\nI'm a parents read some of this stuff and they don't want their their their son's involved and I get it but I think they need to be kept up with what's going on at the the the coaching\nUm you know the seven I was there every coach has to go to there's there's techniques they have to learn and they have to teach making that much safer game so I you know\nI mean like I said I have I have four sons and uh I I watched at that perfect time because the information was during their playing years um the transition to a much safer system is is happening so I I just think you should take a look at it if you have any interest at all and is still asking questions [noise]\nUm but but to answer your question I think there's a drop in football interest in ... it's unfortunate because they they started getting a good tradition there\nKnew were just talking about ... I I just got to say congratulations to pass it after the it's the ... the quarterback or Williams I'm happy for housing remember there are no\nGood ... you know I met him a couple of times at the YMCA

very happy finally they won the big three over this\nNo you've got to be defeated um come on ... have you seen rock them play this year 'cause I Know but I Know it's one of the worst teams in history
