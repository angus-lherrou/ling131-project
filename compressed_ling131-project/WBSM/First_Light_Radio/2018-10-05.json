[noise] well uh you know\nIf that could cause them to change the hours and fly him back I mean that anything could happen we've had situations before they hold held a crucial floor votes open for hours and hours while they're waiting for a Senate or fly back home district\nOh one one such case of senator a lost a parent\nA pet pair that passed away and we got the funeral and they waited for him to come back on their plate said yes\nYes so you know um this is this is a lackey situation and I'm getting stranger by the minute\nHe he said here and I quote a that a GOP leaders caught have literally not said how they will manage his absence for the vote now the clock is ticking so they actually have a schedule that they're supposed to follow so we have a I guess a tell us about the first procedural vote today\nThe first procedural vote isn't about five hours from now and er here on the east coast five hours from now\nYes yes and uh it it's called cloture it's procedural it's a a\nIt's a hurdle that has to be able to come before they can go to the final vote cloture is basically a motion to end debate in other words it sets the parameters for the debate set the hard and time and the heart and time is thirty hours and they like to say thirty hours post cloture right so if we do the math\nThat means that the final vote than after this thirty hours will\nCome on Saturday but now with the speed dating situation or that kind of throws a monkey wrench into the whole\nThing maybe now they're going to be doing the wedding during the Saturday morning brunch or something and then hop on a plane so the thing about cloture vote which is now it happens I mean it's not it's not like a regular thing but it does happen often enough where they have to be concerned\nThat somebody might vote for cloture just to move the process along but not then go vote the way the leadership wants them to on the final vote so it's possible we could see\nYou know all the Republican senators vote for cloture just to keep this process moving and then maybe still vote against Kavanaugh when it comes to the final vote so maybe people shouldn't get too excited about what happens today\nThe only thing that would uh be very interesting in terms of culture of keeping in mind what you just said is if they don't get enough votes\nOr ... when it fails ... then what is the what are they knew that if the Venice just isn't just over at that point\nIt is over at that point they cannot proceed to a final vote if they did not get cloture first\nNow you've been up on the hill and you've been I guess a feeling the feeling the heat and all the uh the strife up their attention now\nI've heard some people say that the Democrats want this thing over more than the Republicans do do you get that feeling\nI think everybody's tired of it\nI think that the Democrats are in a situation now where they're still vehemently opposed to this nominee that if if he does get confirmed that they can use that in the midterms I'm as a campaign rally if he doesn't get confirmed they can use that in the midterms as a campaign\n[laughter] well it seems like a this whole nomination thing is turning some Senate races around and it may cost them there was a small chance but they at least have had a shot at taking control of the Senate if seems to be hurting that because\nIt's turned out the Republican base the Republicans their their enthusiasm are waiting to see as him grapple Democrats as pretty much closed which means that\nIf you are in some of those swing states they'll probably not swing this time if the Republicans turn out as much as the Democrats will\nAnd maybe they're just hoping that people will forget about this and go back to being complacent by the time or the election comes along [noise] well yeah\nI mean anything is possible that it seems like you know this whole thing has energized both the conservative base of the Republican Party and the Democratic base of the Democratic party because they really really are very emotional and have very strong feelings about the situation\nCylinder we're coming up at about sixteen before the hour so I Want to quickly have you describe how this a reading of this and it's not really an investigation it's really just a supplemental investigate a supplemental background check report it's not really an investigation they just took some information of course the Democrats say well you did an interview about twenty or thirty people who are witnesses and have things to say\nSome of these people have actually been calling in and writing and trying to get in our waving hey FBI over here you got to talk to me I Know stuff and the FBI of course did not do it not because they probably didn't want to but because it seems as if we're getting conflicting reports\nOf the White House is saying that well you know there was a senator has told us to to do or who to interview and the senators are saying we had nothing to do with it so we'll\nWe'll find out when the books are written what's the what the story is there but but tell us\nThis information was transmitted up to the U.S up to the Senate what senators have to do to see this\nA it's a very unusual situation or because of the uh heightened emotions in this particular nomination they've decided that the senators a coup by the way are probably still reading the report right now are are going to a secure room in the Senate\nOr the capital of visitors and around the Senate side of the a\nVisitor center uh it's usually used for intelligence\nBriefing to secure a room and it's called skiffs and that that that's an acronym I don't know exactly what that stands for because it just flew out of my head but uh [laughter] the\nYou know as soon as I Know what security isn't there a facility is the last word I forgot what the other ones are for\nExactly basically for going of silence exactly exactly for those of you remember that [laughter]\nI Do I gave away objects because I'm very old [laughter]\nWell they go into this gift a one hour increments there's only one copy of the report be shared by all one hundred senators\nI read or if they were reading aloud to each other\nYeah there's a conference room in their um they've been sitting around the conference table and they've been a reading aloud different sections to each other or they have they're allowed a there's a link to a certain number of people who are cleared to go into the skiffs\nAnd it includes like one eight and a and the senators themselves and yeah that's how they're doing it they're going and then this one hour increments they are uh sharing this one copy\nAnd uh and it's it's ... it's a very unusual situation that not all that they can take notes but they can't bring the notes out with them they can't take any copies of the report itself out with them\nA Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia Democrat who's running for reelection and red state West Virginia\nA was a ... he came out of the skiff yesterday and he was was the kind of he had sort of in a painful look on his face when I asked by reporters you know what are you going to do and he said\nI haven't decided I'm going back again to read it tomorrow morning that would be now and ... and uh he could be in there right now\nAll right well I I understand some of the senators may end up voting before they are allowed in there to see it although uh I I Would assume that maybe they're maybe they have kept it open all night it's very interesting to find out such cloak and dagger mystery I mean it's it it gives you the sort of a of a\nCeremonial aspect ceremony or what's the word I'm looking for a minute food it makes it more dramatic you know when you're dealing with things like this and now you've got to go into a secret room somewhere and you know every one copy and you can you know and they're not supposed to talk about this the public is not supposed to know what is in this report but I think\nBoth sides do want to release it so they were going to Republicans going to say look see there's nothing in there and the Republicans can say look there's nothing in\nThere so [laughter] yes yes exactly exactly it's\nIt's it is very cloak and dagger it is very unusual um\nNormally uh FBI background checks on judicial nominees are kept private because there's some personal information at their um you know Social Security numbers things of that nature that they'll on public but the Democrats really wanted this to be made public with those personal items redacted that of course was rejected\nRight Linda
