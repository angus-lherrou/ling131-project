S. it's added more American Jobs in the past decade than any other company move like this often causes other companies to follow suit in order to compete for employees Carney said that's what they hope will happen\nAnd this is really about America's workforce and uh you know we've seen a\nWages depressed for a long time and uh they're beginning to end up\nAmazon is also going to begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nYou know at seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour or Amazon Fifteen dollar floor is now more than twice the federal minimum wage and hopefully Congress will take action to raise that\nSenator Sanders introduced a bill last month called the stop based those act ... found that Amazon the legislation would tax large employers when their workers need to rely on public benefits like food stamps Michael\nThank you Steve cast and bomb and Bernie is happy about this by the way he put out a statement saying it was a wonderful thing and Jeff Bezos responded by thanking senator he says we're excited about this and also hope others will join in\nIn fact they are as a as Steve mentioned they're going to start putting some pressure on Congress to lift the national minimum twenty nine states now have their own minimum wages which are higher than the federal standard of seven dollars and twenty five cents\nThe Amazon median pay last year was a twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars and that comes out to\nThirteen dollars in sixty eight cents an hour right now how they're going to need to attract a hundred thousand seasonal employees as the holidays are the holiday shopping season gets underway very very soon it's a very tight labor market the unemployment rate you know below ... percent fewer people are looking for jobs\nAnd usually when you have the similar economies very tight employment markets wage hikes follow\nAnd uh you know it's the law of supply and demand I guess and the workers are\nBoth the supply and demand so I guess they can call the shots right now so what do you think is it is it a good idea to do this should we be um or be happy that the company is doing that is this part of some plot somewhere a lot of people are always suspicious you know because Amazon\nIs increasingly investing and automation so in the long run and by the way they say this will cost them about a billion dollars a year\nOr you know that's a lot of money but uh you know they make a lot of money so they can afford that they can either pass on prices to consumers or as time goes on and they do more and more automation I think it's inevitable they will actually have fewer employees on the line and in their warehouses and I believe that's where most of the employees at a\nAt Amazon worked they worked in the shipping development and shipping area and they're in warehouses and shipping and that's where a lot of those jobs are not like a places like Walmart where people are working in stores and dealing with customers and that sort of thing this will also put pressure on Walmart which of course is one of the biggest competitor to uh\nTo Amazon right now or they've been locked in combat for years they're they're both trying to uh become number one and uh as as Amazon has dominated e commerce and that is heard Wal Mart Walmart is now getting into e commerce they're both getting to the grocery

get your phone dialing finger in shape call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six were talking about Amazon raising its minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all of its workers fulltime part time seasonal\nOr what have you is that a good idea you know they really kind of have to do that because we listen to this\nUh in July there were seven hundred fifty seven thousand a retail job openings across the United states that seven hundred fifty seven thousand open jobs that employers can't still because they can't find people\nThat's about a hundred thousand more of these retail job openings and existed a year ago that's according to something I saw in the wall Street Journal\nAnd unemployment is low a three point nine percent in August so companies have to do something you know it's a a shrewd strategy I Would think on Amazon's part to get some workers in there and uh they have um\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand employees plus a hundred thousand seasonal workers that has a lot of folks who will have more money to spend on buying things on Amazon so let's find out what folks think about that let's go down to prove to guard a Florida good morning Peter\nGood morning how are you today I'm feeling pretty good and yourself\nFine a matter of fact I'm a business owner of presidents like business right now oh can you speak\n... so you must have to put in long hours to run your own business\nAbsolutely absolutely I think it's hard for him to raise rates market demand but\nOurs is certainly going up and I encourage etiquette very disturbed by the second part of the news stories that I've heard that after they do say they're going to get the support a mandatory raise the minimum wage law I think that that's the problem\nThat I Wonder if they're doing that because they just think it's a good idea or because it would give it a level playing field so that the other organizations have to do the same thing in a might be harder for them\nThat's exactly right they are going to do it in order to crush the competition that does have the cash in order to raise their wages but\nYeah it's one of those you know it's it's it's just one of those things as you know as you pull from one and you pull it away from another and it's like whack a mole and it's just it's very very difficult to figure out where the sweet spot is on these things and I know economists argue over it for decades and decades and politicians argue over it so uh\nI guess what's good for Amazon is good for Amazon we'll see if it's good for the country in business in general anyway listen I Know you have to get to work and you know you're the backbone of the country what you're doing so we appreciate that thank you for that and thanks for the call call back again
