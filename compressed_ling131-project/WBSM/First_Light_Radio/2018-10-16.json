Kaylee heart tongue on the history of Sears\nLong time since ... transformed the way Americans shocks me back in the late Eighteen hundreds in Minnesota\nRichard fears was ending his days as a railroad ... until one day he still watches from local jewelry\nAnd realized he was really good at selling selling in Eighteen and sex he started a mail order company not our W steers watch company and eventually hired a wants to make her advocacy wrote them and in Eighteen Ninety three Sears, Roebuck and co was born\nHere then became a very successful mail order catalogue company this business model broke\nThe mold remember most Americans were living in small towns with access to only a few stores they often made their own clothes furniture or did without fears early catalogs only feature watches and jewelry the\nLeast catalog for more than five hundred pages long people could buy anything from issues wagons stove musical instruments sometimes people even bought their home directly from the earth and because of fears about in both the company was able to charge customers lower prices\nIn Nineteen twenty five years opened its first retail location in Chicago and it wasn't just

at the twentieth century came to a close so to tears rain\nKelly heart tongue on the story the rise and fall of Sears an American institution I uh I didn't really use the catalog myself growing up I think we had them in the house because they were just come to your house automatically once a year\nAnd Sears didn't shipped their purchases right to your home the way Amazon does now your order would come to the local catalog store which I Believe was different from the department store and then they would call you and you would go pick it up\nAnd uh but I I Do remember flipping through it and you can look at all the toys and things in their page after page after page and it would give you some ideas about things that you might want to ask your parents for\nAt least that was my experience and uh\nI don't think I uh I think I think occasionally I might have been brought there for a first day of school clothing but uh I remember other stores perhaps that might have been closer to our home but the thing is\nAbout a hundred and forty two of them are closing and also k-mart stores now there are also closing a bunch of k-mart stores Kmart doesn't seem to have the same hold on the imagination I'm not sure why that is maybe\nIs it wasn't around as much or maybe it was more regional sometimes at least in years past\nBut a Sears owns Kmart and the k-mart stores are going down the tubes along with the parent company SERE so it's pretty good chance that as we sit here a year from today they will not be Kmart or Sears does that matter to you\nDo you have memories of it the miss
