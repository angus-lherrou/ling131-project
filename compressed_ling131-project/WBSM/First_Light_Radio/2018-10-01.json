life this morning we're talking with you about the investigation by the FBI Rio\nFrank or a nominee Brett Kavanaugh so and the FBI is investigating now but at its most basic this is not illegal situation is not really a court of law it's a battle for public opinion so how does an investigation fit into this loss ask retired FBI supervisory agent James Elliana James\nSo so people have said that it is it is not a court of law and they're they're a hundred percent accurate there but look our laws are predicated on our social mores on our culture on our you know how we\nHow we live as a society [noise] um I Believe as I Know every FBI agent every prosecutor beliefs that people are entitled to the presumption of innocence and due process I understand that this is a job interview it is not you know this is not a criminal case\nBut I just fear that going forward you know if something like this if you can make an allegation and he did it cannot be it cannot be substantiated\nWe're going to move into a pretty dark place because\nNobody remembers that the FBI investigated it needed hills charges back in Nineteen Ninety One they put together a report and the reports that they could not substantiate any of them they interviewed people that are part of education where she and Clarence Thomas work\nThey interviewed people at equal Employment Opportunity commission where both work and they could substantiate it it was given to the White House and obviously the proceedings move forward and Justice Thomas made it to the court\nBut people still recalled those days and say well people just didn't believe or or the that she wasn't given you know she wasn't\nTaken seriously but no one ... gets the charges and that's going to be what's going to happen here nothing\nEven if the FBI investigate Seuss and nothing comes of this are not able to corroborate her ... any of it I fear that you know justice Kavanaugh is going to be is reputation is danger solely in perpetuity whether or not he makes it on the court that's a political decision and I don't weigh in on those things\nBut I think it is going to be [noise] not a good idea going forward if we move into this realm now where the presumption of innocence is taken for granted\nAnd we don't give people due process so that's just my opinion is that old\nSeason it was an FBI agent looking at this now as a as a as just a U.S citizen\nAnd I guess you have that right and we are also injure appreciate the fact that you are speaking with the voice of experience retired supervisory FBI agent James ... coming up on sixteen before the hour now let's go to the phones and take your calls David I understand you are in Washington DC or the state\nUh that's the state well good morning very early morning I'll go down in LA so what do you think about that\nLike about almost three o'clock out here yeah anyway I think that the this uh\nUh investigations to go forward the FBI because this is criminal and I noticed that used to have is that your limitations is seven years or a sexual assault no more it's the same as murder there's no statute of limitations at all\nAnd I and I agree with that total it if they say that I've been there for the night\nSo you want to go on if they come back in a couple of days and so you know we're we're we're finding some leads now and we'd like another week or two would you rent them out or do we want to just say look you know you've had your time cut it off bet\nThat they go on as long as it happens to\nAll right just laid out mountains is a brass that that\nThey're innocent or guilty of this a sexual assault that he's been accused of\nAll right thank you David in Washington presented the call a quarter before the our good morning Jesse you are in the Lone Star state good morning\nMorning you're on the answer yes or no I just wanted to see this is ridiculous\nAnd this woman will be coming up with these charges thirty six years ago and it's just ridiculous\nI mean it it ... it is a long time but you know it seems to be the the generally accepted opinion now by people who study these things legal people people who work in the ... as health professionals mental health professionals\nAnd even most of society now is just coming to grips with the fact that this is how this kind of thing works that it takes for women a long long long time to be able to deal with this and come forward with it\nAnd so we know we may not those of us who have not suffered may not understand it but I think we have to appreciate it\nAnd that's where we are that's the that's the world we are in now and uh for better or worse that's the situation that the FBI has to do or even you know they're up against it because they've got to track down thirty six year old leads which is which is difficult they do have a bit of a road map now with the calendar and that ah\nThat ah the nominee a judge Kavanaugh turned over so maybe that will give him give give him some help so anyway thanks for the call appreciate it let's go up the coast of Massachusetts Good morning Richard\nHello Richard you're on the honor the money yes the ... well I think that the the uh\nInvestigations continue even if it goes tests the week I think that ah Christine Blasey Ford was incredibly credible and I ended up in the Republicans knowing they absolutely knew it and that's why they dispensed with the Arab prosecutor about asking questions\nThat okay we're going back and we're going to go after the\nDemocrats with a meat cleaver and talk about how this is a conspiracy but say six year thing or thirty eight year thing you know I mean all of these priests are accusing a presenter accused of sexually molesting boys and a lot of cases that's twenty or thirty is\nAll or even more but didn't end so let's believe them no no that's not the way it works she's a woman and she was a very credible evidence a witness and I I certainly believe her and I think it's absolutely would posit that people will say we shouldn't ... you know we should just have the vote and and then put them on the court\nWhen in fact he may be somebody who are certainly somebody who attacked\nHer and he may have been involved in some of these other cases so I think they absolutely need to do their level best to investigate\nAll right appreciate the call let's go to South Dakota good morning Dave checking in from the heartland\nPi Day earnings\nI'd say a refrain from calling people's\nIdiots and that kind of stuff but the AOL this whole thing has such a sham a her just loyalists shot falls and everything else you've got people that claim that her friend was later\nAnd she is saying no I was a ... so anyhow I just don't believe her I don't believe a and I've done a lot of ... women that that rate and yes it takes a long time for some of them are bringing it up\nAnd uh you know it's just a situation here where the Democrats are trying to run the staying out as long as they in because they think are overrun or a house and Senate\nThe question of timing is interesting because both both sides are trying to manipulate the clock here the or the ... the Senate Republicans want to get this over what they'd like to start calling procedural votes by the end of the week to advance the nomination and we know\nWhy that is they're trying to present the base voters river or with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court which you know for the for the I mean that is a reasonable thing for them to do for people who believe that way that is what are the machinery is there within the government for them to do that\nAnd they're trying to you know generate some support for the midterm elections to hold onto his many house and Senate seats as they can and\nTo do that they want to get those three Democrats who are in those states uh you know wanting to be quotas and Indiana and also um [noise]\nUh who's I'm Joe Manchin of West Virginia they want to get them on record voting against\nThe nominees and they can they can hurt them in states where Trump is ... is popular in in those states so you know both sides are trying to manipulate the clock here so I [noise] um but you know it's ... it's interesting also for you though it's not really a matter of the length of time that it took her to come forward you just find her individual story not credible is that what you were saying",
