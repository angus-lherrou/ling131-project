law all around the country it was put into effect in Nineteen Ninety nine it allows doctors in Texas to withdraw some forms of this life sustaining treatment even if the patient's family doesn't want them to as long as the physician has the backing of the hospitals ethics committee\nOr doctors in Texas are also protected from any civil or criminal liability meaning that if you're a grieving family member you can't take them to court after they've taken your loved one off a ventilator\nNow there are states such as uh Oklahoma for instance where doctors are explicitly forbidden from withdrawing life sustaining treatment without any agreement from the patient or the patients legal surrogates\nI think are just two other states California and Virginia offer abroad green light protections like those in Texas so most states don't allow this but we have a California Virginia Texas I guess\nI'm rich rich or you know has these complicated laws dealing with this unbelievably complex situation as I said there's a little girl at the center of this now we don't know if the little girl is still in their\nDoctors say she's gone there is no brain activity the girl the little girl little Payton is no longer there just the shell is left being kept artificially resuscitated they're artificially ... having respiration by a machine they say it's cruel to the child\nTo keep the body in that state the parents say we need more time\nNow what is happening here they they had some legal actions back and forth over the weeks and they were given two weeks to find another place to take the child and that's proving to be very very difficult it seems to me that you might want to have if you're going to have a law saying that a hospital has that kind of awesome power over the wishes of parents\nThan that there must be a way to deal with the parents' wishes as well there should be a way to mandate that another facility would have to take that child I Would think that's not the case in in Texas the parents are left on their own there and they could lose their child against their wishes I mean we know the child is probably lost already but\nShouldn't we respect that family's wishes at least until they can come to terms of what they have to do\nThe mom whose name is Tiffany ... said uh this is as of a a day or two ago as of right now they have not found a facility but they remain hopeful there\nShe says people are sending them different locations all across the country that they think I might want to take a or the girl and they're they're keeping up on that here's here's a quote from the mom Peyton never gave up on anything and I know that in this situation she wouldn't give up either at the fact that the doctors told\nWould stop on its own this weekend and she's still alive she's still made it until today that lets me know that patients not done she still here to fight so I'm her voice I'll do it for her\nSo that's the situation we find ourselves in this morning it really is no good answer but there must be something better than the family losing the right to ah to make a final determination like that and maybe they just need time to come to grips with it\nUm you know you're told you know you have a child you love the child you have an active life with that child and then the child gets sick and ends up like this it must be very very difficult probably nothing more difficult in your life would you ever experience and having to make a decision like this and then you have doctors coming along and saying we're making the decision for you\nKnow it seems cruel it seems arbitrary but the doctors also have a have a responsibility to their patient girl is the patient not the parents and so the doctors are saying we are in charge of this girl and this girl's treatment and it is our medical opinion\nAh that this girl is gone she's brain dead you can keep the body going for you know who knows another year or two years or however long before the the whole system collapses\nBut the girl is never coming back and it's cruel to keep the child that way I mean who's right who's wrong I don't know every situation is also probably different I don't know that one law fits all but\nTell me what you would do in a situation like this you know would you\nHow do you find a facility that would take the child if nobody wants to take on that burden I don't know if the parents could pay for that that's got to be awfully expensive [noise]\nAh I don't know what the insurance situation is in Texas it's not one of the more advanced stage with insurance health insurance\nSo we don't know call us eight hundred seven three six three six six six if nothing else offer your prayers for this family as they deal with this problem alright seven\nEight hundred and
