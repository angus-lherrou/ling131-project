Thomas maybe you can explain who she is and what happened to her five year old daughter back a less than a year ago in two thousand Seventeen go ahead\nThat's right so cautious daughter\nOr is it a school that had with little notice to parents adopted a transgender bathroom policy with essentially said boys if they identify as a girl\nCan use the girl facilities can use the girls restroom showers et cetera um and so what ultimately happened is one day cautious daughter in the hour go environmental to protect her privacy something the school didn't do here\nWas excuse to go to the restroom and a boy in her class that identifies as ginger fluid was also excused and while Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom to boy came in\nAgain allowed under this policy and sexually assaulted posh his daughter\nA ... that evening I learned about it her daughter telling her what happened and was shocked as any parent would be to hear that this happened to her daughter and she talks to the school officials and finds out that this happened because these schools transgender policy\nSpecifically allowed this boy to use the girls facilities\nOkay is there a is their policy if the schools just basically ... any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right and all it takes is for a student to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assumed that when you say that the little girl's five years old was molested she was touched was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the ... hills but um and it's something\nThat we would all be above ... of course with you Paul and anybody who has children or grandchildren is going to be appalled by that so so what happened Pasha went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct this policy what the school authorities say to her\nYet no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think the school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they share the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so ... was left with no choice but to do with any parent would do take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in helping or seek the justice at the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or Bennington, Vermont this is Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a a traditional commonsense values\nThat you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that girls go into girls restrooms boys go into a boys and if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a\nTeacher's restroom a single use their facility but you never allow them into facilities at the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window because of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOK as so Pasha Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh and it's usually you'd think that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who's doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what what happens next year ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay as so a ... in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother in Decatur, Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to\n... daughter there are better solutions but the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... the cater school district it here\nOkay I'm speaking to match they amassed sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom\nAnd he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skills of this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation\nIt's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC\nOr religious liberty is still under assault and it's under assault or by bureaucrats by local officials by school boards in many many different areas and right now you're on something of a winning streak over the ATF orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible wins from the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently cheap Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one point two million dollar settlement after he was fired by the city of Atlanta for writing a book about his Christian beliefs okay the\nPart of this take part in it um maybe there's not that much we can do right now to save this poor Christian Woman who's been condemned\nTo death for blasphemy\nOr for talking about Jesus or but we certainly can defend people here right in the United states go to the alliance defending freedom a and and you'll find that go to Michael med dot com\nYes it was inconceivable I I couldn't I I

moment of a way that the Obama administration mishandled the situation in Egypt\nA Hosni Mubarak had been a virtual dictator of Egypt for a long time\nHosni Mubarak was not Thomas Jefferson and he wasn't Ronald Reagan and he was in some sort of benign ruler is a time\nThey did not support personal liberties or freedom of expression in Egypt and then when the Arab Spring came to Egypt we let the Mubarak\nRegime collapse\nAnd didn't know when any favors because Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came to power\nOf they were awfully close to a disaster in the country the military came in fortunately and they supported a coup with general al Sisi and he is now the dictator of Egypt in\nIs the vastly better and more of a Democrat more of a liberal than a Hosni Mubarak probably he's not he's probably less of one\nBut it's a difficult part of the world is a part of the world where there are murderers terrorists as the alternative and by the way the same thing is true in Saudi Arabia\nDo I believe that uh Mohammed bin Salman is I don't know the second coming of Nelson Mandela know\nOr the guy has real sluggish aspects but he also has real religious reforms\nThat he has been undergoing allowing women to drive was a very big deal and the radicals who are the main opposition of this regime and when I say radicals I don't mean radicals on the left I mean radicals on the Islamic right\nOr they would love to get rid of Mohammed bin Salman\nHe's also called back the religious police who used to run wild and Saudi Arabia and and most of all he has really been leading the way we're trying to get Saudi Arabia to engage with the west I Know there's this you know that they used to ban movies entirely\nAnd he's a good good for them I mean even movies that you would like\nThey they banned emphasis Disney Princess movies are banned well we'll talk later on about why feminist band Disney Princess movies coming up [noise] but ... but he one of the things that I'm On the bin Salman is achieved as you can now actually\nLook at movies they're censored or they want to protect people's sensibilities in Saudi Arabia we are talking about Saudi Arabia not Connecticut\nBut still it's been moving in the right direction does that mean that you forgive something as horrible as the to show the torture and killing and by the way for people who say well he's ... Islam as he was a bad guy he wasn't a bad guy\nAnd nor do I think he was a total paragon of virtue but for goodness sake the same way that we\nGet upset with I mean I I remember when Daniel Pearl was Wall Street journal reporter was beheaded\nBy a colleague shake Mohammed chaos him who's now an American prison he should have been executed long ago but he was involved in that he was involved with September eleventh more seriously\nIt's hideous\nAnd no Americans should even suggest for a moment that it can be excused let's go to your calls to a Alicia in Los Angeles Alicia you're on the Michael ...\nNice to talk of really changed my life Oh thank you um [noise]\nWe have a little situation here in Los Angeles where our daughter just went from competitive gymnastics diving\nAnd the club it out I Would say heads around age twelve s hill about Seventeen or Eighteen it's all pre college they did the diving at UCLA on campus and they use their facilities\nIn the locker rooms UCLA has a a a gender policy that is very open to everyone\nThere is a transgender boy and on the dive teams that uses the girls locker room and it was very startling when she came out of the stall one day when they were changing it's bathing suit", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "20"}
