tearing up\nAnd and having goose bumps and listening to her account of Franklin Roosevelt coming back from polio and having to make a national or parents had a democratic convention to place the name

you know I it was both those things thrilling and and being moved immensely all by the same book and the space of an hour only books can do that for us but are we still reading books well the Pew Research center says that um\nOverall Americans read an average of twelve books for a year but that's kind of misleading because of the real figures show that a lot of us are reading a lot of books and a lot of us don't read it all so when you average it out for the average American the average American reeds for books every year and that's it's been that way for about a\nA goes back to twenty eleven\nSo I'm you know that's that's a that's a good I guess that uh that that we are still reading but I Wonder about our kids are they going to read they've got these short attention spans if the Twitter generation\nOr you know doesn't exactly lend oneself to wanting to read a book that takes you know maybe a week or twenty or thirty hours of your time to get through so we'll have to see what happens\nSo apparently there's a series of books I did not know about\nAnd uh it's called the before you die series and uh there's the one of the latest I guess maybe the latest one is called a thousand books to read before you die and a\nMan named James most ditch us voted his life to books I guess he put together a list of a thousand great books right there but he describes in his pictures in the whole thing it took him fourteen years to do this but he put together this list of a thousand books to read before you die\n... joins us now and James in order to to recommend a thousand bucks just how many of these and you have to read or otherwise become familiar with\nWell I've been reading you know for six decades now so uh it's it's thousands and probably you know the maybe Fifteen thousand by now so there's a lot of books that I've read that are not in here and many of those I've enjoyed\nAh but ah so but that's what I Do I've done for a living that's what I Do as well for pleasure so I Am a I Am a book or\nSo for the person who wants to delve into this how is this organized for the reader\nWas organized a alphabetically by author because I wanted I didn't want to do it by subject or by chronology or by age of reader because I wanted people to\nNot get lost in a silo like if you like mysteries which there are plenty of mysteries in here for a few like a military history or if you like uh novels a literary fiction contemporary literary fiction [noise] uh I didn't\nWant people to go to that category and not get out of it because they thought they didn't like the other ... as I wanted people wanted to encourage people to explore\nAnd so alphabetical by author allows an interesting juxtaposition in of titles so that if you're reading about Flora Thompson's book lark rise to a candle for which is a lovely story of growing up in the English countryside very sedate\nUm that's right next to hunter Thompson's fear and loathing in Las Vegas which is exactly the opposite [laughter] and then after Hunter Thompson\nIs a K Thompson's Ella we used at the plaza wonderful kids picture book 'cause there are plenty of kids books in here as well as really\nMeant for lifetime reading you could start with a good night mood and where the wild things are picture books the parents would read to children and then go up through chapter books and teen books and so on all of that of the book\nSo that's a very eclectic list but is there something in common than all the books have that you're recommending\n[noise] yes I think the one thing that's uncommon for me I'm the real the real thing that's most important is that is the kind of book you want to pass along to her friend might not be every friend but it would be a if you've read something really good at and you say to yourself you know Michael would like\nThis or Jane would like this uh that's what I really look for in in a book that that I'm recommending to others\nNow I've read here that you've set a thousand bucks is not even enough that you think you should be recommending more so is it going to be an another edition coming out at some point\n[laughter] I don't I don't know if I have the stamina but um there's a this book as a thousand bucks there also I write little essays about\nThe books and then there are and notes which recommend a other books to try if you liked that one so even in this book there's about fifty five hundred titles\nAnd what I'm hoping to do is to spark a conversation with other readers\nTo a half kind of updates to list we built a website for that purpose called a thousand books to read dot com and people can go on a comment on the list and add books that they think I'm other readers should know about so I'm hoping this is going to be an ongoing conversation in one form or another\nAll right thanks James must itch author of the brand new book just released one thousand books to read before you die a life changing list and books can change your life they really really can you know they take you into another world\nThere's nothing for the imagination like going off into a world created by an author or especially if they were recreating the real world perhaps or a book of nonfiction I Love to read history and\nPolitical science and I love to read biographies of interesting people I even like to read autobiographies especially now when you can have the author read the book to you\nInteresting books I read in recent years is a an autobiography by Steve Martin and you know he's he started off as a stand up comedian but he's he's almost a renaissance man he's got such a wide range of interest and his book it's sort of about his life but it's not like I did this I did that and then I met this woman I met that woman\nIt's more of how he developed his art form the art form how he developed his comedy style which is very you know it's it's a unique style and how he did that it's fascinating and he's also as he's gotten older you know he writes plays and essays\nAnd uh other books it's very interesting man and he reads the book to you and it's like spending you know a a couple of days in the company of Steve Martin and which I Know I Would love to do is a very interesting guy only a book can really do that for you especially now that you can take the book with you wherever you are you know that's the great thing about listening to books on\nOn a recorded books but you know actually relatively few people actually listen to books digitally that includes audio books or e books a thirty nine percent of Americans according to the Pew Research center say they only read print books twenty nine percent read in digital formats an also read print books\nSeven percent only of Americans say they only read books and digital formats and I've not read any print books in the past twelve months so there's not as much changes I had a I might've expected before I looked up a few figures this morning on that I Would have thought more people were listening to books that are still reading\nYou know all the bookstores are gone\nAnd used to be you could go to so many bookstores and I hated going into bookstores because I Would always end up spending too much money and come out with a giant stack of books\nAnd now the big bookstores the chains are gone they may be happening some online presence there a couple of good bookstores here in the Washington DC area that are also places you can get coffee and stuff like that they're a nice place to hang out but I Want to know about you are you reading what do you read you like to
