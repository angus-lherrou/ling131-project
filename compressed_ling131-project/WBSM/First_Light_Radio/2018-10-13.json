vigil\nAnd another great day and the greatest nation on God's green earth is a particularly great day if you want to use recent history\nTo understand what's happening in this country right now on the directions that we should go there are a lot of books that come over my desk\nAnd there is one book in particular that it just is a must read at this moment\nBecause it is so relevant to people who are concerned about\nThe prospect of a new democratic move for impeachment impeachment Brett Kavanaugh impeachment\nOf President Trump\nOr if you're concerned about what's happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about the Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation there is extremely relevant material on all of that in contempt\nIt is subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nThe author is Ken Starr and a judge star I've I've got to tell you this book is so readable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost sensational unsatisfying and uh the the book is posted at our website of Michael midday dot com\nIn writing it\nAnd then the response to the book which has been overwhelming sense has come out what surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that uh\nHurts that of the Washington Post style but uh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and some would say highly effective\nAt a uh taking a a issue with what seemed to me to be indisputable and that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes from the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned to impeachment\nThat's very high on the list because as you know a ... impeachment was extraordinarily controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeachment now with some of the most vociferous voices saying how dare use that\nAs the book is called contempt a memoir on the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\n[noise] yes and uh you know turn the other cheek and an end kindness to to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and and and the facts are are are in sort of the day new mall was when

think he wanted to be a with the Clinton investigation that led to the impeachment of President Clinton he has now written a book about the whole experience\nAnd it's a page Turner and even though you know how it turns out\nOr it didn't turn out so well for the good guys it seems to me but there it is the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nAnd before we get back to the Clintons Ken Starr I Know that um we all know that Brett Kavanaugh before he was judge Kavanaugh before he is justice Kavanaugh\nWorked for you and uh let's make some news here or did you have a problem did you always feel that when Brett Kavanaugh came into a room you had to lock up the booze and put the women in another room and to protect them from this morning I'm a horrible person\nThis was a terrible a smear or attack uh uh uh uh it was very reminiscent of the attacks on up work on\nA on Clarence Thomas a and regardless of the ... the other motives are the truthfulness of Dr Ford but I Do know broadcasting on I've known him since he was a very young lawyer and we worked side by side literally for years\nAs a the outpouring of support for breath for justice cab no by those who not only knew how to work with him who went to school with him and said this is just not Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd he emphatically and forcefully and emotionally denied the allegations and so knowing bred to be a person of a just on impeachable integrity and honesty\nI Believe him so it was very painful for those of us who know the judge has led such an example\nThe career professionally and a wonderful life personally with his two beautiful children with\nThe nation for a period of time had a new coach K right the girls' coach and uh it just it's it he called that a a a and a national disgrace I call it a national tragedy\nOr both guys called ... it is a subtitle the memoir the Clinton investigation\nI you um you you look back on a this situation not without some changes of regret ... of the things that you might have done differently or that you look back on now\nOr as perhaps they should've been emphasized differently steered differently what stands out most\n[noise] as I describe a Michael a I win against the advice of mind advisors a scene out of the scriptures re a bomb or ignoring the advice of his wise elders and listening to\nThe voices of his young rabble rousing ... or ... thereby dividing Israel [noise] um I fail to listen to the advice of folks who said do not sit down with this particular journalist who I knew I had known him for ten years his name is Steven Brill\nYeah he's a farmer and last night and I and I know Steve and for many years go ahead\nAnd my goodness well I have a ... ended up being on unscrupulous a character who totally distorted everything I had to say in the interview that's my biggest thing you might say ... well it ushered in an investigation authorized but as she should have\nOf the chief judge of the United states just record of the district of Columbia and whether\nWe were violating very fundamental rules violating the criminal laws with respect to grand jury secrecy\nWe came through it with flying colors that being the investigation but it was so it was such a self inflicted wound and then more broadly what I've said frequently is that I Wish that Janet Reno who did the right thing and saying\nThe information that we have\nThat the ... the United states is in the process of encouraging people to the law is about to commit perjury and so forth and the ... civil rights sexual harassment case has to be investigated\nMichael I Wish he had had a ready reserve independent counsel or a special prosecutor who she could have just said you Mary Roach John do you take over the investigation\nKen wants to go to Pepperdine he's been trying to get the ... and the\nCity or in law school yeah go ahead\nYeah and this to be the end of the law school there and this is just I'm going to take more time energy and so forth although I Will say this we were optimistic a that perhaps the uh ... what became the Lewinsky phase the investigation will be over very promptly\nBecause we were going to be giving Monica\nThe opportunity simply to cooperate with the investigation and to receive complete immunity as as a witness to get out of harm's way but\nOf course famously infamously as I describe the hallway scene at the Ritz Carlton hotel on that fateful\nDay in the evening or in northern Virginia and the Pentagon said he or she said using very foul language to her mother who was encouraging her Monica to\nCooperate with the investigation and tech herself out of harm's way\nThat she was not going to bring down this and ... years\nStrong language ... uh and then she said that course for five months and\nI'm the president for his part insisted of course that he\nHad told the truth and his or her jury is a deposition and the Paula Jones case so the combination of the ... city of Bill Clinton under oath and the stubborn refusal of Monica for five months to cooperate\nWith the investigation just hurt us and the nation through this very hellish purgatory old process\nSpeaking of a hellish in purgatory process\nI'm ... I I'm I'm sure you've encountered a the current special counsel Robert Mueller he's quiet right now for a while because it's just a few weeks before the upcoming election and I guess the tradition for somebody in that position as you don't break any news right before an election\nI Would you have some national advice for special counsel Robert Mueller about how to handle the conclusion of his investigation based on your experience that you described in contempt\nYes I Would say that the regulations that are which she was appointed by a Rod Rosenstein point the way to very happy resolution once he comes to let them inclusion and I think he has on the wrong and I don't know\nBut I think he has concluded that there was no collusion\nBetween the Trump campaign and Russian interests uh that's why he was appointed obviously there's the Paul Manafort monitor the Rick Gates matter the indictments of the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on reason that he was appointed\nBring this to an orderly conclusion and a professional way as quickly as possible\nAnd then happily this is a huge improvement Mike all over the independent counsel statute of under which I was appointed and that is the regulations in which a model was appointed to not speak of impeachment\nAnd that kind of ... and include lying about something that happened while he's president before he was president will get to that and more coming up a quick word from a relief factor Allen called end with this message\nThan in ... or early twenties now I'm fifty one in my early twenties I worked
