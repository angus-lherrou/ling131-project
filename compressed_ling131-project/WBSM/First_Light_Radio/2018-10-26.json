excuse to watch these without getting yelled at too much by her family\nAll right so give us your list what are your favorite horror movies of all time\nWell I always like to look at horror movies as as what scares you personally they're very intimate thing and so I'm going to pick a lot of these are going to be ones that are from my childhood and and the first one on the list is invasion of the body Snatchers\nSeventy eight for\nSutherland Brooke Adams it takes the Kevin McCarthy\nVersion and keep the paranoia puts it in a large city San\nFrancisco and it does it in a very pragmatic\nThat really sticks under your skin and and especially when you're trying to go to\nYeah well you're talking about Kevin McCarthy that's the one from the Nineteen fifties that everybody says this kind of a parable on communism yeah I think both versions are really really quite good okay so what else do you like\nWell let's go back to the original slasher and no I'm not talking about Halloween I'm Talking about uh the one with Halloween stars mother Janet Leigh ... psycho this is\nA very pretty and powerful movies the Nineteen sixties now actually scared a lot of people who made them afraid to

movie she was in it All right uh what else do you like well let's take another one from my childhood and that it's actually the violence\nAnd that is the ... on the original which is an unsettling movie to watch today the best of the theories\nAnd it was it was so like you said with the vision the body Snatchers realistically directed even though it dealt with in past the subject\nBut it was a greedy and and disturbing and\nYou know the whole that that movie has on people\nIs so strong that uh the a lot of the scenes were shot here in Washington DC in Georgetown and you know those big big steps with a priest goes flying out the window and goes down the steps found those I've gone up and down the steps yeah people people you can go go walk by there and you'll see tourists just standing\nStaring at it lost and thought and remembering that movie I mean all these years later now I've got a couple of my list that you have mentioned that that I found a course to the home and I think it's the same class as The Exorcist\nWell back in the seventies they were the Hollywood dabbling into demonic guards because they kept making movies about the scary things\nHappening with the ... and the devil this one may surprise you but I find one that goes back I don't know ten twelve years now completely different genre and a completely different way of doing things and that's the Blair Witch project which made me so\nAnxious all through the movie and then it never kind of went any place but for I don't know an hour and twenty minutes or so I was kind of sitting there an easy\nBecause of that movie yeah the Blair Witch project was a real interesting experiment it was the earliest found footage movie that really when big I actually made me sick in the theater because of the video\nElements moving back and forth on the on the screen and then of course there's a remaking the new one will be coming out in April but I don't think you can never topped threatened when as the neighbor next door\nYeah well who would expect kindly old Fred when to be to turn into what he turned into of course there's other movies like Kerry and Rosemary's Baby a lot of people are scared by the ring\nThe ring yes that's another good one that's when they got a whole bunch of Japanese and Hong Kong imports that they were remaking as American films because there was some really
