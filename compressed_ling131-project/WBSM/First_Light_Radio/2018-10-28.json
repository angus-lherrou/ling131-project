technology for financial institutions to prevent personal fund from being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras\nGuatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make sense of the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're having\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have the technology to do it the question is whether or not or it would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop remittances or and or remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nIs I Believe they're a second uh largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that uh if President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras in Guatemala\nIt'll simply make conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument against Mexico is that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally\nOh that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but\nThanks for the idea of you know look into it tight is in San Antonio Texas tiger malarial to show\nVery love your show man thank you so much thank you um\nSo yeah that that testimony from that gentleman a fantastic and that as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the\nThings I've understood is that the Democratic party has had an absolute stranglehold on the black community now and the mind set a for about six years and they had no intention of loose and it is going to take the black community you gentlemen my teen him to get out of their own selves\nAnd so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller asked you how many legal immigrants are accepted into this country um\nAnd I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation it so that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country and at this point in our next\nPitch history we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven no if you if you estimate our population\nYou know you and do that math that comes out to almost ... percent of our population illegal immigrants\nSo you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know presidency for Republican and then is raisins and and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has that when the policy for anybody who enters the country illegally that's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a blockbuster and the willingness to help you you said that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm just protecting them or whatever they're doing now is that these people are not rounded up by the federal rallies immediately or at least\n[laughter] [laughter] ... thank you very much for the call a whole bunch of people are beginning to rethink\nThe relationship with a
