Republicans and conservatives in this election and I'm I'm old friendly acquaintances with a missing his friend would be too much but certainly I've seen him and worked with him over the years Jason Lewis who's a former talk show host a very popular talk show host in Minneapolis St Paul\nHas been elected to Congress and he's a terrific congressmen he works very very hard is a conservative team player and he has respect of his colleagues he came to our event last night I was there with my friends and colleagues Larry Elder and Dennis Prager and\nIt was just an inspiring event there were nearly eight hundred people there and it was just jammed packed\nAnd it was not a a ... one of those\nType cast conservative crowds where everybody is old and white or not that there's anything wrong with being old and white there's nothing wrong with it but this was people lots of younger people in fact the best question we got all night was an audience question\nFrom a to newlyweds who were hoping to have children and they asked Dennis and me and Larry Elder our our colleagues\nAre they asked what our advice would be the most important points of advice\nFor uh people raising a child and raising a child the right way I thought that was provocative and it was interesting it's not all politics and yes we talked about the bombing situation the suspect apprehended after the event so we can talk about that\nBut one of the points where\nI'm actually some of the people in the audience came and they said they were somewhat surprised where we're\nUnanimous had to do with the caravan because uh even though I Would have disagreements on some issues of immigration policy with a President Trump certainly and uh with um Larry and Dennis\nThis caravan thing is just so clear\nAnd\nI I Do think one of the important things in talking about this as we come up to the election and we're only twelve days away from the election\nIs\nCaptured in a very fine Columbine Megan ... who is a now in Washington Post columnist she used to be with Bloomberg but she wrote a piece about the caravan called the immigration conversation we need to have in the most important point that she takes away from it is that conservatives\nNeed to be very clear that yes we\nFeel compassion for the people in the care of and no they're not all middle Easterners and terrorists and gang members and no they're not invaders and no they're not coming to destroy America [noise] they're mostly desperate very poor people a lot of the mothers with children\nAnd\nThey're not a Trojan Horse but they but at the same time they simply cannot be just admitted to this country that cannot happen because they've already started another caravan down in Guatemala\nAnd there will be no end to this\nAnd there has to be compassion but there has to be rule of law and for the left the left is also oh poor babies are these ... these these people they are suffering so much and I think that's admirable as fine feel compassion\nFor them but then what is it they expect how were\nYou you solving a long term problem for our country or for these people by saying well how come into the United states\nAnd then and then be dependent\nUpon other people helping you hear in the United states rather than people helping you at home\nHere's on what Megan McCarthy has center column she says Trump is of course wrong to cast fat free aspersions on desperate people seeking a better life\nWith the left is wrong if it thinks that making that observation ends the argument because even a caravan of nothing but decent hardworking people would raise big questions there are billions of decent hardworking people living in the world\nDo all of them have a right to migrate to the United states merely because doing so would\nMake them better off and uh then then she writes but on the micro scale where you can see the human faces reasonable immigration restriction starts looking different she says\nThose Honduran migrants lying under a tarp\nAnd how ... Mexico aren't any less deserving than you are of clean drinking water safe streets in a warm dry a boat\nThey just fail to hit the pick six in the birthplace lottery by what moral right do we tell them to go back to to ... or ... capital of Honduras and hope that their local MS Thirteen chapter decides to prey on somebody else\nThis is my one problem with her column I'll tell you by what right you say that these people\nWe benefit from the great decision of our parents or grandparents or great great grandparents to come to this country and we benefit and we inherited this yes it is inherited if you're born in the United states\nThe chances are very large that you have at least one generation maybe two maybe three maybe ten generations of people who work very hard for this country and that gives you more of a right than people born abroad\nTo enjoy the blessings of this country isn't that basic isn't that sensible\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then making ... concedes\nA truly open borders policy has\nNo constituency in the American electorate but it's the implicit philosophical framing of most news media stories on immigration which tend to focus on the Mike Rowe problems of the individuals not the macro problem of just how many of those individuals the country can admit\nShe says this is\nEasy to say no of course we can't let in every single person wants to come because doing so would transform this country\nInto one that fewer Americans or any political persuasion would want to live in the United states would be vastly more unequal and income and opportunity migrants would languishing the kind of squalid poverty that the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate\nThat would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program\nOkay this is the core argument simply allowing people in is a disaster for the country and it's not a a blessing for the people who were allowed in because by\nAsked where by peddling this whole idea of multiculturalism that's deeply destructive to exactly the point of view that you beautifully articulate it John\nWhich is a knowledge of American history and it does not inspire any confidence in me at all that both these caravans the one that just started in ... and is making its way toward Mexico and the one that is already a halfway are not quite through Mexico\nThey're not carrying American flags they're carrying flags of Guatemala and Honduras a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy

the flow of people if Guatemala doesn't stop the flow of people out of their country into Mexico and then making their way to the United states is the President Trump will remove all foreign aid from Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador those three countries they're owned by the way destitute dysfunctional\nOr countries I I'm I'm Glad that President Trump does not appear to be repeating this and I hope you stop saying an stops repeating it because\nIt it's wrong it is wrong uh first of all if you want to look at it are foreign aid budget\nTo those countries almost all of it is military or law enforcement aid to helping the war against drugs and to help a battle with gangs like MS Thirteen and a\nTwo to basically aid local law enforcement to try to avoid corruption and to bring order instability in those countries in other words are foreign aid budget which amounts to less than one half of one percent for all three countries of our total foreign\nAid budget in other words you're talking about\nThe zero point five percent of our total foreign aid budget which then comes to point zero zero five of our overall budget it's incentive has mostly small in comparison to what the government spends but it's spent enough for the benefit of people in El Salvador Guatemala or Honduras\n... and for the benefit of us to prevent some of these gangs from\nFlourishing and then coming over here to prevent the kind of total societal breakdown that sends desperate people trampling\nNorth with no permission and NO PLAN and a ... frankly cutting all foreign aid to those countries would make it harder\nTo stop the advance of future caravans now are these caravans organized by George Soros know are they organized by leftist politicians and Honduras absolutely and\nPort in the New York times and everywhere else and the idea that that somehow Democrats one to use this as a political issue suggesting that we have to show some kind of a welcoming to people who are desperate\nWho were decided to march up to the United states nowhere else they they want to go there probably places where they could establish themselves more successfully and more immediately\nBut the United states backing and we simply cannot cannot\nUh allow the fact that that people want to come here to allow people who want to come here who are willing to force the issue let's go to a Kurt in Minneapolis Curt you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Vick uber ticking regard I ... really into my question I ... I couldn't occur more can curb or with you that I I don't but we shouldn't read any of these people would or give any of silence\nBut what can we do what our options were mad at ... I mean you may have just mentioned that there are obviously traveling through other you know Mexico depending on where they're coming from but it's like\nWhat your what your diplomatically and what can we do immediately\nOkay well first of all Mexico has not been terrible on this and even President Trump has agreed that the new the new president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nHas um agreed to some level of cooperation they want to discourage these people from going through Mexico and the numbers of apparently declined recently but I've been cut in half\nWhich means that maybe half of these people have a gone in another direction or split off from the caravan or\nOr finding some places to stay in Mexico it seems to me this is an area where government can cooperate with and work closely with private charities and they're all kinds of private charities that could take it among themselves to greet these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey\nWe're going to help you get back home and when you get back home we're going to help put your feet on the ground and we're going to help work with you I I Know that\nThe charities that we support actually do things like building wells in a village which can make a huge difference I'll tell you what makes a huge difference in a village were in a city in Central America", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "27"}
