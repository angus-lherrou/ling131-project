groundless and they claim that us violations of the treaty ah are happening and they don't like that either so they're saying that uh they hope they Fishell word from the Kremlin has that quote we are prepared to work together with our us colleagues\nOn the entire set of problems regarding the INS now of course you have to remember President Trump is a businessman he likes to negotiate so there may be some thought that what he's doing here is perhaps not throwing out the treaty maybe that's his first bargaining position and what he might be able to do is negotiate a better deal as he did with the NAFTA\nOr with Mexico and Canada you know we're pulling out of this so you have a chance if you want to come in and give us some better and better deals but it's hard to think how you could do this with the Russians because building up weapons and national defense is a lot different from trade because you have lives at stake here\nSo the first thing we're going to do this morning before we take your calls and by the way our number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six and I want to know what you think about this\nAre you willing to trash a treaty and return to the old arms race of the past and put more and more billions of dollars into using weapons or to building weapons that hopefully we will never be able to or have to use or would you rather save that money for domestic needs built some new bridges in airports and trains and infrastructure and\nElectrical grids which is your priority call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six so now Fred plight and has been following this infrared is based in Moscow for us and he brings us up to date on what is just being said on both sides of the Atlantic on this issue\nOr the U.S Russia headed for a new nuclear arms race associate it could happen after President Trump announced over the weekend the U.S will exit the INS treaty\nAgreement\nBecause they violated the agreement on terminating\nOh frosty welcome for national security adviser John Bolton in Moscow Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov demanding an explanation and warning Russia will retaliate ...\nStudents to choose any action in this area will be met with counter action strategic stability can only be achieved on the basis of parity\nI N F stands for intermediate range nuclear forces\nThe treaty was signed in Ninety seven by Ronald Reagan held Gorbachev led to the withdrawal of twenty seven hundred for your [noise]\nThe U.S says Russia has been violating the deal deploying new medium range nuclear capable missile close NATO territory\nMaybe this is just to move to say look if if we don't if you know right now we're moving out of this and I hope that the case I Hope we're going to be able to figure out a way to stay within the trading\nMoscow denies it's reaching the ins and it turns lame America for violating it by developing missile defense technology\nWe don't get to target missiles used in the U.S to test the defense systems are identical to intermediate range ballistic missiles exist and they are in use their production in the U.S could be a sign that ins prohibited technologies are in development\n[noise] several of America\nFly safe they're concerned about the Trump Administration\nTo tend to be hearing after decades of calm [noise]\nNuclear\nWeapons could surge once again a\nLot of concern about America's allies in Europe other places as well of course a lot of anger here in Moscow and the tough meetings continue for the national security adviser John Bolton he is meeting none other than Vladimir Putin himself today\nThe Kremlin has already said who also wants them to exactly explain what the us plans to do how the U.S plans to move forward\nAll right thanks to front plate in reporting from Moscow for first flight this morning we are at Eighteen minutes before the hour on first like give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six and you know this is not just the story between the United states and China\nAh I'm In the United states and Russia China is also involved in this because uh right now U.S officials say the U.S has been relying on other capabilities to balance China in places like the south China Sea they're using missiles fired from ships or aircraft\nAnd are advocates for us land based missile response which would be prohibited by this say that's the best way to deter China and their use of their land based missile forces experts are warning that China would put pressure on countries in the region to refuse any requests from the U.S to position their missiles there China kind of like this whole thing because they say hey\nYou know this this will allow us to to do a bunch of things and we're going to stop you from basing basing missiles in this part of the world and that would give them an advantage\nWe also hear from the Soviet the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev this morning he's the one who signed the deal with President Reagan he says that President Trump is being very very irresponsible and he fears a new nuclear arms race\nSo let's take you back now to December eighth Nineteen eighty seven president Ronald Reagan is in the East Room of the White House standing next to Soviet premier and Mikhail Gorbachev and getting ready to sign the treaty\nDid was over six years ago November Eighteen Nineteen eighty one by first proposed what would come to be ... Ciro option\nWas a simple proposal one might say disarming really simple [noise] unlike treaties in the past it didn't simply codified the status quo or a news arms filled up\nIt didn't simply talk of controlling an arms race for the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire class of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nAnd that brings us to today and by the way that the that treaty\nEliminated thousands of land based missiles or with a range of between approximately three hundred and thirty four hundred miles so that's a pretty big wide swath of a nuclear arsenal and as I said that brings us to today President Trump threatening to withdraw from the treaty would you like to see that happening are you concerned that that will\nTip the balance of power in the world will that will eat up all the money that we need to rebuild our own country our infrastructure our bridges are trains are electrical grid our Internet grid\nYou know our roads we need to be a building things to help us deal with hurricanes we need to rebuild whole cities along the coast there are a lot of things to put money into do you want to put money into building nuclear weapons that\nProbably will never be used and if they are used while he won't be around to enjoy anything else anyway so what do we do with this you know it's international politics international relations at the highest level now this is Cold War era stuff and are we ready to handle that\nIt's coming up on fourteen before the hour we will be back with your calls at eight hundred seven three six three six six six in two minutes\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most brands were overpriced over designed and out of touch at Harry's our approach is simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by a world class Germans late factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starter set with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and the travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nJust go to Harry dot com and enter one zero one zero at checkout that's Harry dot com codes one zero one zero\nEnjoy\nDo you will be iris ten thousand dollars or more than you may qualify for a fresh start program the folks at civic tax relief can give you free information on how it works they're professionals have\nOver twenty five years of experience negotiating with the IRS that's critical they know the proper steps to take and the right people to contact to save you the maximum amount of money\nWe'll negotiate your IRS ... plus protect you from banquet reason wage garnishment find out which program fits your situation best the information in consultation are absolutely free experience tax professionals are standing by they'll listen to your situation find out what you need and give you all the ways they can help him at first\nFree call again this information is free and could change your life so call now eight hundred six of one Seventy nine Ninety One eight hundred six one Seventy nine Ninety One get your free information now call eight hundred six of\nOne Seventy nine Ninety One that's eight hundred six of one Seventy nine Ninety One so gene totally believe in them [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "23"}
