of stories that he was tracking down and apparently working on where things about the kingdom did not like that the Saudi king and the ... not like and I guess he's written about them in the past they were also some reports that had been a somewhat the bunk that uh I guess they were claiming he had ties to some anti government\nForces and militants and that doesn't seem likely and most uh most of the investigators are saying they don't buy that linked but that's what anyway that's the word that they that the kingdom has been a leaking out to folks\nFair I mean that that's the biggest question was why were they torturing ever ... that kind of stuff where\nYou start sure and and that that was a dollar\nYou can see the line here where if they say okay if this guy was ... say say they say they say All right this guy was involved in anti government terrorist activities so then it would make sense for them to arrest and bring them home and do whatever they have there\nAnd of course but now they can say well it was a thing where we had a rogue officers who went too far and then they tried to cover it up so that at least make sense or I may or may not be believable but at least you could see where they have a storyline developing their\nYeah that's true so it definitely needs to be investigated ...\nAll right so you think we should just kind of hold our fire until we see what comes
