family it was back on TV the other night but without at Central character Roseanne so Kevin how was it good\nMichael it actually was an interesting experiment for ABC to do because they literally had to exercise the main character and reason for the show and the original idea of all the state of characters\nOut of Roseanne and put it into a new show after of course a crazy crazy tweet flurry from Roseanne earlier this year got her an ceremonies Lee fired from the project [noise]\nNow they've got the Connors as basically everyone but Roseanne and turns out they they killed her off with an opioid addiction so of course they were in the nature of the show staying topical the big question a lot of people had is enough with enough people watch and it seems like you had\nA you know ... ratings that were similar to the finale of the the new Roseanne revival season so not as big as that original opening but still in some very respectful numbers of course that's going to drop off in

we'd on you marijuana may be legal in some states here in the U.S but you know there's still a federal law against it and that means it's illegal to bring marijuana purchased say in Canada across the border into the United states even if you are flying into a state where it is legal like Colorado\nVancouver international airport has already trying to warn travelers about that they had to sign up saying\nCrossing international borders with cannabis is illegal so that means or say you're going from Vancouver to LAX\nAnd that can be risky even know Los Angeles international recently announced that passengers are permitted to travel with small amounts of marijuana there now if you're going to fly with pot from Vancouver to Montreal inside Canada that's perfectly legal as long as you meet

out I assume if they were not involved in any kind of violent activity or or widespread corruption you know if they were just arrested for a token up or it may be selling a few bags of marijuana\nThey will be let out of prison is that something we should think about doing here because we don't have much space in our prisons\nAnd uh there was some folks who could do should be behind bars who aren't
