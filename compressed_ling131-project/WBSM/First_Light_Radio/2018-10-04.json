planets that exist beyond our solar system but a moon around one of these worlds has yet to be confirmed\nBut there are some problems with this new law says Jennifer ... with the California chamber of commerce and only focuses on one aspect of diversity and elevates only one protected class\nFor in a situation in which we're considering a new board of directors and we had a potential candidates who are not the now but nonetheless that other diversity qualifications are criteria that we're looking for\nIn other words black Hispanic elegy be GQ persons with disabilities and so on that\nThere'll be fully mandates that we hired the woman I both anybody else can we made the fulfilling for purposes for his\nShe says violates the equal protection laws and both of us in California constitutions as well as civil rights laws\nEven governor Jerry Brown in his signing message said the law may not withstand challenges but says quote it's high time corporate boards include the people who constitute more than half the people in America and quote or as Jackson puts it\nWe do hold up at least half the sky\nAccording to the law companies that don't comply face a one hundred thousand dollar find the first year of violation and three hundred thousand dollars for every other year it violates the law companies also face a one hundred thousand dollar penalty for not reporting it's boards that gender ratio to the state's secretary of state\nMike oh All right thanks Jim Root for coming up on Nineteen before the hour now and there are a lot of issues related to this is not even clear that we would get women to actually joined boards in California about thirty business groups and as John mentioned the California chamber of commerce oppose the law\nWhich may or may not pass legal must here and there are questions about how many companies in California it would even apply to not still this bill is actually based on a requirements in a number of European countries that they have passed\nAnd uh it is actually has worked fairly well over there evidence suggests that are having more gender and racial diversity in the boardroom is good for business\nAs a group called the Peterson Institute it found that the presence of women on corporate boards and into the sweet ah may contribute to from performance and that among profitable companies move from no women leaders do thirty percent representation is\nAssociated with a Fifteen Percent jumped in profit or some European countries like Germany Sweden Iceland Finland and France they have quotas and finds requiring that the companies have to add women to their boards or Norway I think requires companies to give at least forty percent of their director seats to women\nAnd they say that uh some of the folks over and those countries who resisted it initially said that once they've actually experienced it changed their minds and they've kind of warmed up to quotas but that's in Europe quotas having different a different reaction in this country we are not crazy about being told we have to do things even when we know their rights\nBut we all know that when you bring in women and and people of color anybody who's got a different life experience and the perspective\nThan just the same old viewpoint especially on things like boards it makes a difference and a lot of companies on their own of course understand that they're looking outside of their own companies maybe to bring in candidates who are a little more diverse and might uh you know refreshed the gene pool a little bit and that's what this is about but the question is\nWhen you start mandating it\nOne size doesn't always fit\nA all well you know just just doesn't work all the time\nAnd we don't know if this is going to be good for women will they be looked upon as serious members of the board if they're on there because they are quote quota hires so it could be is that going to be bad for them all it makes some women who feel like\nI worked hard to get to this position I'm qualified for this position I've been here a long time I'm On the board but now people look at me as if I'm a quota higher they may not like that so we have a lot of questions to go through we have a lot of opinions to go through and of course this was a time when\nUh the relationships between the sexes are fraught with all kinds of issues that have such a difficult time this is just one one more thing\nAnd of course I Know a lot of folks will say you know what we do need to have diversity but we should do it only as the marketplace depends and others will say well if you wait for the markets to come around and\nAnd grant for corporate culture to change that's not satisfying for women who want their equal representation now not when they're older
