fistfight\nSenate minority whip Dick Durbin tells NBC's Meet the press the crown prince has his fingerprints all over the death of ...\nAnd the fact that he is heading up the investigation makes it

a way to have a nuanced response\nCongressman Adam Schiff the ranking member in the house intelligence committee ... this week there were several things the U.S could do\nWe ought to suspend military sales we ought to suspend certain security assistance and we ought to impose sanctions on any of those that were directly involved in this murder\nSenator Durbin tells NBC there's even more the u._s. can do\nWe are expelled formerly expel the Saudi ambassador from the United states until there is a completion of a third party investigation into this couldn't a murder and God Knows what followed a that occurred in Istanbul\nSen Paul tells Fox the U.S could go even further\nI feel certain that the crown prince was involved and then he directed this and that's why I think we cannot continue to have relations with him and so I think it's going to have to be replaced frankly\nAnd he says the U.S should use its leverage\nThe Saudis need as much more than we need them we have incredible

when this story first broke a couple of weeks ago\nUh the senator or a put together some legislation to block this arms sale at that time when very little was known he was only about four votes short of getting the Senate to pass a cancellation of that arms deal and I would imagine that\nOh with such stalwart are supporters of Saudi Arabia as Lindsey Graham now turning completely against them that\nThat that Paul uh legislation would probably pass and kill the deal of course President Trump says he doesn't want that to happen the president talks about it as a one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal\nAh actually it's not really a deal is really a memo uh intense saying that well this is what we would like to do over the next step you know ten Fifteen Years this is what we'd like to do as of yet they've only signed letters of uh of intent there is no actual contracts with is the deal is kind of ephemeral at this point\nAnd there'd been widely burying interpretations of the benefits of that job the president says ah [laughter]\nIt would create five hundred six hundred thousand jobs the Pentagon says maybe a couple of ten thousand maybe twenty or thirty thousand or the president says five hundred six hundred thousand dollar jobs are available\nAnd so far the Saudis have really only agreed to about fourteen and a half billion dollars in sales and ask for things like helicopters and tanks and chips and weapons in training\nAnd uh and but of course that the deal would allow them to purchase up to a hundred and ten million dollars over the next ten years but whether they do or not is not actually spelled out in that so it's kind of an ephemeral thing that's what's at stake though and that also is at stake is the role of America as a beacon of democracy around the

hole in the Senate on the proposed deal or the way the Congress works is that the the two ranking members of the top Democrat the top Republican of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nAnd the house foreign affairs committee any of those four people can put a hold on anything like this and in the Senate it was done by Senator Bob Menendez who is the top Democrat in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he did that actually back in June before any of this actually happened\nHe put a hold on it so right now it's actually kind of hung up in the Senate anyway or if he were to lift his whole then you have a ... day review process that begins and any member of the Senate can then at that point file a resolution a disapproval which would block the arms sale and Congress would have to vote on it right now it looks as if\nThat would pass the Senate the house or I don't know that anybody has done a nose count there\nAre and it's also a little difficult because everybody's back
