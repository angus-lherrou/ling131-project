whatever\nOn the cw appearing so those are all looking big for people who are fans of the super natural and the superhero versions from the seat up these shows all do full seasons like in the old days yeah they do and the cw was really kind of hit a stride with those they've they've always had a hit and miss\nMoment but but with the the D.C characters which seemed to do better on TV are really sort of providing the pillars in the Lynch pins for this network\nOr what what's the age range of people who are going to want to watch the show\nAnd in general cw is always aimed they're stuffing teens

B.\nTwenty nine minutes past the hour an hour on first flight well a lot of us went to the movies this weekend kind of an unusually robust October weekend at the box office\nBe Sony comic book movie venom that we talked about the other day shrugged off bad reviews including that from Kevin car it shattered the October box office record where to eighty million Tyler debut Bradley Cooper star is born that Kevin didn't particularly like either sort to forty two point six million bucks\nTo be seen I mean people are already talking about putting Susan Rice on the ballot to challenge her two years so\nWe're better real fingers Susan Rice just playing around by saying you know are indicating sort of teasing on uh on on Twitter over the weekend is there anything real happening there\nWell she did kind of surprised people and she said that she would she would someone said let's put put someone else up against a citizen and a ... a ... against us his columns which is where I went\nAbout me and everybody sort of took it seriously um for about a New York minute until she treated again it said you know basically you know I'm just I'm just kidding but she may not be she may not be\nShe knows her parents are family has a home in Maine so she does qualify\n... that's interesting role you know there's there are a record number of women running for Congress this year so I guess it would be no surprise of Maine has another woman running against or a woman senator Collins who's been there for a quite a few years now\nSo you know on television we could see what was happening on the Senate floor things looked fairly normal\nUh I guess the TV cameras up in the gallery looking down don't really pick up a lot of interpersonal relationships and how that works what was it like up on Capitol Hill are are people ... do they have I contact with each other across the aisle do they swap each other on the back of his all that just gone right now\nA little of both um this particular vote on a confirmation was unusual in that well in many ways but it was unusual in that the senators all were in the chamber at the same time and they were voting from their seats so everybody could hear\nTheir gays or nays normally they just go up to the recording clerk and uh you know just talk to that person or raise their hand a thumbs up or thumbs down and then they leave the chamber\nThis was one of those very high profile votes and everybody was required to\nIn their desks and stand up from their desks will say how they were going to vote\nOr I did watch a lot of the inter personal communication that was going on of course the Republicans were huddled with the Republicans the Democrats were huddled with the Democrats there was a lot of conversation going on uh but uh you know that not many people talking to his wife Lisa Murkowski a which is interesting body language\nA but it was it was a one of those rare occasions where there was a lot of milling about and ah and also just uh\nEverybody in the chamber at the same time you you may not do this or you may Michael but a lot of people uh think that the chamber's full when they vote usually do or even when they speak from the Senate floor but they actually tend to be speaking to an almost empty chamber because it\nMonitoring the proceedings front on closed circuit or in their offices in the office buildings so are they\nAll these fiery speeches et cetera usually given just to the recording clerk in the uh the presiding officer\nSure well I guess they expected that there would be a lot of people watching at home on television and plus there was a weekend so there are probably more people available at home to sit down there and just wash this for hours I Know that\nI kept running into people who are who are saying people who would not normally be interested in politics thing or even during the week the week before when when the hearing was on that they were recording it on DVD are just to make sure when they got home and they'd be able to watch the intense public interest in this\nIt's a Eighteen before the hour and no one for a slide we're talking with our Capitol Hill correspondent Linda Kenya and so what happens next I mean the Congress was not in today's holiday plus it's a Monday\nSo I mean they don't have any work days left before the election do they\nVery few in fact the house has already off the house just the entire month of October off so they could go back to their home districts and campaign the Senate probably would have done very much the same had it not been for this Kavanaugh fight and uh they still have a\nFew things on their agenda to do and then they need to cross the eyes that the a tease if you will [laughter] on the um on taxes they're hoping to to bring that up again\nSo then what they want to be resistance another round of tax cuts is that correct\nAnother round of tax cuts that's right that's right and that bodes well for the uh for votes during the elections but you know all spending package is generally what are supposed to begin in the house and how has gone so it's\nGoing to be a lot of a place holder legislative items in the Senate agenda\nOr not the least of which will be a number of confirmations as well nothing is high profile as the Supreme Court nominee mind you but still so low or just lower a level judge ships and things of that nature some some more a lower level I'm\nA administrative positions federal agency positions there's always those to go through 'em\nSo not a lot of high profile stuff left because keep in mind you know the Senate a lot of those folks are up for re election and they they really want to get to their home districts as well\nSo when they come back when river ... highest who might be a lame duck session\nWill they take up some things van and I'm Wondering how the election returns mind you know affect that because I say the Democrats take the house or maybe even take the Senate which doesn't seem likely but it is a possibility but if they take the house\nAnd do the Republicans at that point try to ram through everything that's on their wish list or do they look at the election returns and say maybe we better mend our ways a little bit more in touch or if the Republicans maintain their hold on the house and under they just run everything through and what happens to money for the wall do you think the president in a lame duck session might get the money for his border wall but he wants\nWell they have until December seventh to figure out that issue because that's part of a C R A continuing resolution on funding a that was passed up before the house went home for the entire month of October and\nIt also it contains some defense money so they do still have to work on that uh they deliberately made sure that they see our we'd go past the mid term so that it wouldn't become an election issue\nAnd so that is going to have to be dealt with but other than that and the you know the last of the appropriations which are also important that the our\nUh that's really the only thing that they're going to have to do and they will probably try and brand that through knowing that ah they risk a government shutdown and if they don't\nMhm oh government shutdown while that would be interesting if it happens in a lame duck session because what happens if they if they can't get it finished before the before the calendar runs out on them I don't think they want to be there on Christmas Eve Christmas would not be a good time to have a government shutdown one would not think\nThat are before on Christmas Eve although as I recall it was health care not shut down but we do tend to go very close to the line of the shutdown\nThat something or think about All right what else is going on before we let you go anything else we should know about as as a as we look to see what Congress does and you know for the next couple of a couple of months before the before the new the new Congress comes in and whichever form\nOr they get better question would be what Congress desert [laughter] is it a little\nJoke up on Capitol Hill we don't know which is worst Kobus being in session of Congress being out of session All right you know that we're not sure yet what they're going to do it's mostly going to be a case of passing the are and are mostly getting just getting used to the constant campaigning between now and election day and\nAnd then afterwards cleaning up the messages that might be left behind\nAll right thanks so much Lynda Kenya on our Capitol Hill
