distraction for the national football league\nOr when some athletes thought that they would respectfully show that they thought that our country needs some improvement they weren't necessarily a concern about the pledge or the flag but just saying that you know if we're going to pledge allegiance to the flag we also need to pledge allegiance to living up to our ideals a lot of people did not like ... including the president who\nVery quickly turned it into a political brush fire and so that has hurt everybody\nIncluding people who like to watch football games without politics so it's you know it was that inappropriate forum\nBats in the eye of the beholder I Will leave that to you to decide but that those are the issues that we are talking about this morning\nAnd it was sort of brought to our attention because there's a case in Texas where a student has refused to recite the pledge of allegiance to state has cracked down on it saying it's the law and so now there's a lawsuit challenging the right of Texas law to mandate that you have to say the pledge of allegiance in a public school\nClinton novel has some background on his round that Michael in Texas it's\nUp to parents whether or not their child to recite the pledge by state law parent or guardian can sign a waiver to let their child opt out of it but the student then still can't\nSchool children cannot unilaterally refused to participate in the pledge\nMark rye lander with the Texas attorney general's office says the law gives parents or guardians of fundamental interest in getting the education and upbringing of their kids\nTexas is among twenty six states with similar statutes that make reciting the pledge of allegiance a regular part of every school day furthermore sixteen other states have statutes do allow for a time to be set aside for students who wish to say the pledge of allegiance on their own\nKids he Landry sued the Houston area district after she says a principal kicked her daughter out of school for sitting during the pledge of allegiance she says the law violates their free speech right according to riot lander the cases about respecting the country and parental rights\nThe pledge to be re sided at the start of every school day has the laudable result of fostering respect for our flag and a patriotic love for our country this case is about providing for the saying the pledge of allegiance\nUh respecting the parental rights to direct the education of children\nThe gate to separate trial next year Michael All right thanks that's Clayton novel reporting on this case in Dallas and as I mentioned earlier there are some folks who are trying to fight all trying to find alternate methods of\nUh expressing some appreciation for our country by not using the pledge of allegiance in San Francisco's Unified School district the last week well they had a change they have a brand new president of the school district his name is Stefan cook\nAnd meetings that always open with the pledge of allegiance but he opted instead for reading that he says expresses a love of country\nWhen you learn teach when you get give he credits that to a poet Maya Angelou who ah did go to a high school in a in San Francisco and this guy cook says this is not a demonstration and the same way that um the some of the NFL players\nAre kneeling during the national anthem they're talking about police brutality he says\nI was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nAnd uh so he said it had nothing to do with President Trump or anything like that but of course it gets controversy because some people do not like you messing around with the pledge of allegiance or there's just there's a schoolteacher in Indianapolis [noise]\nAh I have that information here and ah his name is John ... he teaches history in Indianapolis and ah [noise]\nHe says that what he's done is to kind of spruce up um the the flag every day he gets somebody different from the community to come into the school to lead us or the lead the students there in the in the pledge of allegiance so they're doing the pledge but they're finding a way to make it interesting so that you don't just do it by memory or by rote or because you're told to do it\nBy having somebody different a leading it he says it it makes it a something that you pay more attention to and maybe by paying more attention to what you think more about it so he's got a different approach to reviving our pledge of allegiance\nNow the thing is can you can you mandate allegiance doesn't allegiance have to be earned kind of like respect and you know we we just heard the attorney general from Texas saying he believes respect is learned as first light\n[noise]\n\n\nIf you owe the IRS
