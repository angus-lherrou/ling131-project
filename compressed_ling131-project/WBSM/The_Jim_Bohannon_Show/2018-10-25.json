this of course is abysmal disgusting horrific whoever's doing this should be arrested they should be tried and they should go to jail for the rest of their lives\nThis ... this is just an awful awful thing and what's amazing is that if you say that publicly there's a group of people will immediately suggest that it's a false flag attack or that depending on the target of these sorts of bombs that it's OK which suggests to me that there's a collective\n... sort of collective mental illness that's falling across as a small but significant group of people who believe that the other side is so evil that everything up to and including sending pipe bombs in the mail to them it's justified which is just say that means that we have a sickness in our society that needs to be\nEradicated a mental sickness in our society that needs to be eradicated\nHere's the story from ABC News explosive devices address to Hillary Clinton's home when the house and for president bronco bomb were intercepted

week in the home of mailbox\nA billionaire George Soros knew what the Clintons left in ... New York the lunar I Believe that all three devices are similar pipe bomb south construction now the immediate jumped by folks on the left was to suggest that this was a right wing or who have left wing or is it has been inspired by President Trump\nAs I said for years now I despise when people blame individual acts of violence or attempted violence on general watch political rhetoric\nUnless you're actively calling for violence and someone takes you up on that offer are not responsible for the violent actions of people who take you\nTo to the ultimate extreme in terms of violence so for example when he Bernie Sanders support one shot up a congressional baseball game and nearly killed the house majority whip\nIn the media covered it for all of that scene minutes\nI didn't blame Bernie Sanders because I wasn't Bernie Sanders this fall when a when a kind of\nFringe member of black lives matter shot a police officers in Dallas a couple of years ago right after Brock Obama had made speeches condemning police officers is probably racist I didn't say that that was Brock Obama's fault wasn't brought about his father was an act of evil on the part of a person who was\nActually evil or mentally ill or both\nAnd that had nothing to do with Brock Obama's words I think you can raise the temperature in society and do serious damage to the society because you've raised the temperature of that society but I'm not going to attribute individual acts of violence an evil to individual political viewpoints unless those reports are actively calling for violence and to do anything less\nLeads to the sort of censorship that makes the country at worst place in that way\nIf you believe that free speech is inherently connected to violence you're more likely to crack down on free speech in order to prevent that violence and that seems to be more of a broad danger than individuals in the United states who do evil thing so with that said obviously this is really really bad stuff and it goes to the question of motive\nTo President Trump's comments on nationalism suffice it to say Democrats are not abiding by the basic moral precepts you off you attribute the best possible mode of someone who was the worst possible motive and that means or thinking pretty awful things about President Trump is a measure of\nFolks life insurance is really important but one third of people don't have it that's\nBecause it's kinda hard to buy in because you've been waiting around too long you have to work out what you need and do the research to find the best quote you have to hope you don't get swindled it's not a good way to shop for anything and\nThat's why policy genius has made the whole process a lot simpler wasn't you need life insurance want to take care of your family policy genius compares quotes from the top like insurance companies to find the best policy for you it takes just two minutes to get a quote if you don't know the first thing about insurance and got all the tools to get up to speed\nLearned the difference between charm and whole life insurance calculate how much coverage you need to be sure you're making the right decision in fact over four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance\nHousing genius doesn't just make life insurance easy disability insurance in home insurance in auto insurance if you care about it then covered whether you know a lot about life in church or nothing at all start your start policy junior dot com and\nJust to me that you can compare quotes and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones policy genius is indeed the easy way to compare and buy like insurance go check them out right now I policy genius dot com\nThere's a reason millions of people use them policy genius\nThe easy way to compare by like insurance\nSo this was an amazing story with Dr Steven and Malik are Gregory then no one\nUnderstand that Maliki who's eight almost nine years old male was suffering with not just one or two wars but I mean a significant outbreak of ... all over his body so significant it impacted his ability to really function good so at what point did you see that there was actually improvement is really going to work\nWhen we really started to notice it around twelve which you can see these things are actually getting smaller and smaller I'm joined up with the flu\nThat's the whole thing's economists than regular Sam get into a pair of shoes yes how wonderful it's great to see him so happy and friends that have Senate does blown away by this is awesome\nCar a thick thick a three six eight seven three by that a thick thick a three thinks a than in the thought that that kind of like A.Q Khan T.

Democrats are fully invested in everything President Trump says and the worst possible light comments on national it's my now exception Mazie Hirono of Hawaii\nI'm says that he's national she says maybe it's because he's a white supremacist or an anti Semite we should\nStop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand what he said he refers to nationalist or any of these other terms ... these are not just ... it's racism\nBasically for many people and it's a um anti Semitic as white supremacy\nVery well what he's talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay Mazie my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism when the president says nationalism I'm not hearing Nazi\nHe's saying that he prioritize the United states is border security over the human rights of people trying to make their way across the board hit us agree with that but there's no way that that has anything to do with racism or anti Semitism but this became the actual talking point across walk yesterday\nJim Acosta CNN and waiting to find you somebody who loves you like Jim Acosta love Simpson can Acosta here's Jim Acosta saying well maybe when President Trump says national is he means white nationalist\nOkay or maybe when Jim Acosta says stuff I just think that he's an idiot ears dumb Acosta\nWhen you're demonizing middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on and back here run without offering any proof and then call yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a structural a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journal is making so much objective journalism in there from Jim Acosta I don't think it's any water that people ask whether the president has announcing when he when he says things like we should protect our borders and nationalism\nMean flashback to block Obama two thousand five saying exactly the same thing block Obama actually said this right here is Obama circuit two thousand five when he was just a senator barely a glimpse in the nation's I Know he was saying exactly the same thing as Donald Trump\nOr a generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who served for for your legally and ... for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked circumventing the line a fee for waiting patiently diligently unlawfully does become immigrants in this country\nOkay so uh you know again that I guess that rock Obama way back when was that sort of white nationalist also you know being half white\nI guess that he was white nationalist as well it wasn't just down the cost I who at this point basically everything that he says she'll be prefaced with your diary because he says all of the quiet stuff out loud it was also NBC News Peter Alexander more objective journalism being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean under tones that are not just racial that you've seen a phobic this is something to the presidents and sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow with it I'm somebody who said that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think the national isn't alone is enough I think there are ties that bind us\nIt hides of history and culture but what actually makes the United states the United states is the root idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution and backed by two thousand years\nOf Judeo Christian History rather three thousand years Judeo Christian History and that's what makes the United states the United states is the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states' unique\nThat has a unique idea in world history so I'm not such a big fan either of the president using nationalistic language but to suggest that has white supremacy is just idiocy\nBut again this comes back to the basic idea you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise the the the hackles\nThe other side all you have to do is just question motives day in and day out and that's what we are now in the business of doing the truth is that in a country where we agree on Ninety percent of our values we really do I think in the end a grand Ninety percent by bally's the only way you can divide us is by\nNow is that will make until he was suggesting\nThis is where we get into the issue of assuming people's motives\nHere's my opinion on people darkening their face for costumes like that I agree that it's inappropriate specifically because of the past and I think that it is fair for people to look at the sort of thing and be sensitive about it but I think it would also be worthwhile to recognize there's a difference between being ignorant slash racially insensitive and being racist\nNowhere was making Kelly suggesting that black people should be mocked Noah was making Kelly suggesting that black people are in your in any way in fact and they can tell it was interesting is that maybe why people want to dress up as some famous black people because they admire those famous black people\nThat is not the same thing as people dressing up in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a frat party dressed as a black person with black makeup on\nMe that's insensitive and you should take into account black people's feelings about historic use of this sort of costuming for mockery but\nI also think there's a difference between even if ... going to a party and a little girl who decides that she wants to dress up as Michelle Obama and so she puts on dark make up\nBecause I think that you can pretty easily tell the difference noted the attempt to miss it from the motives in our society is really grow Megan Kelly is not a racist and making it was not attempting to be racist by that statement at best and worst worst Megan Kelly was being ignorant of the hits\nIn a black face and the impact that still has on black folks in the United states that's the worst hit but there is no way to Megan Kelly was actually suggesting it's okay to mock black people\nThat is not what was happening here and yet here is CNN someone and suggesting that make until it actually is a racist because there's never been a time when black face was acceptable first of all he doesn't know where she was you know what kind of party she went to like download and doesn't know that\nSo if he's been Justin isn't making tell he was a racist when she was seven years old because you dress up and Diana Ross and black interface for it\nI Would suggest that Don Lemon doesn't really know what he's talking about you may know what he's talking about historically with regard to black face but again there's a difference between darkening your face for a costume to raise an African American person and darkening your face you mock African American people\nAnd I said several times in the segment I still don't think you should do it to praise African American people specifically because they're too many black folks are going to look at that and say well maybe your mocking maybe the real reason you're doing that is because you're mocking beside of sensitivity you shouldn't do that\nBut the attempts to immediately attribute the worst available motive to Megan Kelly is really telling and it says something about the nastiness of our politics right now\n... forty seven years old she's always there has never been any time in her forty seven years that blackface has been acceptable [noise] um they're all white people in that now there were no African Americans know people of color there to say hey Megan not cool\nOkay so this is this is really really absurd you know again\nIt's the taking blackface seriously is fine but misinterpreted motives that I'll give you an example you only know you wonder how we should deal with these issues really how was your deal with these issues and see whether Jamie Fox deals with these issues and Jamie Fox was you know it is obviously an incredibly prominent black man in the United states has made lots of money as a musician is an actor very talented guy\nYou know he's very close friends with Robert Downey junior a few years ago he did a pod casting Joe Rogan and in the middle of the podcast the question of Robert Downey junior actually putting on black face for the movie Tropic Thunder came up\nRobert Downey junior was nominated for best supporting actor Oscar and there was no way by the way that even\nYeah I think what most Tropic Thunder made maybe ten years ago eight years ago maybe eight years ago in any case there is no way that movie gets made even today because of the great sensitivity around identity politics but here is Jamie Fox is perfectly decent\nExplanation of Robert Downey junior and how he feels about all the\nPeople have to understand where it comes from your roof people that do to really mean you have\nLike outside of us I mean there's some group even really like whatever you are whether you're black you why you're straight you're gay whatever it is there's some people really don't like\nWe're in agreement and it's easy were easy targets\nSo when when Jamie Foxx and jets you have to know where it's coming from there are some people who are bad out there who don't like you are Robert Downey junior is not one of those people why don't we start thinking of each other as people who probably could be friends if we would stop hurting each other like garbage\nAnd Megan Kelly is not going to a party dressed in blackface my black people and it's kind of amazing how certain people get away with this sort of stuff because everybody as soon as the best motives on their part so for example\nTom Hanks in two thousand four was at a fundraiser and that that fundraiser there was a comedian who got up and it was one free and he was actually making jokes while wearing black face when he was actually ... and he was wearing a fight way and Tom Hanks was cool with that\nAnd the controversy laughing about five minutes because Tom Hanks said listen that never should have happened it was inappropriate I don't know what was going on there I understand people were offended everybody said wait Tom Hanks has since a race as we know he didn't mean to mop black people we know that he's not interested in taking in in somehow hurting black people and everybody got along with a lot\nBut because we are interested in right now in what can we can people to the wall over that makes for the worst available country\nVersion of ourselves and that has to stop whether we are talking about making Kelly or whether we're talking about President Trump or whether we're talking about the the attempt to nail people on the other side of the aisle in in ...\nOkay I'm going to talk a little bit more about this plus I Want to talk about the latest on the Caribbean issue in just a second and plus there's some breaking news on the return address of fishes packages\nBut first let's talk about the fact that you are going to die I no Doxil stuck so today but the fact is that if you haven't thought about that you probably also haven't thought about getting life insurance and you ought to have life insurance just as a responsible human being\nNow maybe you thought about life insurance but it's kinda hard to buy because you have to work out what you need to do the research to find the best quote hope we don't get swindled well that's why you need policy genius policy genius compares quotes from the top life insurance companies\nAnd they find the best policy for you it takes just two minutes to get a quote if you don't know anything about insurance and got all the tools to get you up to speed move the difference between tournament whole life insurance calculate how much coverage and eat sugar making the right decision in fact over four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance\nPolicy genius doesn't just do life insurance either they also do disability insurance home insurance auto insurance\nIf you care about it and they've got insurance for it so whether you know a lot about life insurance and nothing at all start your search of policy ingenious dot com in two minutes you can compare quotes make an informed decision for you and your loved one policy genius is indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance policy genius dot com go check it out right now what do we sent you\nOkay so the the update with regard to these bombs that there was a return address I was put on the labels Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office that doesn't mean that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is actually sending these bombs and means that somebody is probably trolling by doing exactly that okay so\nI Want to talk a little bit about a little bit more about you know where we are as a society and how we how we care all of this\nAgain we need to start with the premise that the people that we are talking about generally do not have harm in mind that their goal is not to destroy us in any way if we figure that we can have normal elections yes fought heated elections but we're not going to be trying to kill each other because we can assume that\nMost people in the United states grew up in the same dealt with the same Diced and we did\nAnd they did it I mean the reality is that we all grew up in the same million\nOr values are not all that different even though most right wing members of the United states and most of the members of the United states theoretically agree on certain basic values freedom of speech and hurting each other a compassionate way in decently\nAnd why because we all grew up in the same study when you grow up in the same society you share a certain level of base my values now I think that splitting I think that's one of the problems the country but one of the ways that split is exacerbated by simply assuming the political disagreement reflects underlying character differences now speaking of political disagreements and you\nKnow the polarization of our politics that social fabric those common values I say are being split and you're seeing it in in some of these democratic campaigns one of those campaigns from Stacey Adams she's the Georgia gubernatorial candidate for the Democrats and she was caught on tape talking about free marketeers what she had to say\n[laughter] and higher here you are free market [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nFigure [laughter]\nSure [laughter]\n\n... and you can't hear you saying the free market I have never solves any problems in the medical field which is obviously on through your baseline root issues in American politics but I think Stacey Abrams is therefore lacking character no I don't think she's just wrong I think she's wrong and she doesn't know enough about economics and she's misinterpreting the economics that she does know\nBut if you're bad person I don't know Stacey Abrams probably not even though the you know there's tape of her I I Believe now burning a flag back in college so I guess we've now whipping directly from script written by Aaron Sorkin like we're actually just going to do the American president\nAnd again with Stacey Abrams I noticed this weird trend in the news in the last couple of days like there was there was a ... Boston plane that landed on the one oh one nor I got like not that far from where we do that\nAnd all I can say is thank God for the ... because the royal Airforce really took care of business making sure the ... and so the man in the capital is coming true that's exciting and apparently Stacey Abrams is directly from the American president\nAnd then there was a story that I saw today that a guy who looks exactly like David trimmer\nRobbing a liquor store and and robbing a beer so rough for my friend has been cut loose and President Trump is the president Donald Trump the president and the United states you know Scott Scott Adams the guy says maybe living in a simulation I'm starting to maybe believe that we're just living inside we're we're we're in script but any case\nThe ... the divisions that that\nBefore they get any better we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest\nMaybe we'll know sense these bombs that certainly bring yesterday's events of your\n\n[noise]\nThings

major Garrett\nIs with us to like CBS News chief White House correspondent to talk of his new book Mr Trump's wild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills chills screams with occasional blackouts\nOf an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue you what I should have learned in your lead up with this quote\nMajor fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be\nThe real world on quote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you [laughter] know factory right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo uh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture of humility 'cause I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\nA full blown though at all or an aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that an audience can feel and touch and relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate\nThat you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced and been around the track is I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability\nSo that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give the listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd said to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I only taking the time\nTo look at that sentence deconstructing and ask myself some basic that super high level of psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you\nI Would have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to the very first sentence\nAnd one example of it major fantastic what is that about well it was a press conference before rally in ... in Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of\nHis press conference before the rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen\nAny of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here you're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic\nThat's Trump I should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually mean and this sense as I say in the book\nOf adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\nAt your table exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I said to myself there were all sorts of these great clues\nThat Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I'd taken more time been more\nCurious about this different kinds of political actor and there's different ways of dealing with language I'd I've learned a lot more than ... wouldn't have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock well\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets\nYeah let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for an eye on them up I mean let let's let's just your look at the at the circumstances of this man\nI I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nI Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that\nVery large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf\nCourses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was a completely different actor a different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game [noise]\nAnd I write early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do and Jack Black [noise] uh that Trump lots of politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie [noise] those uptight parents who want a\nA school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that and the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music\nDonald Trump and his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lives that sort of thing and it's I mean while to get out of that it took a while to get out of it and say you know what the laser different he's enjoying them and look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're going to have to pause on that note that when it come back what they look at how some other Republicans were in these lessons with major get rid of the moment\n\nAre you looking they senior care for your mom and dad they don't know where to start high I'm\nDown in line with us from on Medicare parents are a lot

yanking your chain and try to do things go with what you think you believe in what you think you know what works for you\nPresident elect Trump appreciated that like wow I'm already being taken seriously and giving ... given ... real practical advice by sitting president on the other hand he gets this Michael Flynn thing\nAnd he wonders what are you sitting up here or what is this about why are you just picking this one guy had you know I like him you know he was a surrogate of mine\nI knew he fired him President Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency because Michael Flynn ... weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn not you jump really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information\nAnd yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember there was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael fled he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President

Missouri to like a good evening Patrick into welcome to the program\nWelcome along a think tank a major Garrett or riding such a good book and you know actually he needs somebody to tell the truth but I really think that if anybody takes a look at these bombings it's awful convenient that all the people that are being investigated\nOver this current corruption received the bomb\nAnd none of them went off and now the FBI almost completely stopped I Would imagine investigating him and his running around trying to find out who set these bombs I think and it happens right before the election plus to take the heat off the convoy coming up through Mexico\nOh I well I think with our guests comment about to all of those various factors that has momentarily are taking a attention away from that the

game from our conversation demos is that the answer to this question do we really need another Trump book which is not an unfair question and I would say in this sense we do why\nBecause we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't think it was in a book about what's actually happened what decisions have been made what\nIf you want to call and this and the White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen that are likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that is with us is this dramatic shift\nCarried out by president elect Trump there was a good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition\nTo start a relationship with the Saudi regime and fundamentally alter America's approach to the kingdom in that geopolitical read region shift away from all Ron shipped away from the Iran nuclear deal\nAnd create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to all wrong\nAnd so much of U.S policy in the middle east was predicated on that and has followed that track set in motion and I detail how during the transition by these early interactions if you want to think of this way of the two young princes Jared Kushner\nAnd the Trump Administration crown prince Mohammed bin some on the de facto leader and Arab parent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their interactions and their trust in one another was foundational to this emerging Rio orientation of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and\nA long time ago summer of last year\nWhen the White House was more inclined to cooperate on books like mind Jared and I had a long conversation about this which is on the record in my book you don't find very many on the record lengthy conversations with Jared Kushner about anytime many topics almost none on this topic so if you're curious about how this all got started and what that perspective is\nI I recommend the book to you because you can actually find out in Jared Kushner's words what they're trying to accomplish what their initial hopes were\nAnd certainly the Jamal can showcase brings many of those hopes and

in the Wisconsin and of course it is there is a certain amount of irony obviously attached to the president\nCalling for a a civil tone it would have been a lot I think a\nA better for him had he not engaged in some of the tone that he is set in the past because that would have given a clear and moral superiority\nOr in contrast to a party which has stood by and essentially in some cases are actually whipped up the Bob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the mob but again the president is often hard pressed to uh\nTo curb his tongue so as a result he finds himself dipped into the mix with the with the others hear your thoughts on that a doctor Uber's bid go back to some calls here\nWell I think I think when we talk about President Trump we're talking about actually a

and having to deal with\nWith both parties that seem to become kind of a ruling class and they're tired of that so they put somebody in there are different and\nI think they expect him to make mistakes and pulp halls and it doesn't bother to the middle class or the middle group of America\nSo I I think they feel he's justified in the state\nUh I'll put it this way he makes enemies he doesn't need to make and that would be my friends to complete a deal that David in San Francisco hello David\nWell Jim when your guest sure you know it's not I've I've always had a fear of a a a fear

instead cost older women\nAnd and usually know accounting so top secret budgets fear based budgets a suit and sometimes a bad science budgets are can clearly go out to just off the register it if you're trying to check the books for Congress\nAnd you discover that some program is just looking at for all it's worth\nA you know when you get whistle blowers we the people need to whistle blowers okay and and so this idea of getting every uh getting America to start spending that money and then every willy nilly ill\nAs opposed to this whole incident the Saudis are so guilty\nAnd these two versions of trying to be afraid of people seeking freedom\nYou know I guess I'm trying to put your comments in the context of the discussion at hand we're talking about the uh the seven pipe bombs that were delivered to today various locations I mean\nI remember the ... ... are you familiar with\nThat and I doubt that most of the people in the audience or one of the Palmer Raids um how does that relate to what we're talking about\nWell that sounds good Hoover got his start and it was in Woodrow Wilson\nThey had these pipe bombs that went off in Vanderbilt\nYeah they actually went off in this case pipe bombs could have gone up I trust you are not not assuming the tracking down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a I mean it may be budgetary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the Patriot act and they\nCame out here I Am about to that's why they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we faced an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's safe founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose I don't feel any particular instances we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights for quote unquote safety is a bad mistake or I think we have to be cautious as\nCitizens and pay a lot of attention to what our government is doing or politician now and we're we're the watchdog so\nI I see where he's coming from we need we need to have you made the low down some of this knee jerk reaction\nAnd make it more of a thoughtful\nProcess new laws and you know there are times and you know I Know it can ... that we just have to react because we only have pi yeah anything out\nAlthough of course I Would note that that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our rights for example we don't have a right to get on an airplane quickly correct but All right to a job in Albany, Oregon now but hey you know\nHit everything that I thought at least to me it's sounding like Sam wack job took President Trump's rhetoric for marching orders\nMaybe or maybe he decided that he would still be tried as severe conservatives we don't know\nThis is true that's true yeah and that it was the\nRight or NATO though I don't know how much of a quote unquote white job could could have coordinated\n... that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber that that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't come they don't tend to come in well organized groups exactly\nYeah that that that that I think that the doctor makes a very good point there that's for this to have been delivered of the matter that it was would indicate that we were talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it they ask given that we will always have people of that nature we got three hundred and twenty five million that was\nBut Oregon I that uh that\nThat of course is a whole nother level of concern yes All right what are your six six five oh jumbo and the more with Dr John Huber and your calls as well about the boy had a show in a moment\n\nKnow I appreciate your thought I I again I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr Huber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away it can't be the midterm elections
