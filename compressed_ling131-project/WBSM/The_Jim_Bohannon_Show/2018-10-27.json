morning\nABCs and guitarist ... yesterday I was able to track down a fingerprint on one of the envelopes that was sent to Congress from and Maxine Waters they also were able to extract DNA evidence from one of the packages sent to former President Obama and that was used to identify\nCaesar's say alcohol was taken into custody in plantation Florida say say say I was like man it's windows loaded with pro Trump than any Democrat anti CNN stickers\nPresident at a rally tonight in Charlotte North Carolina\nSaying an effort by the media and race than ours is the actions of one individual just let it go against me and the Republican Party\nThe mid term elections ABC News senior congressional correspondent Mary Bruce\nI'm voting issue\nHigh tech like actually I think what's interesting\nIs the one year old Gregory Bush should have been charged with murder in the shooting gets to people in a grocery store just outside of Louisville victims were black and Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers never science Bush tried to get into a predominantly black church just before the shooting video surveillance system called or\nWho was almost like a free ride a U.S attorney Russell and Cameron said federal investigators are probing\nViolations like shooting you\nCan make your listening\n\nTo a nearby\nDi di\n\n\n\nCrimes including crime but you know by the attorney general Rod Rosenstein\nFor which is like for drug trafficking particularly if you\nAsk questions which federal\n... says the psych was desecrated\nCar and your name for the\n\nAfter\n\nThe\nWrong hands into my life [laughter] and now I'm\n\nLike why are you now are energized\nBy the first ... ... by the world for\nLabor Day tomorrow night three sixty five miles from a code awake for when they were twenty five dollars off tomorrow\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\nI\nWalk on this is the bench bureau show that a ton to get you today we start with the breaking news the authorities have indeed arrested a suspect in the election attempted bombing of various democratic officials and media things around the country\nThe guy's fifty six years old he's identified of Native American support now this is why it was it was stupid for somebody on the right to immediately leap to falls flat\nI don't mean asking questions I mean we're going to fall flat suggesting without any evidence that this must be a false flag attack that this must be some sort of democratic operation the most obvious explanation for a person sending a bunch of bombs you highly public officials is at the crazy person and then as it turns out the person is indeed a crazy person\nOnline records show that this guy has a criminal record and he is on the company is called Native American catering inventing as well as proud native America ... row price dry cleaning your body builder and you said you have been trained by DNA and phone records in this flag is just back after making previous terror threats to judge it so presumably\nThis is all President Trump's fall ... version of a man that links this guy to pro Trump anti Hillary Clinton stickers here's what the pictures look like for those who can't see\nThe man is plaster plastered with pro material it's just in his army and like and you saw this on the street you would think you're absolutely crazy person there's an inverse proportion between the number of\nMaybe two and a number of bumper stickers on your car and your sanity were bumper stickers on your car the more clearly we can assume that you're crazy person so that means that this guy is a complete ... job obviously if you just want than you would say the guy's currently not job like you would not know anything else about him\nAnd then it's also the craziest bumper stickers that's not just CNN sucker bumper stickers it's pictures of President Trump and like and it is Hillary Clinton with a target over her face it's the same thing with Dan Jones and the target over his face it's the meaning of President Trump riding a tank with explosions in the background\nAnd there's a there's a bumper sticker on her hip hop he's soccer recruits for Trump which I don't even know what the hell that's supposed to Maine and I always go figure that it would be a soccer supporter was going to be responsible for something like this shock or I Can't believe that somebody with this man is\nIs sending bombs to people that's crazy now the media immediately jump exactly where you think it would jump which is\nThe guy is it crazy he was a perfectly rational same human being and so President Trump came along unfortunately for this will be live all available evidence to this person has been arrested some ten times they were I was arrested back in two thousand to one of the time it bombing threat\nPermanent was the way I guess that was President Trump's fall back on his on The Apprentice or something and that's the take of the media today\nLaw enforcement officials covered that white man it was covered in photos as I say a Donald Trump and like Penn and had at least one sticker referring to Hillary Clinton it was a little tape from CBS News covering all that you have to be covering the van so all of that is just a renaissance man it\nAnd I think that it's incumbent upon the Republicans in this country to start to speak out\nAnd did not open their mouths when they can't actual father they did not open their mouths when he attacked a gold star family while he said he was going to grab women by their genitals and when he said the second amendment will take care of Hillary Clinton faced faced silence and they are the perpetrators of ... I\nMean what's amazing is that when Democrats are actually reminded of violent rhetoric used by Democrats in the past and they get very very angry and this is the part where the one sided ... of the media is creating more volatile political climate coming up as I said well what's really do not like to be reminded that overheated rhetoric is fairly common on both sides and we have the\nVisual and audio evidence of that right here in Haiti tour of MSNBC getting very very upset when she was mind that the Democrats are fond of using overheated rhetoric as well maybe media bias has something to do with the ... in the country\nIs a venture bureau [laughter]\nDollar shave club has everything I Need to look the on smell my best and I never have to go to a store which is awesome because I don't like stores that's\nBecause they deliver everything I Need right to my door and they keep me fully stocked on what I use like don't run out here's how it works dollar shave club has everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for that'd be covered head to toe hair skin they and their new program automatically keeps you stocked up on the product you use your determine what you want when you want it from one month do once every six months\nThat's what I Do for yesterday's toothpaste plus with\nTheir hands from discount the more you by the more you say they've got a bunch of stars that you can try for just\nFive bucks like the ... and after that the restock box shipped regular size products in regular price then your soccer set right now for just five bucks a dollar shave club dot com slash but that's dollar shave club dot com slash spend all their products are just terrific I particularly like they're staging black pepper shampoo\nIt smells delicious I also like that body wash it really is read all their products are really top notch and again you don't have to go to the story more but a dollar shave club dot com slash spent that special deal dollar shave\nClub dot com slash then you'll be ...\nYour trip gifts then you've got hooked by the sales pitch bought the timeshare and you've regretted it ever since and maintenance\nThese kept increasing and we just didn't want to deal with it anymore that was not anything like what they showed us when we bought their timeshare\nTime shares or the day in the late [laughter] they're all cats you know really unless you talked to resort release we can release you from the time share legally and permanently plus rated by the bb one hundred percent money back guarantee that our clients five star reviews tells the story you get\nTo some of the ... was never anything hidden absolutely wonderful\nEither one of the gun away before twenty Nineteen maintenance to use their goal now for a free consultation made a a thrill wave fifty nine fifty five\nPayday day three oh eight to nine fifty five four resort and released dot com they catch we release resort really hated it three away fifty nine fifty five eight eighty three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resort release dot com call now\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's pretty hard not to worry about what am I dated guys making an online purchase are simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk you are being tracked down lined by social media sites marketing company and your mobile or Internet provider which is why I decided to take back my privacy or using expressed VPN\nExpressed VPN has easy to use apt to run seamlessly in the background of my computer\nPhone tablet turning on especially at the end protection it only takes one click\nAnd expressing the insecurity and none of my your Internet browsing encrypting data hiding your public IP address\nProtecting yourself with it's about the piano costs less than seven bucks a month so it's really cheap protect your online activity today to\nFind out how you can get three months for free\nAnd express VPN dot com slash bed\nAt ...

bureau shops and we've been told by the media all volatility in the country is due to President Trump ally as an interim has contributed to the volatility in the country if they exist at him and will continue after you've gone and the media for why\nSo let's say for example kitty kitty ... over at MSNBC obviously a member of ... and ... was wind hit by a guest about some of the violent rhetoric used by Democrats and recently she didn't like it wasn't willing to talk about it because obviously only one side of political ... bad and volatile and uses overheated rhetoric\nYou out of work that actually might Iran and other politician other than Donald Trump say I'm so proud or or or or or given kudos to another politician who body slammed a reporter have you ever heard that from anybody else other than Donald Trump\nAnd the answer is no it's terrible right now it's terrible when President Trump says that stuff also and it's terrible when Democrats say that you should pick people when they said he should confront people in public places when Bernie Sanders claims that Republicans are going to kill millions of people with their health care plan to pretend\nThat the volatile political climate in the United states is anything it was ridiculous but this has been a longstanding democratic tactic for legitimate decade this actually is dangerous for the country for two reasons\nWhat a dangerous enough to meet his take on this is when they suggest that rhetoric that does not incite violence is responsible for violence there criminalizing whether it\nAnd when they do it for only one side it appears that they only want to criminalize rhetoric on one side which leads people to believe that they are coming for you\nAnd to fail to acknowledge that has to fail to acknowledge what's driving a lot of our politics these days which is a reactionary feel that the other side is threatening you\nAnd its presence on both sides now let's get to the right wing response to all of this preemptively so there are people on the right I think most people on the right and said listen we wait for more information here we don't know who did this most likely outcome is crazy person I said this\nRepeatedly I said if you think this is a false white attacker you jump to the conclusion false led attack based on nothing but confirmation bias you're doing it wrong there was a substantial sums Fred I'm On the right that suggested that this had to be a Democrat had to meet somebody on the left who perpetrated this because obviously was convenient for Democrats in the run up to the election\nThis sort of conspiracy the rising is not good either the reason that it is not good either is because it allows people to believe that there are no crazies on their own side that evil is entirely relegated to people who disagree with them it leads to more polarization\nAnd again it's not good for the country when you jump to conclusions based on your own confirmation bias and right now there's tremendous incentive to do just that\nThere's no incentive for people to say let's wait for more information let's wait for more information is one of the least popular sentences in American politics and it's usually right it's almost always right\nBut it's the least popular phrase because if you jump to a conclusion and then jump ends up being white you're such as happy that I get to know how you know he gets it because it's got was right he he gets it and if you're wrong on sites as well that was right it's just the fact and that has got in this case but he still knows what's what\nSo jumping to conclusions being incentivized on every side right now and it's really bad and it's particularly down the presidents of the United states doesn't don't legitimately legitimately just a couple of hours before the FBI arrested the stuff that President Trump started tweeting about the bottom up this morning so he treated out about CNN\nFunny I donated CNN and others can criticize Mitt will even blaming made for the current state of bombs and meticulously comparing this to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing it went to criticize them they go out and screen it's just not presidential\nHe's right about that one a president from his corrected\nOne when he says the media read him and the criticizing it well and when he when he responds they like to talk about why didn't or Oklahoma City and that he's and he's creating not he's not wrong about that but here's what President Trump does do wrong again just stop there at seven Nineteen am hopefully ...\nWhen they were really looking for economic opportunity she'll go home and apply the right way I don't think there's anything wrong with Trump's and go home and apply the right way but if the idea is that if you legal for them to approach the southern border and apply for asylum that of course is not true either\nWhat does also not true is that the United states has an obligation to take an everyone who wants to cross the border and no matter what\nWere they come from or what their motivation is John ... back and he says the ... he he's spoken about\nNow as a religious person who seasons out three times a day doesn't talk back to me but I talked to a fairly often like a lot okay but\nApparently got does talk to John ... and it's funny I have left one mock Mike Pence when he says that he has to prey on things in order to make a decision on John cases now than left his platitudes in the name of God that is totally fine here's John Case suggesting that God doesn't want us imposing the caravan\nLet's stop putting up walls around ourselves and not understanding the plight the trouble and the problems of others it is not right and the lord doesn't want it and our people ask their hearts wants to reach out to others\nLook at what they do in these storms they go and they were people they don't know they put them in their homes they feed them that's America not old is your garbage in this division and yelling\nAnd the hatred on all sides okay well it is also true that is America is maintaining a border so there's that as well but even John ... the guy who's going to bring his altogether can't stop myself from using this sort of overheated rhetoric\nIt's a problem okay so you know speaking of overheated rhetoric Megan Kelly is going to be out at NBC\nOr she's out at NBC because they are basically fitting about Megan Kelly being racist so this was sort of predictable making Kelly was not getting good ratings in mourning and so they decided they wanted the dumpster and then he found an excuse to dump her when she said I'm a morning show\nThat she didn't see what was wrong with people darkening their skin for Halloween costumes they accused of being pro blackface as we've discussed over the last couple of days this was sheer absolute nonsense we'll talk about the media's attempt to polarize the culture\nOn the issue of race but first let's talk about

I Am ... he says it's time we met and take responsibility for our role and the problem of violence against women because it all men are guilty of violence against women\nHe says I've decided not to cut corners joined me with due diligence in civic duty and publicly proclaiming I Am sexes in fact perhaps at a time we lay claim to a movement I Am section think about us national international implications as we take responsibility for sexism massaging or patriarchy\nIt's hard to admit we're sexist I for instance would like to think that I possess genuine ... bona fide\nFighting but who am I kidding I'm a failed and broken feminist more pointedly eye infection there are times when I fear for the loss of my own entitlements as a male toxic masculinity takes many for all forms continue to hurt into violent women\nFor example before I got married I insisted my wife take me last night after all she wants to become my wife so why not take my name and become part of me she refused she wants to keep her last name I was not happy especially as she had her father's last name which I argued contradicted her position against patriarchy but as she argued this is my name and is part of my identity I became stubborn\nAnd interpreted her decision as evidence of a lack of full commitment to me well she brilliantly propose that we both changed her last name and take on a new name together showing our commitment to each other\nYes obviously this guy's real anti feminist ... says if you're a woman reading this I have failed you mean it's like a male was forced apology\nIs it sounds like a POW tape\nMy silence and an uninhabited collective massaging I have failed I help and continue to help perpetuate sexism I Know about how we hold on to what was the power that humanized you only to their sense of masculinity I recognize my silence as an act of violence in for this I sincerely apologize\nAnd really what he's doing so you're saying I'm not a success because I'm apologizing for my sexism but every other male is the second is that super heating the rhetoric is that polarizing our society maybe just a little bit and let's point out the media topography when it comes to these sorts of issues\nWhen it comes to these sorts of issues every democratic mail is concerning non sexist in reality\nWhen it comes to when it comes to the media making Kelly happens to be a person right of center a Jimmy Kimmel as a person left of center as it were brought up the fact that if we're going to talk about black face Jimmy Kimmel and two thousand didn't actual black face routine on national television on Comedy Central the Jimmy Kimmel in in ... not only\nMocking black people use among Carl Malone specifically mocking Carl Malone for not being able to speak English properly there's a lot closer to insulting black people and make until he saying I don't mind if someone dresses up and dark and their skin is Diana Ross to honor Diana Ross he Jimmy Kimmel somehow is a show on ABC no problem there is going to come all circuits you'd Alison [noise]\nSome and I fall into the sky [laughter] ... [laughter] ...\nOr\n... read all the all white people to buy earlier in all on a hill older [laughter]\nOver and over [laughter]\nIs that if I'm\nFairly that wasn't a problem for Jimmy Kimmel but it's a serious problem for making Kelly to suggest the dressing up as a black person on or a black person is is not that bad she actually have to lose her job over it\nAnd they get paid her out but you have to lose your job and get\nThe polarizing environment predated President Trump will it will go far beyond President Trump because that is the that is the nature\nOf the politics that we have chosen and it's the nature of the politics of the west continue to push the most radical extreme there is an opinion piece in today's New York times that is fully anti science and just completely crazy you know this is now being touted as not only mainstream but if you don't believe it than you are apparently they get\nThe pieces by Dr ... sterling professor of biology and gender studies the ... the the piece is called why sex is not ...\nThe complexity is more than cultural it's biological to do what the doctor ... sterling day better faster sterling points out that there are genetic sexual disorders that make people intersects for example\nAnd she therefore suggested because they're intersects people there is not sexual by more efficient in human biology this is crazy talk okay it's just crazy talk\nShe cites a bunch of ridiculous\n... honestly ridiculous references like this is my favorite just because I happen to know something about that she talked about Jewish botch the ancient Jewish rabbinical code notice stepped up for example\nSometimes treated people who had male and female parts as what they could not inherit property or service priest at other times men preventing them from shading or being secluded with women so supposedly this means that it was a third gender\nNo you don't okay someone who actually knows this stuff I Will tell you exactly what the Jewish while I was doing the Jewish while I was saying this person has to\nThat basic ... the basic\nDistribution of resources that is not even means that the person who's more prosperous somehow victimized the person who is less prosperous Jews happened to be more prosperous uh they tend to achieve highly intellectual areas of Israel is is a wealthy state\nAnd so forth looking down and they say well they must have gotten wealthy by scoring somebody else and therefore they're the bad guys in this particular situation also the state of Israel is a nationalistic institution left does not like national isn't they think that international ism and globalism is a is a better way\nI disagree we'll be back next week I shouldn't be appearing\nOn NBC's Meet the press on Sunday Morning when

for this\nBut I agree with you if you're a fake out in this trial you know he had these rallies take a lotta here take a lot of on the track here\nI don't know it's been like throughout the rest of the country to hear a sport at an angle it when we had a early elections\nThere's been no facilities here and there was no it wouldn't have before we've heard that this is going on\nIn even after the news broke that this is going on for lack of facilities hill or did you would've thought that navy or the news media are rough it's people's attention\nThat they would come down here ... off the oil that it'd be interesting if anybody else out throughout the country early elections before I think the early voting places but I think it it it's pretty nasty here\nBut what do you say when you say pretty nasty there are some that you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nSo here's you know you've got one side on one side and the other side on the other side and you know one side trading at the other\nGuy talking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning

and it'd be interesting if for happening in other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again uh I uh uh\nYou you in other words you have it in a in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the or\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't see a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like fire houses in in schools\nAre are are opened up in this regard I note that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox you send in an absentee ballot or or or no protest in the offices of let's say a a ...\nOr the county office building so these are all polling places huh I well\nYeah well that's what they call it is early huh why are they going to focus his early election\nBut then after a certain things they have to go to their kids ages ... to ... and of course you can see the half hour but you were just I Would say that one story row gets ... they're not knowing that if we can ...\nI Believe that aired and they're just wanting that wasn't there for like ... fall out later that Afghanistan I even heard\nOf that I'm an expat sustained fun it's really it's not\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering you know do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has all we can I don't know if this is true in other states\nIt seems clear Wyoming to me as far as people in this state ... ongoing arrests factory\nI just can't help the people that have been a rough for twenty and everything's going out on the street I guess that's perfect for me\n[noise] um yes it reflects as me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times\nAnd the convictions or one would matter in terms of uh of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but I see what you're saying that yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would just thoroughly concur only uh get colds in from Philadelphia tonight the good evening\nOn land [laughter] yeah that moment on your mind so I'm fine\nI'm I'm a ... so I was I going to follow up on what you're saying where laws and you know a person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from a more proactive and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health is even more under served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes in so many times\nYeah they brought people on probation they put people on parole maybe they could have a thing where they uh put people on a mental probation where they they go to a specialist a health professional and they got to help and maybe if\nThat kind of thing was more accessible and the first place that person was never get to the place in their minds whether they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are expensive that's one part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and I'm from the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening in the first place that's just priceless especially if the yeah especially somebody could be better building bombs and they I Would I say get lucky they get\nThose bombs or go undetected something actually happens and people get hurt than to prevent something like that with a little bit of investment is definitely something I see is priceless well wildly on buddy\nAgree you are certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment and give but let's say a\nSeventy percent chance that uh we both fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo haven't Joe on the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he has told authorities that they were never supposed to go off so ... what ... calls things I don't know go ahead Greg\nYeah than I did that that is the that as well as the ... this thing that this man and one set up for this guy from day one\nThe whole thing is that is to try a random set their support for the for the Democrat but they're really hold on one of the targets I get up at six ... six years ago\nBut this is such that much faster than believable\nWithout one or the older was granted he tended to pick a a has banned or never was targets that's very true but there is a I I'm not sure about why when you say is set up but I mean uh it sounds like the guy said at Jim Jim this okay how do you know he was at a quote set up and by whom and that's when I get [laughter]\nOkay All right oh my goodness oh isn't that the CIA who did that\nYou're saying you're saying that you have knowledge that in fact the Democratic party establishment a higher seas are say Huck\nI put it past that I Will not I would not\nWell okay so it's not a case of you know that at all it's the case of

basis they're under the law for some kind of a of a preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people that have been arrested who have a criminal histories that pay their bills are that are are able to take care of them\nSo they're not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking

wanted to share a some information about what was it may have made that original comment\nA ... years ago I was watching a historical presentation on PBS or CSPAN\nAnd uh what was portrayed was that it was no less than Benjamin Franklin\nWho approached John Adams us to ah make a comment that an apology was in order and debate for John ... get onto apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention this wife\nA menu even said that a famous line apparently that gentlemen don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the the the origin nation to that it is a credited description of thinking in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that uh it's an sporting a I guess in in times of winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\nWell I just what I mean yeah\n... but again but in terms of the origin or perhaps so I I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I Want to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n... shirt so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Edward Snowden leaks ah you know the Snowden story revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans to assert very surprising a lot of people surprising me and I started to read\nAnd if say and the history of the un is that when you read about the history of the NSA all roads lead to this guy a William F Friedman Elizabeth street menus husbands or he's considered to be the godfather yeah say if you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's a large lord\nMan by the way is it Marilyn directly between Baltimore and Washington\nBut go ahead so if you if you go to an estate headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus William Freedman head outside of the auditorium there's named in his honor\nAnd so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William or who was a code breaker famous code breaker I saw that is why it's Elizabeth was also a break [laughter] yeah that's interesting right how ... how many has been his life's a code breaking teams can possibly be [noise] ah and so I started looking for more information on most of their\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a a a link to a library in Virginia [noise] private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had less there before she died in Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down I live in Philadelphia\nSo I drove down to the library and I I went inside and I said hello and introduce myself and I said I was curious about the Elizabeth Smith treatment collection and [noise] and they were very friendly and they ... they brought out box one\nOf the twenty to a boxing is that it was the last guy I started reading her letters and ah it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because as soon as I started reading her her handwritten letter Sherlock hundred years ago I was just\nA immediately taken with her I mean she's such a [noise] a such a it's kind of voice on the page or and and the materials that library had work\nOr or what are the kinds of materials to any journalist and author who would want to stumble across it was our original college diarrhea was there it was you know love letters that she wrote to William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written in\nCode like one of the amazing thing I really like the ... I was going to see who else would do that right\n[laughter] right yeah no I mean it's it's actually it's actually kind of a [noise] I mean it's lovely 'cause we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing or in secret messages as a way it's you\nI'm as a way to hide things but for them it was a way a flirt [laughter] Hi it's nice to bring them closer together and ah I was just a the the tax or these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I realized after\nSpending some time with them that are there was an untold story here they're really good needs to be cold but it was a story of you know this amazing hit and a woman who was behind the developments of American intelligence and the twentieth century it's just kind of a genius\nTo solve all kinds of problems than six all kinds of messages and you know the more I read the more I realized that she she was kind of like that like figure and American intelligence sister she's\nBeen I haven't I I Want to come back and continue that thought or as we will continue right after these messages\n\nAh during the twenties and thirties she was taking on these gangsters and\nShe wasn't just taking them on in an office you know solving their messages and getting them convicted she was actually\nAttending their trials and testify and\nSo they knew who she was\nRight the newer face they could see her and um it's just not necessarily the safest thing to be doing right you can you can uh you can imagine and um\nAnd so yeah so there were there would be you know there'd be gangsters or on trial a lot of these a lot of these run running rings where international crime syndicates those essentially the mafia and so she and she would walk into court a unprotected with you know a pink dress in a in a in a a [laughter]\nWith a flower pinned to the brand and she would stare down these guys the defense table you know five foot three and she was a explain exactly how she had broken their coats exactly how she had essentially\nStolen their thoughts and uh you know and she did it fairly fearless we all all through that time\nBut it was necessary for her to actually get into the tradecraft\nIn a court of law that's that's remarkable in today and of course the minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial\nI mean that the free market you know these are things that weren't these are things that that uh\nLet me put it this way when I left the army uh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not that many many decades later I was even forbidden to visit\nA a a an iron curtain country for five years after I left the army and I was a a relatively small player albeit with a top secret plus clearance and the idea that she was ... and the court is well this is how we did it I mean that that's remarkable\n[laughter] well yeah I mean so you're you're in your career you you weren't able to you expose your sources and methods that would get right to the last thing that you'd be able to be a good\nWife spent some time at Fort Leavenworth Kansas behind bars and that is correct\nExactly and and that and that's that was true then and it's true today but the fact the fact was at the time she had no choice she was she was ...\nAsked to do to stop Kony by a federal prosecutors because prosecutors needed to make cases against some of these international crime rings um that were killing people and network controlling the the ... and so they they they wanted to get these guys and Chris and they wanted to take down the east coast and it's the only way to do that\nWell it's actually try to make a case against them so in in which that though is the best and ultimately you know there would be a lot of publicity around these trials 'cause it's kind of spectacular\nVisual because he just petite ah America you know an American woman American mother testifying against these guys 'cause she got all kinds of a newspaper coverage that were on edge\nNewspaper stories about Elizabeth so through the Nineteen thirties and uh and the tone of them were it's sort of was like a but there was a woman doing things that men could into I'm I'm looking right now at at one of my favorite clips which is a story a true story published about this and in a magazine called true detection a detective fiction we weekly\nThe true story about her though and title was lady men out there and there was just lining the story about um how small slender American Woman stepped in\nAnd smashed crime where men had to sell [laughter] uh so she was she was a ... she was she was a skeptical\nAnd obviously that made a lot of her
