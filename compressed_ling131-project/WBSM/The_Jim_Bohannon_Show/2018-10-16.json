today brawls between ... and the Proud Boys breaking out in Portland and New York Hillary Clinton is back in worse than ever but we begin today with the greatest story of the last several weeks Elizabeth Warren has come forth with her proof for gross\nIt's using the Native American Well Elizabeth Warren today decided that she would engage in the most humiliating cell phone I have ever seen in American politics\nI mean this is like the best self owned of all time but this is a really bad owned gold my goodness so\nWe have to travel back in time what time it was with Lauren claim that she was in fact Native American she said that she had high chair the cheekbones she suggested in a in a rush of people called powwow chow I kid you not that she was a Native American\nAnd the recipe she submitted to pat well ... ... a recipe again I can you not for Krabbe bisque\nBecause clearly that was something the Cherokees made back in the day crab bit noted crab\nHordes of the Oklahoma planes the her ancestors used to hunt looted Warren told this story over and over about her Native American ancestry and what she said was that there were racist members of her family couldn't accept her parents' romance because her mom was partially Native American here's Elizabeth Warren telling the romantic story\nActually about what it is I Believe this strong the associated with okay my mom and dad all was which was with each other and they want me to get married\nFather's parents sent her because she's porch or key issues for Delaware\nAfter fighting as long as they could why parents but also they looked\nOK so her parents are low because her mom was part Cherokee and part Delaware\nWhich means you would think pretty hefty dose of Native American ancestry right there right I mean if her family is worried about it then it sounds like that would be some significant Native American ancestry\nSo President Trump didn't believe this because it's nonsense that people actually checking her background they found there is no Native American ancestry anywhere in the in in the time horizon of rationality\nSo President Trump went out on the campaign trail this is back in twenty Seventeen I Believe and who's holding a rally in Montana and he suggested that he would give her a million dollars if you could prove or Native American ancestry\nAnd we will say I won't\nFor your favorite charity for trouble if you take the test or to chose your to your [laughter]\nSo today Elizabeth Warren came for what the evidence that she was in fact Native American now I think that it's important to note\nIf you'll leave media bias you have to check out the headlines today because the headlines today are truly astonishing the headline today from the Daily Beast suggests that there is strong evidence that she is Native American okay this it says\nElizabeth Warren is bitterly clinging on to the narrative in the media are bitterly clinging on along with her and then they are clinging on to a bunch of other false narrative that they are putting out\nAll they have to do I said this on CNN all the media have to do in order to undermine President Trump is just try to stick to the truth they can't do it there's nothing that they can do that and that will force them to stick to ... coming up the president of the United states routinely\nLines the fake news sometimes he's right sometimes

had to do all that and it was beyond they can't even do that now they're just\nOpenly about what President Trump says the evidence of this over the weekend there were two separate major media stories that turned out to be basically fall for number one here is eight and NBC tweet about a rally the President Trump did I Believe friday night and says what\nPresident Trump says Robert illegal say great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible now you'd think well that's bad stuff\nYou probably shouldn't call it Confederate leader incredible but here is what President Trump actually said about robbery here's a clip of president from talking\nAnd one day it was looking really business and lick you just said\nYou hardly knew his name and they should do take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd like you said I don't care what probably as you guys are women\n[noise] and his name was grants\nGeneral ... [noise] I like you said [noise] I\nIf he's an alcoholic for actually give me six or seven more just like\nOkay so there is from actually talking about ... what he was saying the Roberts Lee was a great general was overcome by grant\nHe was not saying the robbery who's a wonderful wonderful person standing for wonderful thing to NBC has to actually corrected it from the out he says you guys you got this wrong you got this wrong so here's President Trump's tweet\nNBC News has totally changed the poet and many of my story about general rabbit any agenda Ulysses Grant was actually in the shadow to warrior grant and the great state in which he was but as usual this on his reporting even mainstream media embarrassed\nNBC has this weed out of corruption which we had a full corruption corruption and earlier sweetness identify the general President Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio was general Ulysses S quiz not General Robert ... and the patch video clip lacked the full context for Trump's remarks there was a folk what\nIt took NBC News to whole day's ... and that wasn't the only example of ridiculous media bias in the last forty eight hours\nSo CBS tweeted this out about President Trump on sixty minutes last night President Trump was on sixty minutes here's what things we did between President Trump on his treatment of course being lazy for a rally at the accuser of just now justice Brett Kavanaugh it doesn't matter we one makes it sound like the question was\nDo you care the mock Christine Blasey Ford in terms of it doesn't matter we want well there's only one problem that is clearly not what Trump was saying like clearly not what Trump was saying there's President Trump actually talking we need the actual clip of President Trump talking from from the sixty minutes\nI here he is in context that is absolutely not what he's saying\nOf philosophy forging mimicked her had I not made a speech we would not have one\nBut I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're going to destroy your life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her\nI didn't really make very well that is the person that we're talking about getting over here the time the place ... professor was he forgot before the Senate and ... and\nWas asked what's the worst moment and she said when the two boys laughed at me at my expense and then\nI watched human occur and thousands of people were laughing at her they can do what they I I Will tell you the way [noise] now justice Kevin was traded has become a big factor in the ... have you seen what's going on with the bulls\nDid you have to well I think she was treated with respect I nobody on the show you what do you think you should do you think you treat it with great visual you could just seemed to be saying that she\nIs monarchy they chop people's hands up regularly\nThey imprisoned dissident they're not a human rights friendly country ... upon was supposed to be a reformer but even as a reformer\nHe's still the dictator of Saudi Arabia this is not a supremely shocking story on any level other than we know the name of the guy who was disappeared as opposed to presumably many other people whose names we don't know who have been disappeared second the Turkish government has a pretty strong interest in trying to humiliate the Saudis because the Turkish government\nHas basically been anti Saudi for years that are in bed with the Iranian government at this point\nAnd to a certain extent in bed with the Syrian Government as well\nAll of that said the Turkish government releasing evidence in an attempt to make it look like they are friends\nAired on his leader of turkey also an Islamic thug who has imprisoned dissident until dissidents too so there are no good guys in this part of the world or at least not in leadership positions in any case\nThe call for the United states to distance itself from the Saudi Arabian government after all that I think is appropriate but I think it's also appropriate to know that the outsized consternation with regard to cars shaggy which was outside I don't mean that is inappropriate totally appropriate but when compared to the amount of consternation over turkey imprisoning thousands of people\nInto a minute ago and president a U.S pastor\nOr Syria murdering ... half million people or bond pursuing terrorism across the region\nIt's it is amazing how the human brain has the capacity to hone in on a single incidents of evil in a way that it doesn't on her literally hundreds of thousands of incidents of evil but with all that said the United states does have to do something if the Saudi Arabian government is calling dissidents\nTo conflict and then ... them that's not ... that that is that is a bad thing here President Trump on sixty minutes talking about it he changed his tune a little bit today\nThey ordering military equipment everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wanted if we want it if we got it\nSo would you cut that off what where when I don't want to do [noise] blowing lucky Raphael and all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like ... there are other ways of a hung out how to use a word that she's pretty harsh words lenders true\nOkay so you know when when he says that he wants to maintain certain economic ties that is not great for that he needs to actually be exerting pressure on the Saudis for now he has to do that carefully because he also doesn't want to give a lot of leeway leverage to the Iranians who are enemies with the Saudi regime and have been fighting a proxy war in Yemen\nWith the salaries they're again they're no good guys in this particular area of the world but with that said\nYeah the president ought to be signaling some pretty harsh rhetoric with regard to shaggy situation is not that one files under bad Trump today he said the Saudi Arabian government denies it they say that it's not real so we're just going to ignore it that is not\nGreat stuff from the president okay other stuff that the president said during the sixty minutes interview here are some other bedroom here's President Trump and Kim Jong own uh the the dictator\nAnother evil dictator and he has more and more it's for him\nAnd I know but why do you love that guy luck luck\n\nHim okay that sounds like you know it's like an ... will let it be interpreted let it be whatever it is to get the chance guy look let it be whatever it is\nI get along with him really well I have a good energy with them I have a good chemistry was him look it's a horrible ... no\nNo more stretch\nMe so you know him and talking about him that way is not good either you actually have to demonstrate a strong and President Trump did that early in his presidency with him but he's not really doing that anymore so there's a lot of good Trump that from happening uh with with regard to sixty minutes but that's who the president is and it's important to note that his ups and downs\nAre indicative of the man's mind I mean that's just to President Trump is than just a second I Want to get to the other big story of the weekend which is these violent clashes happening in Portland and New York between ... and the Proud Boys\nBut first let's talk about your Internet Security with all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about what might hate it does make an online purchase reactors or email or could put your private information at risk\nBecause you are being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies are mobile Internet provider\nWell not only can they record you're browsing history so often sell it to other corporations want to profit from your information which is why I've taken back my privacy use the expression VPN expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer\nPhone and tablet today on expressed VPN protection only takes one quick expressed BP and secures and anonymous and your Internet browsing encrypting data hiding your public IP address protecting yourself with expressed BBN and costs less than seven bucks a month\nExpressed BP on his way to the number one VPN service by tech radar it comes to the thirty day money back guarantee if used public why fight and you want to keep the hackers out expressed VPN is the solution you don't want to hand over your online history to your Internet provider\nEspecially in that's how you do it or is that your online activity today find out how you get three months for pre expressed VPN dot com slash then at the X.

Trump has good from her bedroom\nHillary Clinton just has said that Hillary there is no such thing as good Hillary Hillary came out over the weekend and said that Bill Clinton should not have resigned over Monica Lewinsky because he did not abuse\nIn any way I Do walk that she is considered a hero or heroine of the feminist movement pretty spectacular stuff in the last year here as Hillary Clinton\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power no\nNo there are people who look at the incidents in the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an inch or in the power imbalance just to work in an adult\nBut let me ask you this where's the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made\nSo good so good so I I Love his trunk should resign because of allegations against him but her husband should resign because of allegations against him also he didn't have used foul when he's forty nine year old presidents of the United states was being service by twenty two year old intern in the oval office\nNone of these power anyway good to know the power imbalance is no longer a concern for feminist on the left very exciting stuff also Hillary came forth and said President Trump is sexist of course the reason that you know something as a sexist is because Trump was mean to her\nIf you watched the way Trump debated me it was just interviews with ... making fun of me for preparing well you know that's the old like oh yeah the girl in the class who's always prepared I don't need to be prepared\nThat really was that would happen to those debate what happened with the Trump was much of a jerk to her as he has to every other human being on the planet and it didn't play well with her because she's one of the most deeply unlike ... human beings on planet earth just what the Democrats have decided to full scale embrace the most radical version of themselves\nYou know they say enacting we have to get in touch with your authenticity Democrats are certainly getting in touch with their authenticity the problem is that deep down democratic leadership not particularly charming\nBernie Sanders is is another example of this so Bernie was an Jake Tapper show on CNN and Jake Tapper asked him about the inflammatory rhetoric on the part of some folks in the Democratic party and Bernie\nA follower of who's shot up a bunch of Congress people last year came out and said that it's not that bad if people get mobbed in public places like it's it's amazing the brain doesn't feel any necessity to say anything here about the sort of action\nYou know I wasn't again I don't blame Bernie Sanders for that incident last year because unless you're openly calling for violence I don't blame you for somebody going and doing violence but\nWhen Bernie Sanders refuses to condemn mouthing in public spaces you certainly is not making the country a better place I\nAm very strongly in favor of mobilizing the American people\nTo stand up and fight for economic justice and social justice and racial and environmental justice and I think we have to mobilize people I Am not a great fan of being rude or disrupting activities but this is what I Will say\nThis entire year two thousand election campaign is going to come down to two words and that is voter Toyota\nSo he's not fair to people getting when people get rid of that sort of the way that it is and voter turnout and don't want to dance and enthusiasm\nIt just shows how Democrats are willing to work\nWith the mob politics they've been talking about for the last several months really since Maxine Waters broke out into the open with it and they're willing to do so on a on a regular basis or even willing to validate mob violence on a regular basis over the weekend the Washington Times report the Portland mayor Ted Wheeler\nHim under fire over a viral video showing antifa protesters blocking traffic and harassing drivers but he says he supports the decision by police to watch from a distance without getting involved\nBecause I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the Portland police bureau decision not to intervene the whole incident will be investigated the video was posted by journalist and you know do and it showed protesters including members of anti find black lives matter locking an intersection\nI think to direct traffic well officers on motorcycle watch from a block away at one point the activists chase down Seventy four year old ... house or after he made a white turn against their wishes pounding on his silver watched and breaking a window the cars and same thousands of dollars in damage he told the Oregonian but Mr wheeler insists the motorists you feel completely safe\nComing into downtown Portland or all of this this lack of law enforcement this lack of crackdowns on antifa it leads to\nGreater heightened violence when other people who are ready for violence show up in places where ... is now here's been my recommendation for very long time I speak at a lot of public events where protesters show up and some of those protesters\nIn the state and city should investigate every one of these incident and the people who instigate violence you go to jail if the city was doing that in the first place you'd balls would not be breaking out we've seen them now in New York City this is all ugly stuff\nYes you're ready to defend yourself don't go to events spoiling for if I'd be there in coordination with the police if you're on the side of law enforcement you're doing something right and if the west refuses to allow law enforcement do its job this sort of stuff is going to become more and more prevalent and it's horrible for the country\nTruly truly awful for the country where we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates

today\n[noise]\nAbsolutely absolutely so that we do that we\nWe did a very very effective counter propaganda so what we did is we is Shaun White lights on the lies Soviet Union wherever they were and we demonstrate to the\nThe ... and the internal coherence balls that ideology so whether it was the president a cooling Soviet Union the evil empire with it it was his speech the Brandenburg Gate

Soviet Union right you're Free Europe right you'll live with the the voice of America we we we were heavily engaged in the world of ideas and this has been one of the failings of our response to September eleventh we become\nThe most powerful nation in the world to the scene and we are able to kill terrorists once we locate them with with with almost impunity\nBut at the end of the day if you kill a terrorist and eleven or twelve people volunteer to replace him the very next day old you are creating as an endless cycle and it becomes the practice of global whack a mole so\nIn the in the in

happy with the way the world is but I Will deal with it as it is and I recognized the fact of dealing with it as it is means that in many cases our choices are not between good and bad they are between bad and worse and if so I had any like any other rational person will choose bad over ...\nThat would be my answer to Joe what about yours\n[noise] yeah I'm quite stunned by the\nPolls that

is defeating jihad the winnable war and a\nOne eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number\nDr Gorka you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling I don't know if you're caught this in the cabin or hearing the Democrat Senate starting with Cory Booker a used the phrase\nThe truth when talking about the testimony from ... to fold that is so telling her truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this post modern is on this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics can be divided into two groups\nThose who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twentieth and twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would ah concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction\nBut what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my objective truth\nWas wrong but there is this right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into that our own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truth for multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the absurdity of of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you can use against the the liberals the spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nIt depends I mean the the the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if\nIf it's a Muslim who's living in America uh I'm I'm the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's the problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh will or elsewhere\nWhere if the law becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land of ... such as Afghanistan\nThan we have a problem because then the the truth that we hope to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes these things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements are are dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies\nThere's these things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements are dangerous in this case because\nWe have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but he's a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left uh pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat or you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah they're very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist a in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation mold and forty two percent of\nAmerican millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America this is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact within the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed and then they will socialism communism so\nYeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to have this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially at the College of faculty level in many cases who have an absolute axe to grind and an very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to drive even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that\nBut in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor presidents of these universities about been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated\nThe schools the high schools and colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody is a good as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allow the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the ... show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\n[noise] you think you know the ... brothers well here's some things you may not have known about this directing duo\nJohnny's in Cohen have directed more than Fifteen films together but began working together when they were very young they're collaborative directing began when Joe saved his lawn lawn money to purchase a super ... camera\nRecreated the films they saw on TV with the brothers are notorious for being script stickler most of their films line for life are exactly as they are on screen as they are on the script some of the actors\nMost frequently Kastner film thirsty shiny John Goodman and Joel's why France has been dormant in interviews they're usually described as being relatively brief with their responses and less than accommodating often pacing effort of in their behavior\nHowever despite this they're very accommodating to those they work with George Clooney instead of the duo quote they are really very easy to work with will put George that different this episode of unique\nYou know movies make sure to subscribe like ... ... followers on Twitter and get the latest movie and TV news on screen writing dot com [noise]\nLee is being forgotten please visit wounded warrior project dot or\nThe world can be dark and chaotic and our relationship with God can sustain everyday people's Christian Church in\n... entering I\nMean you know to help you to\nTune in for a message to\nFrom where we're working twenty [noise]\nFavored to talk for talks stations will be twenty first street worldwide on the bill UPS and don't do you go\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard cancer and\nA federal judge just thrown out Stormy Daniels decimation lawsuit against President Trump\nIn the court's ruling here in LA the judge agreed with President Trump's argument that when the president tweeted about Stormy Daniels calling a composite sketch of a man Daniel says threatened or a quote total ... job\nThat he was an opinion not a statement of fact about Daniels' the judge ruling was rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and the first amendment protects that type of a statement\nABC's Alex Stone in Los Angeles Daniels as attorney is promising an appeal the\nPresident and first lady surveyed hurricane damage in the Florida Panhandle in Lynn haven Florida hard to believe\nI've seen pictures but it's hard to believe when you're\nAbove if they don't play the total devastation\nAnd Georgia and the president heard from farmers whose crops were wiped out by the storm multiple sources report the kingdom of Saudi Arabia will acknowledge that Washington Post columnist Jim ... died during interrogation that went wrong\nPresident Trump not wanting to spoil a twelve figure arms deal with the kingdom suggests that road killers maybe to blame\nThis has become a major diplomatic incidents the president's explaining why he has to do to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia\nI what I don't want to do rowing blockade Raytheon all these ...

which is just a moment here but he's looking at solutions\nTo health care problem that has not gone away Obamacare was still on the ropes of the Republican Congress would pass section could do nothing seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's a very real problem for many many people Lawrence calls in from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nThat ending gentleman I could use the time it more orientation here is genie see is that sort of like a political song for candidates except you're selling ideas about health care\nWell first of all his GDP and this was as good a time of

help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nOr I was there anything else that you are you wanted to ask you about Lawrence\nThat's good I think I can make my contribution now\nUm [noise] I basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high\nUh I also just ... and psychiatry now back in the days when I charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the men and our I actually made more money that way then over the years as it went higher and higher\nA I Want to express my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happen there\nAre those are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention accept doing my therapy keeping up mentally\nA medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything went off the screen and maybe you have some insights but um I Want to make a point here that once upon a time I think the medical world was more\nUh like I was able to do it in the early days my practice\nOr the people were coming in hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive\nWay that was going to help them resolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still they were in charge in that respect I think\nThat's different than what your gentleman that we're talking about a yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the PBA ca and I understand the need to help corporations figure out\nHow to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get to that and the second was will stay on the line but to your response or substance and\nWell there's a couple of things in when we're when a riot\nIt started to see that go I'll go back in the first part of your question or comment Lawrence which was you know back in the day it seems different than it does today and that seems back in the day it was different [noise]\nUm as as we continued to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I now\nYou you know we can actually draw very clear and close parallels to what we saw in the banking system by two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail\nWe're seeing that same thing up her in the healthcare system now healthcare systems aren't run by doctors any longer the run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenge that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation\nUsed to you you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system try to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of healthcare they're no longer doing that\nAre actually working together and working together because of the al ... as a result of the Affordable CARE Act insurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit her in the AC a\nFifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and the c._e._o. or Wall Street based organization and I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin I Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patients that by my product and this is part of the challenge we have an healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility is to the shareholder not to the consumer\nAnd so we started to see this movie when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred in fewer insurance companies are in the market they've gobbled up the market share and\nNow they're going to the hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies now every doctors in network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care\nIsn't true at all discounts don't matter anymore\nPrices do\nAll right uh the the the leaves that covers quite a bit to the thing that you would like to add to that the Lawrence\nWell I can add in bring up the the second point a day so I think\nThere's something strange about a a doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrator or most hospital administrator is I have a bachelor's degree\nOr they couldn't ever get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more interest martyr actually let these people run the entire ball of wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs down hospitals are even worse than\nA doctor prices are the and and the\n... were coming up on a break here that does move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause do it after these messages\n\nAgain or going to

therefore they Rob Peter to pay ...\nYou are you still be talking about the practice of taking money out of the Social Security trust fund which of course has been done for a wide variety of things and in fact a lot of people think that there is a in fact an account someplace with all of that uh that psycho withholding when in fact there's nothing there but an Ohio you so I'll I'll address\nDid with our guest the substance and so\n[noise] well listen I mean yeah [laughter] definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to look to move money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is really insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash and the coffers from a standpoint of\nWe we the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're borrowing against the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive\nAre the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nI'm with the baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created\nTo ensure that the American citizens didn't outlive their retirement savings\nRight and so but we distorted that
