or watching the show tonight\nAnd when you have a good show for you tonight Stephanie Burke is not here ma'am own eases not here ... off on some kind of an adventure Stephanie's down in Tennessee doing an event with Porter at the er at the location that I Believe you saw on last week's episode of haunted live\nI forget the name of it right now but that's where they are and\nFor those of you who saw last night's episode of haunted live on the travel channel very exciting to see echo vox used on TV\nAnd actually have great results for eco boats now those of you who have listened to spooky self goes before you know that I've long been a proponent of the echo box echo bucks echo vox app but ah [noise]\nIt's been a rough go trying to get that on television over the last few years I've I've tried on all the different series that I've worked to get them to give back over the try but\nA lotta times they were kind of reluctant to put it on television because it is now and because a lot of the\nParanormal community out there as untrustworthy of apps but ah I can say echo boxes the real deal I use it and all of my investigation that I'm always impressed with what comes through so I recommend that you give it a try\nIt uh it is you know pricey if you want to buy it it's it's not a free app it's not a one dollar rap but uh the results that you will gather are well worth it\nSo if you do get a chance if you haven't seen hounded live already or if you did watch it you'll see some of the responses that they got direct communication from the echo box\nWith investigators last night with the tendency rave chasers and uh no it's not for Ninety nine Mr happening on the chat room I'm Sorry it's a little more than that it's a it's twenty dollars a few use iPhones and I believe it's thirty dollars if you use Android\nFor the most current version the echo box three\nBut like I said I highly recommend it it's a it's very intensive or if you have never used it before and you first use it and you're a little overwhelmed by all the different settings I recommend going on Facebook and joining me echo vox users Facebook group\nBecause not only will you find other investigators in there that you can talk about people who use a vox every day\nNot only will you find the creator Danny reverse you hangs out in that group all the time sharing his adventures and sharing the latest developments on echo vox and giving some some expert advice on how to operate a best but\nAnd so when we get there we're going to take a train ride around ... uh and then at the end of the event and then at the end of a train ride will have some pizza and then after that we will be a investigating for hours and you you definitely want to take care of a take a part in this investigation because\nNot anybody not just anybody gets access like we're gonna have\nTo the museum building to the suicide house where three different people have killed themselves over the years ah the the museum building has had tragedy as well but we're not allowed to talk about publicly but we all share with you all we are there\nAnd um all the decorations for when if you were a kid like me\nAnd\nIf you grew up going to eat a villa Christmas Time a lot of the decorations that you remember being out there are now in the attic at the museum building and we get to go up there and investigate\nWith all of that as well plus the midway all those rides came from other parts and they all bring their own energies with them including I Know for a fact the carousel came from gas light village in lake George New York which is unknown hunted theme park that is now no more so\nThere's all kinds of weird energy is going around a ... and of course it's built on native former Native American land which has its own\nA activity associated with it as well so you can take part in that event and then November seventeenth will be at the bowl mansion in Worcester our first time ever investigating there will be a checking that play so and also having some of their their find pizza that they offer\nSo all of those events are are for sale at a spooky south coast dot com if you want to get your tickets

about her story the number to call in his five eight nine nine six zero five hundred\nIf you want to call in toll free eight seven seven nine nine six fourteen twenty we have um\nThe phone lines open throughout the course of the program so it's not like other shows where you know we we say we have to save the phone calls for the final segment or anything like that we like to keep the phone lines open throughout the entire night because this show is just as much your show as it is ours\nWe're only doing this so that you know you can hear these stories and you can hear what these folks have to say what our guests have to say and so we want to make sure that you feel like you can be part of the show at any time so you can call in throughout the course of the night and you can also drop your questions and\nFor us in the chat room it's ...\nDot com on spooky TV on YouTube if you want to ask questions they're the only thing that we ask is if you want to ask a question please put it in all capital letters if it's a question that you want to have answered on the air and I I mean a serious question they want to have answered on the air because um well because\nI Need to be able to see it through all of this growing chat so that that really helps and and if you really really really want to make sure that we see it then you can uh you can do the the super chat to protest turned on ... okay it would help her out on your microphone on but a super ... super shadows on\nYour which I thought so if anybody wants to do that you and all you have to do for super chat as you make a small donation of of your determination to the program and a and you'll be able to ask you a question and super chat and it'll show up and you know maybe you just want to throw a couple of bucks anyway you can do that through super ...\nThat's another way to help out with the show with uh 'cause this was all funded out of our own pockets you know we um we pay for the pod casting they pay for the website we pay for all that stuff and we don't we don't get paid to be here on the radio so\nThis is our way of uh helping to finance some of the operation so that's a good way to help us out not that we have our hands out\nWe're not trying to beg you printing money we're not trying to get you to keep a roof over our heads or or feed our pets or anything but uh we do appreciate anything that you can do to help us keep the show running smoothly and we will\nMake sure that if you ask a question and super chat if you make a donation to a super chat in any way we'll make sure that we recognize that on the air too so\nSometimes you do that kind of stuff and you get in trouble it's like that thing that they do you know you know they do it like at St Patrick's Day and at Christmas Time and Halloween where you can you can buy the the pumpkin or whatever and All right\nAt the store and then if you pay for it you can kinda right whatever you want on yeah like as long as it's clean\nAnd you can you can you can get away with and stuff so I've I've always made it made the donation and I've always puts bookie south coast dot com on it I was thinking like if I put the donation up there somebody will see it and be like oh I don't know what that is going to check that out right so it's a way to kind of give back and and still be able to\nYou know promote the show a little bit 'cause I don't think people that ... we we do give a lot\nBack like with all these events that we do like this isn't money that goes all in our pocket oh right yeah we're making substantial donations back to these locations and helping to keep them going so you know we we like to think of ourselves as a slightly philanthropic organization\nSo that's why we're we're willing to do the same thing if you're making a donation will will mention you on air but uh [noise] there's a there's someone that's even though we're not technically on the radio right now there's there's still some things that we we can't say\nDamn it\nI Know such a rebel right I said the one I said a word that like everywhere else on the radio every day\nBut um that government [laughter]\nBut uh certainly uh we ... we will continue with our super chat program in the future uh where we work with ah some nonprofit organizations or where some of that super chat money will be donated to those non profit organization so I don't want people to think that\nUm we're doing this all just for ourselves or just tonight it's just so happens that we don't have it linked up to any\nParticular nonprofit so tonight the money will go to us which were were pretty deserving\nEntity ourselves so\nNow we're we're going to be talking about near death experiences before we do that I have to ask you have you ever had a near death experience have you ever\nUm something where have you ever had an experience where you thought you should have died or are they you didn't die um\n[noise]\nI don't think ah it came to the to the where I thought I was going to a parish but I mean I've gone in minor car accidents before where I thought my life is in danger\nI mean have you had that experience with your life flashy before your eyes type of thing\nUm no no I'm maybe you get that I'm\nKind of like freeze freeze up mhm where it and like right before like an accident or something where everything kind of slows down but I've never had like a a thrown me back to like years before and seen like going over all the bad stuff I've done or anything like that\nLike like or was that movie Albert Brooks defending your life where you had a I think the closest I've ever had was I've I've had some moments where um I thought it was going to die but I ended up not dying which I was thankful for it but you know like um like when you're choking on something\nOr ... than from a gas station\nWell that's that's a danger that I'd I'd do that just keep myself sharp [laughter]\nI like to walk in and be like a chilling dangerous today what should I Do I think I'll Try and ... sandwich [laughter] um but uh generally you know generally I've had a few of those experiences where it's been that uh\nYou know you start choking and and there's no water around and you're worried if you can like make it to a sink or or the fridge or something I'll write something to drink or to wash it down you know I've had a few of those moments\nAnd it's it's it's usually when you're shaming ... when you're like eating alone [laughter] and you're really like shoving your face right or not bothering to like take normal human bites but like I said oh\nIt's always it always happens that are at those times because of the times where you can be just an animal and just devour think\nYou are yeah and you are shame eating anyway so like you're alone like you're naturally alone for that so if you do start choking are screwed unless you can find like yourself yeah which you really need like a chair for\nAll right we're going to get into the discussion with our guest coming up in just a moment not if I can just have to favor of you would you mind just running out into the hallway and grabbing me a like a cup from the from the\n'cause I I have a truly a bottle of soda over here but I don't want to drink directly from the bottle home and you don't want\nKnow that I drink directly from the bottle so I Want to be classy\nIn and be able to do it that way but ... why don't we get into it with our gas right now uh she's gonna be joining us for the rest of the show Nancy rinds is a leading voice for\nPersonalizing the wisdom of near death experiences developing our hearts centered in tuition and living a life of inspiration and creativity and she joins us on the line right now good evening Nancy are you with us or\nYeah and uh we're so happy\nHave you uh I was uh watching some of your appearance on a Megan Kelly today and hearing some of your story and I think this is something that will resonate with a lot of our listeners in on the topic that we've covered a lot here on the program near death experiences something that I think happens a lot more often than people realize\nAnd then I also saw the accident happening from outside so from a point of about Seventy five feet or so outside of the the crash which kind of freaked me out I didn't know what that was all about on\nThat at that time I didn't know what to make of that and I just ... just chalked it up to something really you know obviously who that was weird but I didn't know what to call it at that time and and I just let it go\nBut a ... um some bystanders stopped her from driving because they've seen what happened and uh the paramedics came and they took me off to the ER\nAnd it turned out I had you know massive trauma to my spine and I ended up with like twenty four bones that were broken in multiple places\nUm [noise] some internal injuries you know a crack stern into this and most of the damage was to my spine and my neck and it was pretty bad it was I was lucky to actually have survived on ... and ...\nTo have survived with without a losing my ability to feel my legs are arms so there was a good chance that I Would be able to recover\nSo you you said that you kind of went outside of your yourself while this was happening um what what goes through your mind them is that it's happening because it's it's gotta be frustrating to watch your physical self going through this and being aware of it but not being able to do anything about it\nWell actually you know the the really weird thing or at least I thought it was weird at that time was that that that consciousness that I had that was outside of my body wasn't frustrated at all it was a very peaceful\nUm [noise] loving compassionate side of me I Would call it my soul and it was\nI remember what that part of me was thinking and feeling it was feeling you know wow this is really a you know I paint painful experience but it's exactly what needs to happen and everything will be okay\nAnd it was very calm about everything that was happening so there was no frustration at all it was not to be\nUm I still do it it must be hard to to go through I mean I've seen just sort of an example like one of the the most famous cases of somebody being hit by a car and the way that it's changed them I think was a was Stephen King\nBecause he was he was hit hit by a by a van and and he has written about it and and we see a kind of in his writing in the way that it's impacted him and I think part of that was because he never really came to terms what happened to him but it sounds like you were able to come to terms with what was going on pretty much immediately\nIt it was it was a theory on\nA life changing event from the get go I mean I you know I did process what happened for you know a couple a years afterwards but even ... like you just said\nI felt at Keith about everything that was happening which was really odd because I was never at peace in my life before [laughter] [noise]\nBut it it's interesting to me that you know this is I I don't know if like people that get into the categories Asians of these things they might say well well not really an indie either you were having ... even though you were near death and you didn't almost die or is that more of an out of body experience was that would that be something that's more of\nOf having that detachment from self\nOr to be able to see that but it sounds like you know to me it was more like you were kind of a on your way out of your body or you were kind of on your way into another existence and and and for whatever reason just just were was able to stick around\nYeah you know I've had people debate that I I don't try to categorize it because\nI'm that wasn't that big event that happened anyway that round people call it um a kind of a small near death experience or other people call it simply an out of body experience or I've had a couple of people call it a on a by location\nWhere you know whatever it was it I don't really have it I don't think there's a really good term for it I think you know the chaplain explained it to me she said well you know I've heard about this before and you were getting ready to leave your body completely permanently you know you're on your way to die\nRight it it didn't that was going to ask if you felt like there was anything that kind of a the kind of dragged you back into yourself or anything that might have pushed you are back into your cell phone so it was just a natural like one minute you could be outside of yourself and then one minute you were back in your body\nWell actually would drag me back in was first of all thinking about my daughter [laughter]\nAnd then the second thing was that pain when when the accident was\nHad stopped when she had stopped driving and the paramedics came and started kind of take trying to figure out what was wrong with me that's when the pain started and that's when I snapped back together with my body at that point\nUm it was the physical sensation of that extreme pain of feeling like I felt like my back was ripped in half um and and was that pain I think that brought me back\nBut in a in a way that pain must also now I'm sure you weren't thinking about it at the time but that pain must also be um\nSounds weird to say but someone of a company sign because at least you know what you mean ... you know you're alive if you're feeling the pain\nAnd I knew I was alive and but the fear that I had is the pain was so extreme in my lower back I I kid you not it felt like my body had been ripped into that's how bad the pain was and I was really terrified that if I moved the wrong way\nThat I wouldn't be able to walk and and it turns out that would have been the case um you know the injuries are so bad that\nThat they did require surgery to repair and that's where the actual Andy happened was during surgery a few days later\nAnd um well let's let's kinda fast forward to that then so you you go through the through this accident or just kind of take us through what you remember 'em from getting too from that point in to the point where you had this the more intensive Andy\nYeah so it was you know basically the doctors didn't think I was going to survive the weekend and so this happened the accident itself happened on a friday and uh they had tentatively scheduled surgery for the following Monday so a few days later\nBut I I my doctors told me later they didn't tell me at the time but they told me later that they didn't they hadn't actually expected and these are ... to survive the weekend\nI'm so that's why they put off surgery um so it was basically for the weekend I spent laying flat on my back in the hospital um\nYou know my family and friends came to visit and kind of sat with me to make sure that I was OK I'm it create the on Monday but but it was really just kind of a boring pain filled weekend just lying on my back\nAnd then I'm so surgery that Dave surgery came and I was really terrified I hadn't I'd had surgeries before but nothing like this but I hadn't even broken a bone before in my life and now\nYou know my entire back was shattered\nInto a um they brought me into the O R and I was absolutely terrified that I wasn't going to make it back out\nUm and they brought we'll me into the O R I had this 'cause I was completely conscious at that point um\nThe the the lights were so bright in the operating room that I had a momentary thought of this is almost like you know the pearly gates [laughter]\nWell I mean it seems like you were still pretty uh you know you were still of sound mind even everything that was going on or to be able to process all of this it seems like you were still relatively sharp um with your with your mental functions\nYeah I actually um I ... I guess lucky for me are unlucky for me I don't know which but I'm allergic to most pain medication so I wasn't done much pain medication\nAnd it all must have very much and so\nI was pretty loose it because I wasn't on narcotics or anything like that\nBut you're probably wishing that you were with the with the amount of pain that you must have been in\nRight I was a hoping that they'd be able to give me something pretty strong but uh I was reacting to pretty much everything they gave me\nA they did find want eventually that worked I'm fairly well but it in it you know it wasn't heavy intensive pain that but it was it took the edge off and it you know I was able to stay fairly loose it through all that\nUm and and so I was pretty with it when I went into the oh are\nYou know they uh put the they\nActually gave me anesthesia via drip and my I. V. and I remember the the anesthesiologist was joking with me as he was you know putting the the drug in my ... and I am I. V.\nOur software in in these processes that we had um doing some analysis as well but mostly I'm just training other scientists\nAnd so I mean at least is is your is you're going through this I mean you have an ... an analytical lie you know you have an analytical mind so as you're going through this process in in in this other place\nYou know it's it's not like you are as you said being an atheist and in having this background you know you're going through this from a from a rational perspective more than a a beliefs\nIf a true believer was going through something like this then I think that they would automatically make that assumption of you know I've I've reached heaven or this is where I'm supposed to be this is what I Would expect to happen and then you would actually have a lot of doubt as to whether or not when ... when you came back\nYou would actually have a lot of doubt as to whether or not you actually did experience a place where if you were just meeting your lifelong expectations\nWhereas with you you had no expectation going into this\nYeah actually my only expectation what was that there was absolutely nothing\nYou know that there was no that consciousness did not survive the physical body on the belief I had was that consciousness was produced by the physical body and that was it so and the physical body met at that and that was the end of consciousness um and what I\nRealized you know through the whole process of this experience and even after that's not the case um\nBut yeah I went into it and and I was very careful about not like I said before not naming things I just let things roll\n'em and allow things to happen a came up I came into it just like a kid in a ... meaning I Would go I I was there just kind of sucking it all in and just experiencing it's experiencing at asking questions too but\nBut really just allowing the experience to stoke end\nYou know just to try to remember everything that I could\nAnd because also to use you're looking at it from a perspective of um you know I I'm assuming not just not to speak for you as you're going through all this you're going to want to or\nDid you do get back to your regular life you're going to want to analyze where it was that you went where did you think at that time like this is where I'm going to be forever no\nWell I I didn't think I was going to come back [laughter] so you wouldn't want to okay and\nUh the it was so amazing to be there that\nAnd I didn't have any and the thing was that I didn't have any physical pain and I didn't want to go back to the physical by because it was so painful\nUm I didn't want to deal with the physical ... the you know healing and all that up so I had it in my brain that I wasn't gonna I mean I'm like I'm not going back there but when I'm after a few moments of\nJust the you know experiencing that voice and and kind of feeling that ... the loving and compassionate was coming in to me that uh that other being the other woman walked up to me and told me that she was going to be my teacher my guide\nAnd helped me learn what I needed to learn so that I could go back to my life on earth\nAnd I kind of had a bad reaction to that [laughter]\nBecause you're wanting to stay because I\nWanted to stay I wanted I knew\nI knew at that point that this was kind of like the first step in\nThe beginning of what we would call the afterlife now the funny thing is that I I no longer call it the afterlife but\nI knew that this was like step one in the transition to an afterlife and I I wanted to just keep going so that I could go be with my family and friends who had passed on you know before me and when she said well you're going to go back to your\nYour life I\nStarted\nI didn't want to go back in ... in\nA while I was going to say when when the map once you told you that did you in this place did you did you argue with her at all in all er\nOh yeah [laughter] I was I received [noise] well\nIt's funny because she was very patient with it I think which would you explain is that she and I had been friends well before I was\nBorn into this life so she knew me\nAnd I'm new my personality I I can I can be very strong willed sometimes and\nSo a few times I did argue with her that was one of them like I don't really want to go back there and and she completely stop the argument cold when she said well you already agreed to go\nBack and I ... that kind of took me off guard and I said well I don't remember a green to that\nAnd she said well let me show you and she showed me this almost like a movie playing in front of me of me\nAnd the things that I Would call my spiritual team or spiritual friends and I was agreeing to to take on you know certain responsibilities in this particular life before I was born into this life I'm ... now\nOh so was this is pre birth or you're talking about this meeting\nRight yeah yeah\nBut in this in this flashback or you could see 'em well in this in this ah ah for lack of a better term this movie that they're showing that you were showing you where you you like did you look physically like your salsa and did you how did these beings you were talking to look\nWe all looked like I'm\nA\n... kind of like light or ... along gated um\n[noise] maybe three to four feet tall light almost like pillars of life but but more eggs shaped almost hard to describe I'm like in a long gated egg shape of just energy and light 'em\nAnd and I I knew the individual ... because we just we knew each other I I could tell the ... almost I guess you would say the energy signatures of each being was a little bit different and so I could tell who who um\nBut and I could see me and I knew\nWho I was and I knew who everybody else was so do we didn't we weren't like humans\nBut when you saw this you know according to your mind that this was something that indeed had happened\nI remembered it as soon as she showed it again it was like oh yeah [laughter] okay now I remember [laughter]\nSo and and and that's got to be a first shattering unto itself because now all of a sudden you have to believe in in I I guess a a soul at that point\nYeah I mean it was very um apparent to me that\nThere was some kind of an energy being that I was at some level I was some kind of an energy being and we all I mean we are we all have that\nBut but to see that and to see\nTo see those cells of all of my friends um was pretty startling you know I'm from somebody who had and believe that any of this just a few moments before\nSo we we have a few questions from the chat room or whatever I Want to ask you about this experience a one question was was the voice in the feeling that your experience was that something like a a blanket of love that wrapped around you\nAnd uh and was there any kind of a strong vibration during this experience\nIt was it felt like\nIt felt like I was being held in\nA big arms like not crushed but but but but hug like are carried\nIn in big loving arms and it wasn't really a vibration that I felt but it was an energy like warm like it was more than warm but the close to the closest I can describe it is\nIf you're on like a cold winters day and\nI like on the east coast when the winds coming off the Atlantic and you're standing in front of a really warm fire and you feel the heat going through you that's what this love felt like and this energy it felt like it was just permeating me like like warm toward permeate me\nAnd it's and it's a warm said draws you closer like you want to you know we're on the east coast ourselves we know exactly what you're talking about where like draws you into wanting to to be closer to it and absorb more of it and it almost gets to the point where uh you can't get enough of of what it is or isn't enough there to fill you with the with the need that you have for it\nYeah it's it's very magnetic like it's like you know a magnet pulling you know piece of metal to it a very\n[noise] you can't you don't want out of it you you don't want to leave it because it's just so strong and so appealing um and it's and I knew that would be hard to give up\nSo she showed uses this movie this this flashbacks are you agreeing to to go back or was that the end of this experience at once once you realized you had me that agreement\nDid you have any sense of whether this was going to um wrap up or you know you know was there any kind of a sense of when you felt like maybe you had learned enough and maybe asked us now is the time to go back or is there just a a quest or a service to want to learn as much as you could during this experience\nFor me it was a it was more like I wanted to just learn learn learn\nAnd that's not what she had in mind there are certain specific things that she had in mind that teach me it turns out um I just wanted to learn as much as I could\nAnd I didn't have any specific agenda for myself I just wanted to keep learning I still had it in the back of my mind that I wasn't going to go back to my life even though\nI knew that I had agreed to it I was still hoping that I Would go on and and fully die you know my body what forty die and I would go on to whatever came\nOn but that she had some specific things that she wanted to teach me um you know about love gratitude um how we're all connected to each other that just the the amount of connections that there are amongst all of us um that\nHow important it is to be true to yourself and and to listen to your intuition or some people call listening to your heart some people call it you know being true to yourself but honoring you as a unique individual\nUm but a lot of what she taught was centered around how much power that I have in my ability to choose you know each individual moment of my life I I have choices in each moment and\nA lot of what she spent time on with me was really the intricacies of choice and how I can best to use that in my life here on earth and how important it is to keep that in mind when I came back\nWell and I just I Apologize for asking the question is kind of out of sequence it's something that I should have asked earlier but has popped up a couple of times in the chat rooms or when exactly did this happen what year did this take place\nThis was a January six of twenty fourteen\nOkay so uh just just for posterity because uh I should have asked at the beginning but uh\nI did and so now you're saying that in every moment of life we have choice so you're saying that there's there's nothing that's an inevitability is there nothing that we are powerless against there's no there's no state controlling us it's it's kind of our our lives are are are just a a a chain reaction of our decisions\nFor the most part yes that's that's the way that she explained it to me however there is a however in there\nMany of us come in to this life as she explained to me many of us come into this life with certain things that we want to experience or certain things like me you know that we agree to do 'em and you know like this ... this\nCar while car versus like accident with something that I had agreed to experience\nUm many of us come in wanting to learn about certain things or we might want to experience\nSpecific types of events or um I don't know we might come in wanting to be and it sounds crazy but we might want to come in and experience what it's like to um [noise] you know live in a household of\nUh I hate to say it this way that abusive parents or in a in a kind of a negative household as children to to experience what that's like\nUm I'm not saying that everybody out there who's in the ... in that circumstance has chosen that I'm not saying that at all I'm saying that some of us do choose bad experience\nOn some don't but part of the learning is okay so I I've put myself in this experience whatever it happens to be\nHow am I going to deal with that one of my what am I going to learn from that and how if I Want to get out and get out of that experience how am I going to change my life or\nEven the lives of other people around me um some people may choose to come in to a family\nThat then you know um\nMaybe there's been a lot of violence in that family for many many generations didn't choose to come into that family did to change it\nBut they've come in and and you know I'm going to come into that family and I'm going to make a difference in that family and I'm going to to break that cycle of this violence that's happening\nSo we can make choices like that when before were born and we come in and and have these things that we want to experience or do um but a lot of what we\n... we had that ability every day to make choices and to you know she even told me that I could when I came back in my life on earth um I could choose to tell people about this experience or not it was up to me\nAnd I'm so we we do have a lot of power in our lives\nPlease please don't take this in a in a flippant way does that mean then that you chose to be hit by the SUV on on your bicycle\nYep okay yeah yeah no I don't know it's okay to to ask that question because it's really a good question um [noise]\nIt's I the way that the way that it come about what I had agreed to do is there were um three points in my life before\nThis accent where I could have\nChanged my path in life to be more spiritual and the the agreement that I had made with my spiritual friends or my spiritual team was that if I had missed those opportunities\nYou know one two and three whatever they were if I had missed those opportunities then at that point then I Would agree to have this accident\nHappened\nAnd of course I missed all those opportunities I I I Know what\nThey were um and I just totally blew 'em off at the time um\nSo I knew that I had chosen I had chosen you know if if that was ... if if those that times if I don't choose to take a spiritual path in my life than yes let's do this accident\nWas and the pain that you went through as a result of the action resent any kind of of of penance for missing those really your choices are is a just a a byproduct of of what happened\nYou know the physical pain was just a byproduct of what happened but the interesting thing is that when I came back\nUm I think it was let's say at the surgery was Monday so by Wednesday morning I was refusing pain medication because I didn't need it anymore wow\nAnd the doctors were like completely freaking out like you need to take some pain that that said no I really don't need it [laughter] feeling fine\nSo the on the question is a question and the ... before we we uh go beyond what happened with your near death experience uh the question is if you knew who just being was that was teaching you that if deep down inside you knew it was ... and and then if maybe it was a future version of yourself\n\nActually the the ... I knew I knew who it was and it was a on a a being that had been a ... a friend of mine for very long time just not in this particular lifetime\nOkay so does another another soul if you will that had been crossing pass if you throw the course of your existence\nRight yeah you you could call it um like a spiritual guide or spiritual teacher or something but she had a friend of mine for very long time\nAnd we'll get into this uh of course coming up which is she still is she still around you or do you still feel her in your life on a day to day basis\nWhenever whenever I Need to call on her she's there on and not so much day to day anymore but certainly um a couple of times a week at least I check in with her and\nAnd uh mostly just to say hello and thanks for being there but\nThey try to do a lot of things on my own these days and then when I Need help I call on you know my my bigger team to help me out including her\nSo now this was a near death experience so during the course of the surgery and as you were being a six up by the by the doctors are here on this realm on this plane of existence you'd never technically died there was there was no issue where you are physically does\nI was I mean it did it you know the whole the whole concept of\nCare take someone else to make someone else's decisions that can only show them or or give them my my viewpoint or my my thoughts and feelings or what I learned\nBut in the end it's really you know their journey and that's\nThat's okay but at first it was hard um you know I came back realizing that we make this life so much harder than it needs to be in a lot of cases uh it it doesn't and and often times did this in in even me I mean I did this when I was before my Andy\nI made things much more dramatic and\nMore difficult than they really need it to be\nUm and but at the same time you know it's a\nI guess I kind of get some enjoyment out of just seeing all the different live that people eat we eat and all the different decisions people make and you know\nI kind of look at my own life too friendly now to from a much wider perspective I think it is a little frustrating\nI\nThink we lost a little bit there but I mean that is\nThat is going to be the hard part is to now come down I mean it's it it makes it easier to know that making all these decisions are part of the process\nBut it also must make it frustrating to know what lies beyond this and having to go to the minutiae and the day to day of everyday life kind of waiting to get back to that point so yes you did come back with this great message to have to spread to others and this opportunity to apply in your own life but at the same time\nIt was going to be a lot of little things that now you have to wonder gee you know what what does this really mean in the grand scheme of things now that I Know there is a bigger picture\n... at first it was really funny because um I I didn't want I mean it was like gosh I mean I actually have to cook dinner and eat and even the little things like taking care of\nThat\nAre listening minimal oh so you're dropping out of them is a little bit there\nYeah so I was um so you know just taking care of the by taking care of the things in my life I was doing laundry it it just the basics for like really I have to actually do this now right\nAnd and and it's but it's the same\nTime I mean are you looking to find the little the little meetings the little hidden meanings that might be in some of these mundane things\nWell and that's part of it I mean the whole the whole messages that that life is life that's all part of the journey and you know it's it's a ... I became really I guess like within six months to a year\nI passed all that and I realize that it's just every day here is a blessing even though yeah I have to get up and you know today I got to do the line\nYou know to this chore that show or you know pay my taxes or whatever I'm just those are kind of like the things I have to do in order to lift a blessing as being here and fully experiencing the joy of\nAll of that that they are around us I mean it's an incredible experience to be here on this planet\nWe'll we and we said that you've gone from being an atheist to a believer but have you subscribe to a particular ah organized belief system now that you're a believer did you join in particular church or how do you express your um\nHow do you express your belief and observe your belief in in your day to day life now\nI'm pretty I'm as far as other people going very tolerant of anybody else's beliefs and religion for me I go to um a couple of different church if they don't go to one in particular\nAnd I also very open to learning about other religions as well but I Do go to a Christian Church because that's kind of how I was raised in it feels comfortable\nAnd I kind of like a lot of the things that you know this you know that Jesus taught but at the same time that may not be for everybody and it's not up to me\nYou know to judge out what other people's has in life are that's just the one that I've chosen for myself because it feels comfortable for me right now um\nGet the same time you know a big part of it is you know nine judgment and and I was told specifically not to judge you know\nUh you know spiritual beliefs that stairs\nRight because they think the the the question and a lot of people have is for somebody like yourself that has gone and and learned from the experience that you've had\nThe a lot of people would want to ask you well then what is the one true religion what is the right thing to believe in and I think in the in their own right they're all basically worshipping something redeem themselves the the the real problems are just ... you know manmade concepts it's just things that we fight about amongst ourselves and have nothing to do with the bigger picture\nExactly in fact I'm you know my ... my spiritual teacher there had said 'cause I did ask about that and she said well there isn't really one true human religion per se um as long as it's love you know love compassion kindness\nAnd that whatever it is that you choose to participate in is based on that um but it isn't up to you to choose someone else's path for him or her you know you basically\nThe way I came I realized\nYou know I've got a lot on my plate as it is I don't have enough time in my life to to tell other people what to do it's\nYou know I've got enough in my on my own um play to deal with you know just being a spiritual person being loving and kind and compassionate and I want to focus on you know myself and my family um and\nYou know I think we can all the thing is I Wish it that's the one thing that has been frustrating for me is\nThere is no reason why we can't all get along\nMhm and be tolerant of each other's ... differences in different beliefs and different thought processes um and just be for me it's just a matter of being tolerant and and loving for what other people are choosing in their lives and celebrating the differences\nWell it's it sounds like you certainly learned that there was a an another place beyond this and that there was a a greater story this being told that we're just living part of here on earth but um we haven't really touched on this outside of that voice coming from kind of everywhere all at once is\nIs there a God and what you will and what you had learned in in is that got involved in our daily lives\nWell I Would call I hesitate to use the word God I mean I Do personally use guy but I also use words like they design on the divine consciousness\nUniversal consciousness because they don't again I don't know what term to use it doesn't\nThe term God from has a lot of baggage associated with it for what I experienced with more of a universal define consciousness that was much bigger than our concept\nOf a guy a guy with a beard sitting on a cloud ... which is kind of how I was taught about God\nUm it was much grander much more loving much more compassionate much bigger than anything that I ever learned about in school and and in church when I was a kid\nSo for me like universal define consciousness really is the best term although that's kind of a mouthful\nBut we always hear that you know uh when things go wrong or I mean you even when good things happen but mostly when things go wrong we hear well you know it's it's part of God's Plan and I think it's hard for people to accept that especially where you're talking about how we have these choices\nThat impact where we go uh in in in where I live progressive to based on every decision that we make\nI think it's it's a coping mechanism for a lot of people to to say something like that it's not a fact that God has this plan in place and is dictating everything that we do it's just something that we we used to reassure ourselves when something goes not according to the plane that we put into place for ourselves\nRight yeah you know a lot of a lot of what\nA lot of what she would I Would but it was explained to me it was you know we've made a ... believe made a lot of these choices not just as individuals but as a society and as the global culture if he will\nUm that has gotten us into some masses and you know basically she said don't lay that on God you know that's a lot a lot of these choices a lot of these places that we find ourselves in right now\nThat's resulted in any human decisions and you know it's up to us to get ourselves out of them um you know there may be some instances in individual lives or or maybe on a global scale where something is you know divinely\nDoing that a lot less and\nAnd uh certainly uh if you have anything coming up on the east coast or let us know because uh we we would love to to help you spread the word about it and and again if you go to the website you can find out about all of those things are as well is there anything coming up out this way that we should we should know about\nTheir way right now are the kind of like you know\nAll right well we'd love to ah to have the chance to have you in Studio sometime and talk more about this but it was just fascinating hearing about your near death experience and not only that but the way that it has changed your life\nAnd hopefully some some people are [noise] are listening to the Showtime and can take that into account and and live their life that way without having to also go through what you would have gone through to be able to get those divine truth\n\nSo thank you so much for joining us when we look forward to talking to you again in the future\nOr have you have a

I used to call Donald during the campaign now of course I caught Mr President I I'd say you know I don't agree with you on that but I think not there was a pretty good thing\nA ... so you you said that this isn't you know your your introduction was it looks like we haven't improve NAFTA and I think that's a good way of putting it you know a ... you know NAFTA needed to be updated it modernized I think the president was right about that I disagree with them that this was the worst trade deal ever in fact I think it was good for all three countries\nBut it had become out of date there were some abusive practices that were happening by the Mexicans in the Canadian\nOr you you were about Donald Trump many times talked about the\nTwo hundred and three hundred percent there is an American dairy products or he had a very funny line in his speech by the way at the rose garden you said at now those are those Canadians are going to buy our ice cream [laughter] you know which I think that's a good thing but that I'm Ellen so this is a good thing for the whole continent it's a better deal for American companies\nAnd ultimately what this does I think the bigger story yet is that you know this president who's six months ago or a year ago people worried was going to create some kind of global trade war you know is an interesting Michael but now he first she got that they'll deal done with Mexico\nAnd now he's got the deal about what can that looks like he's going to get you'll do with the Europeans\nAre in the national out of town in Rio as reacting to South Korea and Japan and it's like these dominoes falling and the irony here\nIs this quote protection is president and I was worried about this with Donald Trump that he would pursue protectionist policies or you know at the end of the day we may end up with freer trade than ah than more trade protections policies ... with the exception of the steel terrorists which I still think was a mistake\nOkay a lot of people are saying that part of what President Trump is doing is trying to settle these less important trade dispute or the ones that are in the low hanging fruit that he that he can settle a so that he has more leverage to get tough with China do you buy into that thinking\nTotally yeah I think that's exactly what he's doing and you know it was very interesting his beat people get a chance to if you didn't see it live it was beautiful day by the way and and and the rose garden of is that somebody five degrees and beautiful day and Trump got up there he spoke for about an hour and a half he talked about Kevin I talked about the trade deal\nHe had some uh you know back and forth with the press which was interesting I'm just as an aside may say Michael that you know I've been to many press conferences over Thirty years um I I've never seen the kind of abusive treatments that the the meat you know these young punk kids they're twenty five or Thirty years old\nAnd the way they're so disrespectful of president I don't have a problem Michael or you know if someone from media asking the president and a tough question that's why we have to be asked that the president's tough question but it's not the tough questions their manners\nRip with contempt and he started out that press conference by saying okay a first question was what a cap and I said look I'll take cabinet questions but we're here right now to talk of the\nYou know the trade deal so are there any questions about the trade deal and he said after work I'm Talking about the trade deal then I'll take questions with Kevin next person resurrect what Kevin up extra what about Kevin are you I was just outrageous and and uh\nAnd it just bothers me let's treat the price of the United states with respect and some dignity I mean he deserves it and I look I didn't always agree with with Iraq Obama in fact I disagreed with most of the things he did but every time I saw him I was always sir and Mr ... and it just isn't happening there\nAnd I and I think most Americans do and I'll I'll tell you another thing I I Do not think it's going to work for the Democrats this huge article and honest and it's like reading more in peace it goes on and on oh the New York times\nTehran Times that the teen thousand words I mean it's a lot of war is basically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly ah both Trump's both father and son cheated on their taxes one first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... march thirteenth out thousands or it was it ... I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing\nI had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on the first point I made\nWas wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and seeing you know it was a hundred times you know friends episode rerun you know that you've already seen twenty times\nHow many times of the New York times run the story I I mean I worked on the campaign they must won three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes and you know then they win one last year and now the running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of his movies\nTax\nThere is a difference a Michael between tax avoidance which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the\nTaxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of ... after you got the most amount\nThere was a shock tax avoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax\nFraud went a lot of these look I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years has been it by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason there are campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again your old one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump a release his tax reforms\nI advised tromp among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which were Thirteen or they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have you know a lot of the tax documents this\nFor people who to question her testimony and to question some of the details in her testimony as ... it'll have her and her memo\nI question I question both sides I Try to be fair I ... but I Do not mocked somebody\nOkay so again a when you say mocking ... of people said he was imitating her voice she wasn't even find imitator voice there was no false said oh there was nothing like it when he was talking about was the fact that she couldn't\nUh or wouldn't answer basic questions which are very real questions and this is the point that everyone should read the Rachel ...
