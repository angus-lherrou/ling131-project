parish a lot to get to today the radical feminists have unveiled their agenda Hillary Clinton will never go away President Trump loud and violence and the mail that a lot to get to we begin with Hillary and there's a new article and political today about how Hillary may want to run for president for a third time that\nI think that folks on the right or a little bit you saying what about that and they think OK Trump meter last time he'll beat her again this line\nAnd let's face it Hillary think garbage candidate and shake smoking garbage you know the candidate the reason that President Trump is president\nIs yes because he has a certain skill set and just kind of skill set that makes them dangerous to people like it but if she were to come back I'm not quite the same when everybody else that it ends in a radical the fee for I think Democrats show up in large numbers in a sort of revenge play by the U.S and that's a significant possibility that said\nWhat Trump or for her to some of the other candidates are out there no question I mean he's changing the person he knows how to handle she's got more baggage than any national airline that you care to sneak up and she is truly truly awful at what she does\nStill she won't go away because the minute she goes away she can't make money on her other liquid aside gigs and if you look at the donations the Clinton Foundation incredibly donations the Clinton Foundation dropped precipitously as soon as she was no longer running for president because that's how things work and Clinton land if she's not relevant to the national political discourse the money train dries up\nSo much focus on the Democratic side are trying to basically said her stick around the kind of go away so Michael ... my favorite of the twenty twenty democratic presidential contenders and I rooted I'm overly rooting for Michael have not\nHad made absolutely clear I root for entertainment value but if the outcome is gonna be the outcome is going to be I'm not that I Can't control the outcome I can tell you how I think you should go vote but\nIf I'm rooting for a candidate make it Michael ... guys and Democrats just like an avid anti Trump race would just be the great ... the first question and that they would be which one of these slept with Stormy Daniels more times like that would be an actual question in a presidential debate\nThey were there man let's embrace embrace the hurricane and break the stock like let's just do this thing Michael having outta here's what he had to say about Hillary Clinton in his article and political he says\nIf I was running I could see certain circumstances in which you can be helpful for morality perspective in certain locations I'm a limited basis just to say like stay away Hillary stay far far away as I think there's still a lot of people that support her and for that reason she could certainly play a positive role in some capacity and was he wanted to\nThis is like the question in a job interview where they ask you to name your worst quality and you're desperately trying to think of your worst quality and then the thing the name of the thing about Hillary Clinton is like\nMaybe she'd be good at like standing there sometimes\nAnd then the response was showing off the mom and her boy\nWas terrible but I have to admit that I actually have a little bit of sympathy for\n... not in the sense that you should shut the boys but boys do change the dynamic when girls are playing I based on I have a daughter and I play very very differently when boys go to a girl is only going to change the dynamic boys are different than girls radical something just want to have it both ways boys and girls are exactly the same but girls are different from boys and therefore should be separated off from boys when they want to be separated off from boys\nI think that we should recognize ... boys and girls are different also we live in a free country and because we live in a free country people should be able to rise and fall on their own merit without cleaning victimization at the hands of the free society in world history okay so it's Hillary Clinton to run again I

midnight poker President Trump loves being in front of an audience and basically ... is a comedy routine which has its upside and its downsides led the president doesn't rally like President Obama would go out and make some speech the president goes out there and you just rich for an hour\nAnd it's usually very entertaining in a lot of folks have been to President Trump's rally they say it's a lot of fun obviously the crowded there to have a good time it really is kind of half a political rally and half of comedy routine because Trump is highly entertaining human well sometimes that has upsides and sometimes that has downsides because like all comedians when President Trump gets a ribbon\nSometimes the risk is good and sometimes he is just going to put his foot so far down his mouth and it comes out his call in and out his rear end and back around again sometimes he created an Aurora boroughs of human physicality\n... here's a good sometimes the President Trump used up like it's like this is kind of funny so President Trump there's a woman in the crowd and she shouts I Love you and here's President Trump's response\nWise guys the Democrats have church I Love you too [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's finally a woman you know I get it from the mental [laughter]\nFor every guy that said I Love you but just not my thoughts\n[laughter] I finally earned it from a woman thank you\nI think that's funny stuff that's funny stuff and then you'll break that down all its ... and it's because he's funny okay that's a funny thing to say that the funny thing that they\nThe problem is because the president is actually a performer Donald Trump they perform it he spent his entire like being a performer as someone who performed onstage I Know what it's like you play to the crowd the credits in front of you respond with cheers and their response booze they've found with laughter and you're constantly trying to keep the book and President Trump even said that when he was just candidate Trump he would say that he'd go to a rally\nAnd if he was on his stump speech and his three quarters of the way through speech and people look for it would just start saying build the wall because it got people all ...\nThere is is pretty shoddy hey whatever start here ends up here\nAnd it doesn't matter what started there is one of the ... is one of the good things about the president's why he's authentic why people like authenticity in politics\nThe reason he was authentic feeling is because he's authentic in the same way that my four and a half year old is authentic she thinks that it comes out that's the way it is like there's no presents that good in politics because it's honest right you get the feeling that he's on his evil like even the stuff that from says that it's dishonest feels honest because he actually believes that he will say that Trump is just going out there and he's lying for barricaded\nDonald Trump believed everything that Donald Trump says that doesn't mean everything that Donald Trump said is right or factual but it is authentic so that's the good side from\nThe problem is sometimes the thoughts that go through the head should not come out the mouth and that happened yesterday\nUm twice actually so he was talking about Greg ... who is the is Montana congressman and a and I guess in Fort was at this rally\nAnd the president decide you know it'd be a great idea to praise that time the congressman Jim for body slammed reporter so if you'll recall back in twenty sixteen campaign there is a situation in which airport confronted raging for like two nights before the election and Jennifer got mad and he went full\nMacho man Randy's Abidjan\nRight one full undertaker he like grab them by the neck and he slammed into the ground and it's just caught on tape and then he had to plead guilty to a misdemeanor\nPresident Trump things you know what I'm In front of a crowd I've done that we do we need before let's talk about this thing you know this is an issue that really needs to get on the table two years later let's do this so here's President Trump new or is that a smiling as because this is the world we have chosen this is a business we have chosen a time in ... says that we're here we can't go back\nThat just took a guy in the Istanbul constantly it killed in chopped up his body and then look we'll fight it when\nHe says the ... the body slam that's probably if that's that type of attitude that led the Saudis to believe that they could murder a journalist\nI'm not making this up this is what members of media say now because the members of media are insane and respond so let's say Trump says something that is one hundred percent stupid and then the members of the Democratic party and the media come back and say something that is for a hundred percent stupid folks on there I go see Trump triggered him from her and her them if Trump is really good at furthering them\nWell I don't think his actual genius\nI always attribute to stupidity what I cannot attribute some Alice\nAnd I think what we're watching here's President Trump just saying stuff and then the media being unable to hold themselves back and saying stupid things in response to do I think that this is President Trump manipulating the media into being crazy no I think are crazy and he drives them crazy and he's good at at poking them but\nThey have a unique capacity to pull his chest knocked out of the fire he'll say something\nAnd then the media overreaction is so insane that you go\nI guess I can say with those people do hear a CNN CNN host drawing a comparison in the link between President Trump praising ... and the murder of ... by the Saudi Arabian government you know stupid you have to be to make this link and Saudi Arabian government has been murdering people since you know their entire existence\nThey've been murdering dissidents and journalists for literally decades but it was only ... from\nWhat is going to the world has Trump came around ... this is a part of it's so annoying about the media yes Trump's as bad things I guess what the world is also a rough bad place before President Trump was born and before he was president world didn't start spinning the moment the trust President Trump was elected heresy in and help so trying to attribute the spike\nIn treatment of ... journalists in places like Saudi Arabia to Trump as it from his dictator of Saudi Arabia\nAt that rally last night will play for you the president praised the body slamming I Need a guy who can do a body Fleming like that so why does it matter while you might think that is also your journalism any circumstance is bad but remember\nHappens three weeks after the apparent murder in this member of end of Washington Post journalist ... ... and the president we should note acknowledge that it certainly looks like this columnist is did at the same time he refuses to condemn the Saudi regime for this ...\nOkay so if you think that President Trump is okay with the murder of journalists because he says something stupid about Greg ... you know and if you think that President Trump is suddenly driving press members around the world to be killed because he said like the Russian government needed a cue from us\nLike I don't remember this sort of talk about President Obama when journalists were being killed all around the world under his watch and journals were legitimately being killed around the world under his watch but because he didn't say this kind of public stuff there was no linkage\nWhile they're still in the linkage but Trump says dumb things which is the obvious you know answer to do all of that that the worst example this came courtesy of Joaquin Castro one of the Castro brothers who wants to uh I guess who wants to run for president walking is just the other all the other one\nAnd nobody cares about that much and he was on CNN and he suggested that\nAdministration had literally Greenland the murder of democracy Augie by the Saudi Arabian government\nAnd then he was kind of using the gym for the comment as as evidence of this let me go to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner\nMay have with U.S intelligence delivered a shit list for enemies list to the ground proves to NBS in Saudi Arabia and that the prince than may have acted on that one of the people that he took actually goes on Mr ... soldiers\nThat didn't happen Jared Kushner did nothing they hit list to the Saudi Arabian government and tell them to go murdered journalist there's no evidence of this and I like how Joaquin Castro says there's a rumor going around there's a rumor going around the walking Castro dismembered babies and eats them in his backyard\nI'd have to provide any evidence for this rover is just a rumor I heard it around and ... this is why Trump will continue to win so long as people do not treat him with the proper level of objectivity\nAnd by the way objectivity does not mean moral center when he says bad stuff that means that if you respond like a duck\nTo his comment than doubled up on you so in a second we're going to get to more of all of this but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you so why would you buy a generic mattress still for somebody else\nHe would sleep built asleep quiz it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sweet preferences to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from but with the ... there's no more guessing and no more confusion just go to Hugh ... dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes liquids and they will match you to a mattress\nThey'll

you have to try out for a hundred nice risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress or what do you have to get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he looked bleak dot com slash Shapiro my wife and I we have the helix mattress we took that two minutes of course we ordered the mattress\nIt came in the mail and wrapped it in inflated right in front of us we put it on the bed to go in and supremely comfortable and luxury mattress at a non luxury price that he would sleep dot com slash a pure over a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or to once again he would sleep dot com slash up here I use that slash Shapiro so they know we sent you already so\nMeanwhile as the media continue to wildly overreacting blame President Trump for the murder of a Saudi journalist I Would like to make one note about this particular topic okay when it comes to the murder of the Saudi journalist couple of things\nOne the people who are most loudly criticizing President Trump for his treatment of the Saudi Government or people who were absolutely in the pocket of the Iranian its members of the the former Obama administration who want in the middle east to be controlled by an Iranian had drawn spreading its power from Afghanistan in the east to Lebanon in the west and south Yemen\nIs Obama characters who are saying that Saudi Arabia has to be cut off by the United states now should there be serious consequences when allies murder of a journalist of course there should be but I'm not going to take\nAt face value the complaints from turkey an actual despotism that has arrested a hundred and fifty thousand dissidents and last year and a half years\nI'm not going to take at face value their complaints about human rights and I'm not going to take at face value complains about human rights from a bunch of people were propped up and gave them billions of dollars to the worst human rights violators and dictatorship on planet earth outside of North Korea I'm not going to do that\nSo two things can be for one don't murder journalist and there should be consequences and also that doesn't mean that we have an ... that we in the United states have an interest in undermining an alliance with the Saudi Arabians on behalf of the Iranians the way that the Obama administration wanted to do okay you know what\nI I Can't handle the most just mail that mail that's okay but you know too much too much of an art now that got Joe says\nHey man who do you think is the favorite to win the demo twenty twenty democratic nomination in addition horse and people you think Trump would be handling election course and people you think he would struggle to be thanks I Love the show okay so in the cats\nHe would be handling Cory Booker he would mess up Cory Booker right far to kiss would go down harder than a journalist at the hands of ... the president would say\nCory Booker is mechanical an awful awful at his job he is a he posed as a moderate and he actually is a radical left us\nAnd he like Hillary Clinton he's actually like a bad version of a robot is not even like a good like ... and from Terminator he's like the earlier version espoused out a lot it kind of broke down on the battlefield he's he's more like gizmo from some of those old series he he's he's not\nYou can you can see every gives hurting for Cory Booker\nA man who is there a data jumps at Trump would finishing because Booker is the most inauthentic candidates and Hillary Clinton just terrible candidate I think that Trump would also want somebody like Eric Garcetti the LA mayor who pretends to be cool but it's actually just did the work so I think Trump would would destroy him pretty quickly um I think that the most dangerous candidate for him\nWould have been Elizabeth Warren and she didn't implode because like frankly I thought he was a lot smarter politically than she is and I was shocked to watch her set herself on fire sending smoke signals to the rest of the world that you didn't know what she was doing\nAnd she just sat there and center TB on fire and I didn't understand why she would do that\nBut she's kind of taken herself out of the smart candidate\nCircle I Would say right now of the top democratic contenders most dangerous is still Biden because it's hard to destroy guy who's been in the public eye that well\nIt was one of the benefits from past is that everybody has an opinion on it which means that nothing that you say about him change anybody's mind if you say that Donald Trump his dad with lemon everybody goes right when you yep okay have you seen Donald Trump says things sometimes that are really bad in a more like well yeah we've been here we know and if you say that Donald Trump\nShot a man on Fifth Avenue we'd all be like\nWell kind of probably okay\n... and he he really is right that was the truth from ...\n... in high name recognition\nAnd a history of skeletons in your closet means that it's very difficult to actually destroy somebody politically if they've dealt with the skeletons in their closet and the obvious about it\nSo Joe Biden has been out there for a long time there's not a lot out there that isn't known about Joe Biden then they can dangerous also he does have blue collar appeal it a lot of the states that Trump won places like Ohio and Michigan in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that is sort of Biden territory democratically speaking so Biden would be dangerous candidate show when Trump says he wants Biden I I don't think that's right\nKamala Harris I have yet to see so Kamala\nShe is much better at the routine of Cory Booker is she also happens to be somebody her downside is that she has this kind of\nAbsolutely clean clean as the driven snow image in a lot of the public mind that she's just a prosecutor a hard nose prosecutor asking the tough questions I think when people start digging into clean characters in politics they don't stay clean for a long and President Trump is a master of throwing dirt on people's hands he was just great at it so I I think he would there okay against\nKamala Harris okay let's see Joe says as the saying goes away to a man's heart is through his stomach what food does your wife make it falls under this asked him any food that signal events okay so I have to be honest about this my wife has called me three meals in the last ten years that is because my wife\nI Would not be surprised if the Democratic party embrace the idea of gender neutrality meaning that it would be that they are in favor of anti discrimination laws that prevent\nAny sort of difference in outcome between men and women are and even reflect the idea that legislation that allow you to self register in terms of

latest news will be absurd you that it will will be here to break it all down and laugh at it as an inch of erosion [laughter]\nFirst see me doing street would you be\nABC News\nOntario holding or how

I ... the Latino vote kind of like a three headed monster there so many moving parts here so many different at your hand immigrants you have the first or second generation and the well established generations here in United States where the ...\nA simply a take advantage of and uh somebody for Republicans to completely ignore or not the true at all now than let's just go to pose here this actual campaign that the president is trying to stand in the way of any pending blue wave\nWith just Eighteen days left until the mid term elections the president is the book solid for the Bible push holding for rallies and the next five days\nAnd as Pamela Brown reports will likely see more of a newly minted rallying cry at those rallies\nDemocrats ...\nRepublicans for jobs\nI knew a rhyming line of attack from President Trump as he tries to pump up Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nAnd remember it's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new might bring caravan thousands of Central Americans nearing Mexico's southern border presumably headed to the U.S\nI Will say I have caused the problem is such an incredible autonomy [noise]\nEverybody\n[noise] was it worse\nWe're doing a hell of a job\nUsing those laws to blame Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration and fly\nAs you know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border [noise]\nAll thought because the illegal immigration onslaught for Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge what changed the laws like\nTrump also taking it Twitter with his Democratic conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party lettuce south on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThe leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S again saying without evidence this group of migrants are criminals\nDemocrats for their part accusing the president I fear mongering\nThey almost want there to be an immigration a challenge there almost cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create\nOr something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance Trump is in full campaign mode as the election season entered its final week\nPamela Brown and with all due respect to uh Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals you said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking to live with a key late ... of the real wealth management\nAnd are looking at or something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you dig ditches right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states nation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who uh get a warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing in ... I Am not one of those people [noise]\nUh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without the country's permission or do you uh take exception do any of that\n[noise] you know I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that\nWe should have a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it shouldn't be definitely more career and um\nThat we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries are a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have\nWere created by us I mean unless Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know ... it's kind of a double edged\nThing although he was the U.S government policy the created in most Thirteen\n[laughter] of course not of course not [noise] I'm from LA or\nThey they certainly are and of course ah many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up a a entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back into it it's stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration is right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you would think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not and should not be quote a right but a privilege to be conferred by a nation\nAh depending on what isn't the best interests of the nation state but to call it a rage or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and it is my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are changing you know just uh my twenty fifth the\nHispanics or or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like to turn back to you know it's more reflective upon his\nPartner or by twenty ... you are we are a warning for\nOne in four ... persons here in the United states aren't going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that are not if we don't terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more\nUh sons and daughters uh than an average angle a family um but more importantly we used to tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr an advocacy we are are dealing and opinions will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank\nOr that we would probably wind up is separating\nThose parents from their children and my response frankly to those people is a rap somewhat say harsh but uh this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a\nVery lengthy and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but a Soviet that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point\nBut you know for looking at it from the other side of the of the class you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had an idea of the whole show on that and and uh ... ... is not exaggerating that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long we proceed\nYou know so you know ... in that sense if we could you know if we can get both\nSides of the aisles to start having the dialogue started having this conversation no one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy but we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\n... and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino or bothers me not one wit and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this is not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and uh so anyway the ah the point of course obviously then we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm elections to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino\nThey should uh obviously it is added issue is an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well or jobs or cry about all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the pattern of opinion here will be back in just a moment\n\nAmazing you know frozen Disney

on Long Island New York and joined the boy had a job that evening bed\nYeah good evening I just um [noise] I I wanted to know what you would consider the difference between four thousand Italian immigrants showing up at Alice island\nIn Nineteen eighty nine hundred years ago or four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now twenty eight so what will be the difference a stash especially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that the the ones who showed up at Ellis Island went through a process and they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and and running a sure they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned or a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short\nA months at best also it was not illegal to enter the country at that time All right or they did not have the laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire gym\nThat's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once your population reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of a nation state to determine who gets in when you reached the point where there are a a certain number beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat uh it has the obligation of a country to decide who should enter the country and how many based on what's in the best interest of the country now grad and you go back a century and a quarter\nMaybe say a century and a half into and we had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed a it was very labor intensive needed a lot of bodies when we were trying to settle the lands of of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many\nToday would you agree\n[noise] you know [noise] um I I think that we still need a lot of bodies in other industries and to\nGeneralize or stereotype
