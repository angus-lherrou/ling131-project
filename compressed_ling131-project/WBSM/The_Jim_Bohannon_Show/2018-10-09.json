that he's using with\nRegard as political enemies I'm sure that he knows the entire line of cases stretching\nPrior to ... on the right to privacy and he's just upset and how that line of cases could be curbed by the presence of Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court probably that's what's going on but I don't want to make it sound like it's just you know members of angry mob ... involved in being an angry mob I mean they are but it's more than that raise it to some of the elites in our society\nFirst of all I'd be remiss if I didn't know they like Cory Gardner says that his wife has never seem gruesome beheading video after his pro cabinet vote\nAnd they he's not the only one who was who's receiving those sorts of threats those threats actually are becoming quite common with regard to Republican members of Congress I've heard from a few of them who said that this sort of thing is becoming sort of the norm but as I say this isn't just that the people would sort of the the popular level of the Democratic party this isn't just\nLeft this grassroots folks who are very very upset we're talking about high ranking Democratic Party people with completely lost their mind and legitimately completely lost their mind over Brett Kavanaugh joining the Supreme Court in much the way they lost their mind over Donald Trump being elected in the first place\nSo take for example this ... is a

I don't know by whom and I'm not certain when but I Do not believe that he was the ... and ... ...\nOkay and that prompted Mazie Hirono to come out and say how could Susan Collins down\nHow could she was in college that was really funny because I remember that like a week ago literally a week ago there was one in Julie sweating it brought forth by Michael ... and she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh had gang raped her or the he was involved in gang rich you never hear her name any more from the Democrats why don't they believe all women\nDon't they believe that all women ought to be believed regardless of whether there's any sort of verifiable are corroborating evidence\nBut Julie ... she was gone\nSo not a it's not believe all women it's believed the women who he wants to believe because they're slightly more credible and then Republicans say okay well we agree that Ford was like the more credible than sweating it but we don't believe that she's totally credible either at least their stories and corroborated and then people like no no no that means you don't you're not leaving all women\nRight but you don't believe a woman you don't believe Juanita Broderick he'll believe Kathleen will you don't believe Paula Jones you don't believe the waitresses were sandwich by Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd back in the Nineteen eighties it's just it's maddening but here's made you want to say how could Susan Collins even have a doubt\nHow could you even ... because this is a free country where we do not condemn people without due process of law and we certainly don't condemn people's lives do the ... of history simply without any cooperative evidence whatsoever\nTo say that she thinks that back and forth I think that she was assaulted what effect and seen so then there was cooperation because she had talked about this is talk to her phone to others before back half an hour every nominated to the Supreme Court has took a lie detector test cooperation with their\nSelf Mazie Hirono just again this is built on the line is that we may have lost the battle with regard to the capital of winning the cultural war the cultural war is going to be that men verses women and women always

here's what ... what else\nIn the ... most of the mothers sisters and why is that these young men because my stupid uterus still holds out some insane humble solidarity first of all I just would like to point out that disappeared in the New York times the most\nSolid paper in the United states according to a lot and it printed a sentence in which a woman said that her uterus hold out hope\nYou do I do not hold out hope you drive or in Oregon and you say my appendix out help ... she says we're talking about white women the same fifty three percent put their racial privilege ahead of their second class but gender status and twenty sixteen\nMy voting for uphold the system and valleys only they're white and it's just as they have for decades so white women put their femininity behind them they're not real women is what is going white women aren't real women they're just white people they're just faceless nameless white people you know like the gender was which poisonous\nSince Nineteen fifty two white women have broken for democratic presidential candidates only twice in the Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen Ninety six elections according to an analysis by Jane John\nA political scientist at the University of Southern California women of color and specifically black women make the margin of difference for Democrats the voting patterns white women and white men marry each other much more closely and they tend to cast their ballots for Republicans the gender gap in politics is really a color line\nActually that's not really true the gender gap in politics is really a marriage line if you actually look at how single people both versus how married people go that's really the distinction married people tend to vote heavily Republican\nMarried women can vote heavily Republican single women\nTend to vote heavily Democrats and sound out color and same sex it's very much about marital status why because when you have kids and you start thinking to the next generation when you start thinking what is the kind of society where I Want to bring up a family and when you start thinking you know I have a family unit that requires protection from an overarching federal government that wants to get in my grill\nWill that change his mind a little bit but according to watch the score now it's all about the weakness because white women benefit from patriarchy trading on their whiteness monopolize resources for mutual gain\nIn return they're placed on a pedestal to be cherished and revered as Speaker Paul Ryan has had about women but all the while denied basic rights this is just nonsensical is just nonsense that person's means white women benefit from patriarchy trading on their white next to monopolize resources for mutual game\nFirst of all replace way with black in that sentence and obviously it's racist but beyond that the idea that women are somehow trading on their sexuality in order to achieve\nSome some decent treatment at the hands of the patriarchy this is all this is all crazy I'm Sorry this is all crazy stuff and if I urge Democrats to to run down this hill screaming is like an she's a staff as possible and please go do this make this year electoral strategy\nAlthough suburban white women who you're trying to gain and the next election I\nUrge you to scream at them and tell them they're terrible people because of white go for that let's do that\nIt's it's amazing it's amazing\nSo or ... or evidence she says during the twenty sixth in presidential elections and white women really vote with their weight in this in mind Laurie Frazier ... political scientist at UCLA\nRecently measure the effect of racial identity on white women's willingness to support Trump and twenty sixteen and found a positive and statistically significant relationship so white women who voted for him did so to prop up the rightness\nOr alternatively correlation does not equal causation because that's basic mathematical statistical science it's it's in the study white women who agreed that many women interpret innocent remarks or access access or Seventeen percent more likely to vote for Republican candidate\nRight that makes sense because Democrats have gotten hysterical on this issue and they have decided that everything ought to be treated as right when Matt Damon suggested the best team in suggested there were gradations of sexual misconduct he's run out of town on a rail my folks on the left so finally she concludes this blood packet\nAnd then the white women is an issue in the November midterms President Trump knows it and that that's used a news conference he signaled to white women to hold the line the people that have been complaining to me about it the most about what's happening or women women are very angry\nYes women are very angry many mothers many mothers are very angry and that crosses racial lines\nBut this is the the the attempt militarized me too movement which was supposed to be a bipartisan movement was basically universal support no one wants to see women mistreated has now been shattered thanks to politics because the left decided that meat you any allegations that I'm going to be to an allegation brought against someone there like\nIs going to be ignored and any allegation brought against someone they don't like is going to be upheld\nAnd on the right to prospective is Christopher Columbus in the west have committed a lot of sense but it is an eminently good thing for the world that western civilization found the western hemisphere\nThat's the basic argument it's

area of course where there have been many many a resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you\n[noise] um I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is how the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the\nYou know people get bored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute fit the we there the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the the party of appeasement and they need someone to discuss some fight and then in just says no we're we're going to fight for this\nAnd we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight ... fight they put up\nYeah well that's a that's a good point I Would I guess to to address and I certainly agree with the Charles uh\nAbsolutely uh Dave in regard to the notion of the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up by a liberal justice so we start coming up with the stories about how they uh they uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is is Charles ... disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering are have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a Brock Obama's pick some of which I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the lead the victim\nIt's the president's choice when at the nominee is qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim or I disagree with that person and therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of a Republican\nTry to follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue a and and the the or a collegial bunch of people which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate are being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember back when I was in high school and we talked about all the stuff in American government and\nAnd you know I had some good teachers back then people who weren't really afraid to ah to speak out coal spade a spade and say look you know people do this but it's wrong it's not the government is supposed to work nowadays a ... it's almost like a a pitch battle you know a food fight\nAnd what they tried to do to Britain cabinet or the Democrats\nAre with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up a um uh the Ford accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus a fifth of the dogs the reason just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both ... and it would probably be who've the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public a what we witnessed with the judge cab mental justice cabinet all\nOr was it just deplorable if not despicable and ah you know I I wrote about this uh I've covered this thing for liberty per person the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just roiled up\nThis really has fired up the Republican base I think it's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim they're angry and and they have some people that they are angry at they can identify\nThe people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats from the they might have blown this one\nWell we'll see certainly both bases seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon in grain Missouri yellow\nVarying I can um you know I Hope that justice Kavanaugh\nJust vote the constitution that but I Want to get to do I don't want them to make law I don't want them to be the best on the court I why then followed their parents can\nSpend some time not going to be happy with that well it may go against something that I think by the constitution then I Will I Will abide by ... and support it I'm tired\nOf this\nCork a making law than they are not supposed to do that that is Congress' job where I Want everybody to do their job Congress do their job presidents guy and they did bishop branch to do their\nAnd for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just notice do today was well you look at the constitution that aforementioned constitution\nOr the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate the presidency the chief executive officers the cabin and heads and the like and then you come of course\nThe article three of the the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says a judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such a very records as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the disc records are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those course any time it's so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also know if if you study the whoa really will ... is a on a lower federal courts and and there's even been some mention I think by ... or in New York\nThey added that is the liberal democratic congressman going\nOn yeah and ... he's apparently already talking about are trying to I'm\nA ... ... ... ... and all you can only do that by impeaching him convicted I Know and and just you know peach with is just [noise] that came out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist\nSome of these people really are on the east side of the aisle\nAnd the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nNo I'm I'm sure they do that after this appeals to the base which increasingly has as Democrats or rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency [noise]\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure they'll vote articles of impeachment against that Donald Trump and possibly Kavanaugh they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I've gone to lose any sleep over it will be back and just a moment\n\nDo you owe the IRS ten thousand dollars or

don't know I don't know what some of these people are thinking\nWell I I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break here but a lot of Democrats are really running

today being a Columbus Day a federal holiday or this is what the going back to the D.C versus Heller\nA decision and this is what the judge Kavanaugh had to say in the twenty eleven\nAnd and I'm quoting here from a cabinet position and disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry and fell them in possession laws\nHeller established at the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans on regulation is determined by reference to text history and tradition\nUnquote Brett Kavanaugh as an appellate court judge seven years ago or your your thoughts about that as a as a a philosophy going forward Dave\nWell I think that is one of the keys to white Dianne Feinstein and some colleagues were just going for the cabinet\nAnd to the Supreme Court ah I think he looks at the historic uh we the firearms have really been a part of the American fabric\nBy you know we talked earlier about a a law enforcement and and how the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds and I'd check the Texas Rangers\nOr were formed Eighteen twenty three by Austin now alright uh um\nThe the idea that ah when the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they'd go to trade they do think they had a ... a and it might have been a a Flynn lock or or briefs of pistols or something but they had guns with them\nEverybody behaved themselves or at least most people behave themselves\nAnd uh I think he looks at the historic context of health firearms were were really part of the ... the American a fabric and and how we advance as a country he also said something in in that ruling into this little Evan\nThat because semi automatic pistols or protect her so also should be semi automatic rifles\nAnd you know that's in the some of the Democrats into orbit\nThey'll try it out the term that they could define that their lives depend on what about assault rifles and yeah I can defining assault rifle for you right now and that is it's a it's black and sinister looking you may have a pistol grip that that's an assault rifle go ahead well\nUh yeah I think you just paint that because quite frankly the term was an invention by the the the gun prohibition lobby the and you know they this dates back on and twenty five thirty years\nWe've got to demonize these things and and really make people think that their machine guns and this was the strategy back then and when

from a from a spectators point of view [noise]\nYou're looking at a different game everybody turn that television on everybody comes out pretty much in some kind of an offensive formation where they spread the field they got a kid sitting back there seven plus yards eat a quarterback but he's a tale back in many respects\nAnd if he can run in through the creek he creates more problems defensively they spread the field they throw the ball\nAround and it's nothing for people to score forty fifty once again that's the big change and I think that's what's happening in the game that they've uh they've made it\nMore exciting but they've got talent level that permit them\nTo change the rules by putting excellent people on the field\nEverywhere and er and move that bull up and down the field

matter of fact he certainly was a Hungarian refugee but he uh essentially changed the foot part of football forever to get\n[noise] the ... were part of the Hungarian revolution they came their father was a doctor and he practiced just outside of Budapest and the Hungarian revolution came along in Nineteen fifty six\nCharlie was about seven or eight and his brother Peter was I think about twelve his mother was pregnant with a third child to realize that he couldn't stay where he was didn't know what was going to happen\nHabit everywhere they found out if they could get\nTo Vienna the possibility existed that Australia and open up the ... and ... to welcome that well put his kids and um\nBasically in a in a [noise] a wagon got somebody to carry them through the forest up there they finally worked after three days and got themselves to the ana only to find out in the end it was closed\nSo when he finally ... things that he says what our options or any other places we can go they said we can go to America America what's in America anyway they came to America they landed in New Jersey at a place a camp and New Jersey which is a World War two camp\nAnd after being there for a while his father found out that there was a job opportunity up in New York state [noise] and the job opportunity was that the practice medicine 'cause he couldn't do that without a license but to be an administrator and he took it and he went up the right of the family\nAnd a few weeks elapsed any sense for the rest of the family they came they came out of business for New York okay that's south of the St Lawrence river and I want to say it's not too far from the north pole I went up there as coal anyway I make a long story short\nPeter Goes out and you see these guys playing a game you never knew me for football [noise]\nCan you believe Ogden for New York did not have a soccer team they didn't mind that soccer program which these guys were playing as a young age and hungry So Peter started one day he kicked the football he wasn't on the team he was out there and he just happened to the football coach ran over to see what are you doing\nHe says I I just you know are they speak English he was trying to tell him when he was doing a coach said you can't do that you don't have any elevation she got to get the ball up you know any way he looks over a week later the coast sees this guy could chemical fifty yards\nThat was the birth of the softer style kicker it a long time is Charlie Charlie comes to recruit Charlie we get this letter from this\nKid he says you might know my brother Peter who is now at Cornell\nHe said I too am a soccer star kicker and I'm interested in your school where he wrote that letter but a lot of a long story short he comes to Princeton and

a pretty dominant followings in terms of the game of football some would say that there is a\nSerious question about the future of the game it has prompted our guest a Bob cast viola too right\nFirst and forever making the case for the future of football the fact that you have felt the need to write the book alone must have given you some misgivings that you know you have you on the subject you come up twenty five years ago by making the case for the future of football they wouldn't even have been an issue\nThat's a very good question what got me going was that\nEverybody was taking shots at it and I felt that for my own experience my own experience as a as a player and as a coach administrator and from many I coached and recruited\nI felt that story I have to be told to say hey there should be a future again should go on\nI I just want to get back to something very quickly generated you mentioned earlier it talked about teams dropping the sport or none of it's very interesting in a pen in Pennsylvania just this year\nThere at three schools three towns because of population changes that have decided they want to maintain the football program and they've gone to eight man football instead of eleven\nWell you know people would say is that an indication the game is going out I said not at all as long as they're playing and they go on with the game\nWith preserving the game so you do whatever you can do that and the other thing is I noted\nThat this year but the kickoff is two thousand Eighteen college football season there's a record seven hundred and Seventy eight teams playing each weekend since two thousand and twelve\nThirty five teams have join that list and the school out here it's very interesting and again just to say there's other things happening that are positive or hearing surprise Arizona is a new school ... the name of it playing at the university plane as a building block to\nGive extra Tiller curricular activity to this didn't base they've started the foot\nProgram so there are some signs that people are finding a way to keep it alive and\nIn the chapter six of your book first forever uh are quoting or what you call that the coach of coaches are granted chief voting some of the the positive aspects of the game here I'll just read the for that or that he mentioned a positive attitude and approach to life\nA total effort to anything I commit myself to self control of self discipline and caring for others um those are pretty pretty solid points and then a very good points a\nCaring for others I that's a good point I think to explore further at it sometimes seems I think\nThat the people who watch the game who may not have any close association with other than just watching a a little screen in their living room but the caring for others would be the last thing they would ascribe to football that it is a\nHard nosed ah ah almost killed or be killed a winning is everything or maybe more along the the Vince Lombardi line of thinking and I'm Wondering your thoughts about this notion of caring in football isn't it very much a\nA hard nose game of of when it's not an all costs at at most cost\n[noise] yeah but I think it's come to the point where\nCoaches have come around to becoming more than just\nOn the on the field giving you an assignment block this guy a tackle this guy is covered this man I think they're taking it beyond that what they do with their lives with you beyond your\nFootball experience is no greater example of caring than when you look at the chapter in here on Jack ...\nWho came in and took over a program at Marshall after they add disastrous crash that killed the entire team coaches in parts of the end of the ... applying with them went in there and rebuild program rebuild the football\nProgram and it's a great story and Jack is a wonderful human being he\nHad a lot he got the job\nThey went through three or four candidates looking at how they're going to do this\nAnd they took this guy L'Engle whose coach had a small\nCollege in Ohio because he was coming from a background where he had to live\nAnd stay and be with his players constantly small college they took a chance with Jack and he went the Marshall and rebuild their program and it's a great story and he's a great story but there are many stories like that you mentioned grand theft rent it is the guy that built the Baylor program from nothing\nHe went on the head of the American Football Association for over Twenty years\nHe's giving person that's why he talks way does\nAnd I think there's a lot of people like that and again I told people\nWho quickly I tell people that you know there are a thousand coaches that there there have been written a book just like mine because there's so many coaches that had the same influence on kids who had the same type of kids that they coach and went on with their lives do bigger and better things\nAre we in need of a\nOld competitive sport for normal size people are I think some years ago there was discussion of maybe a a special form of of basketball for people six feet and shorter\nOr do we need maybe a a a competitive football league for people who weigh two hundred pounds were less\nCould very well be [noise] you know that's a good question that I really haven't thought about too much but the more you talk\nI can see where it would come down to that if it got to be so different that they only the the biggest and strongest to play a everywhere or in great places I think it would be very interesting to have people\nWho had maybe less size and less talent to find a program that they could fit into because they wanted to play it live they enjoyed it\nA you know we talk about it sure football is a contact sport you're going to hit somebody you need to be getting it from ...\nBut a lot of people you talk to you talk about this book every one of them will talk about how no matter what happened to him physically as they look back on it the
