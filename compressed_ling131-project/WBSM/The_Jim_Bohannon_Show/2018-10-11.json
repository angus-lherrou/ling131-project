will tell you the story of James a student at University of California Davis accused of sexual assault turns out yet not committed the crime will get into that plus we'll get into the media is desperate attempt to avoid the radicalism the Democrats\nBut we begin today with some new polls from the mid term strung that Republicans are making some significant gains in the Senate\nIn Tennessee the state in which I currently said that state has now turned strongly toward Marsha Blackburn Phil Bredesen\nOn the heels of a Taylor Swift endorsement\nHas fallen plummeted in the polls he's now down to the thirties according to some polls\nAnd Marsha Blackburn has pulled convincingly instantly Claire McCaskill remains extraordinarily vulnerable in Missouri so it looks like Republicans cutting back in the selection lose seats in the house and pick up some significant seat in the Senate which makes a big difference because it means that if you have a four or five vote majority in the Senate next time Republicans having judicial pet\nIf they'd heard Ginsburg retires for some reason\nOr God Forbid something happens or health wise or then Republicans will have the opportunity to replace our with a strong conservative a strong texture less most importantly like Amy Coney Barrett which would be just unreal\nAnd that's a significant possibility if the elections go the way they seemed to be going right now now the reason that the shift is happening\nIs not because of President Trump is not because of the Republicans the Democrats have decided today are going to look as ugly and terrible as humanly possible in public as often as possible so funny because the Democrats after after losing to President Trump\nDecided that what they really needed to do was be more off putting it look at President Trump and they see that his popularity racer and low forties and I thought well you know what if we could imitate that but you it worse\nRight so we won't have the the kind of blue collar appeal of President Trump we won't have any sort of personal charisma President Trump will just be insanely off putting in terrible all the time maybe that will win us power again\nAnd it

Peter events or unwritten twenty eleven is consumed by the dramatic increase in health insurance costs he says the fixed costs of health insurance are much larger percentage of the total compensation of lower earnings workers meaning that you did get a raise just came out in your health insurance\nAlso many perhaps most big ticket items used by typical American family on a daily basis have decreased in price\nAnd they they looked at the ... at human progress they look at the prices of common household items advertised in the Nineteen Seventy nine Sears catalog and prices of those common household items sold by Walmart and twenty Fifteen\nAnd remember those products and twenty fifth you know a hell of a lot better than the product in Nineteen Seventy nine a washing machine made in twenty Fifteen is a better quality washing machine and a washing machine made in Nineteen Seventy nine a car made today is a better car than a car made in Nineteen Seventy nine\nAll the products are getting are better and you're getting them for cheaper\nThere is what they did they divided in Nineteen Seventy nine nominal prices by Nineteen Seventy nine average nominal hourly wages and two thousand Fifteen nominal prices by two thousand Fifteen average nominal hourly wages and they calculated the time costs of household items in each year that's the number of hours it would take to buy a washing machine for example so for example\nThe time costs me Thirteen cubic foot refrigerator so by fifty two percent in terms of the hours of work required at the average hourly nominal wage so if you could buy two refrigerators and the price of one that makes you Richard regardless of what your top line income is\nNeedless to say the above price productions greatly underestimate the totality of wealth or again by the average American ignoring qualitative aesthetic and environmental improvements on commonly use item again those products are better today than they were yesterday\nSo it's pretty clear it is pretty clear that when it comes to products that we can buy we are much better off than they were in the Nineteen seventies so where are we short or Jordan education healthcare and housing because the cost of those things has risen at a faster pace than total compensation\nHowever it is true that today's houses are larger and healthcare is better and education is more high tech\nAnd it's also true that the reason that house that houses have risen in prices because of tremendous regulation on the part of democratic administrations for the most part in major cities the reason easy housing shortages in Los Angeles which is the most sprawling city you know in in the country and it's where I live is because of heavy regulation and zoning\nSo what is the standard of living well it's\nIt certainly better than it was in Nineteen Seventy nine for the vast majority of people in the American public the average apartment is bigger the average stuff you have in her apartment is bigger the average house is better the average stuff that you have in that house is better all of that should suggest that maybe we should be kind of great\nFor the country in which we live and stop trying to tear it down and stop trying to tear each other apart in the name of some utopian vision Democrats might be wise to start there especially because the more and rage Democrats get Republicans lag behind 'cause we we are not fond of the rage but\nIf you in rage us\nWhen you awake that sleeping giant it's not good for you to look for early is not good for you\nOkay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats' failure to recognize that basic truth in what they're saying now about justice Kavanaugh but first let's talk about your sleep quality I don't think that while on the road you know why because I don't have my sleep mattress with me there was nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe would

he likes sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nOkay so let's talk about the fact that the left doesn't seem to realize they live in a a great country\nAnd that they believe that we all ought to be living in fear every single day now fear mongering is never a wonderful thing if you're going to get exercised about problems in your life you probably should be exercised about problems that\nAre truly prevalent now things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting that every woman in the country is at risk of rape every second of every day is probably not a good way to bring people together it's also not a good way to view your neighbors because the truth is that\nWomen are not at risk of sexual assault every day in the United states and there is a pretty safe country for women in fact it's the safest country for women in the history of mankind so there's that but\nThere's a song it's now become very popular on Twitter and Facebook I'm not sure what an her name is Mercedes wins I guess a and she just put up this song and folks on the left are just ecstatic about this on because it suggests that men should not be concerned about false allegations of sexual assault\nWe should not be concerned about it anymore so young\nMen who are worried that in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense that anybody can be accused at any time without any corroborating evidence they should should sit down and shop because women have a tough now there's a logical flaw at the root of it which is two things can be for once\nWomen can be afraid of bad men and men can be afraid of bad women why did you see things are supposedly mutually exclusive is beyond me I Do not understand why\nSaying that women have a right to be afraid\nWhen a man of cost them and treats them terribly why is that mutually exclusive with a man has the right to be afraid that a woman will make a false allegation against him I'm not saying that the fears ought to be equivalent in nature I'm not saying that the level of of the or should be equivalent or that the level of prevalence of these events is equivalent\nBut to say that I shouldn't be afraid of something bad happening to me because something bad could happen to you makes no sense at all just on a logical level\nAnd the reason I say this is because there are cases many cases across the United states particularly on campus right now where\nMen are being accused of things that they did not do and it's costing them time money and credibility so here's the story of genes I mean who sort of James and I'm going to get into this lady's on so James was a freshman at the University of California Davis this is according to reason magazine who's on his way to math class when he received an email that we drill his life for the next few months\nUniversities title nine office which handles sexual misconduct disputes between students was investigating\nAgainst him this was in February twenty Eighteen right after Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and all the rest\nJames that this was not a good time to get accused of something like that the email from the title nine compliance officer when it's a great detail about the seriousness of James situation you'd be investigated in accordance with university sexual assault and sexual violence policies\nAs well as the student code which covers physical assault threats of violence and conduct that threatens health and safety and finding responsibility\nCould result in suspension or even expulsion but the email the short on details of the alleged conduct according to the title nine off as a female student and Becky and complains that the James touched her on the bread and butter over and under her clothing without her consent\nJames who Becky they've been classmates and drama and briefly friends even about ... who thousands Seventeen they'd met up with some other friends to play music eventually finding themselves alone and Becky storm they catch for a few minutes engaged in some light sexual touching before other students interrupted them\nIn James's view encounter had not only been fully consensual it was also mutual that people are just as much responsibility for initiating it as James as Becky would later made clear to the investigator should also touched him sexually she it was described her own actions in her official statement\nJames attorney wrote about the incident and uh and they wrote that these accounts of the incident a set forth in the summary of her investigative interviews does not on his face allege any active prohibited conduct of matter\nContinued until may first at which time the officers student and judiciary affairs finally concluded that James is innocent even so Becky was afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision consistent with university policy is dictated by the Obama administration's education department\nAt cost James twelve thousand dollars in legal fees to defend himself against an allegation in which the girl admitted admitted that she was mutually involved in the sexual conduct I mean it's pretty astonishing\nAccording to back east complain the kissing followed a night of mutual floating and started out romantic eventually she either asking us to close the door closed at herself that continue kissing and also touching as they grind it against each other\nHe said he says my hand started making my ... slowly respectfully testing the waters James opened his eyes to make sure that he was enjoying what was happening she seemed into it and so he touched her over her clothes and remove T shirt and she told him to drop it on the floor so in other words she was involved in every step of all of this\nRight at one point James became too forceful he was running against her she was pressed against a closet door in fact he asked him to be more gentle\nHe agreed and tone down the writing back you'd miss that you catch the James his neck but didn't think she gave them a ... she did however asking whether he was into certain types of sexual activity and she says the Jews aroused by all of this so she says all of this to the title nine court costs and twelve thousand dollars anyway so should be worried about the sort of thing\nWhy not why wouldn't they be wouldn't you'll be worried about the sort of stuff but according to feminist because women have a completely separate set of fears some of which are justified and some of which are overstated\nMen should not be worried about anything Tibet cabinet as guilty because bad things happen to women is basically the logic of blessed and then they wonder why folks on the center and on the right or not interested in this particular point of view well here is this this song from Mercedes ones expressing that's bizarre point of view that bad that women are threatened bad things happen to them therefore mentored shut up\nHere she is singing about having five million use on Twitter it's gone viral of course\nI Can't\nThe conflation of I'm Upset about justice cabinet with America systemically unjust against women\nIs just it's it's absurd and its ally and I'm speaking as a guy with my own daughter and with three older sisters\nIt's it it's silliness but again the motivating factor for a lot left right now is rage and they don't understand that that rage there's gonna be a delayed it back but the rage will blow back on them anger is a short term high and it's a long term low we'll be back in them out with all the\nLatest news on the latest updates from the hurricane that is Darryl when we're Florida right

Botox\nHurricane Michael was the path of devastation across the Florida Panhandle it dropped from a category four to a one storm now is it makes its way across south western Georgia with damaging winds and rain forecasters say the storm continues to cause flooding along the Florida Gulf Coast\nBrian Todd has more on whether it's considered the strongest storms with the continental us since Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety two\n[noise] heavy rain and sustained winds flowing home support flooding river [noise] ripping railings from the ground\n[noise] collapsing beside home [noise]\nWeaving away 'cause the structure and its\nPath [noise] the category for storm intensity of the Gulf as feral inland making landfall with winds of up to one hundred and fifty five miles per hour [noise]\nSee I made landfall around twelve thirty the storms biggest threat is the devastating flooding Frank was expected circus as high as Thirteen or fourteen feet [noise]\nSweets of Appalachian coal are already dangerously underwater northwest coastal town hit with a six foot\nEven before Michael made landfall responders unable to reach those in need as waves crash down along on top of major highways\nThere is going to be a killer killer storm surge in this or that nine ten eleven feet no one's going to survive that low lying areas the Gulf of Mexico are kind of like a base in the water are being pushed up on people and uh if you're still there when that comes and you're going to die\nFlorida officials hammering home the message the storm surge alone can kill you but it is now to link to evacuate the\nWorst thing you can do now is leave with yourself and your family in danger\nYou know I think it's really important to show people they're there to every story of how to be on the reason that that that was ... spoke to some of that now\nWith all the troubles are only has got that we hope that it's not going to hit bottom well this proves\nThat sometimes it is exactly that serious on I ... a lot of them really hurt the kinds of [noise]\nWill stay as safe as dry as you can touch and thank you for taking time out\nAnd I\nYou very much that's the ... in Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tag and assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental science\nBut at the university at Albany State University of New York and I was noticing a doctor time or comments made by a Natasha regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was a guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf in a stream and that is a you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain ... not moving very quickly with like for instance sort of linger over the place and that given period of time whereas\nA leaf in a fast moving stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUm uh it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um a window over a a area for a longer period of time and it has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall\nUm but in terms of that uh when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI say so in other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nYou know no it isn't\nA very good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants there or continue to move across the Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Bryan tang or this\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they look at all these terms like a ... satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ... and early know what that is but it sounds like you folks were are totally on touch a\nWith the with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess you know a whole lot today we act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and that it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight and it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether interdict extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany a that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\n... what is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and the ... uh we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form a in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction and then well form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season by the river yeah why\nYeah and that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that also when the uh the atmosphere is is uh uh the the the more most moist um and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to for\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of what this thing could do and I asked him and says or anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers at camp crunchy said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure low pressure areas\nIs that you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over to the entire globe and that all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nOn orders to forecast a model and that is a is a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get ... a a more powerful and um we we sort of learned about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked at ... at the tropical psych load formation of this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the [laughter] [laughter] but now that the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight in intensity changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical aside from prediction that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong\nA tropical site found or hurricane um so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what feels ... that is as you as you said before the war ocean waters\nThat are live below the ... are both below the hurricane and that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for the ... to power the winds at the store\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the the the climate system itself or are there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm to to hurricanes or portions of the planet where are all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\n... the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of number of hurricanes that formed the um Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they ...\nYet storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that is another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess with what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes type and I was in the western Pacific and psych phones yeah just sort of generic cycle on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting yeah those are just terms of convenience we are are sexually talking about the same phenomena that right\nYes the way which is why in the science community we're just referred to everything as a tropical sigh phone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nPheromone up [noise] All right we'll continue our discussion to lie to your calls welcome of course are either as a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather ah and I'm also in the experience which you may have a particular if you're facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six\nFive oh five four six to six our guest is Dr Bryan tagging assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York back with more in just a moment\nYou have a call from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama on the jumbo how to do with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening Donna\nHi Dr ... I'm a native New Jersey and I can make a restaurant here I feel kind of like a hurricane snob and there's not much reference ever given to hurricane Camille all Seventeen sixty nine right that was a sigh yes and nothing after\nI had never been worse uh I think a lot of these other storm hit been getting a wrong intensity as comparison get Camille and my dad even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf ah there were\nTankers they were African freighters bar just on highway Ninety and up into the residents that area\nAnd they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or cell phone journey thanks how I was wondering if you can comment on the fact that um that's given no reference as far as the ... of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nYou're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot a lot of people these days I don't remember a storm because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right the\nPictures of of the the devastation along the coast uh\nWere was absolutely tremendous um [noise] what's what's different today perhaps is that oh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because a living on a ... a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that conversation I went through the entire thing uh-huh I went to all of it so I mean I'm\n... got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that seems a little not to realistic purity\nYeah ... or ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area I'm a tend to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assumed they can for instance they can take their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have planned you prepare and emergency kit and and it's it's a ... like this where where um you know it comes to fruition\nYeah I Lived through the the tail end of ... and uh it almost eight my car it hit the war way to the side of the of some land by a screen bed that became a raging torrent and uh uh literally had I if I had not gone to lead the lot where this car was\nAnd moved it I buy my car I could not get into the car the driver's side but I I moved to a away from the uh the edge of the water but that that waterway was and this was littered with cars or the next day and this ... this was the weekend tale of could build the thank goodness we were lucky portion of\nCamille so I have to do what I was talking about will come back we'll talk some more with our guest Dr Brian ... adjustable\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero

you were just pure begging\nFor a for major problems there and I've I've often wondered why was zoning allows that yes I Know you're right that that we have this desire hey I'm On the ocean front well\nI'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that that that that's just foolish this\nYeah you did you touch on a than you know an important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed more and that\nUm you know where the terms of um how people managed or the risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes have you're near a fault line [noise]\nUm but in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance\nUm the federal government or has the national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have home owners insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through the federal program or a another private company that offers sort of flood insurance and\nI'm a sort of who who pays for that that catastrophe poll uh when when that that risk is realized um is kind of a ... is a subject of rape debate um and controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be a changes in in how insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nIt's yeah it's a it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think I'm a you know it's it's really kind of up to how how the state and wants to sort of crafting legislation on terms of um\nThere there are caps on insurance premiums another set of policies that they can put out there um they come at a local local municipalities and and areas can put up zoning restrictions um to prevent people from voting a risky areas and ah you know one of one of the things

they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars now it's even lower than that\nSo I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and gold is not going up it's just not what it used to be if anything the Koreans become a new kind of safety valve and even that haven't been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a platinum as kind of a a place I play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker lightweight zone none of the pressure smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your services well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge of the day\nThing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another prejudice precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times on some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing decently we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just doesn't join well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the fat reserves raised raised a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIs starting at about two point one percent sort of had a big move out pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe three and a half percent by the end of the year that is all bad for gold silver platter millennium\nBut ... do you see a interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where von ... interest rates speaking about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute low was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher ... let me just doing a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the net seller of treasury bonds now that fire for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month or so called quantitative easing program\nThat's over that's what our for about a year and a half now and now they're doing quantitative tightening so when bonds come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile it's huge news supply Jim we've talked about this before but the deficit is that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars and that just that corner alone\nToday there are options of the thirty about the ten year bond they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demands\nYields and you don't go up and prices go down\nThere you go the old a supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk some more we will certainly return to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about the when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at a that gift that keeps on giving the
