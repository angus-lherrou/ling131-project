have written about\nThe uh the notion that a lot of people live in sort of suburban Fort Apache where they're prepared to defend their home turf against hostility\nBut they don't really have a lot of alliances even right next door and that's one of the themes in them why we hate each other\nOh the heel it's the new book by Senator Ben Sasse the senator from Nebraska many many of our listeners were extremely grateful senators asked for your common sense in perspective during the Kavanaugh hearings\n'em ... before we we get back to that and where we go after the Kavanaugh hearings you were talking before about teenagers\nAnd how isolated teenagers are by age and they have in today's world very often are not serious relationships with people who are older or even people who are younger\nAnd a ... one of the cures to that it always seems to me is provided writing a religious context you're talking about which is the Sabbath\nThe idea of one day a week where a lot of these other demands\nA take precedence I was reading about presidents Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd he tormented his six children and they were all required to go to church with him on Sunday and then they would have a Sunday dinner and that was required for the kids and a lot of them resented it of course as adults they were grateful for it\nOr what about that as a means to heal as you talk about in your book\nUh yesterday man uh so I mean the ... and it does maybe be recovered and you do see places in both Judaism and Christianity now where people are recovering it um\nThe the intergenerational stuff you were talking about a minute ago kids are less happy if they spend their whole life as a Fifteen year old or an Fifteen year olds 'cause it's not a lot of wisdom there\nThere's constant immediacy and there's value in knowing not just forty five year olds Seventy five year olds\nAnd so Andy crouch is a guy who's written a pretty interesting book called the cat lives family\nA ... a guy and he he talks about one hour a day one day a week one week a year they lock up all their technology\nAnd there are people in that tradition that haven't dealt with them now who jokingly say they're trying to be almost almost Amish\nOut with their approach to acknowledge it what they mean is all the technology you can use in your work environments but being really self conscious about the ways that technology can crowd out real satisfying human relationships in your family and in your social life\nThere's a bunch of data now in the happiness literature which shows if you go from two hundred five hundred social media for for five hundred to a thousand social media friends you don't get any happier I covered this in them um why we ate each other and out of jail\nUm but if you know the person who lives two doors away from you and your neighborhood your statistically much more likely to be happy and it is that if you invite people over for Sunday lunch or or Saturday five at lunch or if you have people over for dinner and of course of the week um you get happier\nYou'd you'd get into a service posture we realize your whole life isn't about your own consumption and you start to build ... relationships in a neighborhood that aren't ... and they end up making you happier and so I Try to spend a lot of the book on that constructive kind of topic\nAnd dance a Senator Ben Sasse senator from Nebraska his new book of them why we hate each other and how it uh he'll\nLet let's talk for just a moment about the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight and thank goodness you were very key part of winning that fight for a justice Kavanaugh and I'm sure he's going to be a big credit to the Supreme Court and do a terrific job\nBut what about this idea I Know your colleagues Senator Graham and some others have talked about not letting it go going after the leakers and the people who set up the ugliness that America song going after Dianne Feinstein for instance I'd do you think that's productive\nUh I I don't know the right path from here in the Judiciary Committee that is is broken as the committee on which lengthy and I said that they're loving loving Republicans ten Democrats edited a terribly broke and circus right now\nIt didn't serve anybody who are kids or the cabinet family or the Ford family or a search for facts and truth it didn't serve anybody well because the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in particular decided that it wanted to be swallowed by cable news television instant instant certainty on everything\nWe did a really really bad job as a United States Senate\nBut senator Feinstein's team did some really horrible despicable fangs\nAnd so I Do think we need to sort out how did we get to a place where these allegations were\nAlways treated in the circus like atmosphere as the first bite at the apple when I sat on the Judiciary Committee now for two years we'd get lots of allegations all over the map about stuff some of it ends up being real some it ends up being grace that ends up being clearly made up political hits\nAnd there's a way to deal with this with the FBI and in the Senate confidential process that doesn't start with everything as cable reality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's what they wanted to start at the top of that back to the theme of our half an hour to gather here I really do think there is a desperation\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics the center of gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking
