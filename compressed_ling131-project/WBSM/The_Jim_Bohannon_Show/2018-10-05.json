Kavanaugh we begin today with the news that Mitch McConnell is filing culture\nMeaning that we're not going to allow the Democrats to filibuster the cabinet nominee and that means that by Saturday the full Senate will be voting on Brett Kavanaugh here was Mitch McConnell yesterday announcing that he was going to file cloture on the floor of the Senate\nThere'll be plenty of 'em are members to review and very brave film a supplemental material before ... ... ... ... nominations is or you're going to ... or ... or\nIn the process should move forward the process should move forward because guess what shocker it turns out\nThat nothing has been found and we've never been doing this for another week another week thanks to Senator Jeff flake and the idea and an FBI investigation was wanting to how everyone's clearly that's happened clearly Democrats are now very satisfied but how's it going everybody has a lot of faith in the FBI folks on the left\nIt really feels like a full investigation has been done and they're feeling pretty satisfied about all the take for example Senator Dianne Feinstein who took the results of the FBI inquiry and she saw that it basically said nothing new and actually you know what I feel like it's been settled I guess now really consider Brett Kavanaugh's nomination or alternatively she did what everyone knew what she would do and she said\nOh no investigation is a bunch of ... and it was never meant to be comprehensive and therefore Democrats can't vote for Kavanaugh on that basis or a science Feinstein who really has just been\nI mean there's no other word for it in terms of the process that using Asian than evil I mean it really has been an evil process in which means engage getting an allegation naturalized already is holding it for six weeks until just before the vote releasing it without any corroborating detail\nMaybe releasing an anonymous link in order to spur the full release of the story and then growing Brett Kavanaugh on suppose a gang rape\nAnd all this has been gross but here Senator Dianne Feinstein continuing her pattern of being raised by saying that the FBI investigation is incomplete and because it's incomplete therefore that's really why we should vote on Kavanaugh\n... what I can say is is the most notable heart of this reform is what's going on in it\nAs we noted by the White House sci fi I did not interview for Kavanaugh says we have seen even more fresher force of witnesses who wanted to speak with the sci fi ... we're not interviews\nOkay so I Love that she says what's most important here is what's not in it\nThat is true but not how she means it so she says what's most important is all the people you have to I didn't interview\nWell that's because the people that she's talking about could provide no corroborating evidence was not in the report is that there is no corroborating evidence for an enemy of Christine Blasey Ford allegation\nNo corroborating evidence knowing\nInstead he said cabinet ousted by and laughed at the victims\nSo what he was a jerk in high school was part of the popular kids click this guy who was deeply unpopular ... I have no sympathy for guys were boys in high school or who stood by what bullying occurred in high school no sympathy for that 'cause I was a brutal victim of bullying when I was in high school but\nBeing a victim of bowling does not mean that I think that anyone who's a bully in high school also rape checks\nBut that's the implication from New York are starting to wonder why the right is reacting with outrage to all of us that's why the right is reacting to outrage coming up soccer Christine\nBlasey Ford's attorneys respond to the FBI investigation suffice it to say they are unhappy

surprise incomplete\nHer attorneys or democratic activist and they sent out a statement it said quote\nAn FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview with Dr Christine Blasey Ford nor the witnesses who corroborating testimony cannot be called an investigation wherever family disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice you made in coming forward those directing the FBI investigation will not interested in seeking the truth\nIf you think what she testified under oath at length there is no reason for the FBI to talk to her again if you'd contradictory stores you commit perjury\nThere's no there's really no reason for them to talk to her second\nThey talked to all of the witnesses\nWho did sworn statements and those witnesses did not back her story when they say that the FBI didn't talk to the witnesses Robert who says money there are no witnesses corroborate her testimony there's talk we're on the left that women would never falsified would never missed remember would never lie about allegations of right now I have\nTremendous sympathy for people who alleged sexual assault\nI Do I mean when when she first came out I said this is a credible account and and I want to wait for corroborating evidence before I make a decision on that there's no corroborating evidence forthcoming and that's why I'm saying that Brett Kavanaugh attention on the court I still don't know if she's telling the truth you don't know either nobody knows 'cause there's no corroborating evidence and the witnesses\nWith that said one of the things that's been put out there by by folks on the west is that there's no incentive for women in high profile cases come forward\nI have two words for you Anita Hill ... hill on the left for the last twenty five years HBO made it full serious about her and if you think there is no incentive for women to come forward and shape the course of history\nI find that highly doubtful mean here was time magazine's covered this week or the time magazine cover this week is up Christine Blasey Ford swearing with her eyes closed and her entire face is made up of words from her testimony\nThat looked like somebody who has not benefited at all from the publicity\nI Would say the Christine Blasey Ford is one of most worship fingers on the left today so that's not an implication that she's lying but to suggest that the incentives are stacked in one direction is just not correct It's just not objectively correct\nIt is true that Brett Kavanaugh has an interest in her story not being true but she also has an interest to suggest that women don't have an interest in coming born in high profile cases\nBecause all they're going to get the downside is just it's not accurate and it's just not accurate now again that doesn't mean she's manufacturing her case doesn't mean she was lying but we ought to at least be honest about what the incentive structures here are incentive structures are in place for allegations you sometimes you may\nIf they weren't then you wouldn't have high profile cases what women come forward and say something and it turns out that their fitting\nAre making things up\nSo that is that is a point number one point number two they're a bunch of people who are now coming forward and making ancillary claims they have nothing to do with Kavanaugh and this is supposed to be ... be great\nTo bunker up cabinets there was a piece in USA Today that one was promoting on Twitter and what she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh getting angry in front of the Senate is the reason that he shouldn't be on the court to remember the original reason he shouldn't be on the court was that he was conservative\nThen reason that he shouldn't be on the court is because he allegedly committed sexual assault than when there was no corroborating evidence shouldn't sit on the court because she was partisan and angry there's one in USA Today says I remember my angry father and that's why Brett Kavanaugh Russians it on the court\nWhat in the world that have to do with anything that's like me saying I was abused in high school by boys recap knows boy in high school that means you write the check and therefore I posted nomination if a bad thing happened to you in your life thanks to a person who is not the person we're talking about\nIt doesn't mean that the person to issue actually committed a crime against a person who is not you\nIt's ... I have a relative was murder that means that ten yet committed murder of another person there's no logic to that whatsoever first of all when you get away with it she's very clever dastardly in fact in her cleverness\nSo if you lie to impede a grand juries line of inquiry then that would be a violation of perjury charges if you're President Clinton and you suggest you did not in fact have sex with that woman that is legitimate perjury\nBut that is not the same thing as you know you asked a question about whether it's on a particular day you know it's nobody's here waned and it has no actual material impact on the course of the investigation that's perjury okay that's not how our so what are the lives of Brett Kavanaugh supposedly all first of all\nIt is important to note that all of his testimony was given it in the context of him being accused of a gang rape by a bunch of Democrats and then they were digging through his year book so every claim that has been made about his wise has been that supposedly he downplayed his drinking or lives about his high school yearbook\nOh I've got a high school you know I'm not going to defend lying I'm not going to pretend that Brett Kavanaugh lied about things I think that makes them squeaky clean let's go through a list of the supposed ally that Brett Kavanaugh soldiers from Boeing ... going going as if our website and so this means they're going to get\nAbout as comprehensive of you well it's actually from media matters which is comprehensive use you can come up with of Brett Kavanaugh's watch\nSo what are these impose allies have enough that he did not travel in the same social circles as four but he did\nAnd then they said well he traveled in the same social circles well what's the evidence that some of the people she says what a party with her on his calendar\nThat's not the same social circle that six degrees of Kevin Bacon\nAnd that it's ... that's that's like saying that you know I travel in the same social circle is and yet and therefore send his friends are in my social circle that's not the same thing at all\nAlso they say that he lied when he attempted to fabricate an alibi by suggesting he did not drink on weekdays that's not true he said he rarely drink on weekdays and his own calendar and in fact you referred openly invest money it was telling her I said on this day I probably drink how do I know I probably drink it says though on my calendar\nHave enough that he had no connection to Yale University prior to attending undergrad and law school there but he was ... and ...\nAnd it's not a legacy and many hey his grandfather went to Yale in Nineteen oh wait\nNot hear la school in jail and so that's that's not that's not actually a thing where else do you why supposedly he lied about blacking out from drinking but\nHe didn't live out that there is no evidence that he actually did blackout from breaking\nNow the Democrats kept using blackouts and drinking because what their front and they were attempting to establish is that he actually tried to rape Christine Blasey Ford and just didn't remember the incident\nThat that's what they are attempting to to say but there is no actual evidence of that so there's no why they're either now what you could say is that he was playing his his drinking in the most favorable possible light I think that's fair but that's not the same thing as as perjuring yourself as lying openly\nWill go through a couple of more be supposedly wise the cab not told ... has a good rebels and the silver political as well\nBut first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet\nWho like you said why would you buy generic mattress built for somebody else he always fleet has built to sleep question takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and we preference as to the perfect mattress\nWhether you're aside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a partial from but was he like there's no more guessing no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash bureau take their two minutes we'd was they will match Udall mattress they'll give you the best we've of your life for couples\nYou can even split the mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and your preferences for each side and a ten year warranty\nGets tried out for a hundred nice risk free right now here is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders and up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he would sleep dot coms Russia bureau wasn't\nWe tried that we got we did this liquid we received a mattress\nIt's really terrific get him in the mail we unwrap that after right on the bed because inflates right in front of you it's so good I got my sister who is leading actress for her wedding helix leave dot com flush Shapiro right now for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or again ... dot com slash bureau that addresses a luxury mattress and non luxury prices\nHe looks bleak dot com slash of Europe for a hundred and twenty five bucks off\nSo back to the supposedly wise the cabinet sold so this is a final ditch attempts they said we can't nominate him because sexual assault ... and then they said we can't nominated because\nOther women had been raped by other people were not a cabinet and then they said well we can't nominate him because he got angry and finally they came up with well he committed perjury you committed perjury is on top\nNo evidence he commit perjury so some of the other accusations they say that have not fight in Maryland and drinking age and explaining his behavior even though he was too young to legally drink in any case the only thing is that he said in his testimony he was too young to legally drink they said the drinking age Marilyn was Eighteen he said that in his testimony\nAnd then they get to the booth thing right so they suggest that it's a wide committed perjury charged with perjury for saying that in his your book when he was Seventeen he used the word booth to means part and what it actually means is anal sex I'm not kidding this is what they actually are saying\nThat what everyone knows that moving as anal sex and I didn't know the moving was was that that we're\nAlso it turns out that there are a lot of different ways that people use the word ... also something I didn't know but there's been substantial research on the ... thing and it turns out that there is no way to substantiate that as ally also the term devil's triangle so they're suggesting is that Brett Kavanaugh was using a portable\nSince about ... and one girl in a free some again he says that that was a drinking game it seems pretty weird wage what's your your past and drunkenness to term devil's triangle uh drinking game but again there are a bunch of people on Twitter who have said that they have heard of that as well\nAnd so they there's a bunch of people who said no he actually meant that now ... what's what's rubber\nWise any of this material it's only material because the suggestion by Democrats is that he's he's put a bunch of sexual references on his Facebook page that means you sexually assaulted a girl when he was Seventeen that in itself is an insane line of inquiry it's an insane when have you ever read a Facebook page\nI think people have been in high school\nI went to an all boys Jewish high school\nThey might you have a page was clean I Can't say the same for all my friends are there are references that people didn't necessarily understand in your book pages and orthodox Jewish day school and I have a feeling that most high schools around the country are replete with such references\nJustin send ya you guys went to high school were very obscure we're sexual references and your your book by dude yeah that's right too many to count is precisely the right answer because\nOf course have you ever let a teenage boy I Love all the senators were drunk in Laos boiling all well when you were Seventeen you wrote and your your book about drinking and making sexual references\nLike okay if you're a Seventeen year old boy I've ever again have you met a Seventeen year old boy there's not a Seventeen year old boy on earth doesn't make sexual references none zero zip jumped but if Brett Kavanaugh downplayed that in his testimony just means he was ... I cannot sit on the Supreme Court now that he's sixty years old and\nHe's still here is ... ... fighters and finally they narrow it down finally they narrow it down so what does this they also suggest that he lied when he says that he had a weak stomach so he used to throw up a lot well maybe he had a weak stomach and he threw up because of alcohol in or spicy food\nI also have a weak stomach I brought up a lot to\nThat could happen from drinking I've never thrown up because of drinking actually because I don't actually drink 'em but [laughter] but\nThey now sham it's like you know I Know now I'm not I'm not desperate enough to bring that a shot at such that'd that'd be just terrible\nBut it's it's so finally they come down to what they've known and on one thing one thing that the ... thing that that will find all the stuff that it's just a bunch of nonsense\nThen they narrow down to one thing and one thing only there's only a credible claim in my opinion there only credible claim that Brett Kavanaugh wide in his testimony there on a credible claim is that there was a reference on fourteen of the boys your book pages about a woman named Renee dolphin who's an attendee of local all girls high school\nNow a few things you might need to know that when a dolphin before we actually get to the to post a lot\nRenee dolphin was good enough friends of Brett Kavanaugh that originally she signed a letter in support of the idea that he was very good two goals when he was in high school she was on that later when she was friends with him for many many years\nAnd she signed that letter there's no accusation that she had sex with him in high school there's an organization that he sexually assaulted her high school there's no oxygen that he touched her in high school not so what exactly is the claim the claim is on fourteen boys your book pages there was a reference to innate alumnus referring to her\nAnd other references suggests that ... that she was that this was a joke about above a bunch of ... among a bunch of guys you just think that they were alumni of her genitals essentially the day that there's a bunch of guys had had sex with her and when Kavanaugh was asked about this you said that this was an attempt a clumsy attempted affection among his friends\nRight that's that's what he said in his in his actual testimony and I want to see if I can grab the actual patch of testimony that I can find exactly what it is it that he was that he was claiming but the the basic suggestion of of Brett Kavanaugh is that this was not in fact\nA a reference to sex with Renee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople um and and their stories of of of of hurt and of pain who are we who do we want to be as a country what are we trying to project to the young people in this world to the European\nAll of this country so upset about all the stops at the back and twenty twelve she wrote this on Twitter ... on Twitter Bill Clinton I Love you so much like crazy amounts of love\nClearly these are people who take very seriously allegations of sexual assault so yeah I'm I'm I'm definitely there's no ... politicking here at all not well we'll be back here tomorrow with all of it\nSure as always ... lot ... stuff at all [noise] ventured here [noise]\n[noise]\nStreet Journal author has been too emotional\nDuring last week's hearing ... going\n... will be hard working even killed and open the justice has been during his career he's not the only one speaking out on the eve ... procedural vote in the\nKnew several swing votes\nAnother can you hold out ...

been friends a long time and we share a along background in radio and it's something that I'm Still in dear to\nYou have a Mike ... is a you're an older too I Believe aren't you have some stations\nYeah yeah I have a partner and I and we own some stations and the Arkansas Texas and we are in Missouri so it's been kind of fun to go from being a a care making minimum wage at a radio station what I was fourteen years old to now owning a few of them\nAre bad Charlotte's calls in from Durham North Carolina Charlotte\n[noise] well I can tell you a jam Mac and how they contain myself Governor Huckabee I Am so thrilled and delighted to be able to reconnect with you you may not remember may at that she made so many thousands of people but six years ago\nI asked permission to give you a hug which you granted when you add a fund raiser for our now lieutenant governor Dan Forrest\nI I I Do recall it because it's very rare to somebody wants to make usually I Want a slight may happen next year I understood correctly [laughter] it's like to talk to you again\nWell we had our picture made together and I was just like a child I was just so thrilled because I have so much a respect for you and um you know just thrilled to pieces that you've got this show and doing so well and your daughter\nIs doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her ah I tell people that Donald Trump was not my first choice for president because I was my first choice for president a thought he was my second choice and I also say ... least we got to Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\nYou know it's got to be tough or as a dad to watch people beat up on your little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how grow up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know it doesn't make me nervous as people think and I'll tell you why because I Know are well enough to know how tough years ... some guy like Jim Acosta smarter than trying to you know put the squeeze on her\nI'm more afraid for what's about to happen to him as I realized he's about to get his head handed to him just know it yet\nAnd sure enough she turns and really Texan down a notch and I I watch her with guys like that and I'm thinking you know I've seen that same approach that she makes to her five year old and a three year old son\n[laughter] All right I Love so much is the fact that you have supported President Trump and ... if everybody would try to do that you know he had our president\nThat's cruise affect a lot of people seem to ignore [noise] Richard your call Charlotte let's go to Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHey how are you were well\nYou're talking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and what he said about girls is absolutely true because I have five girls\nAnd every one of them to take down just about anybody for fighting or something they believe in it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you what I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think cabinet of um\nI mean do you think it has more to do about abortion as anything else work habit I think that's opposition\nI think it does a cow and in in large measure because the locals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and ah read there's a role of the way which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nBut what most people don't understand ended up throw the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision and how would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it true the issue person but [noise]\nBecause if we were except the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point at conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to the prime a person of bear a life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because there should be about protecting the innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo about ten seconds here am I then I Want you to stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little checking your the calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected president a year younger than Trump and we've never had a president named Mike or what do you think [laughter]\nA gym I can tell you that there's a greater likelihood that outlaw transgender surgeries on it ever on for ...\nFor a while you can catch the man in his new element that is of course of his great TV show it's Huckabee on TBN and the new season premieres this Saturday aid eastern seven central and stay on the line Mike I'm jumbo had a\nA\nYou know I I I think that a lot of it depends on whether you see Trump's name on the ballot I think that the Democrats look at the ballot and basically Trump's name everywhere on it doesn't say Donald Trump or but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person\nWhereas Republicans I think look at the bottom and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they made you ride as a as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh\nAnd so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm also show I think all\nTrump has basically said that this is a referendum on the hand that as a nationalized election not good for\nA Republican or any time the power and the party in power and so they're trying to keep the ... election\nUh and not have a Trump is the main issue they won all ... judicial appointments or do they want that to talk about because a child support and still a great it's a and the\n... the low forties if you look at a solid holes in the thirties if you look at other ... and so uh he seen as very polarizing figure and he seems to stoke the culture wars\nIn a way that is not helpful for the Republican Party or the country a mocking the accuser a few days ago saying I don't know I don't know\nAre not great for a national unity it seems to me because uh you\n... well cool all halting call them all ...\nNow you know and after the victim\nWhen I when I heard that I remember thinking at the time you know everything he just said factually is absolutely one hundred percent true\nThat in fact in terms of someone who was a a bringing accusations against others the she was she was pretty vacuous at times and I I agree with that completely the same time I grand at what he said I also grown because I think this is exactly how it's going to be taken he is again\nHanding ammunition to his opponents and he just doesn't need to do that if he had merely recited the areas in which your testimony was rather deficient on specifics instead of the mocking but\nHe just couldn't resist himself I suppose [noise]\nAnyway let's take a quick break and come back on some calls for I guess these

this\nIt's going to be available in a couple of days or on a I Choose a and Amazon uh and uh we're going to be doing a limited theatrical a releases we've done a screening in Washington DC that had attendance from\nEverybody from the White House to Capitol Hill a just a few days ago and we had another screening in New York when he starts out more around the country so you go to the website there'll be information there and you can sign up and get updates when it comes to your area but it will be available shortly online both Amazon and I\nDo still get to have a Facebook page\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting I'm a YouTube when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some ... uh which we we have no reason to\nBelieve or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert ... who's this a PHD used to always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of votes by controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nYou actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his content so\nIt does happen to people or more often than you think it just demonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide if their whim a how they are going to control what you see\nYou have access to but they don't play favorites\nWell [laughter] I mean that's why they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean it's sort of thing I I understand it happens all the time and and and what they need the oil being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did that is particularly interesting when we go through this in the in the film\nOr is joining the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually in the fall and chairs around the country this was a a you know John a blind way\nUm but they basically enlisted volunteers and have them in job searches um on both\nGoogle and thing as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period and then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers or the red states where some were blue states [noise] so I'm One of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of\nGenders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google in every single searched position of the\nTop and the search results [noise]\nThis is the result favored Hillary Clinton\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the seed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump in the same search results [noise] um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't\nShelter results at the end of the day [noise] um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science essentially apolitical but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty six teams\nAre and what he is concerned about of course it's not political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that when I decided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election\nThat one base are sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for a and looking at the search results to where you really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially a whole actions and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer and the one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a show when we come back in just a moment\n\nNo you're you're you're exactly right um and if you think about all the sort of just ... uh uh novels about\nA totalitarianism it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state was going to smash in control people\nSo you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was visible it's kind of the you know the the the clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nBut what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a a global imagine a Mao or stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we've given them an enormous power and Google basically tells us is trust us yeah last us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Lyndon\nAllowed him um I I I don't I make quick comment a lot of uh the uh believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but what I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests for what he's been doing and about search engines\nAnd they're used to be I click which had a they they have another one called start page the same company but they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolved\nAnd I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppress I click or what happened to it and I use that that go\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars\nThere's a year for the opportunity to London safari searches so think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because they want the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing\nEverywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being present\nI think that is that is going to change eventually start pages becoming more popular it was a deal struck a while ago duct duct go is good\nIt it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that they\nWhich is the Microsoft product which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck up commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe\nThat there is some kind of ... where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives we'll be back in the moment\nLet's
