the whole looking forward to these funky Eighteen mid term elections coming up in just a couple of weeks here the polls in the lead up to the midterm elections\nAre starting to look a lot better for the Republican the reason for this is because Democrats suck it everything there is a lot of attempt on the right to claim that this is all Republican no hell and suddenly Republicans are good at things\nNow what what's really happening here is that the Democratic mask is often Democrats are garbage in everything basically when president from in the second thing in the news that has a very good thing for Republicans when he's the first thing in the news\nIt's a problem so when Democrats spent weeks demonstrating they don't care about due process and that they won't railroaded by simply for political reasons\nVery good for Republicans when the lead headline is the leading twenty twenty contender for the Democrats setting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for Republicans when we'd headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz in a restaurant and screaming at him and his wife very good for Republicans the best friend the Republicans right now\nIs the insanity and the Democrats and you are seeing that full scale in the polls also obviously you're seeing the effect of a very good economy on the Republican the market by which voters crushed Republicans over Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling raising our last Seventeen in his polished amazing also\nI don't want to give no credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good things number one is taking proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the presidents of the United states does make it feel like he has a change after\nAnd usually in midterm elections there's an attempt to vote for change right now what the whole show is that Republicans are actually seen as the party of change while being the party in power that's really unusual usually the party out of power is seen as the party of change because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he's the guy who's sitting in the state\nThat is very good for Republicans for here is what the latest polls show according to the wall Street Journal wrote are interested in the mid term elections has searched records within both parties helping to drive a President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrats lead as a party most preferred to leave Congress according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News news poll refining point to an energized electorate\nProfited by dynamics that bring great uncertain teaching the outcome of an election just two weeks away and what the polls kind of show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters joy high level of interest in the election that has the highest ever recorded in the mid term election since the journal NBC poll began asking the question in two thousand six\nNow the reason for that is because largely undemocratic\nDemocrats were always going to

as\nShe is sharing her looks and also she wants to completely redistribute all income in the profit motive that she is now back to discuss warming you wonder why folks in the United states are not taking Democrats maybe as seriously as they should because they don't deserve to be taken seriously here's Alexander Ocasio Cortez over the weekend\nSaying that we should fight global warming the same way we fought the Nazis\nWell I don't see really how bombing the Germans gonna help but I mean I'm willing\nTo try to get [laughter] the Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez suggesting that I guess we're supposed to I don't know invaded Normandy to stop global warming or something there she is the most intelligent advocate for her position the left and present these days you know general cause you for test [laughter]\n'cause when we talk about it at the central threat to the last time we had a really major existential threat to the country was around World War two so she knows nothing about history there was an entire Cold War that existed for several decades after World War two as turns out to that so we've been here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before right when we bomb the German\nAnd it don't do stop her she's rolling says none of these things are new ideas well we had was next to central Britain the context of a war we had a direct essential for it with another nation this time it was not Germany an actress who supposedly made the United states as an enemy as an enemy\nHistory lessons with Alexandros ... or some of my favorite history lesson directed central threat with another nation this time it was not to Germany and access\nNot ... okay you mean the axis powers oh that's what you mean\nWhat we did was we chose to mobilize our entire economy industrialized our entire economy and we put hundreds of thousands if not millions of people to work in defending our shores and defending the country we have to do the same thing in order to get us to a hundred percent renewable energy and that's just the truth of it\nSo we need to draft every male military age have them living berets for four years ship them overseas for women in the factories and rationed the butter\nDon't see how that is going to go around why don't we take them seriously I just don't understand speaking of not taking them seriously\nA very serious issue right now is cropping up on America's southern border so\nAs folks know I'm pretty libertarian when it comes to immigration I'm somebody who believes that there should be free movement of labor not citizenship you shouldn't be able to come in the United states become a citizen and vote you shouldn't be able to get taxpayer dollars but if you want to come here at work I really don't have a huge problem with it but\nEven I libertarian on immigration believe that we ought to have actual bores in the United states indefensible boards you don't just gets across our borders because you walked across our borders a country Without Borders is not actually a country\nJust tear man issue these serious issue\nThere's according to the Associated Press this morning a going caravan of a hundred migrants\nShrimp or southern Mexico on Sunday heading towards the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents briefly block them at the watermelon border there's these help at every turn for sympathetic Mexicans walk her food water including hundreds of local striving pickups dams and cargo truck stop them to let them clamber board\n... Lopez on during the city of San Pedro Sula her stuffed polar bear and winter cap that seem to add a place in the tropical heat it's the favorite of the only way of her two daughters four year old Victoria and three ... ...\nWomen what sweat and then I simply for folks who wants to get crappy places to come for a better life that doesn't mean the United states has an obligation to take an anyone who wants to get in without any sort of vetting procedures or determination as to whether this person is going to help the country or not\nYou cannot have a country that is the strongest economy on planet earth taking in thousands and thousands of people illegally without reading them without any sort of skill set that does not make for good economy this is one of the reasons why it's so funny both on the left they love Norway Denmark and lost weight and\nImmigration restriction is have been winning in Norway Denmark and in Sweden\nYou cannot actually have it on social estate in terms of redistribution of wealth when you have an underclass that it's coming that does not have a skill set\nAnd one of one of the things about about\nThose ... countries Scandinavian countries is that they basically banned immigration when the United states the left in the United states wants it both ways they want full on open immigration at the same time that they want to raise social spending like never before seen in human history that is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on this issue even Lindsey Graham was a real job on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously one of the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration from even he said listen this is not something we can do the anti blows you would welcome these tournaments I don't know what happened Lindsey Graham\nWhether he bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham you point out the reset is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina saying Nancy Pelosi will welcome these caravans\nTo be the country of people who run the up and down the hall and spit on you or do you want to be a country\nOf of of Republicans who can actually deliver for working families out there that will put good judges on the court that will stand up to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi will welcome to care of and fear a Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop\nOkay well that that is exactly right and that's not out of lack of simply because a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrats continue to push the tissue are going to lose it's funny because Democrats are so ensconced in their own bubble and what poll shows that Democrats have far fewer Republican friends than Republicans have Democrat friends\nBecause Democrats living areas actually she Republicans as nasty evil human beings and so they won't even talk to them\nThey actually believe that it's a mainstream view that people should be able to flood into the country they actually believe that it's a mainstream view that gender insects are completely separate and not only that that if a man calls himself a woman that that man is and a woman the latest evidence of this is I mean there's an amazing story\nThe way the media are covering and attempt by the department of education to to find what title nine actually shot so here's the headline from the New York times today it says transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you it sounds like the Trump Administration is saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nGender just for your gender identity disorder that's what it would sound like from that had one is that what's actually happening\nNo that's not what's actually happening because that's idiotic and nobody is saying there aren't people who are transgender\nWhat the Trump Administration is saying is that under the law was that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological sex they're not focused on you thinking you were a member of a different sex so when the civil rights act was written and it included language about\nMen and women and sex discrimination it did not mean that at a sex discrimination for you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom dressed as a woman\nAnd you say that's not cool we're not going to do that that's not the same thing as saying a woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination\nAnd that's that's what the Trump Administration is saying they're saying that behavior by men is not the same as being female\nThat's the actual ... to the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that's not what they're doing\nThe media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because there used to even acknowledge the fact that there is such a thing as biological sex it's orderly self defeating what the what the west and just the gender insects are exactly separate but gender is sex\nAnd so general insects are completely separate you can be a man but your gender is female and that makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman\nThis is how they want to read the law that makes no sense\nUnder any circumstances I Would explain in just one second they thing as a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane it's insane but first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news

Trump railed the fake news this is what he's talking about the sort of headline from the New York times transgender could be defined out of existence under Trump Administration were just going to disappear the transgender is now know that is not what they're doing okay here's what they're doing quote\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because gender is biological and immutable and it is delivered at birth\nNot what the what's the status they've redefined the term one of the great ... areas of confusion in the transgender debate is what the hell everyone's talking about\nReally I mean that because sometimes when people on what the gender what they mean is expressed feminine or masculine qualities and sometimes what they mean is actual sex and it is impossible to tell which unless they actually specify and then they shifted definition\nBased on what they want their point to me that the west is really the one making the case it only two genders they're saying that if you're a feminine men are actually a woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually in that\nIf you wanted to find gender as just expressed characteristics of femininity or masculinity there are seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means as meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say the gender has to do with biology\nNow you have to separate it into sex sex is based on y chromosomes and X chromosome now they're intersects people have very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates they're arguing that you can be fully genetically male and female\nAll of this neck no logical sense it's completely confusing because it makes no sense there was no internal consistency are watching the transgender civil rights movement they can't even find their term\nIf they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman is one that Caitlyn Jenner is just as much of a woman as my wife gave me a freaking break and everyone with half a brain on planet earth knows it\nBut there is what the New York times that a series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal programs including in education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth\nFirst of all sects assigned at birth the dumbest term in the world the only the gender assigned at birth at least now you're being consistent with the terminology\nBut even in that state and you can see the terminology shifting right there's gender and then there's sex assigned at birth\nYou does assign a sex at birth babies are born they are what they are when my goal was born she was a girl I did not sign her girl you know was signed her girl genetics God that was sort of baked in you know I Know 'cause she's a girl my God people and the same thing with my son when he was born\nYou know I knew he was a boy I looked at him\nWow this was difficult and it turns out he is in fact a boy amazing that the coincidence they comes out and he was all male characteristics and he's also a boy\nUnreal just amazing\nAlmost scientific ooh okay so here's what they say the policy prompted fights over bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas where gender was once seen as a simple concept conservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times conservatives especially evangelical Christians were and sent this was a wave slandering religious people as they get\nIt's not people who actually use their brain and recognize that there are men and women and these are two separate categories\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that one I mean women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups and the same thing for men's groups\nAnd the same thing for bathroom no it must be that there is those crazy people believe in the Jesus it's those people the people if it weren't for those crazies believing the Jesus then it would then everything will be fine and we go with knowledge than men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage down below\nThe here's the New York times has now here's the bad stuff okay what's the ...\nProbably ... now the department of health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under title mine the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education programs that will receive government financial assistance according to a memo obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues and it's a memo that the government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender is determined on a biological basis that it's clear grounded in science objective and administrative all\nThe agencies propose definition would define sects and he's a male or female on changeable and determined by the generals a person is bored with according to a draft review by the time a dispute about one sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world that not just basic rationality if you claim your woman I should be able to objectively tell whether you're a woman or not it shouldn't be up to ... it shouldn't be up to you to decide\nAnd it's amazing to me that the same let that has now come around you Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American because not well if she says she's a Native American why isn't she Native Americans you should be why not she's more Native American and Caitlin generous woman so what exactly is the problem here\nAnd you make sex and special and connected to a level of emotional and spiritual intimacy will likely or to lead happier life I speak as someone who has led this life\nAnd the promise of the sexual revolution that free sex all around it's going to make everyone happy here is a bunch of crap is not true it has never been through is a false promise attached herself to one human being and recognize the sex is more than just getting your rocks off\nYou'll leave it you will lead to happen to them by the way your sex life will be happier to\nAll of this should have been obvious but we as a civilization of ... decided to describe the obvious in favor of the attractive and that of course in the huge\nWell we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest crisis on the forest and have and

P. H. D. in Philadelphia pinch hitting for Jim tonight on a spectacular ... a night of the news\nAnd all that you just heard Steve Bannon that was good stuff I'd love to get your reaction eight six six fifty gym but I don't know if you've heard him before it's a rare interview eight six six five zero five forty six twenty six get you to me now I didn't get into it because I knew we get into it and I I Want you to hear other parts of Steve Bannon\nBut the caravan is the big story the caravan and Mexico I've seen Fox numbers now tonight swelling to fourteen fifty thousand the caravan of migrants\nAnd who knows whom and Univision tonight had a guy in Spanish that's why we don't play it but uh one of their reporters embedded with the caravan says he's met migrants from known terrorism hot spots like Bangladesh what are they doing there\nThis is part of the fear but the other is what Trump ran on tonight in Texas we're seeing a rally that is it's gargantuan is anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and packed a basketball arena tonight with Trump and cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox and friends today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people about the caravan\nAnd here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you know mandatory in crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stops this caravan and all of his threats listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nLike a let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that that the United states has plenty even immigration laws I I think even immigration laws are a problem for any country\nAnd I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated ah ah but this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants sure so what should the United states do if those seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand which the United states do about this ...\nThis is the ... country on the planet I think we can handle a on a a caravan of people unarmed coming to this country so let them in well I I'm saying to process them properly you aren't real quick on the ... there's a humanitarian crisis\nTaking place in Central America and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening it gets turning the talking points for treating I'm treating\nThis as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly if it is treated such as that way so I I think the ... these these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution um ... offers um in in dealing with\nThe backdrop his the terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens [noise] great discussion\nAlright that's from Fox and friends is one of my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim what's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they've they're going to punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week tail end of next week right before the midterms\nWell they see the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass but this sort of invasive behavior has gone on every day it I've been to them\nI've done shows from there this is the type of thing that goes on and I think this\nPlace badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let 'em in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd if the military had to use physical force firing on people that would that be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me it's just like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong we do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this is not just political and all of this comprehensive\nReform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with is\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sounds on this coming out but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to Steve Bannon that was really good stuff that you're the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim ... that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me down to your Dana this caravan story if you break right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking America's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't feel good as Americans if Trump\nStops is I think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it he\nLoses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this we don't want this love to hear from you my name is down to your data I'm sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One [noise]\n\nSomehow or another you'll use that level of force that America will be a revolt it I think America will not\nParticularly if the military can push back on this without anyone losing their life or anything like that but this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until we put up enough of a barrier AKA a wall\nTo stop this but this is why Trump was elected Democrats in a meeting or not they think this is the October surprise that\nThis is going to cut in their favor I don't see it in that way at all or let's go to Dan in Trenton New Jersey hey damn good evening\nAnd assemble all to be a ... like I said on\nThis has been a presentation of double UPS enforce smell back to regular programming which may already banned progress\n\nYeah but Alabama's all kinds of mine was better the your heart's won a championship right ... how they were the last more of the problem that shape Patterson yeah but you are too they couldn't Magellan on your talk you know but you're hurting real issue of the year two they couldn't win with Joan earth's they had to have to come in and save them and the championship game they were going to win the championship a gym and hurts yeah but there and he won a championship what hurts [noise]\nSo it's it's an actress for when right [laughter] not really no different now but I'm a hack into quarterbacks with one championships in college football they're not exactly the greatest of the greats yeah but they know but a great college players unlike jailing hurts them and a great college player\nYou know I mean this whole like he'd be the greatest transfer money shape Patterson has good at the point is she passed it's good enough it's the rest of the team around that isn't up to par when you're talking about beating the likes of an Alabama\nThey're not meeting Alabama I'm Sorry about even convince you if you don't have a state\nThat they have it in a long time but not what you just even better than the teams that horrible as that in the past I'll say that much but the problem is so fast and I agreed Ohio State probably is this year though two years ago they were pretty close but here's the problem that happened in it's not just the NFL's college to the quarterbacks\nSo much of winning games is on quarterbacks less so well you just explained it hurts\nWell as more of how about Alabama too I mean it's a scary to say next even has the best team is ever had there and he's won four championships there have Clemson do last year getting to the championship game but Kelly probably wasn't a good quarterback got their right and then what happened and that was one right was one but right was elderly against Jill and hurts to mediocre quarterbacks\nBut I just [noise] because they have great talent ... around them but I don't think he's in defense lights out now what shape Patterson to me you know he does use his legs but I don't look at him as the same type of threat the running the football some of these other quarterbacks\nI just don't see I think he's at best cheese\nOn lightly above average quarterback may be average\nAnd I think the big test is going to come you know look what what what what'd you say\nShe passes what slightly above average quarterback average nine hundred that rain average she sees slightly above average she's getting better though that's so true so\nIt's not about to pass this is my point it's more about the rest of the football no but you are oh no no no but here's the thing you have to rely more on the rest of the team because I don't think there's an some confidence ha Paterson\nI don't think the team was set up that way I mean but you know but that's because they have inadequate play quarterback that inadequate no but I had a pattern that has had more than adequate player quarterback not good enough to win championships I just explained you that the rest of the team is not up to par we're horrible no no no no no but he has no but the problem is\nYou can be ... known as you've been Oklahoma you can mask\nOther issues if you have had ... Craig trends though I Am looking at ... my point it's the talent around shape Patterson that sign up to no but it's not a ... foot mine points\nBlow the doors of Michigan if there were ever to me no no but my point is when you don't have great ...\nShe was so great got three for ... and possibly to force earning ... that help but hear and an offensive lineman probably at least one or two Joe Williams who's the top I think but here's the problem Greg McIlroy\nI mean the list goes on no but when you don't have any over ... back or any day\n... [laughter] well yeah and that was because they had a dream and Karen I wouldn't say shale raising the care not in college maybe down the price either but here's the difference but what I'm saying is\nThat true shape parents who was the top quarterback of the nation to just goes to show you God Knows how I mean when you watch it but here's the difference though when you don't have great players around the quarterback position\nYou need a quarterback to be better when you have the great players you can get by without a great quarterback what I'm saying is energy mid Michigan doesn't have great talent around it it's not ... not Alabama town well that's what you need that our talk right on that's not exactly what you know if you want to ask and Jeff ... but even Alabama hasn't had\nWhat Alabama has this year in years past I mean this years their best team as if you listen to everybody I talk this is the best team that ... right possibly I think it's All right so so no one can so again so what are we talking about here it's impossible for Michigan ... to have that type of talent\nOr the Alabama has this year it's it's you know so it's gonna come down the coaching\nBut you know the ... and you know I I favor Nick Saban in that battle I think yeah I Would agree but here's a here's what it comes down to Ohio State though see I thought Ohio State had that talent\nTalent well a little house it has a guy quarterback though if you want to go go right to to your point\nThat might be able to exploit the weakness of Alabama which many believe is the second secondary yeah and that's why Trevor Lawrence is sorting for ... and he can throw the ball over the yard you know that great on exactly terrible hair avoid the weakness or where you got spoke the weakness of Alabama\nI think the shake him no I I agree with you on that but man I'm telling you what this Michigan Ohio State match visitors it's great to break him every year bowl and both teams show up with one last which could happen I'll tell you what that can be a heck of a match\nBecause that you know look that's a big loss for Ohio State losing a Purdue at the conference last Michigan has not lost in the conference yet\nI don't think they will [noise] at Rutgers going to be to be boys course come on and off the getting the most of them and I am G G academy quarterback of the way I mean I ... my dad even go see my dad was nothing about football you as a\n... he comes over Saturday morning you know he doesn't care about college football had the game on obviously brings my daughter back to the playground and he's like\nIs Rutgers and the Big Ten I go yeah he goes why I said for the New York for TV\nAnd ... another quarter back during the championship prices are a very easy to remember he also got ten million dollars in the NFL from Seattle and all my dad here's why I go because of the New York media markets rockers isn't in New York I go I Know we talk about all the time or they're terrible they are a ... what's the next time they go in a big game\nThey won't I don't have you looked at their schedule press the way they play Penn State law she can stay on Michigan loss\nAnd uh another tough team they lose they probably like Wendy ... forty plus a plea for the top dogs are there to play the higher standing up on out fifty two three oh my goodness\nI'm as unbelievable\nSo right now where are you off your mission glasses for I Can't you have to write a ball Michigan versus Ohio State who really the better team right now it's going for him\nI think it's going for ... the ... but I ... I look I\nAgain Michigan lost so many times to Ohio State of the last ten years\nI you know I I Can't sit here with a straight face and tell you they're going to win but in terms of talent but how about the shenanigans off the field\nOh what is Harbaugh still mad about\nHe won that game\n[noise] come on if Michigan mid embassy Bush said I I Know so they have this tradition where they lock arms which is really corny if you asked me she was for the games I like to sideline\nFrom end zone to end zone Michigan claims that they were late\nIn doing this ritual the Michigan State was late and ...\nThey had no business I'm\nSo Michigan we had a right to be on the field Devon Bush and another player had a right to be on the field and well you know what happened they were doing this this tradition where they walk the line right like storm troopers is a ... like a put it and they did it close line Devon Bush but they kinda like walk right\nThrough him she had words [laughter] than Tony smiling Antonio mocked Antonio smiling up ... and Bush league and he doubled down today and you won't let it go\nSo I mean come on and then Devon Bush stumped on the logo at me field which was kind of\nDone which works if you when\nThey did win Michigan oh no mission Ron I'm saying like Michelle Taylor what I'm saying like [noise]\nIt is a stupid tradition the locking arms and walking and I think it looks good looks ridiculous but it's their thing if there's a new it when he blamed Devin Bush for being there well that's the whole thing or ice skating claims that they were late in doing it their tradition\nAs you say claims that they ... Michigan was well aware and their staff was well aware that this is what they do a ten o'clock I Am eastern ... he's been there before so I don't know I don't know if you want to play Michigan State of Michigan and I don't know who's to blame here hardly get off harm in horrible horrible what can you know horrible and use it as\nSort of I don't know I Would absolutely close lining Devon Bush All

people like me talk show host and alike\nAnd the criteria was that there was the most polarity between Democrats and Republicans with these two in other words Democrats favor the Republicans were opposed or the opposite got it so Hannity was in second place Russia was in third\nWhat do you think was number one\nAnd I'm going to tell you who number four was and I think she's been out it Ellen DeGeneres was number for it and I may shock you think of Alan\nNice enough woman that seems to me the dancing and all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race just gives them an incredible forum\nEverybody so nice there's no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about well the executive producer do you know what the executive producer is that's the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand and I think this is what they did generous show was about\nHe attacked millennia Trump I mean look you can attack president ... how do you tackle millennia Trump\nThe executive producer Andy last nerve took to Twitter\nTo insult Mrs Trump and to praise the care of and he said\nI'm way more afraid of another millennia getting into this country than I Am of any of the caravan of human beings seeking asylum is what he wrote and I maintain this is exactly the mentality of the people around these shows even as something that seems to be as offensive\nAs the Alan ... number for the most divisive about Republicans and Democrats it who's the number one most divisive figure out there and it needs to Russia's three you get that polarity\nYou know they're provocative tours but this\nGuy the executive producer of the

six let's get some callers in right now Don in\nNow Albany, Oregon is nectar good evening good evening good evening on high\nDuring good myself I'm just I just have one question for your are communist socialist their own worst enemies more often than not\nOr in some ways but here's the problem down right now we have whole generations of people that have been under educated or indoctrinated in colleges and\nAnd today I Am socialism is not human misery socialism seems like a new idea and kind of cool to them as strange as it is\nYeah\nBut I think something like that myself no but that's a big difference of course we cut and we've seen this we've lived through various things are these millennials and the light to them done that they just\nSee that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for some millennials student loan debt Everytime I see this Cory Booker is out there to not you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey Cory

ah make things more equitable fifty grand I'd had a hundred grand I don't know that fifties enough\nAnd I I've seen Democrat after Democrat\nGone after student loan debt well here's the thing is charging all this the people that run colleges are progressive Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging it every time they raise the rates people start scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government et cetera then what do they do they raise the cost was responsible\nFor how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up the IRS they're charging whatever they can get away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive that are running it All right so who is the most polarizing figures celebrity figure out their yellow and show and if you've ever been to a Trump rally and I'm really hoping to get somebody I think we might have a couple of coming up\nHere on the ... and John I Want to get a full time if you went to this rally tonight or all day long\nThis was that\nThis may further enthused people to know you're not alone out there as we head toward the midterms if you support that Trump's agenda or conservative causes there is not just going to be a blue wave here it's not going to happen in the Senate Republicans are going to pick up three or four Senate seats\nOn top of what they already have a house that's where the battle is that's going to be tough it's going to be very very close not a blue wave\nBut as a caravan bears down on us\nAs we see people throwing boulders ... windows harassing Mitch McConnell as he ate at what looked to be like an Applebee's and all that people\nAre getting more enthused and get out there and vote will take your calls have you heard the rally day Saturday we want to hear from you my name is down here down or sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood\nOne [noise]\n[laughter]\nThey jump into more Americans to do that day of the better off we are thank you thanks for the call and that's where President Trump ignite it is and here's my overall take on what we're going to see play out in the midterms when we see these caravans coming our way the average American apolitical they may have been like Dave they're activated\nBy this and they say with Trump here's a guy finally taking his head on\nYou know they vaguely might be a Democrat or Republican but they're sick of the politics they see this is a different time in a different person what do they see on the other side they see people doing stuff every day that are mob like these are mops\nI've had it here in Philadelphia I've experienced some of it we have a lot of anti ... here but it's not just ... its people going crazy all over the place believing that's the first amendment right to harass people scream at them as a professor this week\nAnd the University of Mississippi did nothing about it he tweeted out don't just arrest these conservatives Republicans when you see them out there if they're in a restaurant\nStick your fingers all the way through their salad and all mess it up if they've ordered appetizers take them and distribute them to everyone don't let some Adam bring boxes with you to steal their food and take it home type of stuff that's being condone that freedom of speech that's not that's democracy\nNo it's not it is a mob so you're seeing that mob domestically than you are seeing this other mob headed toward the border invasion the caravan and which side do you think Americans are going to side with even like Dave or like quaint said if he doesn't like Donald Trump the way he presents at times and all that\nThat's protecting America even if lot versus the other side just on the attack significant numbers are going to go with the Trump agenda side that's the way it's going to work\nAnd this caravan is exactly that coming up soon to take a moment to put something on your radar screen and I bet a lot of people listening have not heard this but when you do maybe you'll tell people about it and he'll start and I know the media has got a lot to cover now but can they tell you the story of ...\nPreventing Haiti Brennan from New Jersey and they Murphy he's the governor there administration you know coming off cabin up we're supposed to believe women were supposed to take actions to validate that if they make a claim this woman made a big claim about rape sexual assault\nAgainst an official in the Murphy campaign and then it official when the government wait until you hear what happened with it or didn't happen the wall Street Journal just did a big piece center but that's the only national media the rest of the national media said we're not going to cover her could it be because Murphy is a far progressive\nAnd that's why they won't cover so we're not seeing national media it's worthy of it I Want to shoot it by hand and listeners to know about it promised people in Philadelphia I Would tell you so I'll give you the breakdown of that next and your calls at eight six six fifty jumbo you get a ... year down\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what

to me if you were at the rally tonight\nOr in that area you got to give us a little bit of your play by play on at the big Trump rally have Katie Brennan\nIs a woman who were deeply for governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who is very very liberal running for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez who got a hundred and forty thousand dollar jobs housing czar in the Murphy administration after he won drove her home\nOr you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked to use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend who joined her she's shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy the Murphy's tower they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a forum they did investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now the legislature apparently is going to have a special team investigate this and a a former a judge is being brought in to investigate it\nBut why should national media not interested in is even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat n J dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think this would be all the rage given what we went through with Kavanaugh here's a woman with resources that's it by the book\nNow Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if the woman says all that though it's true you have to believe her Cory Booker in Jersey and these others right well\nThis woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets criminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job\nAnd despite all these complaints there still gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems to say the point being that double standard rears its head her name is Katie Brennan\nIn any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece\nAbout it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so if the standard coming out of cabin up people on the left in the media you shouldn't be on the court\nIf a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow does this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there in gyms audience about this\nNobody you know follow up now even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf here well that's an object lesson I could live with that if that's where they come up with a coming through the meat to ear and all that or could it be", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "23"}
