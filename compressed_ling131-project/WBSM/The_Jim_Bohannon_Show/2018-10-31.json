talk about the nature of anti Semitism the relationship between rhetoric and violence but we begin today with the president of the United states make them kind of a shocking announcement he says he wants to push for an executive order that would outlaw birthright citizenship the president of the United states\nHas now said in an interview that he is interested in signing an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrant children so here is the way the law currently operate if you come to the United states for virtually any purpose unless you were born diplomat\nYou come to the United states and you have a baby in the United states that baby is automatically a citizen of the United states entitled to all rights and privileges\nConferred upon all citizens of the United states the reason that this is a controversial issue is because nothing in the constitution actually said that this is the case\nNot only does nothing in the constitution actually say that this is the case\nThere's pretty good evidence that the framers of the fourteenth amendment had no intent to do anything remotely like this just that\nJust because you come to the United states and then you have a baby hear your baby is now in the United states citizen and this does have some pretty significant cost involved right now you have in California too many stories about that you've had situations where\nLegitimate birth tourism is happening people are traveling to the United states just to have babies in the United states that their kid become American citizens\nAnd there's some pretty significant impacts the center for Immigration Studies which is very anti illegal immigration and they estimate that between three hundred and four hundred thousand children are orange legal immigrants in the United states every single year meaning one out of every ten birds in the United states to any legal and grandmother all of those children are considered\nBy the executive branch US government to be us citizens enjoying the same rights and privileges as he put the children of us citizens the population of U.S born children with the illegal alien parents has expanded rapidly from two point three million in two thousand three to four million in two thousand eight and that does not include children who are Eighteen years of age or older the actual figure\nIs actually somewhat larger all of the benefits that are available to American citizens are obviously available to these American citizens there's a lot of talk about illegal immigration not having a tremendous impact\nOn the American economy because he legal immigrants are barred from federal welfare for example their children however are not and this does lead to chain migration because children are not us citizens and they can sponsor their parents for United States citizenship the center for Immigration Studies suggest\nThat many of the welfare costs associated with illegal immigration are due to current birthright citizenship policy they take greater effort at barring illegal aliens from federal welfare programs do not reduce costs because the kids are still American citizens nationwide forty percent illegal alien hot headed households receiving some type of welfare\nIn some states the rate is higher in New York forty nine percent receive welfare and California forty eight percent\nOnly Nineteen percent households headed by native born citizens\nMake use of a major welfare programs in other words illegal alien who have\nThe Supreme Court ruled that ... was a child born in the United states to a legal resident Chinese immigrant couple was included in birthright citizenship but again those who legal residence that's more like a case of my parents in law\nAnd my and my brother in law and he was born in the United states to legal resident parents and therefore he's an American citizen fine this was not due to get the question we legal immigrant children was not adjudicated oh wait until Nineteen eighty two coming up we're going to discuss\nThe Supreme Court case that really speaks to whether the children of illegal immigrants are

some of the history of the fourteenth amendment any just Britain surrounding the fourteenth amendment as one Supreme Court case it does suggest that the children of the least\nAren't that citizens of the United states\nThe case in Nineteen eighty two is very famous case called ... do it they wrongly decided a case this case\nMade famous by very lot Supreme Court this case basically was about whether the state of Texas could deny educational benefits to children of illegal immigrants\nSo kids were born in the United states\nThey were the children of illegal immigrants and the question was do they actually have to be given free public education at the cost of the state state of Texas said no the Supreme Court said yes excuse was left it left the Supreme Court there's no evidence that this is really accurate\nOr this is a good ruling justice William Brennan a very leftist judge wrote in a footnote quote no plausible distinction with respect to fourteenth amendment jurisdiction\nCan be drawn between resident alien she's entry into the United states was lawful and resident alien who's entry was unlawful\nWell that obviously is bull crap okay we make distinctions along those lines all the time all the time we are constantly making legal distinctions\nBetween resident alien who came here lawfully and residents aliens who came here unlawfully like for example if you're a resident alien you came here unlawfully we can deport you enter American law if you're a resident alien came are lawfully we cannot to pour you under American law at least not without some sort of violation so this is simply a nonsense opinion now\nJust because it's nonsense opinion does not mean that it does not have some sort of legal standing it does and the fact is that there is legal standing for four ply alert versus you know what that means that when President Trump says that he can simply issue an executive order and overrule that Supreme Court ruling\nOr overrule the federal laws that have taken that have taken precedence uh in in order to ensure the quote unquote rights of of children of illegal immigrants\nThat's not correct an act of Congress might be able to do it maybe not in any case it was going to go to the Supreme Court and that's really what this is all about President Trump\nWas going to sign an executive order and then this was going to be litigated all the way to the top of the Supreme Court at which point the Supreme Court will would rule on all of us now is from really going to do all of us who knows\nAnd when I see folks on the left are very very upset about from talking that executive order this way I don't like executive orders this way either I don't think this is what the executive branch should be doing the executive branch does not have the power\nNor does it have the capacity to rewrite laws or rewrite the constitution I felt that way about Iraq Obama rewriting laws to simply suggest he was not going to prosecute illegal immigrants and I don't like it when President Trump says he can rewrite the laws with regard to birthright citizenship from the office of the presidency\nThe president is not a king the executive branch is not a monarchy\nWhat is this really about what is that what the truth is the president if he wants to pursue something like this he does have a Republican Congress you could push Congress for a law\nHe he does have Republican Senate he can push the Senate for law this is really about joining up the base in advance and the twenty eighth election and it ties into what President Trump key argument has always been with regard to immigration going all the way back to twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen which is that we are far too nice about illegal immigration in this country now there are a lot of folks\nOr suggesting that is red red with regard to the caravan is over the top\nIn some ways it's accurate and somebody says I Want to be there as I can do about the president and his critics when it comes to his treatment of this migrant caravan the migrant caravan is indeed a publicity stunt I mean there's no question that that's what it is it it's being promulgated and push by Central American Latin American government being pushed\nBy the government of Mexico which is allowing migrant caravans you traveled toward the United states border when the president says these are not folks who are eligible for asylum is basically correct asylum is where people are being targeted by a government is not for economic migrants who simply wants to cross over into the United states in order to take advantage of the economic benefits of living in a rich\nAnd powerful country that that is it an invasion it's not an invasion when you walk up to a point of entry and ask for asylum\nI don't think that the big problem with that is that somebody is going to go and shoot up a congressional baseball game Idaho Bernie Sanders responsible for that\nI think the problem with the these sort of radical polarized rhetoric the kind of inflamed rhetoric the problem with that sort of thing is that when something terrible does happen when somebody does something that is truly evil and somebody goes and shoots a synagogue for example\nInstead of a unifying and saying all of that as bad we are now more likely to see the other side as responsible for a crime that we all agree is evil\nThe social fabric relies on looking at each other as though we are friends not enemies but if our politics is all about how we are enemies and when something bad happens to be first reaction is to blame it on your enemy\nAnd when that happens in social fabric actually to cage that's the biggest problem that I see here you know and cast something he writes a piece for Bloomberg today and what she says the trucks hateful speech raises the risk of violence\nIt the the one sided focused on President Trump's speech as opposed to less beach is counterproductive if we want to say let's all take it down it's like I'll take it down a notch this I agree with but you want to say that Trump is uniquely responsible for the tone and tenor of American political debate right now\nThat's just not accurate it's just not accurate and you know it's not accurate\nI mean would you mentally and the last twenty four hours or Republican Party headquarters and blues account in Florida the the windows were shot out here's footage from that just walked\nThat come in through the back door and they sell the windows and\nDid not have time at that point to look around\nAnd then um I didn't realize it was\nBut there's one bullet holes in our windows and therefore bullet holes in the room\nOkay so the idea that violent rhetoric is only happening on one side is just a lot there's another problem which existing that rhetoric is is deeply connected with violence and that is\nYou compulsion to censorship so there is a threat in saying that rhetoric is directly connected with violence here is a threat the threat is that people will then say okay let's restrict the rhetoric that's restrict the rhetoric and that's the move that's being made in for example Europe is being made 'em right now I'm I'm broadcasting from Vancouver it's a move is being made in Canada\nIn Europe and there's a case has been wildly under Under Cover in Europe there was an amazing amazing case in which a woman was fine for criticizing the prophet Muhammad hey this is\nThis is the the description of the case from the Atlantic ram would write a few years ago I appeared on alive Egyptian television show hosted by a conservative Muslim jihad of sympathies he learned early on by offering to answer any question I had about Islam including he said\nWhether the president whether the prophet Muhammad was a child molester\nThe host seemed awfully open minded I talk in the house humorless jihadist tend to be about the prophet when the lights went up in the program again I mentioned the travel Esther issue has remained true to his word that diversity insurrection or try to me from my apartment around the same time a woman referred to as he asked was convicted\nIn Austria for in effect not raising identical curiosity and form of question on Thursday the European Tour of human rights upheld her two thousand eleven conviction for discouragement of religious precepts a crime in Austria the facts but yes did or not in dispute she held seminars in which he presented her view that Mohammed was indeed a child molester\nDominant Islamic tradition told them a hundred and third wife or you shop with six at the time of the American nine at his confirmation Mohammed was in his early fifties\nThe Austrian woman repeated these claims the Austrian court ruled she had to pay\nFour hundred and eighty year old or spend sixty days in jail and the ISI HR ruled Austria and not violated her right\nThis is the consequences of restricting speech because you believe this speech either leads to violence is violence there are consequences on the other side of the ... not all about rhetoric and violence are connected there or take down the rhetoric there is a problem with the rhetoric and violence are connected and therefore we must restrict the rhetoric\nSupposed to be very careful about what it is that we are calling for here\nWe have to be very careful because we're not careful then the impact that is going to be a lot worse than the actual disease itself okay in just a second\nI Want to talk about anti Semitism about the media's radical rhetoric we didn't get to all of that in just one second but first let's talk about your underwear due to\nFall is here and you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade a restock their drawers with all this fall colors in print\nFrom Tommy John I mean these are the best underwear in the business Tommy John obsesses over every little detail on stage these proprietary fabrics to perform like nothing you've ever more before as a

got a full refund with their best patio everywhere or it's free guarantee\nSo what do you have to lose that includes their new life changing women's underwear which is now fully back and stuff before\nYou spend another time on cheap heat trapping multi past underwear remember there's no better way to take care of your good Tommy John no just needed hurry over to Tommy John dot com right now you spoke with Ben for twenty percent off your first order as prominent Cuban or twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com\nI Love these underwear you will to and again there is no risk because they've got that best period a level where it's free guarantee Tommy John dot com I Want to talk about the polarization and I'm One of the reasons that lying about the level of of\nRancor on the other side whitewashing yourself as a bad idea I have to get right but I have a kid who's four and a half to get his two and a half the four and a half year old\nIs just a wonderful beautiful girl she definitely stands up herself the two and a half year old has now decided he's had enough and so he's going to harass her every waking minute of every single day and we as parents have to decide exactly how we're going to treat this\nNow the easy response is that when he pushes her and she screams in his face which is basically every hour or two in our house right now do I simply punish him or punish are also\nThe answer is what I Do as I said to him you need to go in or crab right now right you get a timeout you're allowed to put your sister and I said her Leah when you have a problem I Need you to come and talk to me about it I Need you to I Need you to actually talk to me I'm standing right here you don't need to scream in his face there is not the ... the gear for which you can appeal\nAnd screaming and his face or pushing him back is not the proper solution to this but I'm now\nIs he more responsible and she has you but of course you are a horse yet right he's pushing her but that doesn't mean that you get to act\nLike rats shouldn't get to scream in his face and it's pushing back and get to do any of those things right now in American politics here's how things are going people unless see themselves as my daughter people on the right to themselves my daughter everybody feels like they are being pushed by the other side and they feel like it's okay to screen back in that person's face\nNobody is saying yeah I'm being pushed by the other side and that's bad but also I shouldn't screaming anybody's face and push back maybe what I should do instead is appealed to the broader moral authority of the American people and not act like this\nYou know that the media have been saying for a long time President Trump needs to stop saying the press or the enemy of the people that President Trump I got a lot of blowback yesterday tweeted out that President Trump should not say that the media are the enemy of the people a lot of folks on the right to an internal means the fake news or the enemy of the people\nWould buy that narrative except that President Trump has never been very clear about what constitutes the fake news now there's some I think is bad news that there are people who are quote unquote journalists who are actually\nJust opinion makers\nThere are actual headlines that are wrong that stuff is big news but the president has been a blender ... and his use of the term fake news there was a poll he doesn't like it's fake news and there's a story and he doesn't like it's fake news he's never actually been very good about objectively saying what is fake news in what is not so I'm not going to buy that exact excuse\nThe press though they know the president shouldn't say that from\nTrump's and say that the press or the enemy of the people that is true also true the media should not portray President Trump as the enemy of the people which they have been doing literally since the day he was elected and before they say he's a Russian agent they said that he's a traitor to the country\nThey say that he's doing all of this for his own personal enrichment without any evidence to this point they say all of these things and then they think OK well our hands are clean our hands are clean and you can see the sort of attitude you want to know what folks are angry at me on the right to one of the reasons the folks are angry at the media and the writers Jim Acosta\nGoing after Sarah Huckabee Sanders on his face is\nSafe for\nOf which outlets are you as a president for\nBird as the enemy of the president's going to save a fake news radio or the enemy of the people\nThat if you're going to stand there to say that there are some journalists some news outlets in this country or for the ... version of a shooting you have\nThe guts serves a state which outlets which journalists for the enemy of\nAnd really what you should say is I mean what Trump things is huge and the costs are I mean that that's what's obviously running through Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had she stuck between a rock and a hard place because at the press secretary you don't want to start labeling people enemy of the people why Trump shouldn't be using the phrase\nBut it didn't talk about fake news right I mean I think Jim Acosta is is not a good journalist I think just as objectively speaking as I can be I think Jim Acosta loves him some kind of Costa he sees himself as an accident more than a journalist and it's obvious to everyone CNN then tweeted out or in response of Sarah Huckabee Sanders who said that the\nThat um ... went up and make it she said you guys are polarized debate because you're suggesting that President Trump is responsible for shootings and bombing\nCNN communications that no press secretary in and did not say Donald Trump was directly responsible for the bumps into our office buys ardent embolden support we did say that he as you should understand words matter every single one of them but so far\nYou don't seem to get to catch ally CNN has been saying\nFor a week for a week that Trump should be taking responsibility for the money you know I read you the kind of runs like last week for a whole segment and then and then host people like Julie ... is this radical journalist political journalists from GQ who went on CNN yesterday\nBecause what if you're just as if the Jews escape anti Semitism at the Jews succeed in Israel is using seat in the United states that is in effect of them climbing that intersection will power hierarchy and that's leaving behind their membership in the group victim put right in the group victim click\nAnd this is why the ... version of anti Semitism is not only wrong it is actually counterproductive and leads to more anti Semitism and has been mainstream into the Democratic party today understanding anti Semitism is the key to fighting it and I fear that a lot of folks don't actually understand what the anti Semitism is or if they do they're ignoring it we'll

selling author and demand with some considerable thoughts and observations to make about the political process including recent remarks\nMade by Nancy Pelosi in the New York city she of course the house minority leader and uh she hopes and some polls suggest you might be once again the speaker of the house\nNow it's hard to know exactly what Nancy mean sometimes sometimes you just a little goofy a are referring to of course the famous quote about Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been a rhetorical rambling on the part of ... below sea\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her soul\nI think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party basically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it and we're basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting the ... the American people were told\nBy the president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor they remember that eat Italy yes they were told that their premiums\nWould go down I don't know if they express disgust deductibles\nBut I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go a phenomenally um higher to the point where the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare and and of course\n... I don't think the American ... honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry went\nThey you know health care system in the United states is similar to the legal system in the United states has lots of problems are legal system has lots of problems ... and the healthcare system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other parts of the world\nWe thank God we have it because it's the best in the world right well that that the\nBasically the system was demonized\nUm and it was up there were just a lot of ... and going on in order to change it again the enjoyed advise the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy of the Democrat Party if we look and we you know right and it terms looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre yes we've been hearing a number of things about people uh most notably a Christians similar from Arizona Claire McCaskill of Missouri a quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least made public in which they indicate there are a lot more to the left than the than the\nShall we say they portray themselves to be we have a number of people who would like to speak with James her some and they lead off with David and crushed in Iowa hello David\nThough again thanks for taking my call or two and a brief period ahah I got to\n... or a everybody in the ... the mayor group a first one is a and Lincoln said one time is it didn't catch more people in some way to a party in ... a a ... a barrel a goal and\nThat was the first day and then the other one is that I think yeah the ... entire Congress is going to have to stick to hold their ... and\n... I'm Sorry you're kind of skipping in and out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nI I think we have a hold of statements where they have a Congress up there to put this on their forehead so that each of them can read it and says are a little respect would ah tore each other as you want respect you have to give ...\nYeah well there's certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I think at this particular time your thoughts James ... about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other\nBut basically you know with that the kind of commentary this collateral damage commentary Hillary Clinton saying you don't have to be civil um\nAnd the\nThe basic um atmosphere I brought up the Kavanaugh hearings to see these mobs of people and they are ... percent that caused you know the president come up with the slogan jobs now ...\nWhich I thought one billion by the way but it was ... you know he is a really\nSlow down there but we take 'em if the Democratic leaders have not called out they haven't called out and he thought yeah always willing to go after the president\nHis latest rhetorical access by the president is is a pat 'em out to a stabbing somebody in the heart but when people literally go out and vandalize and ... and ... perform arson and and the like\nOh they they they they're not say anything and of course they don't because they're scared to death of the Democratic writers good at what happened to the Joe Crowley in New York the prominent democratic or\nA house member who was beaten by Alexandra Ocasio brainy ac\nBut in Cedar Rapids Iowa good evening or David and do it welcome\nHello ah what I notice is that where I'm from the Democrats had a guy from like a a a a twilight or sorrow and history about the world like clockwork orange mad\nAs hell when they're talking about ethics and morals\nYou know how they stand as mad as hell and saw last a lot of there's a lot I go to hell I'll see how it was ... well you know it it would be nice where they want to echo\nBy al ... all of that law that ethics they uh yeah we had a place here on this ... ... but I think a lot of apple enough that asked us saying you know Neal lacking morals and ethics Dakota well\nIf your if your morals and ethics of the lead you to break the law would or would thoroughly concur lesson admitted to go here ah your response James [noise]\nWell you know brings up this idea or when he talked about his movie analogies and that as we were talking about a political party that has made it their position not to accept the results of an election\nUm they've they've tried every way they can with their allies in the media to essentially that only undermine the president but to remove him from office using governmental or agency so and it's all failed\nAnd yes there there in a a mental state\nOf kind of the uh the dealing with is when someone deals with that\nThere are still in well we're we're we're coming up with a break that does it move in that we will take that break it'd be back with more from James person in a moment\n\nDoes your basement or crawl space of a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation\nOf uh wringing our hands about this just started to really freaked me out a James\nI perfectly understand is the ... is is right there to bring this up they did have for sure they have firearms this group and the bass a\nProportion of them are young men the fighting age\nAnd it does appear that they want to use the women and children are in as a kind of thought that they would if and when they arrived at the border they would stick them and fraud and to try you know say if the military were to use water cannons for example um I think they want\nAltercation and injury this is a so it's a delicate situation but here's the big picture we simply have to stop though if they were to get into this country\nThere would be an endless number of caravans and ah it appears as though the people that want to abolish ice the Democratic socialist so they called themselves the people that want to open borders seemed to never be able to answer the question\nOf how many immigrants is enough\nAnd so they seem to be on a trajectory to turn the United states into a third world nation because there are certainly enough people in the world that would love to come into the United states of America with to just walk across our border and not have any red tape and be able to get\nBenefits at the same time\nUm especially for example the state I'm In California they're ... they want to

you can follow me on Twitter at jumbo talks\nIn the middle of all there is much in this world to talk about which is of the extremely serious major we thought it would be only right\nOn what he is as we speak live all Hallows eve eve\nTo take note of of Halloween and the particular to a talk with Hollywood executive president the chief data strategist I'm headed media twentieth Century Fox Julie regroup to talk about her book the ghost photographer thank you Julie\nWell how are you came up to tell you something where I come from which is rural Oklahoma I grew up with about thirty jumbos\nAh yeah well I grew up not far from you in southwestern Missouri and if you grow up with the named Jim both have him in that part of the country you're going to use the jumbo real fast [laughter]\nOh yeah now you're now that that makes all the difference in the world I think in your community status if you're a gym\nOh absolutely oh yeah the elevated me I think it may be a boy and a half on me started quotient there so you found your way to uh to Hollywood\nAnd dug the subtitles or the ghost of the ... river Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of uh make believe published by a HBO in live in I Believe\nYes which is a part of Simon Schuster\nYeah uh ... what exactly are we talking about a year in terms of the ghost photographer\nYou know I I Will tell you that at the heart of the book is actually a transformational Journey Through grief\nUm because when I lost my mom to all timers um I was devastated and even five months after that I lost another very dear friend and tragically in a car accident and not long after I started seeing ghost and photograph\nWhere you know like you were we come from this guy to sound like\nToo hard to tell them\nYour\nMy career go\nI Believe that the big leagues with uh the Halloween and uh we're glad to be talking about those things just be tired spooky tonight with a Hollywood executives\nWho has written a creaky book the ghost photographer Julie ... our guest at a she has to put some considerable fought\nAnd the imagination into this bill what's the uh the most uh I guess a scary or realistic thing you've ever seen in this particular brain\n... well at the really great question because there certainly is things that have been scary that I've seen and um and there's things that are scared that experience that actually didn't see\nI think that I had at at one point I'm In the house I made that got I think after if you will the door kind of crash down into the other side for me\nUm had a lot of ghosts if you will that I'm kind of entered the house and we had\nHeaters turning on by themselves light\nOf and computer ... it was it was absolutely insane um and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first goes to that I I I took a picture of\nBecause it was the idea of it actually scared me and this is where the Hollywood comes into play where students that they hold her guys\nAnd so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I open the portal\nAnd am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified\nUm I have I have seen um some some scary scary goes that look like they've been beat up\nA ghost I had no idea [laughter] I didn't I think there would beat up before they cross over wise yeah and\nSo there was one like I had a black guy and like a a fat lip um so yeah there's been some scary things\nBut I think that first one was more scary for me because I didn't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you have this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis a jam was hurt evidence yet are we going to see a return to those good old days of a of a scary this and the Freddie Krueger and that sort of thing\nYou know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy said symbol on um have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nOn and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger\nYou know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore ... are the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is simply muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk you might have a smile and Russia face\nIf you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins and say you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it\nI Hope everything's not just download and we sat and watched things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams of theaters for example uh get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do\nNot think so they do\nYeah uh does Hollywood kind of bad I mean if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater bulls in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and the and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or just the ... the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nNot that I'm aware of where you'd be where I Would yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nYou know All right uh in terms of of the uh\nThe the creativity the that goes into a Hollywood productions it seems to be the some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days\nGo not into the TV shows or even necessarily feature movies it seems so to me the some of the highest levels of creativity at least per per second of air time if you will go into music videos in commercials\nHuh you know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon this film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for second on something like a star wars and have a very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects and then it as anything else\nDoes ... does Hollywood depend too much on affects or we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got the great ... computer graphic or a a special effects here as long as you got to dust gr light and magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nIt now you can't you can't sell it felt like anything I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which\nYou know I started digging into that the data side of things is to is to understand the customers for and there was a day when you could just make a movie and then but he said\nI'm ... this is probably more like twenty twenty ... Twenty years ago [noise] um but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that listen [noise]\nFrom what I've experienced and I and I had to put it yeah it's a kind of start with that because I think it's fair either got access to everything in it for every movie in Hollywood movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie you\nKnow and they're all gone with the wind or Citizen Kane discard [laughter]\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script they might ... not totally confident in but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects and some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... um special effects in any of those films um Slumdog Millionaire was the Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room\nYou know for those films that doubt at least I Hope so because

New York City about nine thirty am eastern time if you place an order before and on the the am like the night before or early in the morning before you go to work\nYou could be charged an unlimited amount of money to have that trade be put through the exchange system that is just a fact\nIf there are more by themselves the people who are buying are going to be hit with these big fees if there
