begin today with all the updates on the back gate attempted bombing attacks on Democrats across the country\nThe weight is with regard to the state of quote unquote attempted male bombing is it is possible that the bombs themselves were not actually structure to detonate so I'll upon it over a hot air right judging by some by social media some grants and a piece story and thought it was claimed the explosive powder inside the bomb was harmless not sell\nA package since CNN insane to pipe bomb and and on with the mystery powder inside if mystery pattern that timeless\nThe bombs themselves are supposedly workable and functional if crude although there are other report\nThat suggests that'd be bombs lack a detonator and so this was either a test run or a hoax or something else like that we're still waiting more information and are you today are waiting more information yesterday I said there were a bunch of folks who jumps to the false flag explanation now I'm not claiming\nThat you are not allowed to speculate inside your own head as to who you think of this or that you're not allowed to wonder\nWhether there's enough information to get on one side or the other way I Am saying is if you are one hundred percent sure this is a false flag you weren't right there like right away you just went to this is probably the Democrats helps in themselves\nThat's not good okay you shouldn't be using confirmation bias and substitute for evidence and this is true in so many cases in our politics I Can't even tell you I've been saying this for years I mean\nI remember when Michael Brown case Michael Brown black guy shot by a cop and\nEnormous logged in the last ... the entire what basically said this is a case of police racism and brutality and look man was shot in the ... because he was black\nAnd I said well let's wait for more evidence and then the evidence came out and it turns out that wasn't the story at all or here if you're jumping to either this is Democrats' hopes in themselves or this is Donald Trump planting bombs in the mailbox and you'll rent CNN\nLet me suggest you that you're totally full of crap you know I Know you don't know you can get one knows yet\nDon't know yet you don't know yet I don't know yet and anybody suggesting they know who did this or why it was done or what the connection is to any particular political party is lying to you they don't have the information yet now there's some indicators that\nSomething weird is going on ... this this this\nPerson should be put in jail forever and the person who is doing this has now sent one of the pack and just you Robert De Niro I guess and I don't want to Maxine Waters and a picture of the of one of the bombs and then you know\nAppears to have a parody of an ISIS flag taken from I mean that was circulating on right wing cars on the Internet since twenty fourteen\nAccording to NBC News the printout appears to show a parody flag there are places in Arabic character\nWith a silhouette of three women in high heels in the middle inscription reading get her done which is a catch phrase of wary of the cable guy enemies Laughlin Markey first noted in an extended period inside the explosive package center CNN's time or a building in addressed running or striking similarity to black and white flag of the terror group\nOvertly and and systemically racist when he said that sort of stuff we felt like okay well you know is that an indication that maybe violence is okay now there are folks in New York felt that way people on the NYPD who felt that way that so much for the one bill de Blasio after ripping the police for months actually went to a policeman funeral was shot to death members of the NYPD turn their back on him\nAnd they did the ... evidence is extraordinary higher or blame somebody for violence incitement you actually have to have evidence but the west doesn't care about evidence they're not interested in evidence coming up CNN's Jeff Zucker\nDoing a lot

CNN and he's now blaming President Trump for the state of attempted male bonding let's all numbers CNN has not been particularly\nMeasured in his rhetoric with regard to the presidents of the United states or for guards at the right hey folks on the left they weren't CNN specifically because CNN has basically become a propaganda outlet in many ways for the anti Trump agenda\nBut Jeff Zucker says that when the bomb was sent CNN headquarters and that's because President Trump here is what Jeff Zucker said put out a statement\nHe said there was a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand that words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of that again\nDo not understand why Jeff Zucker thinks that the president of the United states is responsible for bomb being sense in it headquarters just because the president says that he doesn't like the press or the press or the enemy of the people I don't like that language either I think that language is bad but that is not language thing go send a bomb to the people at the end it\nThat's not a thing the president of the United states in response to the media basically joining up outrage at\nHim and at the right is I think not entirely inappropriate so first of all I Will say that\nPresident Trump has used rhetoric I don't like at all is used rhetoric that I think\nIs immoral with regard to the press I think he has used rhetoric with regard his political opposition that is immoral does that mean again he's inciting violence no and the press have used very similar rhetoric about President Trump does that mean they are inciting violence no it doesn't heated rhetoric and violent rhetoric or not the same thing\nAnd to link the two means that eventually somebody just going to say well since we're all the rhetoric because otherwise it's going to lead to violence here was President Trump going after the media basically the median President Trump can stop covering each other and I think there's some truth on both sides in there's a lot of false and on both sides here is the president saying stop with the media scares\nThe media also has a responsibility to ship symbolism as you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks in stores have to do [laughter]\nYou know I agree with the president at the media to a horrible job of covering the news and in response to President Trump they promote even more fall stood and look bakery and more divisive politics is what they do\nBut is there any question that President Trump is trolling them of course not because President Trump has used similar rhetoric about media basically this is to folks slapping each other in the polling dynamite style in the face and then blame each other when a guy down the street decides you didn't go bomb the local school\nNot the same thing hey Sarah Huckabee Sanders I think much more correctly she says you know ... to divide and attack\nShe treated out President Trump asked Americans to come together and and one very clear strong on mistake will message that acts or threats of political violence betting kind of no place in the usa you chose to divide and attack America should unite against all political violence\nHey that is correct that is correct and I don't understand why President Trump is getting back for saying the right thing at that at that rally or at the White House and then he is getting bashed on the other side when he when he goes after the media anyway in any case CNN demonstrating full scale\nThat they are going to go with this narrative but they never went with this narrative forgot to Bernie Sanders they never went with this narrative with regard to the the attempted attacks on she's in college but they are going to go full scale with these attacks on President Trump's oh here's an end\nThank you know tons targets in the Clinton is President Trump has to match people and then those people get ... ... ... you know what we do in politics we attacked people on the other side and their and their ideas\nI keep on the other side all the time now I mean I'm calling for a bombing of their house of course not and people what's happening yeah mine are not calling for bombing of my ... that's not a thing but here's Gloria border blame them from you know\nHow do we know that you don't know that\nHe doesn't know that because he doesn't know thing everybody assumes the worst on behalf of everybody else and instead of saying there's a difference between he'd political rhetoric and violent political rhetoric we just jump in with both feet the Democrats are even worse than the media on this because the Democrats are absolutely hypocritical and I'm sure so Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer put out a statement\nOn this uh on on the attempted bombing and here is what they said this emily's an audio recording over the water\nShe says Senate minority leader Senator Chuck Schumer and house minority leader\nNancy Pelosi lashed out at president Donald Trump in a statement released Wednesday afternoon a pair jointly condemned the statement from the president you should earlier in the day expressing his concerns over a series of suspected explosive devices sent a prominent Democrat they take we listened with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people\nAnd that is our first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reversed as his statements that can do an act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed report the neo Nazis until the\nWhen in Charlottesville his supporters of rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world murder of their own citizens and our friends in the free press as the enemy of the people\nNow I think President Trump's in a lot about stuff how 'bout that unclear about this but you're actually going to blame him for the bombings ... this is what you're going to do now\nI can remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just had a year and a half ago who was asked about Steve ... nearly being shot to death he almost died okay who's in critical condition he almost died\nIt's a miracle that he let his Nancy Pelosi saying how dare you blame us or Bernie Sanders for heated rhetoric that could have been connected with the guy going on to a baseball field and shouting as he gunned down members of Congress\nAbout health care and food is doing he was he was standing there screaming about health care while I'm proud of murder members of Congress there was Nancy Pelosi's response time she was right then she's not right now what's the difference now she gets to target right winners\nHave do they say such a thing how dare they are so sick individual does something just rip them all and it was horrible what he did hateful\nBut for them to all the sudden they sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before\nIt's just it's it's just amazing so she's worse I mean I Wonder what changed outlook changed his who was going to get one that is what change so there is no such thing as a sword that cuts both ways all we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of ... my blood on one end directed toward you and sharp on the other end directed toward your opponent\nYou don't recognize that what we're actually holding as a sort of use it on your opponent can easily be turned back on you every sort has to edges\nBut according to the left it's just the hatchet and you can bury it in between the shoulder blades have your political opponents for the Clinton does the same thing so we former first lady senator presidential candidate she says listen as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nSaying well that's a person I'm great\nAs an American I'm worried I worry about the direction of our country\nI worry about what kind of rural will be waiting for them\nAgers and young adults and beyond\nOkay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton saying this our top aide fully brains who is really one most vicious people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of this\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his um vitriol\nOkay so next time somebody who's a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office or invaded Fox News studio then I guess we can blame Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil what the other side\nBecause we're generally what the date today today is the twenty fifth okay so we're generally twenty four ... fourteen days ago Fifteen days ago for the Clinton said that\n\nYou cannot be liberal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican seen to\nRecognize and respect strength\nEverybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap will get to the fullest of the crap\nIn just one second but first let's talk about what you do you get ready every evening I loved the dollar shave has everything I Need to look feeling smell my best ... even more is the fact I never have to go to a store here isn't got stores have to wait in line you have to find the product you have to deal with humans\nYes he doesn't make any of those things they deliver everything I Need right to my door and they keep me fully stocked and what I use I never run out here is healthy\nDollar shave has everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for the vet you covered head to toe\nHair products skin face you name it they've got it and they have a new program where they automatically just stopped up on the product you use you to tell me what you want when you want it and she was right at your door or a month to month once every six months I particularly like the ... the wasteful and keeps my skin\nSilky mood I also really enjoy their black pepper and stage shampoos really smells good plus with their hands some discount the more you by the more you said right now we've got a bunch of stars that you can five for five bucks like they're all haircut after that restock box ships regular size product of the regular price\nSo what are you waiting for get your start except for just five bucks right now a dollar shave club dot com slash been that's dollar shave club dot com slash then again\n... everyone if oh crap including\nAndrew Cuomo and bill de Blasio both of them came out and they said listen we have to turn down the temperature in this country and it has to start at the top weird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying the police officers were just shooting black people for no reason\nAnd I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York so that everyone who disagrees with him on policy should get out of state that is not an exaggeration he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage and his views on social issues\nLet me explain if you are sitting around today than going it's always the rhetoric on the other side of this problem\nBy freaking near ... everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here everybody does\nAnd that also means that blaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence is leading to a worse country\nIt's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence when they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric they're actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you are eating everything up you're suggesting the other side is so evil at the very ... of their ideas is likely to lead to death and destruction\nThat isn't that that's an an American perspective on American\nBernie Sanders' can say whatever the hell he wants no matter how wrong he is and I must he's actively saying go shoot people on the congressional baseball field that is not his fault and Donald Trump can say whatever he wants\nAnd you don't have to like it or whatever Donald Trump says he has the right to say that's a long and she's not saying go beat up somebody right now go bomb some place right now\nIf I found weary of all of us just because I Am weary of all this really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation we're gonna have to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does a crazy thing\nOr enough is enough folks really really ... let's stop making the country worst place and other news\nNBC News is actively hyping this Megan Kelly blackface thing and it's really stupid it's really stupid speaking of stupidity in politics so Megan Kelly we talked about the link yesterday Megan Kelly said on the show that she doesn't really understand why this woman who was in the real housewives of whatever why this woman\nWas in trouble for dressing up as Diana Ross at a party because when she was a kid people use the dark and their skin for Halloween costumes and wasn't a big deal and a bunch of folks had well blackface has a long and in glorious history in the United states that's insensitive should you know what I learned something today that's insensitive I was wrong\nThat seems like after the end of the story does anyone really believes making Kelly's approval vicious are racist they don't actually believe that\nOf course nobody believes that nobody actually believed that Megan Kelly thinks black people are inferior genetically that black people are worse like people are morally culpable at a higher level than white people or any of that no one actually believed that at NBC and it just shows you that capitalism when used by bad people\nYou know is not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they've tried to push making Kelly into a box that is not properly fitted for Megan Kelly name Kelly is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question her she's a former lawyer and prosecutor that is where her role as best\nThey try to fit her into the Katie Couric walk walk morning news routine and that didn't work for them and so the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an end\nAnd money and now they're trying to push out the door how are they doing that by ... by actively stoking racial resentment in the United states\nAnd its ugly stuff NBC News is now saying they're going to take the episodes of making the show this week and if they're going to seek to terminate her contract based on her saying that she didn't understand what the big deal was about somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume\nDoes anyone really believe that the NBC bras is really upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that this was actually vicious brutal KKK style racism they would actually think that no of course not to just NBC News trying to stoke racial resentment for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nAnd they the head of NBC News Andy lack the openly ... into Kelly after she apologized she apologized and then lack that well there is no other way to put this but I condemned those remarks there is no place on our air in the workplace for them very unfortunate and then Lester Holt cover her comments on NBC nightly news\nAnd says NBC decided to eat their own by going after making Kelly it's amazing how convenient that it and no one on CNN criticizes CNN nobody on NBC News criticizes NBC News unless they're preparing your shop somebody up and throw them in the wood chipper\nThat seems the most likely outcome at this point\nYou know all of that has led people on the rights just that maybe this latest bomb scare in some sort of democratic attempts to gin up voter rage just before the election but\nAgain in the absence of evidence I'm not going to go there and I don't think anybody else to do that either we should not be moving based on\nYeah Evan inflict allegations at this point I'm perfectly fine with waiting another twenty four hours to find out what the hell is going on and I think everybody else should be too if you want to have a stronger and better country we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest Hossam el that this is the bench here of\n[noise]\nNationwide

Steiner Walters evening he has a Fox News digital politics editor who put together a quite a story some people may look at the populism phenomenon and think it starts with Donald Trump ended the most assuredly does not\nWe're going to take a look at just the history there in what Chris was put together every man a king a short colorful history of American populace and it's published by a twelve and Chris thank you for joining us tonight well\nIt certainly my pleasure thank you for having me\nAbsolutely let's start with just where you would start that is to say at what point did you say we had a political leader who could be defined as a populist\nWell the thing about it this way in American history even before there was a country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution\nThere were people who felt perfectly convinced absolutely sure that there were elites who work crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe wealthy planners in Virginia\nWere conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism in the American tradition where we are talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population\nThat feels like they have been cheated or that they have been longer that their interests are being worked against often and in the various way\nOr the bankers the elites they whomever a and populism when we have outbursts when we have a ruptured ... of popular sentiment in the United states it's when that constituents he gets to be large enough\nSo you know we all read the federalist papers that everybody knows Alexander Hamilton because of the play and all of that stuff\nRoosevelt said at the time um this that there was populism on the right\nUh uh Douglas MacArthur who had busted up the bonus army these were a pensioners from the first World War who are owed a bonus that had been approved by Congress from the first World War and during the depths of the depression they showed up on Mars in Washington they marched on Washington and then they set up a tent city on the other side of the Anacostia River from where I'm sitting right now\nAnd a MacArthur huh he was a veteran of the first World War rainbow division highly decorated keyword tanks into\nThis camp and there was a reactionary hard line on the right there was a reactionary we've got to deal with this and these things but Roosevelt biggest concern when he when he called\nA Huey Long and Douglas McArthur the two most dangerous man in America he was talking about those twin threats that you describe about the about the reactionary is on the right but his biggest concern was Huey Long and hard core social is on the left\nWith is more to come Christopher

about a century now from Jackson as you right here is Christopher walls and the ...\nIn the summer of Nineteen thirty five Huey Long was the sensation that is an understatement [laughter]\nHe was a while to man he was a wild thing and uh what's interesting is he had he had run for the United States Senate\nA as a staunch basically to re consolidate power in Louisiana and his intention was that he would try to hold the governorship in the Senate seat at the same time he wanted the legislature he was a lame duck and the legislature was being a was starting to a pale\nUh at the demands of the king fish the emperor of Louisiana all of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have some opinions and he did not like that\nSo he ran he figured if he ran statewide for that Senate seat he could show his great power\nAnd he did but then he found out he couldn't do both so he wins but doesn't go ... feet waiting to Nineteen thirty two but he doesn't go serve\nUntil eventually constitutional crisis he uh has called out the state National Guard\nOr to prevent the lieutenant governor from take the oath of office he said but eventually he finds a a more accommodating Lieutenant General\nUh our our lieutenant governor who will be applying to a vessel for the will of the king fish and then he we figure she has to go to Washington so he gets here and he finds out he can whip these people just as easily as he whipped him down in Baton Rouge\nAnd that the reporters here are just like the reporters they're desperate for good copy desperate for wild stories or he finds out that the same levers of power that worked there work here and\nHe went right to work in in the course of very little time he found himself a absolute sensation a national political figure and people couldn't get enough of it\nHere is a ... speech just one excerpt from Huey Long talking to his fellow senators a mob is coming here and six months to hang the mighty fiber you damn scoundrels my mom decided whether the stick here whether you go out and lead them [laughter] well okay [laughter]\nThis is undecided over ... undecided [laughter]\nNow than there came a time when he became a something of a sensation about possibly challenging Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency what happened at this point of uh of him grasping for the ultimate political power\nThink about the the context in Nineteen thirty six I'm there were a lot of people who thought that the American system of government probably that the smaller Republicanism wasn't gonna work um that what was happening in Europe was maybe a better solution um the depression had proven intractable\nAnd you have national social national socialism in Germany or you have fascism in Italy and Spain you have a strong argument being made here\nIncluding in it with a bunch of American adherents people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh uh Joe Kennedy and others who said hey you know maybe we ought to pay attention to this maybe this is a more modern scientific way to approach things\nUh and the moment we we take for granted our our institutions are weak now relative to how they were\nSay fifty years ago but we it's hard for us to grasp you know on the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed the American Nazi Party cling two hundred thousand members are a lot of the things and norms that we take for granted today in the head of the great depression or not\nThat was not that was not everybody was an agreement that the American system was the best and wrong you know this very vivid apostle this this with this wild man who had an amazing gift for oratory and amazing gift for facts and figures could talk his way out of anything a and had developed because\nThe poor people in America so many poor people in America felt that he was one of them in understood their plight\nUm it it was happening um whether or not he was really getting challenger as well I'm thirty six I don't know um he had a being Huey Long he had lied about it and he had talked about it and several different ways depending on who he was talking to\nBut whether or not he was going to challenge the threat that he could toppled Huey Long and when\nAnd when and went on a platform or that he can topple Roosevelt and when and do so on a platform that basically called for repealing the American system that it was time that we had something more like a dictator who had the power to deal with entrenched interests who were he said we're harming the common people\nHow did he die [laughter] well I I Would say I would say absolutely um he was killed so a on a white as he was sort of reaching the peak or in August of thirty five is his big it he he is swinging for the fences\nUm but then he has to go back to Louisiana\nTo finish up some work he's got to go back and tell the legislature what to do tell his ... what to do and straighten some things out and he's got one judge who is a real problem for him

I can remember the last roller coaster I was all this was at a at Opry land as I recall and they have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred sixty degree\nI think it's kind of like a model railroad I'm sure that our gifts to be reviewed go those what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second\nYou know what ride that was\nYes I Do actually I was one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew which pays yeah he's just\nGave you exactly on that that was um ... I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little uh the one that one little area but\nYes I'm very familiar with it and uh uh in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course Opry land was a great place to attach to put an amusement park right next to\nThe ... hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was a how shall I put an exhilarating\nUh I mostly do it definitely woke me up I remember that that uh we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers are over there with me and uh I guess I Would you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and uh\nIt woke me up Yes sir [laughter] there'd be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did [laughter]\nIt was actually called the ... can involve the fire is if I ...\nOh yeah all that uh well anyway I put it this way it did lead me say this was off will just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as a as a gift to the park I got to ride for free okay that's fine but I paid to do it again no not really but then again of course that's a that's just me what are some of the place was out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\nPete tribute go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually uh uh in I'm In law actually started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that come to mine of course the universal studios\nAh which is their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking\nDead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse in\nA place where are you going to be totally scared and and ah you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World\nAnd Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and off for the kids and of course you got the ... do you uh Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing uh some of the better\nOnes are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations have the ...\nWhich is your cleric classic scare zones all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the ... the the sewer soles in er which is layer and in places like that um\nAnd of course the the point has got hollow ah weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or fast that that goes on there are ... high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags are and are they really are they really get into this big time uh I mean I even the chain stores\nSound extremely we'll plus even changed the names of the rides sometimes\nUh for example over its heroines a which is a Carol wins in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street\nUh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows and zombies in and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this or and or they're just a you know the rise are still open\nWhether it's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... that's ... basically Anaheim all we mentioned the fight fast in the phantom lights over Kenny would ah how screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens\nAre and of course heroines in Mickey's not so scary Halloween all these places that was mentioned plus others\nUm during the day you know during the day it really is it like that\nOr it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and ... away and that's pretty much or most of these places go if you if you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zones their actual zones\nWhere you'll you know you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the maze is and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will or will tell you with it if they're easily march where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are are just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or or having a kid have a traumatic experience with that\nSort of the way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer\n... absolutely I mean that's uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college in in a a there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know ... they're probably not going to try to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gals\nOr or something along those lines though you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know what if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I like uh he's amusement parks and what they do and how they train people\nIn order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many uh and again there are there is there a scare zones and there are ... ah you know if you're going into a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nAnd what are we going back and take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment\n\nFiber optics move crazy amounts of data even crazier speeds and find a spider rise in is the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nFiles that connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...\nWhether the fast food or actual sit down restaurants or you will find them at the amusement parks because it's a way for the entire family to actually get together\nAnd enjoy a day I mean even the older people uh you've got scooters that can go around with the scooter is now have to worry about the walking you know the miles if they stay for miles\nOn average that you would at an amusement park\nSo I think that's one of the things that was really really intelligent it was that a person not just geared for kids anymore they're good for all family members and that's why they do so well\nStay with us more to compete tribute go an expert on travel and amusement parks and look at some things besides the the bazaar the frightening ...

write to uh to entertain ourselves to what extent Pete tribute go have we become jaded and all of this that is to say uh you have to constantly come up with new things that the the been there done that syndrome is that something that plagues the people who who run the thrill rides\nWell that's the that's the key I mean going back to the Y. Bosch animal that you rode over a um I guess I have to be at least Thirty years ago in order to to do that or you know from now take here um you know people that love\nTo ride roller coasters or or or get you know that that that Russia or whatever you want to call it um they want well of course they're going to go higher they want to go faster or and the manufacturers have a real problem because you want to keep your writers conscious during the entire ride in\n[laughter] so so you really have to to walk the line and of course with computer technology now uh it's actually a lot better know how many how much G. force or how many G forces body can take\nNot a pilot somebody who's experienced and trained to do that and in good physical shape so that's the big key is to be able to make it stimulating exciting at the same time but not a you know have any problems or have any negative effects that are that occur that's wise simulation rides\nIt's very big these days and what I mean by that is the track never actually removes\nWhat happens is is you actually have you with a three D. or forty glasses or you actually sit in in a compartment or that looks like it's actually moving for example storing is a classic example over at Disney where you think you're actually on hang glider and and being a pilot I can tell you it looks very real\nOr that this is all happening so the simulation right take a much smaller footprint there are a little less money or but at the same time you can get that same impression and if you don't like the right just close your eyes and it pretty much all goes away\nDid restrict uh if you buy them you've never experienced these are these virtual environments that they can be pretty intense I I have a chance to do that a number of years ago and I can only imagine how much a better they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of these thrill rides a emulate a a real life version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters and what about video games\nWell not necessarily video games because I'm their life since then and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but you didn't mention ah like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example or different events like ... of course the movie you'll find that a universal studios\nBut as far as an actual mimic it does mimic what goes on in fact nowadays the big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense\nWhat you do is you put on the board the glasses and they cover your entire face a wire going through a small a roller coaster and feeling the wind and the reason to your face\nOr what you're getting is you're actually getting a simulation ride or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour it goes up and down maybe a little bit\nIs now more intense or so that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from ... in Dallas on the jumbo have showed one eight six six five oh Jim bow and our guest Peter tribute go Hi Rita\nHi I just wanted to share something with you uh we're now in the last week of the great month long state fair Texas and my daughter took her four year old grandson to the affair and she told me that our state fair now as\nAn information desk or they put a bracelet on the child\nWhich the child can I take off with the child's name and the parents' phone number and it's on the inside the bracelet so that someone could not come up and pretend they know that child and say Oh hi Tammy because of the names on the inside but if a child gets lost\nThen it's easy to find their parent company then\nThat's an interesting thought utterly of to say the least uh and encouraging one of the safety in general a tribute goes that some people it's practiced and all of these are major theme parks and ah and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park is directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidents of problems that occurred at a particular place a again you very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen\nIt'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News or one of the major networks because it becomes a big news kind of like a plane crash so it doesn't happen very often security has been a stepped up especially at places like ah you know it's a Six Flags or Disney\nThe Cedar Fair or they do that on purpose because obviously we want them to everybody wants to have a a a good outcome now the the carnivals and the fares that the state fairs are starting to come on board with the same", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "26"}
