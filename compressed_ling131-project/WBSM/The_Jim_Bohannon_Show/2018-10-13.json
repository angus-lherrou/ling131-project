House\nReally again in that room Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky knee pads in\nThe room a step in the real thing it's an assault on the White House and Kanye West president has filed the oval office [laughter] she has\nWhile I'm doing this for everybody who is watching us or turn the volume down\nYou can put it back up again\nThat but I think we had a thoughtful play by play and political and now says you're not because that was in his fault on our White House we're\nNot we're not a ... you began to analyze some of that stuff that was said I'm as we warned you at the top a little bit of profanity we there was actually more than you heard we we were able to bleach some of it out [noise] uh but there was a ton of it did make it in there\nOkay mama [laughter] I Wonder ... al ... is just so terrible is just so awful I mean I Can't believe anything like that has ever happened at the White House flashback just a few years Snoop Dogg went to the White House you know the great intellectuals Snoop Dogg\nHe was the or snoop lion or whatever he calls himself these days whatever variety of animal from the animal kingdom he calls himself to follow snoop\nOkay just jobs at the White House and you know when he died at the White House here Snoop Dogg talking about how he spoke at the White House and everyone in the media thought this was hilarious\nAnd did you and when you've got to high before the White House did you also then smoke it up a little bit in the bathroom when you were there I was trying to get to you and say gee yes yes I Do you and nobody and no and I met them what you meant the [laughter] get him splitting one little some some [laughter]\nAnd it was hilarious and funny and\nI thought oh my God it's not because Obama president\nAnd then as soon as I was not president know started off as just or not this is an office where only great things have happened this office you know great presidents had he was about FDR they sat in his office ... notes in his office\nI keep coming back to that because again if you're talking about the filing the oval office there they level beyond having Kanye West there and so the media again ignoring the fact the bronco bomb was ever present I Love Mr oh my God how could somehow not with celebrity ... rock to the White House\nThere was a picture of Jay Z and Beyonce in the situation room one case you can't see the photo is a picture\nAnd beyond say in the situation room and this was just all fun and games was just fun and games because come on dad Jay Z and Beyonce they're great can't go have a clean they come on\nIt's all fun when it was about it and it was that it was Tanya going to the White House and it was just terrible and then you remember that's remember comment on that you remember common is a rapper\nWho has in the past ... song in favor of a Scottish record an actual terrorist an actual terrorists\nOr there he was in the White House but don't worry it's in the fall of the White House in any way to have these folks you you know comedy wrapped about supporting terrorism in the White House ... was there and ... said nice things in or a magazine that was what was really bad here as common during the Obama administration\nIt's an honor to be here in the White House library the tiny Desk Concert series has tried to give voice to people who have something to say in a culture we move our culture forward do amazing stuff and in that spirit and pure music presents comments and\nOh yeah then again this was a White House Obama's White House you want to talk about\nIs the dirty little secret about Obama Obama was just much more celebrity driven the Donald Trump everybody says oh his liberty President Trump Obama was the first celebrity president had no credentials when he became president he turned the White House into basically a revolving door of celebrities you get during ... he did a fundraiser\nRe Jay is most famous for having done a sex tape with Ken ... who's currently Kanye West wife so calling us is married to come crashing come crashing rose to prominence often on the back no pun intended of the rage a sex tape\nApril Ryan went for a comment on the ... visit to the White House to the guy who stripped ... wife on tape before she knew cognac\nAll class members in the media just all class here is April mind doing that retain\nA text messaging with re Jay or you know who ... he's\nHe was once close with Kim car Daschle and he said I think that is great a great opportunity for young black entrepreneur is an artist to talk one on one with the president's the United states of America and he goes on to say this but in watching the pain from CNN he did say he's a little concerned um there is a concern right now\nOkay reaching out to the ex lover of a guy's wife for comment\nIs just I mean is it that is not even beyond the bounds of journalistic ethics that's beyond the bounds of ethics period is just beyond that and it's crazy it's crazy why in the world would you think that regime has anything unique to offer to the situation except the one slept with Kim ... that's\nHow is that even on CNN CNN calling for for news network and do that sort of thing\nThat's just garbage is just average I think it's even worse than that so Don Lemon who is a disgrace to the name of objective journalism it's amazing like there are people who I think tried to be objective on CNN I said before I think Jake Tapper very often tries to be objective and tries to actually do his job done one that has has forsaken all\nRelationship with objectivity but still somehow calls himself an objective news reporter not an opinion journalists serious John Lennon\nIn invoking Kanye West dead mother to attack him\nHis dead mother to attack him don't worry this is just journalism guys so much and journalism being shown much reporting happening right here\nThis was an embarrassment\nConyers mother is rolling over in her grave I spoke to one of her friends who they are expected with one of her friends today from Chicago joined us rooms are used to live there I Know\nShe's gone to would be what would be embarrassed by this\nThat an okay thing is that something that we're doing now are a lot of technical dead relatives use their dead relatives to attack them not their dead relatives in the sense that like their dead relatives did something wrong but in the sense that ain't dead relatives who you didn't know and know nothing about and had a relationship with this man that she would be ashamed of him\nThat should be ashamed of Kanye West like\nThat this was ... I'm Sorry this is just sick and the media is over ... reaction to the fact that Kanye West shows up in the White House is indicative of a couple of different things one is indicative of the fact that when a black person says they like President Trump\n... the media have no one like a black person is that they like President Trump no one because they have violated the tenets of intersection Audi which suggest that we all think like our group we all think like our ethnic group so if you break away from that ethnic group or you break away from that sexual group that you're a gay person who likes Trump or you're a woman who likes Trump is there any of those things than you are at trader\nOr we saw this with all the women who supported Brett Kavanaugh they were they were sex traders they've just given into the patriarchy they internalize The Handmaid's tale and now we see this with Connie what's he's a black guy who's really white on the inside he's an Oreo right on these black on the outside the white on the inside he's he's in the sunken place\nAs people are now saying rented it and that sort of stuff\nIs deeply race but that's why the left is is so that was ... because he breaks two of their rules one he's a black men sports from not allowed\nTo use the celebrities support strong also not all out for people to understand how much from the hate in Hollywood you have to understand\nIn Hollywood if you even express it remotely right wing opinion you will never work again never work again I said before I have celebrities listen to show their major April I'm not talking to a celebrity I'm Talking a plot celebrities who listen to this show and I visited with some of them I've had lunch or breakfast people come into this office were quite famous\nAnd I always tell them do not mentioned that you have been here if you wish to work in the town\nBecause of biased in Hollywood is so extreme that it doesn't matter you're seizing celebrity if you said even associated with me and I didn't vote for Trump than twenty six saying if you say that you associated with me just a mainstream conservative was pretty reasonable\nAnd that is enough to lose your job like that actually happened out here with mark and plus you just got destroyed read mark and plus\nThe guy who directed wild wild country on Netflix and he's done a bunch of other issues on the ... the Mindy project he's in a bunch of other stuff he came in here because he wanted to get a pro gun opinion from somebody for his new movie and so he came in and I gave them like in an hour and a half and I sent him don't tell anyone you've been here because you do it will blow back on you\nAnd then he foolishly went on Twitter and said I was a nice guy and it ended his world\nHe was attacked so harshly on Twitter he deleted this week and then put it between apologizing for ever having tweeted that I was a nice guy\nApologizing for that that's how it works in Hollywood county has broken tools a black man and he's extraordinarily famous and if you are a black extraordinarily famous person you are not allowed to be pro Trump and you're not allowed to be conservative it anyway you have to total liberal line\nAnd you wonder why you're saying is great shock and dismay Taylor Swift came out and embrace the Democratic party because if you do not embrace the Democratic party and you are a celebrity they will ... down\nAnd we on the right job for a long time about the fact that that Taylor Swift and not said anything politically because what's going on her to say something politically

actually has a shot at breaking out of the five to ten percent box Republicans have been in in the black community for a long time and that's because as it turns out that I talked about yesterday\nMinorities are not wedded to the ... social justice warrior version of politics Democratic Party wants to embrace ... showing that right now and that is good because there is an important signaling element to the belief that it's okay to break out of the box\nThat when you stand the Overton window which is what ... is doing right now than people have the ability to think more freely more publicly that's quite a good thing and I think we should be grateful to kind of you for that even if we don't like the celebrity politics in which we are engaged and even if we think that all of this\nYou do but there are so we'll we'll talk about all that probably a little more next week and we'll talk about it our Fox News election special that is coming up our final episode on Sunday at

you'll find is a jumbo\nHad a show dot com and you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox\nAs though we are taking a look tonight at you for coming midterm elections and some of the issues that exist out there in that particular among that group among the electorate which since they first got the vote has been the least likely to vote\nAnd that is to say the millennials are and the those younger than that particularly the Gen x rays and people of of that nature\nWill find out that the Y. or this or this is\nA one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guests are David the Raleigh is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and publisher of the independent review David good evening\nGood either at the gym and ah let's start out by taking a look at a couple of projects that you have a a instituted here are the love God love and the catalyst what are these\nWell I'm a few years ago we created a video series on YouTube a target millennials called love of it's a satire of its on liberty but it's a satire of big government\nAnd what triggered this um is the fact that millennials are voted overwhelmingly both times for Obama or as you said didn't vote\nAnd the basic view that they had was the government's going to take care of them and uh the Democrats' progressive and so forth believe they had this generation and their hip pocket\nBut they wanted a guarantee sort of lock it in but they keep on voting them an office and the way they're going to do that was Obamacare get the kids to enroll\nAnd look I'll become dependent on the coupon voting a sin and um that was the plan but something happened on the way which they didn't expect which was you may remember that when the Obamacare website came on line it didn't work\nEven though Sanders has never said anything critical Venezuela Cuba or the former Soviet Bloc or North Korea what what he says well we need to look at the Nordic countries the Scandinavian countries like Denmark Sweden and Norway\nAnd the claim is that these are socialist countries and they were well and people are prospering and there's a higher standard of living and so on the problem though is that\nThe all three of these countries um basically the the property that exists the assets are owned a overwhelmingly it privately about Seventy five percent of the wealth in all three of these countries is owned privately and the economy generally speaking our market based economy\nVery much so in fact is we are we're overdue for a break which we will take you are but we need to emphasize something the only way\nThat the Scandinavian countries could ever afford the extremely expensive cradle to grave kind of coverage that they have is by having rope bust\nPrivate sectors that I mean private sectors that are are far more open and free of regulation than ours are I mean ... that's something that people don't realize that they think that this is just some giants duck\nA socialist a would be paradise well some of the programs were socialistic but the economy is very private sector or they couldn't afford it and we're going to come back and talk some more what a fascinating idea of finally reaching people who\nHave do a great extent withdrawn from the system I mean they they still have complained but they don't seem to know how to articulate them or to uh to make choices in this in this context will come back with more from David Thoreau again his website independent dot org back in a moment\nFrom a ... like a horror in theory

talked to farmers we know a thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nAnd you're right and I finally ... parks on an airplane every state\nYoung voters that is the group which has consistently election in an election out\nNotch voted or they vote but the the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do what I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard\nBut uh it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people have an option of this country and if you don't use that that uh\nFranchise or you'd be able to exercise your franchise we have trouble nobody likes of flabby franchise\n[noise] yeah I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the [noise] the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nYeah but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't get involved in the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well whose fault is it that you're powerless\nI Know and they're part of it also is the science of it they don't they don't have civic education they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live and\nWhere do I mean if I did I Know and that ...\nBecause of the failure of the of the ... the school system um and that's one you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth\nUm which I think it is definitely in the ascendant but it isn't reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on\nThe hook for them being the questions they were asking and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects those guys so to speak and the uh so the commanding heights so the culture and they no longer trusted\nThe political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but\nUh in their case especially now I'm millennials have left for college and are starting careers\nAnd a family is and so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this so they're look there's you know they're even more interested in answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nUh creating the series and creating catalyst and so on so our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and to give you an idea that percentage of of ownership I'm In this country is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to say a country like China China is just slightly lower than the north in order to countries and then of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just to give me a further idea if your rank the um\nThe levels of private wells\nI'm I'm like country or it turns out that Denmark has twelfth\nSwitzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth I'm North Korea is at the bottom a hundred and eighty us but the U.S is Eighteenth so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with David throw us founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute the website independent dot org you learn more about these series the love of\nThe catalyst one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number and we'll be back with more liberal hand the show in just a moment\n\n\nYou think you know Saturday Night live movies so far there have been eleven blues brothers Wayne's World cone heads Waynesville too it's fat Stewart says his family whose brothers two thousand an editor rocks very superstar the ladies' man Emma Gruber\nOn average SNL movies score forty percent of rotten tomatoes blues brothers has the highest scoring SNL movie with a certified fresh rating of eighty seven percent and it's ... has a rotten rating of zero percent [noise]\nUm and uh the other words on the one hand they've been miss educated to understand history and the and the nature of an economy and so forth and the other hand they're intrigued by the idea of of enterprise and innovation\nUm and uh so we think that all those kinds of factors should be part of the communication strategy for this generation\nAnd those questions are not that different from other people around the world um who come from different cultures how do you make the ideas of liberty relevant and compelling for people\nSo the the fact that millennials um are receptive in the way we're discussing um and we understand how they've been miss educated they're misguided in interpreting certain things for example\nI'm Lynn does have been taught that the great recession in a two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market\nAnd even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government\nMore in centered by the government so what do you have all realize that these kinds of um iconic examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about\nPolitical authority is even more justified it makes a huge difference in their receptive to the to the idea of liberty\nWill come back with the more with our guests David the row again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and we're looking at in

six I find it very encouraging that are as such programs as ah the love go into the catalyst are out there and reaching out I ah\nI consider myself to be reasonably well informed on what's happening in this this country\nA I had never heard of these programs I guess it's a sign that maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now a or is it just a sign of how stratified we are that there are very few\nExperiences in common that the transcend the generations in this country that something like this could be happening I I've long but it's taken for granted for example David by stand in the supermarket checkout line that the uh\nThe names that are splashed across the tabloids first names only that I don't know who any of the bar anymore but I Would have hoped I ever would have heard something about this before now\nWell it is part of it is that we're we're going through channels that are not part of the traditional media and so it's really a ... I I wouldn't call it a subversive but it's it's certainly\nA outflank in the traditional media are it is it is true however the for the first season we had something around a hundred and one million views in the media and John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love of and\nThere are many columnist wrote about it many other places are and of course yourself taking the time um it's something that is in is it it's in the sentence and I think that's the good news is if if it was something that wasn't getting traction and I think we'd have to reconsider\nAmen to that we have a call from ... New York city who joins us now good evening Ben\nHow're you doing guys I'm actually in New York City I'm On Long Island\nClose enough okay go ahead\nWell I don't really have a question I just wanted to say that I think you're you're going a little bit under any age category here with uh the home with the millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I guess that puts me at like the higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more as generation X\nBecause I grew up around people that you know where\nThe older generation that are now about forty and I identify more as generation X then and generation y which became a so called millennial by anybody that's an undergrad in college right now is younger than a millennial according to that\nThat statement aired they'd be like Generation Z those right he's a new one that younger than that there are about twenty three like my youngest brother would be at the ... the youngest of the millennials and he's already graduated college and have the job so you're you're\nYou're absolutely right and you are a millennial you're actually in the the upper half tier of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now\nUm and of course these categories are\nImprecise you know there there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them\nAnd that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger people as well so when we developed this this program the original season one was targeting primarily college age and through young adults\nUm declares the second season is primarily focusing on early career is as the millennial um\nGroup sort of passes through the demography ah so I think that it's a it's a very much as a way you're describing on one thing I should also point out this goes back to the gym was mentioning\nPar with with the MVPs and a dollar off it might be dot com forward slash streaming or click now only lengthy America's some shock [noise]\nIt's just by by Iraqi up oriented firehouse subs introducing the new firehouse ...\nYou think you know TV British installment of TV trivia here's some things you may not have known about the matrix you took the red do\nYou stay in wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole\nTo matrix grossed over four hundred and sixty million dollars worldwide and one for Academy Awards including visual effects in twenties well it was added to the national\nRegistry for preservation by the library of Congress directing ... first choice to deal with Johnny Depp Will Smith turned down the role in order to make blah blah west Nicholas cage Brad Pitt in doubt Kilmer also turned down the road\nShow me in Greek mythology more uses the God of dreams which has the vast\nLaurence Fishburne debase performance on the character Murphy is in the game and sandman comics Gary Oldman and Samuel L.

shot I recorded on my TV that the freeways as Chicago or just around brain dominance ... false secondly\nYour guests talk at a book about the successors to appalled I mainly mainly talking about the so called off in the ... and how they were used they were they were they were successful you have a trade off as just for the political system in Chicago she was just kind of cover up for a\nA criminal gets cut your yes yeah quite as far as\nI dare say they can attack a Lowe's All right uh I was not aware of the free masons played any particular role in this at all but uh you tell me gentleman\nWell probably ... indirectly and that to the business community would have been a made up of many free masons and who who joined together to buy as Brad mentioned to try to take\nA bone down uh the reason was not as altruistic as you might think because ... was a terrible public relations disaster for the city or he he was a gangster who who love publicity who wanted to be a liked\nWhile meanwhile the the people like a Frank ... who was actually named Frank NATO and others on on mob or are they went down in a more traditional business role and that that kind of fit in with what the gentleman earlier asked about the the business aspect of this the\nAh the the parallel and even the uh the event the eventual and merging into legitimate legitimate business\nUh and I think to to touch on on the other question the gym kinda mob for example all all of those people pretty much grew out of the old Capone mob you have people\nYou have people growing up they they started as drivers or their enforcers are there going around picking up money and collecting\nAnd a lot of these people are are thugs is young young man and then they grow into\nA you know they grow into positions of power ah it was pretty insulated even though Capone was well known for not being ethnically pure ... you know he had he had all kinds of\nEthnic backgrounds and the people that that
