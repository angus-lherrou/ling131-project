FM airwaves however we're able to take over\nNot only the spooky TV it's spooky south coast dot com but we're also able to take over the W. B. S. M. app stream and were able to kick that out to the paranormal radiolab which is how you're going to be able to listen to us every week going forward if you are listening and\nLooking for a way to listen to us you can use the paranormal radiolab were also featured there now regularly so all of our podcast show up under the podcast page on the paranormal radiolab so if you are you making a trip if you're you know just the holiday season people coming up people are gonna be driving to\nRelatives houses and going to be out doing their shopping and driving all over the place and if you want to listen to a great pound them all content that's a a good place to get some of it because there's always something going on on the paranormal radio rap and of course we also re broadcast on the dark matter digital network I'm operating on about\nSeven hours sleep over the last three days because I've been filling in for Dave Schrader on midnight in the desert and then last night not only did we do midnight\nIt was three hours this this is great because I have three hours of having John tiny all to myself he's amazing but then after that we did a pretty lengthy after show with Keith and Michelle really so I went to bed at like six o'clock this morning [laughter]\nSlept for a few hours woke up stayed awake for about forty five minutes fell back asleep and so now I think I'm full of energy and Mountain Dew so ready to go forward with our show and ah and we will of course\nAs we go through the next few months you know we'll we'll have some pretty interesting programs for you but\nComing up in January we're going to have our thirteenth anniversary Nike Thirteen and so we got to do something for that were especially since I I think the anniversary actually falls on the day\nLike the actual day we went on marrying the first time as a Saturday Night so let's say ... or ... generally that January January twenty six thousand six was when we started the show and ah so\nHopefully we can come up with an idea to have some sort of a a get together some sort of a party\nWell if we had we did this for ten years we say we do this for the five hundred shall we haven't done anything so I think it's deserving\nSo the um\nThe the trick though is to find a place where we can do it and then figured out what it is that we want to do I mean do we want to broadcast live from somewhere and we want to take the night often just party we want to try to do both\nYou know like we should do something I was talking with a talking with Jeff the lander um the other night uh and I said to him\nYou know we're coming up on this and we're thinking about doing some sort of a party so I said if we do it you have to come down and he says may fail if I'm Free I'm In Austin so maybe we'll just get a bunch of weirdos together and like and just see what happens but ah and\nI Will hopefully be nice and ... and then on January twenty second yes I'll be I'll be coming home for me I ...\nI'll be the same way that I Am now this is my summer ten is it it hasn't faded right it has not hesitated since the summer so there's that I'm I'm white as a ghost\nA but are also just to let people know tomorrow I was supposed to be having a book signing at the Barnes and noble and dark matter is my first book signing in like eight years because\nPeople still want goes to the south coast I guess yes uh but however the publisher did not get the books over to the bookstore in time so the bookstore emailed me earlier this evening and said that they want to postpone and so we're going to be doing that November Eighteen\nNovember Eighteen from I Believe one to three or they just said they move the date I assume they're going to keep the same time so one to three on Sunday November eight teams\nAt the Barnes and noble and Dartmouth you can come and buy a copy of ghost of the south coast and a and I'll be there to to sign that now leaving All right whatever you want and if you want me to sign somebody else's name instead of my own happy to do it\nSo we need to find my nobody wants that I'm going to just start writing my name and every book in the store like this is mine now this is mine now\nSee that book the standard roast and can you please do that and the main thing I told you about the time that are filled you by the time that I I went in there years ago when the book first came out\nAnd leave their story and don't remember\nSo I walked into walks into Barnes and noble I I've been going around to like every book store doing book signings a there was a borders and wear him at the time they had to come in and do like a little ... and all kinds of stuff\nBut nobody has reached out from the Barnes and noble and I knew they had the book yet because everybody was telling me that that's where they were getting it so and I had done Baker books which now parking lot and uh you know I end is it you know they started turning though they do not I know I don't even\nAnd but um so I just happen to to be down there I think we had gone to the old country buffet which I can say on the radio now because it's close and so we walked down to the bookstore myself and my son who was like seven at the time\nAnd actually\nWhen he was like four or five you love you so are we walked down to the bookstore and we saw the the book on the shelf and and I and I walked over to the manager who was working at the\nUh the death ... and I said hey would you would you like me to sign those books because you know they have like the area of all the science books yeah the local officers and I said would you like me to sign those books no obnoxious Lee I was carrying a sharply in my pocket mhm and I said I'll be happy to sign all those for you\nAnd the management said\nWhy [laughter] I said well I I wrote the book like yeah I'm One of the talk to the store manager about that first\n... okay I'm like do you want to see my ID like\nLook at the photo on the bucks that's me right like do you want me to sign it into a no we're not talking to the store manager I'm like okay well if you want to just you know give them a call in and ask a ... I can wait a no oh probably just wait till the next time she's in\nOkay [laughter] so I guess you don't want me to find the book so or eight years later I think the manager finally got back to her about it it sounds like it [laughter]\nBut thank goodness [laughter] otherwise we're there's a new um there's a new a national sales rep for the history press yet and so uh this person's out they're setting up like book signing for where they ... yeah so it's been a while since I've done one so uh they asked if I was willing to give a little talk\nAnd I said sure I'd love to love to kind of update people on some of the stories from the book some of the stories of the places in the book that we've we've gotten since the book came out because you know eight years of checking out Fort Taber and was ... and all these other places you know there are a lot has changed in that time so right\nWell I'm not as cool as you and I haven't written a book but I Do have some local events coming up [noise]\nUm I'm trying to think of\nNovember twenty fourth I Will be in Rhode Island um ethical lost her senior center I Will be doing a gallery reading um to help raise funds for the sanctions in horrible July Fourth parade in Gloucester I'm\nSo I'm kind of excited about that to help them out and it sounds a\nIt sounds like a fun parade I was like I'm Sorry what are you guys call the sanctions in horrible so [laughter]\nIt's a it's a pretty cool um committee I've been talking back and forth of them so that will be at seven o'clock that night and tickets will be available on H. parade ... bright dot com so come out and see me because that's the last local gallery reading that I have for this year\nAnd I have not plan next year yet so I'm excited to do that and I have teamed up with a Kansas Dalton or for those that are locally\nYou would know her as Maureen hand Cox nice um she's a very talented medium and I'm Scott Porter from the Tennessee rate chasers and haunted Lima travel channel and we're doing a I'm\nA little Christmas giveaway so we're actually raising funds for um families that need help during the holidays so our mission is kinda um to raise as much money as possible a hundred percent I'm of the proceeds will go toward\nProviding families with food and gifts for the holiday season because we don't want to see any children go without and you can go on all of our um\nOur Facebook pages for that or websites um but go onto um Facebooking search the spirit of giving\nAnd we have a girlfriend me page seeking check it out there\nAnd help us get back because it's something that we feel blessed enough to um have experienced in our life and we want to get back as much as possible so\nI tend to only donation gets you a raffle ticket to 'em when a ton of different prices for Kansas and I will be giving Lee a bunch of readings Scott seemingly a lot of memorabilia and different things and merchandise that he has um from the different shows\nAnd his current mentioned nice now we have a bunch of other things that we're getting away too that we haven't announced yet so ... check that out and uh let's see what else they have going on when they keep talking okay no\nPlease stop talking he's known known on the local stuff I'm uncover local for sure now we're just getting the guests on the line or it might be trying to figure it out I just kept on yeah it looks like I'm the I guess they were having trouble with the VIP lines so they're calling it on the regular line so that's what we're\nAnd that's why when\nYour parents and they have any friends or paranormal and so they bought the house\nI'm\n\nI'm\nNot that bad\n\nAnd so how did you to come about to write this together how did you how did you mean how did you decide to work on this project\n[noise] I had my\n\nMom right now\n[laughter]\nNow if\nI had a lot of that\nAnd and so Sandra there is a lot of authors notes for for the different locations where you discuss your visits in you discuss your own experiences that some of these places didn't you use your your abilities near sensitivities as part of the the research for this or or were you kind of just trying to stay\nMore objective is an author rather than being subjective and the experience of the moment\n[laughter]\n\n\n\nAnd and I think that that's a great way to do it in a great way to approach has so that when you're going in there\nYou know you you can time to be objective and you can kind of let the let the story take you as as ... as opposed to going in there was some sort of an expectation I mean obviously some of these places you can't help it because uh a place like Lizzie Borden was you know where are the host and managing you already know the story so there will be some expectations involved in that\nSo I mean you really can't\nDismiss all of that history and all of the stories you've heard that other people have had when you know it's it's become part of the the paranormal lexicon it's hard to kind of say well um\nLet's forget about that because it has to be in the back of your mind Sandra while you're in these places\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd it's it's important to note too that um you know we're talking about some of these different places will get into some of these stories tonight and and talk about some of these locations in in some of the experiences that you have to have you had in these places\nBut it's important enough that it's not like every location summer is a is a building not every location as a house there was a wide variety of different types of locations for people to visit a ... and it's not it's not just limited to the traditional haunted house there's bridges there's roads there's force there's all different kinds of places\n\nHere\n\n\n\nAnd and not every place is um\nYou know not every place is something where the story is so I'm\nReadily available you know some of these places are when you don't know the reason why they're haunted then you can only kind of speculate based on on some of the the research that's been done and some of the experience of the people who've had but there there are places where you just have to say\nA Sandra it's just a weird place like there there might not be a reason for the activity that happens there are just some places just are strange\n\n...\n\nSo some are why do you think that there is a so many different places so many varieties of places are that are haunted why is it that it can be anything from you know the woods to to somebody's home is it because there's\nI mean just that energy is all around the city you feel like there's there's something about New England that has a kind of a what I like to call kind of a stain to it\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I and a big part of that stain or for a lot of these places are unfortunately is that there is tragedy associated with some of these places and and one of the most tragic places Sandra is the the er the mansion in North Adams, Massachusetts which\nI Know that I've had one of my ... most profound paranormal experiences but in the books and you mentioned that you had one of your most profound experiences there as well can you tell us a little bit about that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd and just to take a step back so when you were in that area um ... where where their shadow people were making themselves known so if he would come up the stairs and gone into that area you take a left there's like a a little bit of a hallway and then there's that room that's kind of off to the left that's the room that you were standing in\nAnd you saw the shadows walking behind the Mason kind of coming outside that room so let me tell you that when we were there um\nI had found that area and what I Love about the the whole mansion as you can open a door and find a room that you never knew existed you can spend hours just opening doors and\nSo we were all in that area and we were standing there was probably I don't know maybe it doesn't have us up there at the time and we're standing on either side of that hall watching a procession we'd seen shadow people kind of all night long but as we were standing in that area we watched a procession of shadow people walk between us\nAnd we could make them out three dimensional being standing in front of us and I actually said to somebody right at our our friend Alicia was right across from me and I said to a leash I said are you seeing this right now and of course she nodded yes but as I said that one of the shadows turned and looked at me\nBecause it it hurt me speak and then they just kept walking in their procession like they were going through a ceremony and then later on\nWe were up there with another group and we were at the very far end of the hallway and uh we were just kind of standing there waiting to see if any more shadows would come out and there was one shadow that was down at the end and you know there's that window at the top of the stairs to and and so we're seeing\nSomething kind of moving past that window and we got to kind of going to come down to where we were standing and I eventually was able to stick my hand out and have this shadow person approach me and grabbed my hand and shake my hand\n[noise]\nIt was amazing and then before that you know I was kind of like one of those people that would provoke all the time you know Stephanie can Stephanie can tell you I was not always the nicest guy in the world on investigations\nBut that changed me because when that happened and I just I started crying and I said there really is like a human side to this and and what it is that we're doing and so it was it was probably my most profound experience in the paranormal\nAnd they have to say that was probably a turning point\nFor me was investigation because you'd seen when I had done and you've had your still did your own thing but I wasn't looking at that time that was like the one time I wasn't [noise] and um you came back in just totally changed I think you can only tell me about it so that was pretty cool experience than\nI wasn't the only person that that felt that either as a another investigator Frank actually got his hand shaking too so it wasn't it wasn't like it was just something that I kind of imagine you know what was it was something that definitely really and people the people that were with us could see this thing standing there shaking my hand and it's just it's it's such an amazing place and I'll I'm ...\nBut I Will always have that story even if it looks like we might never get the chance to investigate there again\nMy enemy that at\nAT Kearney\nWow I'm\nGlad that\nYou know I\n\nThink\nThat\nI mean I I I looked into at the time or trying to get a group of investors together to to buy it when it went up for sale and I know the ... office was looking into buying it too but he wanted to put his museum there but then the the city of north Adams is just was giving him so much trouble boat running a museum out of there\nBut um I I I honestly believe that whoever's there if they're not\nInterested in the paranormal if that's not something that they want to pursue a well well owning the property they're there they're going to be sorry because the pound almost I'm going to stay quiet there there'll be the goats they're not going to stay quiet and they're going to have to eventually either open it up or you know you'll see it back on the market sooner rather than later\nI I I\nKnow you also went to some other interesting I mean that's the great thing about notorious New England is because so many of these places we've been to we've had some of our uh some of our Smokey cell Towson legend trips events there are but one of the places that we went to the ... the the only time I've ever been there was actually just for a photo shoot\nFor our evening of ghost stories in New England legends but you visited the precious blood cemetery in sockets\nAnd I think that the story of the Americans to monitor something that I don't think a lot of people are familiar with that story I I don't know who wants to field that question\nAnd um [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] yeah\nAnd uh\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nRight right right well and\n\n\nThen [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\nI'm\nSometimes when you're investigating and you don't have the ability to just speak to them like you can sometimes you got to try some things to get them to to respond to mean sometimes you have to\nTry anyway it's even if you do what I Do but you know there are tens in case something some stuff I Do have a tendency to do that yes [noise] and then you don't listen to me as I said\nLook at this book of all places now this new book all new places I can go and get myself into stuff\n[laughter] new stuff new problems\nAbsolutely I mean one of the places that I was flipping through and I noticed ah that you guys covered and it's something that uh I'm fascinated with\nAnd that's the idea of the betting didn't trying going Bennington, Vermont because we live within the burden the Bermuda going where no one's going to try to get a A N may well be having the wicked waters crews from Boston to Bermuda and people can come and cruise with us to the Bermuda Triangle but\nUh we live in the Bridgewater Triangle a which is you know vastly becoming kind of the second most well known triangle but the ... and try and go have that that distinction for a long time or but it seems like these days nobody really knows summer above the ... the Bennington try and go and what it's all about\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd part of the battle and then a curtain there but that's going on there\nThat\nAre having a figure all of that yet but not just your burial ground in the area that has now\nHave a madman for all\nAnd uh and there are certainly seems to me no yeah no shortage of of different types of stories not only from the Bennington Triangle but just kind of from that whole or from the state of Vermont I mean there's there's a lot of different weird paranormal things that happened there and\nAnd uh they're also seems to be a power to it I say I honestly think like a lot of the stuff that we encounter here in New England\nIt predates even the Native Americans being here I think that there's just something about this land\nThat are that has a has this power to it\nI I think you're right I think I I I Hope that that might become more and more why that might have heard\nOddity I forgot what are the better choice of words that died in the country in\nThe world for him on a lot of\n'em but they don't want to\n\n\n[laughter] no [laughter] I get it\nI don't want to bring down you don't want to break down to\n\nA point I had I had gone down the Appalachian Trail on the trail had a five year one of the disturbing that wrote about that\nHad set off a little after ... on and\nUh I go very far into the eye and I'm On a path right along the river that has a very far right definitely had that very like either like\nSenator heightened by watching and ironically when I came out that it takes a lot of time or or um when I got back to the car that you know I had\nMore minutes longer she was she was already gone even easy for her\nThat meant they go oh maybe she disappeared maybe I had add when I was probably gone you know and a half hour but it made her very very bad I mean I Would say\nWell you know we're sorry go ahead I'm Sorry\n\nLet her\n\n\n[noise] well I mean we we can talk about like all these different uh you know um historical stories all these different stories that have come from ancient times all the way to\nYou know even the modern Arab but one thing that you guys don't shy away from in this book is is covering some of the more recent tragedies or you know you have stuff that's from\nThe lifetime of people that are reading the book the things that they can remember from their own lives like the like ah Christa McAuliffe and the and the challenger tragedy and you know these other more modern murders or suicides or what have you and then one of the things that's featured in the book and and I wonder if there was like some\nHesitancy to put this in there and then to included in the book but the Sandy Hook elementary school is in the book where was that something a summer where there was some question about whether or not it should be included in in in this book\n\nAs a a a grave a\nBombing that\nUm and then talk about a young man that I\nDon't know about it All right that\nWe do know that kind of don't that's not how we want to be I don't want it\nAnd I am\nThat way that has been enacted by that I\nHave some very routine and ran aground on there and the things that are all that so I\nHave heard her\nPlayground her favorite color when\nAll around here you have a\n\nVery\nGreat ground ads are higher happening\nLike here it's not that did you say that as the the Red Sox won up or what nine to four in the top of the nine so now it's the bottom and the Dodgers coming back I was gonna say you know that top of the ninth inning like that would have broken the Dodgers and you'd see the red Sox just roll to victory\nTomorrow night right but it seems like\nThe Dodgers have a little bit of life left in the most see what happens\nNow the problem is that Kim ... can't get his stuff together and close out the game properly well I Love my socks I'm I'm pretty much I'm not a huge family anymore I don't\nI I they last me a bit a couple of years ago and I haven't really come back to it so I Do get wrapped up in these games though it's they're fun they're exciting um one thing I Will say is that uh\nYou know it seems like they're they have a very good chemistry as a team\nThey do and and so don't guess so we had tonight Sandra how are they seem like a great pair and\nYou know I'm thinking maybe maybe we maybe we get together with them and pop around and do some stuff at some of these places medical you know there's there's a this is a great book for like I said just throwing it in the car\nJumping in the car going on a weekend trip find you know there are a lot of these places you can stay there and spend the night or spend the weekend and get out there and explore and and we have that opportunity for you as well of course with some of the events that we do and some of the different things that we have planned and of course we'll have more of that stuff coming up in twenty Nineteen\nI ah I don't want to let the cat out of the bag\nBut ah we may be working on some some uh some new stuff to new places and his staff yeah new places that we've never been to before\nUm so we'll be looking into that next year as well I Want to say though\nI've been going on during like these library lectures and in different places\nAnd last Sunday I was at the signs house and uh in Plymouth and men and Matt how I've ever met him and it was it was pretty cool I mean it's it they're refurbishing the place and so there's like doctors' offices and stuff upstairs he really can't go explore the upstairs\nUm it's kind of limited where you can investigate but we gathered everybody on the first floor and\nI was trying to take people through the different kinds of equipment that we used to investigate and we started things off with the Dow zinger odds and I'm usually don't I mean I have success with the Dow zinger odds but I don't really get into\n'em like a lot of communication with them but we had one of the coolest Dow zinger out sessions that I've ever had\nIn the house where we had two people standing at the front of the room each with their own set of rods the person who is in charge of the house said that she has encountered a little girl what she calls Emma and that she thought that there was like another male presence there so\nWe actually we're what we're asking the mail to move one set of rods and Emma to move the other side of the rods and when we ask questions like they would they would do that like they would respond and only move the rods that we asked them to use and it was really cool because I've never seen that\nHappen before I can go into a ... an entire argument for have happened\nWithout ... that was that how how would that be ...
