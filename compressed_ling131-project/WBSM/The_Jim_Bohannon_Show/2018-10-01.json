now why is that why is the instance on confidentiality because this is a guy who has written about and conceded\nHe had very big problems and didn't behave well\nAnd and that I think was one of the the the fears all along about bringing him to a public hearing\nBecause the guilt by association if you talk about in other words what has happened with mark judge if someone came up and made a charge against mark judge in high school\nThat the every region in the world to give it more credibility than making a charge against Brett Kavanaugh and why is that is because Brett Kavanaugh has lived a life since high school and during high school for that matter where he was standing\nAnd he performed very well in every ... was stumbled down broken down wrecked drunk one of the things\nThat that I was thinking of here is I've come to know someone who had a very serious battle with alcoholism and seems to be on top of it now\nBut but during the period where this was a problem she had five DUIs five\nOr that means you lose your licence that means it's it's terrible\nAnd how many do you watch this Brett Kavanaugh has zero how many drunk and disorderly does he have zero mark judge it's a different story or and and the idea that he is willing to cooperate now I think that's good I think that's positive\nAnd yes I think that as a a real benefit or Jeff Flake here's what has just happened they were about to vote they were supposed to vote and uh one thirty Washington D. C. time\nAnd it got to be one thirty and they didn't have a quorum because there were a bunch of people out and meeting with Jeff Flake and the hallway a bunch of Democrats meeting with him trying to reach agreement on the idea\nThat uh that we do all due diligence with ... nomination is important\nOkay and that was him explaining his basic idea and he also spoke eloquently about why this was important\nThat there is no amendment or I'm simply stayed in the discussion that we had between us all of that I Would hope and I think we have some agreement before\nThat the Democrats who have been I think justifiably uncomfortable moving ahead or could could publicly in an effort to bring this country together\nUm say that we would feel better I'm not expecting him to vote yes but not to complain that an FBI investigation has not occurred\nAnd yet I that that's what I'm trying to do this country's being ripped apart here and and we've got to make sure that we do deal with due diligence so I think this committee has done a good job but I Do think that we can uh have a short pause\nAnd and make sure that the FBI can investigate I understand it as that or some of us would have to and I'm prepared to do it and make a request to the White House to ask the FBI to do that investigation it would be short\nLimited in scope to the current allegations that have been made\nOkay I'm In by the way I'm breaking news from Fox News Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana strong Republican strong supporter of a judge Kavanaugh as he should be in my opinion a says we've reached an agreement on how to proceed with Kavanaugh we've reached an accord\nNow how many Democrats that accord ah includes you can't be sure but I Am very confident that this is good news uh let us go\nTo your calls into a mark in Houston mark you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Tucker McCall sure um I\nLike to show that I respect your opinion but I have to disagree with you about\nPeople who you are you at\nI mean I'm not real smart about politics but I Do a pretty observant at a business for ... years and I watch these Democrats and I think if you give them an ... type two miles every time\nWhere they can try they can try but they won't be able to be close again with the buy in here from the votes that Mitch McConnell needs a flake Murkowski Collins um and maybe mansion\nOr they they simply won't be able to take more in other words and and Chris Coons of Delaware was was speaking about this I think they get it that that this will not be delayed till after the election it will not be delayed\nFurther than next week and if that is the price for getting Brett Kavanaugh\nConfirmed I think you mark would it would agree that that is is probably a price worth paying and and the reason I said we worth paying because look a number of people have made this point I think it's absolutely true if Brett Kavanaugh's defeated\nIf he is not confirmed for the center of the United states gets only forty nine votes he needs to get fifty to win in other words if he doesn't get Jeff Flake and Susan\nIf the FBI is investigating it's going to bring more to the flame there will be new accusations and they must not be allowed to enter the conversation\nBut I think that is in fact if I'm what I'm understanding you know we don't have formal war that's part of the of course that they've reached\nSo you are thinking exactly along the right lines key and I think this is one of the reasons that President Trump seems to be so sympathetic to this uh along with them or we haven't heard yet from a leader McConnell but I think we will by the end of the day very much appreciate your call it had a wonderful weekend\nI'm coming up I'm really factor of this um I came in from Sherry
