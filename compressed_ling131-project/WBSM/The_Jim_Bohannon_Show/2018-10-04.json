your whole indoor story we'll talk about what does that mean those holes are one\nNever mentioned for years anything about the sexual assault never mentioned cabinet now that doesn't necessarily undercut all of our credibility according to force you never said anything until two thousand twelve author she testified in front of the Senate she never coach anybody with regard to a polygraph members made a big deal out of taking a polygraph and she's still a little turtle her notes\nFrom her psychiatrist you turn over a polygraph now or a polygraph notes racial questions of their own such as in the polygraph notes original polygraph note said before she took the polygraph\nThat she was sexually assault in the early eighties you crossed out early\nNobody knows why and she took the polygraph and then she passed the polygraph but she testified\nUnder oath that you did not coach anyone I ... never asked ... that's not true there is her testifying about that's under oh\nI didn't expect it to the as long as it's going to be so it's a little bit stressful and you have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test never ... and ...\nThe graph examination when asked under oath and the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips or advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph backer for replied never the statement raised in specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination result instead of therefore need this information\nSo she's got a credibility problem there as well\nThen she also has another credibility problem it turns out that she said in her Senate testimony over and over again that she was in therapy in two thousand twelve because she had a fight with her husband about building a second front door and the reason that she wanted a second front door is because she had security concerns because she was still deeply disturbed about her alleged sexual assault\nAt the hands of Brett Kavanaugh will now it turns out that that's a really dicey story real clear investigations pulse Barry over real their investigation has a piece in which he says real estate and other records under cut a key part of Christine Blasey Ford's account of why she finally came forward with charges of attempted rape against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after some Thirty years\nFour testified last week it should never revealed the details of the alleged attack until twenty twelve inches and couples therapy with her husband she said the memories percolated up as they revisited a disagreement they'd had over her insistence on selling a second front door when they remodeled their Palo Alto California home\nThey need to explain a decision her husband didn't understand pushed her to station one door to alleviate symptoms and foster phobia and panic attacks based on the alleged assault\nShe was specifically asked about this by Dianne Feinstein my son asked is that the reason for the second front door is claustrophobia and forks had correct\nBut documents reveal the door was installed years before as part of an addition\nIt has been used by rent or even a marriage counseling business\nThe door was not an escape route but an entrance fruits and the attorney familiar with the ongoing congressional investigation it appears the real plan for the second front door was to rent out a separate room\nHow else he said Palo Alto CD records show a building permit from the additional ruin exterior door was issued a board and her husband on February for two thousand eight more than four years before the may twenty twelve therapy session or she first identified cabin up as her attacker\nOkay so there we have it and because she said it therefore it must be true see and believe that's how that's all we've got it turns out that other allegations with regard to the the nominee are also falling apart there was an NBC story about Brett Kavanaugh this one has to do with Deborah Ramirez\nAnd accuse capping off perjury\nAnd then it turns out that he was in fact guilty a perjury\nSo here's what NBC originally reported they send a text between ... and ... there are Savage both friends have Kavanaugh suggest nominee was personally talking with former classmates about Deborah Ramirez a story in advance of the New Yorker article that made her allegation public remember Deborah Ramirez lady who allege\nThat it's some frat party at Yale Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself in front of her in one message nearest average the cabinet asked her to go on record and his defense to other messages show communication between Kavanaugh scheme and former classmates in advance of the story the text also demonstrated the cabinet and remembers one more socially connected than previously understood\nThat Ramirez was uncomfortable around cabinet and they saw each other at a wedding ten years after they graduated or comes up or it's also show that some potential witnesses have been unable to get important information to the FBI on Monday a senior U.S official confirmed the White House has authorized the FBI to expand its initially limited investigation and that was the original report\nThen they went back in self edited and here's what the ad and now public transcripts from an interview with the Republican Judiciary Committee staff on September twenty fifth\nTwo days after the ... their marriage allegations were reported in the New Yorker Kavanaugh claimed it was Ramirez was calling around the classmates trying to see if they remembered it\nAdding it strikes me as you know what is going on here when someone is calling around to try and refreshing other people is that what's going on what's going on with that that doesn't sound good it doesn't sound good to me it doesn't sound fair it doesn't sound proper it sounds like an orchestrated hit to take naps in other words NBC first claimed the Kavanaugh is calling around to try and ... story\nAnd now it turns out that he had already testified it already testified that it was Ramirez was calling around to try and bolster her story\nSo good job media well John all the way through there is another allegation that seems to be having some trouble then there's the allegation from Julie sweating it because of course coming from Michael ... it turns out that a former boyfriend of Julie sweating it has now issued a letter\nTo the to the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd here's what it says my name is Dennis ... I'm a former weeknight media meteorologist for channel seven in Washington DC and one in any in Nineteen Ninety five I Want to preface this by saying I'm you know ... and the actions about you mentioned in his letter I Hope my friends family and church members can forgive me I first met Julie sweating it in Nineteen Ninety three at a Washington DC bar near Wisconsin circle\nHow's it going away party for channel seven anchor Dale Sally I left the party to go to the bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my Eighteenth birthday as I sat alone at the end the bar Julie approach me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed and no drinking Han\nConsequently my initial thought was that you might be a high end call girl because of the time that we had three hundred and fifty pounds so it was someone like her want with me but there was no conversation about is changing sex for money so I decided to talk with her a few minutes\nI'd never been hit on in a bar before I didn't\nThe sort of that night although we talked about getting together over the next couple of weeks we met when I Believe and still believe with Jewish place from the beginning ... who I was married and then I was having marital issues\nAnd says she was an opportunist I felt she had only interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds sell because I was on TV and well known although we're not emotionally involved there was physical contact we never had sex despite the fact she was very sexually aggressive with me and then he talks about\nAll of her fantasies you know such with multiple guys and he suggests that uh she is politically motivated and is he says\nThat basically she's not going to be believed he basically calls her sociopath a and so that's that's not great for her account either and her her account always was was really troublesome right that the gang rape account was always a very difficult to substantiate considering there should have been witnesses for any of that stuff\nWe're going to get to a final allegation the Democrats tried to bring up last minute and just one second but first let's talk about your sleep quality\nThere's nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy generic mattress still for anyone else he would sleep has built a sweep quiz that takes two minutes to complete\nThey use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference is the perfect mattress whether aside sleeper a hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from but was he like there's no more guessing no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes of course they will naturally mattress that will give you the best leap of your life\nYou'll send me today you hear how energetic I Am as I got some good sleep over the Jewish holidays and that's because\nI use helix sleep my wife and I took this liquid as we got the healer sleep mattress we've posted on the bed came in the mail in rapid in place right in front of you\nGo check it out he was ... dot com slash Shapiro for a couple he looks can even split that mattress down the middle\nProviding individual support needs and your preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty you have to try it out for a hundred ... praised or do you have to lose right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off\nAt ... dot com slash Shapiro if he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or healing sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nAnd to the final allegation those brought by Democrats again all the allegations are falling apart\nThe final allegation those brought against Brett Kavanaugh was brought last minute by Senator Chris Coons so here is the accusation apparently Chris Coons forwarded an allegation related to judge Kavanaugh's years in New haven the accuser who apparently created TV show in which people strip while dancing to their favorite music which is an awesome TV show probably\nTells a party that took place at the house and judge Kavanaugh's undergrad fraternity during the Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen eighty eight\nSchool year and which allegedly featured some salacious activity of course judge Kavanaugh had already graduated when this party allegedly took place in the first year law student that period as as you well know most academically intense time and most students what its allegations has all the makings of a tabloid headlines\nBut there's just one problem if user freely admit to having no evidence whatsoever that judge have not even attended this party\nIs Chuck Grassley slapping the crap out of Chris Coons\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence of judge Kavanaugh's attendance the accuser provide some investigative evidence he proposes that someone searched judge Kavanaugh's calendars the very same calendar is your college I'm dismissed and derided\nTo determine whether he attended a frat party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven in Nineteen eighty eight and that's it oh he alleges that he wants witnessed a salacious party at our house owned by judge Kavanaugh's undergrad fraternity and then separately advises us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh's calendars to determine\nIf you attended we have reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there is no evidence that judge Kavanaugh's anywhere near the party or anything to do with it at all\nIn fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser investigators have serious work to do all the minority has refused to engage with the allegations against judge Kavanaugh in any meaningful way by investigators have tried to pursue every relevant lead and therefore I Hope that before boarding an allegation and the future you'll first consider whether you'd want you or your staff has been valuable time investigating it\nThanks for your consideration [laughter] honestly I I got to love Chuck Grassley at this point do just does not give any ads it this way he's he's like you know what we're done we have just done\nWe are finished it it it it it's just great because he did the same Bernie Sanders earlier this week Bernie Sanders sent him a letter saying we want a longer FBI investigation and Grassley sent him a letter back saying Bernie you came out five minutes after the nomination and said that you were going to oppose Gavin you think all I can change your mind if you're on your mind maybe we'll talk about it\nIs just it's amazing so all of this leads up to the fact that there's just a shifting argument going on and let this started off if you recall was an argument that Brett Kavanaugh was unfit for the court because he allegedly tried to write big role in your seventies but that was the original allegation then it turned into a gang rape that turned out to be full\nThen it turned into expose himself at a party no evidence of that and it turned into okay well maybe it's because he got angry\nAngry we had them angry people on the court because Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems like at the white\nRubin or Ginsberg who goes out and ran\nAs RPG tore his RPG yeah they should go down she ran politically every five minutes\nShe's perfectly she's perfectly well balanced me on the corporate Brett Kavanaugh got mad when you accused him of being a gang rape is doesn't belong on the court the shift in gold parts posts are just insane here's Hillary Clinton saying Brett Kavanaugh's behavior is out of bounds\nWell I mean Hillary you want to be president and you drank John McCain under a table and through lamp that your husband serves that\nHey here's Hillary Clinton wearing\nAgain something that she got from Mugabe's wardrobe and ...\nI think for anyone who believes there's such a thing as a judicial temperament\nWe want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about yeah because\nHe got mad when you accused him of of being ... and I remember someone else getting mad when when her husband was accused of rape I remember that who would that have been accused of sexual assault was probably true\nI remember somebody getting mad about that oh yeah and she wanted to be president in the United states by the way I should correct modulator references moved ... not ... it was a dictator Zimbabwe will got to be [laughter] we've got through the character from doing okay how how else did the shift that the the standards so Alison ...\nThere's a story about how Brett Kavanaugh back when he was in college gotten a bar fight with a guide to him I said a guy\nNow let me explain how this works I went to Harvard law school a lot of great minds they're a lot of these folks will be senators the people who are in my class\nAnd there was a group of guys who would go out they invited me but I just as you will hear this is not my type of party they would go out to bars\nThey'll get drunk off their butts and then they would just suck each other in the nuts I not not a joke like they would actually just punch each other and the growing like this is an actual thing that I Would hear about later as you can imagine not my kind of party\nBut the accusation here by Allison ... ice throwers are more likely to assault so if you're in a bar fight with due to the bar and he threw ice Adam then it must be they use sexually assaulted a woman years prior\nIf I if they weren't the legal I Would go register to vote eight times in Ohio\nBecause yes yes forty nine percent of Americans back a democratic candidate in their local race for the U.S house forty two percent support the Democratic candidate that is a massive increase in the Democratic support level\nHey when Democrats had a fourteen point lead is now down to seven in the Quinnipiac poll it is possible that Republicans retain the house because Democrats or ... or so to stuffing which would just be poetic justice will not be phenomenal if the Republicans retain the house because Brett Kavanaugh\nThat would just first of all the insanity that is likely to break out on the back of that would just be on the legal things will just be nuts so not so bizarre ... as I said to my children there'll be crazy well\nWe'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest I'm sure there'll be plenty of breaking news I think both maybe taking place we'll talk about that as you mentioned Russia [laughter]\nDo

all\nRight my name is ... ...\nWhat we\nSaid for news station [noise]\n\nAbout because you had a job when he's sixty five oh Jim both the U.S is apparently about to get more serious regarding the Russian cyber threat and it's increasingly assertive use of cyber capabilities\nWe're talking about that with the Michael ... he's the president and CEO of lab MD and is that concerned about this this issue as the should we all be one eight six six five oh jumbo our number as we talked to Marty who calls in from east Texas tonight the good evening Marty\nHi Jim another good one man I'm thinking the way with the signal processing speeds that we see now and the um and and the ubiquity\nOf connections around the globe I feel like the nation states are doing their best to keep up but I feel like there's a lot of NGOs if you will there's a lot of uh an anonymous and uh um\nOrganizations of people in order at a at a at hawk a level that are doing a lot to exploit all of the weaknesses and the Web and that\nThat that's as big a factor as any nation\nAll right uh non government organizations for those who are not into the alphabet soup or a nomenclature uh uh uh what about that the Michael ... do you think that the such groups themselves pose a a a a threat as such\nFor well I Do but you know we have two hundred countries in the world that we have to sort of a coordinate with trying to get that side of a committee to grand what to do about cybersecurity is it an incredibly tall tale especially when a lot of them are criminal enterprises themselves so these NGOs that we call them\nGet a lot of them are just a they have a mass kind of an engineer and really they are they are at the government that they get ... by the government I mean look at how the Russian train these kids to hack at such a such a young age which is a great idea for\nThe call hacking but it's not a great idea for unethical hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more an ethical\nHacking so they can do great defense says that we have to have ethics and this is the\nProblem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world cyber courts and you start getting into politics and and and bad actors that are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might\nLook like outsiders when really\nTheir insiders and talk about Russia all day long I asked her\n... let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up a is there any such international body there is of course a world court and there are various or\nA bodies of the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but didn't end up at best and the and the hospital to U.S interests that red worst but uh\nSerious if if such a bodies even exist usually law and regulation a trail far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because there's a really really really powerful weapon\nAnd I'm as a you know pious plan of suicide how we all get along come by uh I I don't want this weapon given to anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we have a new wittingly put all our shift and one big cloud and so you can puncture that you can get a huge windfall you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything by paper [laughter] 'cause it was harder to scoop up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held that accountable because the bad actors are in locations that are making a fortune outfits that\nLying is acceptable normal something that so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you can't just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations will forget it or\nMaybe they have but it's just so far away it so far yeah I I think the real solution is going to be technologically\nYou know I Would have to think so I as regards what you just said by the way this notion of vote will pay for his oh so twentieth century well you know what a there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that uh we're better or the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point is like for example\nA it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack in and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail rides there of how people voted\nIf somebody hacked something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant ... and uh I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or a luddite well boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span and we sure don't like the way for people that counts I don't want it to the baby out with the bathwater ON Technology there shouldn't be\nBut but they they're it's gotta be something there's got to be safety measures put in place so that everything's not accessible there a firewall there's that bring things out there are different technologies there's you know there's no no and different safety net so we can years\nAt Georgia is going to this right now I I we have a perfectly fine\nJust um but but everyone tries to politicize this and again\nSorry we're we're we're going to break that doesn't move here we will pause and take a break and finish that thought in just a moment\n\nAre you prepared to navigate today's bond markets for your clients\nYeah there's no shortage of these uh world leaders that have no experience in the real world are having to find the sky\nYou know opinions and then they just sort of disappearing the woodwork and were left cleaning up the mess and I don't care what you think about Russia or not any every economy every time I mean the state of the United states has learned the hard way that putting all your eggs in one basket is never a smart idea and and especially after the big recessions and you know in Michigan diverse itself ...\nI'm On the on the streets thanks for example you know so it's never good idea and and that's what the U.S\nTo try to do it well it ... dependency on others so now we have this entire bone and oil production just [noise] you know self reliance is really important it you know we're

so what you're saying is that I'm trying to say okay so if it's a Baker ballot you got to be able to read this thing in order to do\nWell of course citizenship and literacy or not necessarily a things that go hand in hand although they could do an extent yes\nYeah I'm sure there's some others anyhow\nAnd there's the idea of like at the state of Washington the last\nGovernor a ballot they had is that uh the one guy who was the head of the Republican ... head\nSo they had a recount and they still is ad so they had a recount and he still is that they had another recount new on the go out ahead Nicorette recounts interesting thing there is it needed two hundred and some votes for the one they won the when the when right or they they got him [laughter] well\nYou know I mean that that happens sometimes there's no doubt about that and there's no doubt about the fact that sometimes you can in fact have a a fraud occur with paper ballots I'm really suggesting it's harder that way but of course that's not the principle of thrust of this hour as discussion to Daryl in Redding Pennsylvania now hello Darryl\nGo Jim how are you just fine thank you\nI ...
