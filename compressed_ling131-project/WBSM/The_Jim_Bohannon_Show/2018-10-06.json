Murkowski bows to the wrong way on Susan Collins bill is the right way on culture\nShe has in the past voted for cloture on particular measures and then voted against the nominee if she worked at you that\nIf she were to vote in favor of culture and then vote against the actual measure being taken then you would see a fifty fifty tie in the Senate broken by vice president Pence which is about the finished mark and then you could put somebody on the court by but hey\nAlmost only counted horse shoes and hand grenades and this is neither so as long as he gets confirmed that's all that matters in the end Joe mansion of course has a lot of pressure on him but he also understand that if he votes against Kavanaugh he lose his seat is up for reelection in five minutes year and the folks in West Virginia are not going to go along with Joe mansion\nIf he if you weren't you under caught Brett Kavanaugh on this matter\nAlso in other breaking news this morning and this is an insane story that

tried to say that judge have nothing to be on the Supreme Court first because he was a texture less then because he was an alleged rapist then because he was an alleged gang rape is that maybe some ice and to do the deck and college then because he got angry when you were ledge that he committed rape\nWell that that is their latest shtick or the people pushing that stories John Paul Stevens a former Supreme Court justice thank God for the former\nAnd he said that Brett Kavanaugh's performance during Senate confirmation hearing suggested that he lacks the temperament for the job\nAnd here's what he here's what he said that at the time I thought cabinet had the qualifications for the Supreme Court should he be selected I changed my views for reasons that have no relationship to his intellectual ability I feel his performance in the hearing ultimately changed my mind\nHe said that there is near it to the criticism that he has political biased and I'm seeing is a lot this morning there will be the last ten Brett Kavanaugh cried recovery got emotional and Brett Kavanaugh as part of it and I saw that today it doesn't matter even than it was emotional isn't it matters that he was part of it because he said the Democrats are about to get him\nOr alternatively Brett Kavanaugh was saying something that isn't what is it true that Democrats were out to get him remember the original opposition Brett Kavanaugh and then he was attached to it then it became he was a gang rape is let's say that you had spent the last forty years of your life in public service\nAnd that somebody and never knew\nHim for with an allegation against you accusing you'll gain weight and the people who are opposed you politically the same people who said that they oppose you because you're a texture less than came forward and said we think that you are also a gang rape is might say wait a second this feels like a partisan hit job\nMight you say that or does that make it to park and it's amazing it really is amazing all the folks who say judicial temperament first of all these folks have never met a judge\nAnd there are lots of judges were angry there are lots of judges who have personality issues like this idea that all judges are sort of St Louis ... on the hill fence justice from beneath the palm tree it's just not true it's just not true but the question of judicial temperament is how do you approach cases when you're on the bench and we have twelve years of\n... fourteen years ago a of Brett Kavanaugh on the federal bench while he was twelve years a wreck happened on the federal bench\nNo indicator that there was any problem with his judicial temperament was a moderate to moderate conservative on the bench\nAnd then he went through a full Senate hearing you remember that there was a whole set of Senate hearings before this whole garbage news cycle but yet there's a whole set of Senate hearings where he went through silly questions from senators and you had the grandstanding by Kamala Harris and court potato head Booker\nAnd they went through the entire here and she was plastered right he would do that was the grip on him he was to do was to robotic\nAnd then he was twelve years on the bench blasted a full hearing poised flash it\nAnd then shockingly people accused him of gain weight and he got a little mad and that was oh my God how he met look at that that's that's a failure of judicial temperament it turns out that people react differently to different stimuli you give me a massage that has different thing when you walk in the in the back of the head with a two by four I react slightly differently\nIf you massage me and you're on the Susan I can sense your touch that I'm probably going to be placid unhappy if however you clocked me in the back of the head with a two by four I might be justifiably angry and I might be no miffed enough to turn around and ... o'clock it back in\nThat's what happened to write cabin up but apparently that's no good at showing who have not really as he wrote a piece for the wall Street Journal\nTrying to defend his behavior and apologizing for being too emotional I like that at the time he goes no apology to anyone on any of that none if I'd been Brett Kavanaugh and people accuse me of that I Would have gone into that room and I said let me be clear I Want this read into the congressional record and Lincoln state\nAnd wanting to spell this correctly\n... all Democratic senators accusing me of sexual assault on women I've never met\nI Will do something it is pretty amazing it's pretty amazing that we have reached this point in American public life with regard to Supreme Court seat this did in fact start with the Democratic left that decided the court was a tool for the propagation of public policy and not merely an impartial arbiter of constitutional meaning\nThe reason that the stakes are so high is because the court became something it never was before during the war in Iraq and afterward and that was an actual political institution dedicated to a specific set of policy goals\nThe reason people care about the Supreme Court the reason that the people think that the Supreme Court matters is because of things like roe v Wade when the court decided that it was going to make national policy on the basis of left wing viewpoint having nothing to do with the constitution\nAnd the west to believe that the court was going to be its final bastion of weapons and no matter what happened they could always count on the court to step in and defend leftists\nThat worries and for a long time that was basically correct and now it turns out that\nWhen Republicans want to restore the judiciary to its proper role namely reading the constitution as it is written\nAs it was men than the left as well hold on a second hold up a second that's why people are so passionate because let's face it nobody cares about the local dog catcher is raised none of this would've happened if we're talking about a branch of government like a bureaucratic branch of government nobody really cared about that\nThey care about the Supreme Court because they think the Supreme Court is important the only people the only reason people think the Supreme Court is important is because the left has turned it into a political tool and his use it as a club to beat senseless people who actually believe in the text of the constitution\nFor the last sixty odd years fifty odd years ... fifty odd years\nSince the Nineteen sixties since maybe Griswold versus Connecticut although you can certainly say cases like whether it'd Be Sober\nHas outstripped its boundaries many times before that he read Scott Korematsu I wrote my entire Harvard law school third year paper on the idea of the judicial review should be should never get curtailed because the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to these superior political branch and yet that's exactly what's happening\nIn any case the passions were running high yesterday and today Marco Rubio was talking about Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination in the halls of the Senate or the Senate Hart building and he was drowned out immediately by protesters 'cause this is the way our politics goes now\nWhere are we going to [laughter] [noise]\nHearing [laughter]\nWe are one of your mind or ... or were you know these are all different\nOkay and that's just the that I mean that was a normal day for the center than to be escorted in my belief I Will do something remembered that time when people said that the right wing was really crazy and really radical remember the Tea Party and twenty ten how dangerous the right when last you know they never acquired police presence to escort members of Congress to and from things\nThat natural choir that and\nLet's be Frank about this I don't recall a Republican staffer trying to docks members of Congress and released their children's health records which is a thing that actually happened and injured representative Sheila Jackson Lee tried to reveal senators children's health information\nThat's what he allegedly threatened and that would be Jackson Cosco twenty seven works for Sheila Jackson Lee and protesters\nIn the south of course Marco Rubio was a protester operating Joe Manchin of West Virginia they're going to just try to do the same thing they did to Senator Flake button whole somebody in the elevator and then yell at them about how they obviously have women because they believe in due process ... was was kind of whipped up and down by the right the other day for a speech that he gave on the floor of the Senate and that's because people were taking one line\nKind of out of context when he said he would have preferred Amy Coney Barrett so would I make my original was Amy Coney Barrett if you recall but the\nLine is the ... voting for cabinet what the point that he made is this false dichotomy that's being drawn\nBy the west particularly between this case in the me too movement in which they say that if you support red cabinet and therefore hate me too if you support for a cabinet was due process and presumption of innocence therefore you don't take women's seriously he said that's garbage and this nonsense and he's exactly right of course that's exactly right\nThey'll show you have left isn't playing this\nAnyway and just one second but first let's talk about whether you're sleeping enough probably not maybe the reason you're not sleeping in office because your mattress isn't that great I Know you got that expensive mattress out there at the mall but\nIt probably isn't as good as a mattress that you can get from he looks sleep why because he would sleep personalized as your mattress it'll just flip it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference as to the perfect mattress\nWhether you're a side sleep or a hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from but was he was no more guessing nor confusion just go to Hugh asleep dot coms Russia bureau take that two minutes leap was imagined to a mattress and then they send it to you\nAnd you and rapid inflation funny you toss it on the bed frame you're good to go my wife and I have a healer sleep mattress we love it I bought one for my sister for her wedding is that good for couples\nHeels can even split the mattress down the middle providing individual support in Egypt your preferences for each side even ten year warranty gets tried out\nFor a hundred ... you're not losing anything right now she wishes offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders again a hundred and twenty five bucks off at ... dot com slash bureau that she would sleep dot com sweatshirt girl for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress order he went to sleep dot com slash Shapiro All right you show\nThese protesters are not stopping their rating people like Joe mansion trying button hold people and we'll see if the protesters have their desired impact tomorrow because this is a razor thin margin remember\nIt was eight fifty one forty nine vote that if you weren't included Democrat Joe Manchin Republican heavy to vote Cushing here\nIf Joe mansion were switches out if Susan Collins when he joined Lisa Murkowski there is no justice Brett Kavanaugh he goes down to failure\nAnd it's a disaster for Republicans in the terms because a lot of voters just say to their own party you know what you guys are awful go screw off just leap we're not interested in you anymore but this is the protesters sort of story\nIs worth noting you know there there was a lot of hold up today because President Trump tweeted out that some of these protesters are being paid and it's undoubtedly ... there are a lot of these protesters who are members of groups that actually will pay you to be out there for the day I'm sure many of them are spontaneous it's not all of them I just for the one of the women button hold Jeff wake in an elevator\nIs an actual democratic opera it I mean this person who works for a five oh one C. three Center for American democracy I Believe in that center is funded by George ... people are saying oh ...\n... what's that use George Soros and like the stand in for all human evil that George shows is the guy who I really disagree with and a lot of ways I don't think he's a good guy per se I think that for a lot of bad things but\nYou don't have to like use George ... is not the bogeyman\nBut there are a lot of what the protestors out there who had the orange paid for them by groups that are trying to astro turf that now that I think is eminently ... there's a protester I don't know about this protester named as protesters genuine waiting Joe mansion\nHere though [laughter]\nJust tell her how he's going to vote\nAnd of course when he should say is I'm happy to listen to your stories of survivor also do you have ...\nIt's amazing I there was an article in your car today or yesterday saying that rape does not require cooperation because most crimes don't require cooperation what the legal standard means by that is that if I were to allege that I witnessed murder\nHey there's a second witness that has to corroborate my story however you do need other evidence if I just say I witnessed a murder I Walk into a police station I say\nSomeone in this room this very room killed someone\nLet's say that I won't name names but\nI if I if I Would walk into a police station and say that the police would say okay is there a body is there a weapon you have any evidence of this is someone dead if someone missing unique ... but didn't evidence and your doesn't need to be a second person in the roof or rape to watch it and then tell you it was right\nThere has to be some sort of cooperative evidence which is why there's so many cases the police simply does not take up because there is no corroborated evidence I live in ... and has a a terrific video today about the number of cases of of sexual assault and rape that are either falsely reporter to miss remember he's not to present to somewhere between eight and four percent\nIt depends on the metrics that you're using\nIn any case the the protesters also took over\nSenate Hart building and uh you know hundreds of them taking over the very floors in the building I'm not sure why this allowed frankly it seems like kind of a dangerous thing but there was yesterday [noise]\nNow I Will say that all of that is driving the most Republican unity I've ever seen in my lifetime there's new polls out that are just astonishing is there's a poll about Republican female enthusiasm there was a gap in Republican female enthusiasm\nAnd what it shows is that the Democratic enthusiasm gap which was at a massive high and dry there was a ten ... ten point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans signaled Deborah lectures were very important after Kavanaugh\nIt down to a statistical tie a ten point advantage for Democrats just evaporated evaporated over two weeks\nIt's not just a bunch of animated Republican women are not happy with it the great lies that women all women hate\nJust judge Kavanaugh and think that no cooperative evidence necessary look at the look at this Quinnipiac ballot is a generic ballot among white women live twenty second deep fourteen among white women September night the plus five September thirtieth the plus one\nA different Scott ... but this was a person running for a lifetime ... running good being considered our lifetime position the fact is this is Washington this was politics for political curious about issues of horrible things for years and and it becomes ... Fong how do you respond to that\nI'm not taking issue with reminding welfare whether they had a fair question okay well that's your how politics works according to hit it and report ... to ... wonder why they kept telling me oh we'll be back here next\nWeek with all of the way we have a new Supreme Court justice welcome to the bench or will judge Kavanaugh Iran's off in the\nOn Monday and have all the facts and eventually [noise]\n\nSays he doesn't support judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination it looks like he has the votes for confirmation Republican Susan\nCollins saying the FBI could not find evidence to support sex assault charges and she believes in rural overturn the right to abortion\nJudge Kavanaugh has three say ... years for his ... that's a chat with\n... votes joined by Democrat Joe Manchin judge Kavanaugh has fifty one vote for me it'd be real ABC News Capitol Hill\nOil senators indicate how they'll vote the lawyers for the women who accuse Kavanaugh of sex assault Christine Blasey Ford called the FBI investigation into the allegations a sham\nI suppose from room to interview ... through ... that's not a credible investigations\nOvercast cause the lack of an interview a grave injustice Reverend Marvin hunter the uncle of liquid McDonald banking prosecutors fully second degree\nMurder conviction of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke this family wanted\nYes or a car with gas belongs to God God the\nHunter says the family lives and celebrate Brandeis conviction\nA bottle has been found and man as authorities continue searching for a forty seven year old teacher reported missing by her husband acting on a tip authorities discovered the body found about a half mile from the home of Christian West or a mother of two and teacher who mysteriously vanished five days ago\nFor the office of the medical examiner's I say [noise]\nThe Fox river that is a case where a\nPolice now calling the case of death investigation overseas with Johnson California corrections officials say\nThe inmate has killed another in the first death row slang in that state and more\nYears that's the gators trying to determine the motive or listening to ABC News\nAdmitted you probably want to eat healthy but getting enough organic fruits and vegetables into your diet every day is not only time consuming it's expensive\nThat's why in Texas super food we've created a blend of the best USDA organic vine ripe and fruits and vegetables powerful enzymes in Pearl by addicts\nAnd energizing herbs all in a convenient capsule or powder we call it Texas super food complete organic high on natural passing Dr Denis black and I invented Texas super food almost Twenty years ago with one goal in mind\nTo help people like you really busy lives get the all natural nutrition that every one of us needs an deserves so if you can't Walter don't eat all your again and fruits and vegetables everyday Texas super food complete organic makes eating healthy easy\nSee our phone line of quality nutritional products that Texas super food dot com or call us at eight five five Texas fifty five that's a five five Texas fifty five Texas super food dot com\nA former marine serving a life for murder\nBeen sentenced to death from California\nAlready Alice killed five women in San Diego riverside in orange county east between Nineteen eighty six in Nineteen Ninety\nNow do you say it's been sentenced to death for the murders here in California\nThan in Chicago or wind in Livingston County in two separate\nTrials for murdering three women California setting wanting to express sincere apologies to the victims' families say having to hear the gory details of his crime on the city and Los Angeles\nIn this group founded in forty seven of them are what's known as the camera apple\n... three hundred sixty percent growth is a ...

the American future of the Texas Public policy foundation what lessons do you think we should have learned will get down to whether or not we have a minute but but I Would this debacle but we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now\nIs the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president or you know you have in back in Albany that maybe in past administrations would have been cold\nAnd I think the new gold the strategy of the left has never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay in sperm behind the nominee\nOr the pressure would be so great that ah he would have been withdraw the or she would have with Charles himself and so in the face of these vicious\nAttacks on them and that has\nA stellar reputation had an amazing career as a a jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservative stood their ground tenant right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a lesson moving forward to have courage\nAnd the convictions that uh our leadership and DC are there to represent\nHim reality can you foresee a time and let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\n\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that and do my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to bipartisan consideration that used to be a traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being confirmed not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail this law the law the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully end or the last attempt to hit these home run cases to create brand new rights to the brand do\nA protections that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice than with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for the rule of law or that there won't be so much at stake that you won't have\nHundreds of people getting arrested the capital over the nominee because we won't be in such a high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on there and here it's to the law of respect for the constitution the qualifications of their record and we won't have these cases that make\nYou know every single nominee a you know life or death fight\nPartisan fight for the the ... versus the rye\nI Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary has essentially governments umpire bowling balls and strikes that's constitutional ... constitutional there are an awful lot of people out there unfortunately who don't really care how you get\nYou know the end justifies the means I don't care what the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the center and so on [noise]\nAh they don't care about that sort of thing and they care only about getting their way and that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them were not in many cases talking about very principled individuals' here\nWell that's right and that say hey Tim Tim or a sickness that it's come from the federal government that's like out of control that that's got a way the government of limited to write a towers it was ... by the sounding fathers and\nYou know one thing in the overall theme of this administration as the ministry and that it's been looking at cutting regulation and decrease in the size of power that government being thought\nInch by inch every step along the way a but here I think in a way that you share is being transformed it's ... ... men and women in a place that had ... and are rejecting this idea that\nYou know every court case needs to be a policy victory how about we just have a court case that is correct the wall and that's what we expect thought\nWell I I certainly with you are of course if that were to happen we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nOr to feel that way and and that's another area that I Want to get into with Rob and the ... and that is the extent to which we have taught\nYoung people to not only be have been in the the vicious and the self centered in ill mannered way that we have seen but also to to recognize that free speech is important than that your feelings if they get hurt by what somebody else says well grow up to develop a thicker skin\nA though there are a host

that I'm just kidding [laughter]\nYes ma'am two years writing a book what what's better than hearing people read the book back to you\nYeah but the the that was the very very cogent point I had not

we just witness obviously the specific a dispute between cabinet on board is part of it and how did we get Brett Kavanaugh well you have excellent if cynical vetting\nOn the part of a Republican president and you've got partisans on both sides in the Senate but I Would argue that the main blame\nLies at the state of the of the Supreme Court ah because they get involved in so many key social and political issues\nFrom abortion to gun control to resolving a presidential election in two thousand which is the worst uh of the decisions in my book they raise the stakes of confirmation hearings the days are long gone\nWhen a when a justice could surprised the president\nWho named it you know David Souter was not what the first George Bush expected Byron White was not what JFK\nHope for or

I think roe\nWas ... was was not a good decision not because of the outcome but because of the court should not have gotten involved the court should have said that's up for state legislatures in Congress determined but I Would not argue\nNow that road should be overturned\nI don't think you should the court should lightly\nUpset the reliance interests and the the the the fabric of society that's grown up\nLet me make sure that I mean I think that's a bad idea and\nIt undercuts the courts legitimacy if to Trump nominees can wind up changing fifty years of history on\nLet me make sure that I understand this or that you don't feel that roe was a wise decision in the first but now that it's been around a while it would still not be wise to correct that but it would be ... and then the words in other words having a certain amount of tenure if you will a certain amount of social inertia in that direction\nHas given it a a legitimate see everyone\nAround her show I Would call stability in the same way to build I think I think the gun control ruling\nIn two thousand a saying that Americans had a right\nTo have a hand gun in their homes for defense I thought that was a foolish really I think there is no basis in the second amendment for the second memory is terribly written that needed a better ... two hundred and fifty years ago and I think the four dissenters in that case\nFar better of the argument based on history based on tax\nThink Heller was an incorrect decision and foolish decision but I Would not argue that as soon as the Democrats if you will the
