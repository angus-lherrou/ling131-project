foreign power interfere in our elections right absolutely\nAnd I've been saying this for two years this is an octopus there were multiple tentacles\nOf where they accepted assistance from who they

writer extraordinary on you were just a we were talking about our friends who's in long um texted me last week and said can I come in and I I think it's the first time she's told her story of being drugged and raped when she was a sixteen year old virgin at Yale 'em and you were saying that you've never told this story before but you being a\n... a size down with with that and I had tweeted something for the first time I'd even exposed that\nHappened to my life that if any of my friends who are listening they're going to be a surprise to as her family members and yeah\nI just felt like it was time to tell what happened in the other point to that I wanted to say as he never received any therapy he never received anything that would help him understand why he did this repeatedly mounted to\nWhen my sister as well as me once again I didn't find out how the adult yeah they're confronted me about it like why didn't you protect me I told you and what had happened is my sister was the first victim and come to me I told him you need to stop\nTouching her she's only seven whatever\nIf you're doing due to me as I was ten you know the oldest yeah and apparently I didn't learn and telling adult that he kept continuing to behavior with both of it\nI I that's how it usually goes and then there's no help for that person\nYou have no idea what they've done for the rest of your life you know I've never seen him since then I Can't imagine you know\nI Know again I mean regions the only word I can think of I don't know when raged I feel that I was not sexually sold it I said this during the ... thing I never had a I've never had a me to think I've never had a and I know how angry I Am I on all of my friends that have had that experience and then on top of it\nMock I mean we're at a point where I think it was a Tony Schwarz said\nEven ... even she played the clip and he's like I Wish you did you hadn't played I Wish you wouldn't do that\nI Wish you hadn't played that like it's so ugly mhm and I can only imagine how ... every woman that's been the victim of this word a point where you have to make an editorial you're like this is how awful the president of the United states is but but you know I get that it is psychologically painful for people even to watch him\nBut that there's an entitlement we were just speaking about how cabinet\nAs a young man of rich entitled white boy was told you can take\nA woman when you want her email play devil's triangle with your friends without asking her and push or in a room you know it's like you're entitled now to be on the Supreme Court yeah it doesn't matter what it is there is a privilege an entitlement that an entire group of young men white privilege conservative rich men\nAre have been raised to believe is there's yeah take a woman they will take a seat and even the way he\nGreat he uh he drunk dialed who's a drunk TV what you need ... ... talk about I mean again that people's lives are are being talked about is if it's a game ... level the playing field you know that I'm Talking about this like a like a when you know I'm curious\nWhy was it they got you I have it from your worst strength about her and to fight for Kavanaugh at that point\nWell there are a lot of things happening that word correct they were true and there were a lot of things that were left unsaid and I thought I had to even the playing field because it was very unfair to\nJudge now I can get very nicely if they just discovered or right it was a very unfair situation do I\nEven the flag sales at once they did that started the sail through it was very very unfairly to the\nAnd that there was a tactic in that they disliked because it forces them to actually state their positions\nWe turn their back on sexual assault survivors when Senator Purdue ran away from ... in an airport in winning hit it and the men's bathroom people probably sexual assault survivors that he didn't care about their assaults and that he would not pull this fan or any other man accountable for it so you know\nThat's why they just like it that's why they try to discredit it because\nYou know they decided to be public servants and then they didn't like what the people in the public actually wanted them to be accountable for their accent\nYeah I mean ... they work for us and the fact that they don't even know how to just how the human conversation with someone and listen\nRight I mean just ... yeah I I mean we were talking about this cliff did you see this clip learning room in the southern ... on Fox News they're literally having beers and trying to take a selfie to celebrate you know getting the current attempted rape is on the on the Supreme Court and he falls on his house\nShe just completely doesn't acknowledge it [laughter]\nBut I mean it's just it's like they don't have the missing some sort of human ship or something right didn't even pause to Syria will pay your oh that was funny or you know that was a human moment and didn't go how we ... I mean they're just\nIt's like they become human talking points\nIt was I I actually wanted to take them for that 'cause I watched it probably thirty forty times because I was like this is exactly what I needed at this moment it's\nSo I Would say no to Larry's is how they cover the Trump Administration right like never admit that anything embarrassing a ridiculous this happened just to just hope that no one will notice outline\nI mean I think that's the thing that we had been you know as somebody I was I was there on the very first day of the confirmation hearing was the second woman I read that I was pulled out of the gallery I'm saying senator we need to to be heroes and vote now against Kavanaugh\nOn by four officers I still actually has stars on my arm bruises on my arms that have not gone bully away from that incident\nAnd you know women were in that hospital they occupy the heart credit building they in and day out for more than thirty days great lesson fire ... that's what we're supposed to be a cake walk it over and just a couple of days will be something that will be lasting damage to the Republican Party\nAnd let us not forget that millions of people were activated and we've raised over you know nearly four million dollars\nYeah Sarah Biden said take out soon as they call it the whole earth probable for her vote that they will not be in the Senate next year\nThe gymnast in two years we we've got to focus like a laser beam on these\nMidterms right now in the latest you know what is it three weeks four weeks um because yeah I I mean they thought we were the day after the election and for the women's march I mean and we've got to stay in that state right\nAbsolutely and I I Would say you know right now it's so important to her father those conversations both the survivors told us something they taught us something in the\nProcess of you know on my own staff\nOdd that you know more than a dozen people came forward\nAnd name themselves as a survivor of sexual violence including myself and my co executive director Ana Marie are the odds\nOn many of us had not full family not held our parents watch just people sent text messages to their parents\nUm letting them know that they're okay they wait are you ready to talk but that they wanted\nTo name this thing happened to them that type of bravery we can all use a little bit of that and not to have conversations with our Republican friends\nAre Republicans is there's a Republican mothers young and ... actually said this is the country we're fighting for it this is what we want we want in America where we can All right together and and\nParty is in a specially this president\nIs dangerous to the brown people that I Love the threats to the black people that I Know is dangerous to the women that I care about you know how real conversation we have to take this out of ideology or theory and rooted in the fact that there are babies\nBeing held prisoner intense in the desert right now and we have to do something to stop it\nYeah yeah I mean when you look at ... ... you're talking about race class all of that ... that you know this is a white ... Ivy League woman appointed to grow up in the same country clubs whatever's Brett Kavanaugh that was dismissed\nYou know and and you you you know you multiply that by all of her sisters of color in a you know the different classes and all of that an ... you know you realize I'm\nI I I really truly believe that and I should this for a while this blue wave is going to be ... feet is going to be female and look how many women are running right that we didn't that we've never had before\n... ... ... ...\nNobody here oh there you go I I I honestly would sit for collecting on what you're saying

we got to get it that we gotta support\nAnd you know that's that's okay too but this is this a really it's\nIt's a powerful moment in a state now both say we're going to take every action we're going

there has been a great deal of\nGood news uh there's more good news when you pick up the brand new book it it ...\nIt's just going to be arriving in stores if you've ever used doors uh right now it's a book called Trump ... inside the America First plan to revive our economy\nOf the book is by my friend's Stephen Moore and by professor Arthur Laffer a Steve congratulations on the book and it's very well time\nUh I like All right thanks so much for the nice guy words and I'd a lot of fun writing it you know with with my buddy art Laffer it was really just kind of first hand account of when we started working with Donald Trump back in the early two thousand sixteen\n... and and I do think a lot of people including me a reading some of your personal descriptions of coming into Trump's office in the way he interacts with people\nIt's reassuring it's it's sort of different portrayal then once you get in mainstream media yesterday everybody in the in the press and of course have been one of President Trump's economic advisors since the campaign\nBut uh people are fixated on this alleged shouting match between John Bolton and and um and John Kelly the White House chief of staff\nAnd uh do all these stories a White House chaos that's not what you see at least that's what you indicated in the book\nBut Trump is a person who likes to actually have different views at the table you know so we used to have arguments all the time I mean I liked them I mean I liked Donald Trump a lot personally is a is a fun person to be around is actually can very gracious these very charming and\nOr attempt to ah he would like to put two or three people on the table would disagree disagreeing physicians you know and we do get out and they need\nEach other and make up his mind which I think is a good thing that's what a businessman does ah so you know so what if they're shouting at each other you know he wants to have a ... he doesn't want to be surrounded by a bunch of ... and and I think that's a that's a good thing\nAbout Donald Trump but you know I'll correct you on just one thing is that Michael when you said that ... a condom you're coming along but I did I think your understanding Russ I this is a full fledged boom or on right now you know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was in you know by the river from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine in ... in between\nAnd everywhere I go I'll I see is you know I saw this in Seattle I saw it in Portland as she at San Francisco I see it you know Nashville, Tennessee in Denver, Colorado and ah you know Austin, Texas everywhere just a friend's everywhere buildings going up skyscrapers factories\nWarehouses biggest construction boom in the history of this country is going on right now everybody's so bullish on America they want to build a lot of it as foreign investment money that's coming in to the United states uh we have ... you know every time I Do your show I liked the you know I'm ... another statistic uh first of all we got the\nIndustrial production numbers came out there like the highest ever and then we the the seven point one million you know the statistics seven point one million more jobs than Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming toward the border in that caravan I'd let me let me\nGo to one of the oil and I just interrupt you for sure\nIt's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today and they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald\nTrump alive all five ally ... and I you know and they and they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama what way way way way down but you know that why that was right\nYeah because people didn't get jobs exactly there were no she her yeah so they they been rough the real\nReliable pure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nYou know actually what we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came in on the United states so you know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic ...\nBut they never connected the dots on CNN on that you know\nUh but the but it is a sign that the environmental that like you and I agree on this we need a lot more legal immigrants in this country we need more\nPeople in the farm farm workers and we need more service workers and we knew him reading more technology workers and and I used to tell Donald Trump I've told you this you know it and it's in the book we say if you're going to build that wall battle make sure it has big gate so people can come in legally\nThe book is called Trump a non makes inside of the America First plan to revive our economy but you don't believe that President Trump should allow this a ... a caravan from Honduras which is marching forward with Honduran flags by the way that they should allow the caravan into the country do\nYou know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we talk a and I'm I'm watching all these people are you know look no there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on it\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts in Thirty years and we actually have a slight increase syrup is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues to put people into work at ... businesses profitable and move businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah look the problem is spending and you know people I say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department to cut five percent yes I Love that you know that's what businesses\nDon't have enough money\nComing in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of inefficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and\nThat that is an infrastructure we need pipelines we need a lot of Alan gee terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports\nIn Syria where the dictator
