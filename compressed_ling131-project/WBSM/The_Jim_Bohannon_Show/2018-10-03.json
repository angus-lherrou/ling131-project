bit about how the left uses language to confuse us\nI have a video coming out called the left these dictionary and I've been going through letters I aged for antifa be used for budget cuts deems for diversity and eat I was for intellectualism so\nThe reason I Do this is because the left is expert at using language there expert at using language\nTo make ordinary things seem evil right so they will say something like racial profiling and you see coal racial aspect racial profiling is that you know much about ... racial profiling police are doing it at that you know there's all this trouble with the police\nBut think about this for a minute you put a cop out on the street or even more you put a TSA engine and on a line she's got Fifteen to thirty seconds to judge whether you are going to blow up a plane he's got to use every piece of information he's got one of them may be that you're carrying the Koran because a lot of terrorists are bad guys there's a lot of terrorists or or Islamic\nHe's not being bigoted you're not being bigoted the problem is that the decent innocent Islamic guys being taught by the bad guy but the bad guy but that tennis age it has to make his decision in a moment she'll racial profiling is a term they use to make that sound like it's evil\nWhen it isn't so I'm putting out the left these dictionary to translate these terms in to ordinary English things that sound like they make sense from the left\nBut maybe don't quite make so much that's what we're hoping we're going to try and put this together as a book or in time for Christmas so you have something to give you a left wing friends so that they'll hate you because there's nothing better at Christmas Time that having friends\nAbsolutely theories itching for me at the mouth so here is by for intersection holiday in ...\nI I as ... intersection alec\nIntersection how to use the theory that people can be understood intersecting social identity such as race gender clash and sexual orientation it's only when with back to all these interwoven identities is fully understood that a person knows how much he's around to blame this crappy like one white men\nBlaming runs crappy like one white men is called being oppressed and you know press gives you the right to shop stupid stuff while wearing the ... it makes you look like a complete idiot [noise] which is a good thing because it keeps you from having to take responsibility for yourself which can use up a lot of your social media site\nYou don't have enough intersecting social identities and your designated as just some schmuck or white man as a white man everything's your fault and you now have to work for a living to pay taxes to support intersection with people so they have more free time in which to blame you for the crappy lives\nNow you may say well wait with America people weren't really oppressed very much and you can improve their lot spy rising above the dysfunction in their communities in order to live productively\nUser called under the rules of ... people using Fox a fascist and can be shouted down [noise] [noise] you may say what\nIf you shop people down and hit them with sticks than you are the fashions that is called logic and under the rules intersection analogy people using logical fascist it can be shouted down and ...\nSome people object to the underlying ideas intersection Alan nice people say that intersection Ali is just a way of organizing\nBecause it to random interest groups in order to turn them against one another so that left ... power by pretending we're leaving in various forms of oppression don't actually exist\nThey'll up this thing can be voted down especially if a GOP loses a number terms they can just throw this new agreement away but it's obviously a good agreement it obviously justifies Trump's\nStrategies in his tactics in fact\nIn fact I think this calls for the Trump happiness montage that's got it so much and we're going to win at every level\nWe going to win economically waking away when the economy were gonna win with military we get a win without caring for veterans were gonna win with every single fashion [noise]\nDon't\nBorrow bar\nWe going to win so much you get tired when\nWhen we can't take it anymore I\nI used to be the end we we have to keep\n\nUp the Trump walks out in front of the press and he just he just ...\nSo Trump walks out in front of the press and he just he just collapsed them silly and comes out ... let's just play ... ... number five\nI think the press is treated me unbelievably unfairly\nFact when I Won I said the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse they're worse now than ever their logo but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\n[laughter] I Love it there are other brothers logo I can say that because we made the deal was not going to go [laughter] you weren't going to me he's just thousand dollars because all they want they don't want to talk about trade and the funny thing is is all about trade\nThis is one of his big big promises but it was going to rework\nThis stuff but they don't want to talk about trade all cabinet all the time just listen to how cool is talking about this they asked him about the FBI investigations ... a six\nI think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time just so we all understand this is our seventh investigation of a man\nWho has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change she's gone through what his family's gone through\nThe trauma for a man that never had any accusation any he's been out of bed statement about him he's led I mean I think he was number one and the plastic yeah he was number one in this law school at Yale\nAnd then what he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible so\nUh I Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting a I Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation they can't read glove on him on this and it's it's interesting because you know he's not always like this we have to admit this about him he can get hot headed ... especially when he was a pack\nBut he is just been he just looks like he has gotten this in his pocket and he just says you know yeah the FBI let them do what they want in there and so they try to shift that this was the other thing they tried to shifted to drinking and that was absolutely hilarious and he then goes off on the people\nWho are asking for these investigations us put ... number seven\nNow they talk about alcohol they talk about all of the things that you hear and frankly you take a look at that they're bringing up subject we wouldn't know about this over the last Twenty years Thirty years of his career you know what happened to go back to high school\nAnd they're saying she drank a lot one evening in high school we you know I tell you what I happen to know some of the United states senators\nOne who is on the other side who's pretty aggressive I've seen that person in very bad situations okay I've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know\nUh I think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however whatever the senators want is okay with me\nRight we'll get right back to that but first this radio show is just one technical and the great ... cathedral the bench pure world if you want to hear more it over to daily ... dot com

weight Trump just played that about the alcohol thing they're trying to shift at the alcohol and he says you want to talk about drinking you\nWant to talk about drinking let's talk about the Senate drinking in the Senate I mean the stories about their drinking in the Senate or in credible and you know he's pulling the rug out from under them because the whole thing and holding was not about drinking it wasn't about temperament it was about did he try to rape a girl\nWhen he was Seventeen years old that was what it's about this all that they're just trying to move the goalposts that's what it's about and he's just calling Melanie and he just and I my my favorite remark in this whole press conference when he starts talking about ... about drinking and the fact that he doesn't drink and this is a ... number eleven I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my totally good traits I don't [laughter]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason [noise]\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be the right to be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing I watched him and saying that he did have difficulty as a young man\nWas during the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him\nHow confident the ... I mean and actually Trump this is the thing Trump is talking since\nThey're talking about whether he drank in college they're talking about whether he drank in high school how about the last Twenty years oh what's his life been like I mean how confident that you have to be as president to say the fact that I don't drink is my only good trait and can you imagine what a monster I Would be if you you know just how he just is feeling like he is filling issues\n... I'm Sorry but people don't notice this because a lot of people don't like Trump\nAnd they don't notice the way he changes in we adapt see I've always said he's a very adaptable guy he's a guy who learns on the job he said he would learn on the job and he has but that\nBut that is incredibly this is like the the press is an absolute hysteria mowed the left\nAbsolute hysteria mode Jeff Flake gets yelled out in an elevator he collapses\nTrump is like a ... I mean I I'm I'm Serious this is not normal Trump I mean Trump is always a fighter he's always in their fighting I'm not saying that but he's not always just as confident\nAnd cool about the whole thing he does not seem like he has anything at risk and when they ask him for more time you know they're trying to delay this thing all they want the FBI thing is nonsense that whole reason when Trump was right when he said it's a blessing in disguise because it's called them out that's why they have to change their tune\nBut when they ask for more time he has this great response was cut ...\nTell me about time Dianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier if she wanted a a really thorough investigation where all the time in the world\nShe didn't have to wait until after the hearing was closed essentially she should have said listen I have a problem I have this report\nI'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing areas we had too much no she didn't do that she waited until we were closed\nAnd then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say but she probably did based on a very bad body language of the day but\nMore importantly under sense for her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats and I guess I'm a ... to the media right I consider you what part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats\nTo be talking about we want more time for the FBI if he wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bringing this up\nThat that is amazing just amazing stuff because you could see the reporters asking the question I didn't know who was was awaiting reporter asking the question when he said I just include you with the Democrats she looked like she kind of when it's going to ripple like aids struck are almost\nThe guy isn't complete control in this press conference partly I'm sure it's because of the victory NAFTA which really does ... diem a lot of what a lot of the attacks are really answers a lot of the attacks on him\nBut partly it has got to be because he feels he has got this thing ... and I just listen to part of why I think\nA professor of sociology she writes a piece in most in the Washington Post why can't we hate that it seems logical date man I Can't lie of always had a soft spot for the radical feminist smack them\nThey have conflated mixed up confused a philosophy with a gender with a group of\nNobody is attacking women when you attack feminism but am attacking is the philosophy of feminism the philosophy that divides us into grievance organized moms and that's what we're seeing we're seeing the degradation of the left by that organization that's exactly it that's it\nFor me if you'd like to hear more from me you can listen to the end from Cleveland Show\nDaily wire dot com or on I ...

to the gym ... when they six or five oh jumbo interesting poll that we've been talking about here from Steve Bannon's group\n... damage our guest is White House columnist with the hill newspaper now this is a a had a survey that was split into two parts one was about twelve hundred respondents nationwide another focused on roughly forty competitive house district with eight hundred fifty responded\nIn both cases the pollsters initially asked respondents about their voting intentions then posed a number of stark questions on contentious issues and asked if they're voting intentions had changed\nIn the national poll initial nine point edge for Democrats was reduced to two points by the end of the survey the bowl on voters in competitive districts expanded a negligible GOP edge lessen the single percentage bought up to a five point advantage\nThe change came after hard edged questions which sought to portray Donald Trump as the disruptor of a state's a stale status quo\nAnd the Democrats as the party of open borders the impeachment and below sea for example one question as respondents whether they believe the U.S should have an open borders and immigration policy or whether it's illegal immigration is just that illegal\nIn the national polls sixty five point three percent of respondents said the latter opposite lose closer to their view only twenty seven point five percent said the former now has a uh the notes on this poll continue the Democratic party does not favor open borders as that term is generally understood\nOr know that they simply favor no enforcement and then they would I suppose a look and wonder ... uh like Nancy Pelosi does all the time and say gee how to all those people get here anyway Nile Standage are our guests deceiving and the interesting thought\nI recall the George W. Bush strategy an old for against John Kerry and rather than as the incumbent president rather than the reaching out so much his strategy in the closing days of that raised a successful race of course for George W.

I'm picking up their base is more likely to be effective\nFor a long time I've been up for the ... that the number of persuadable voters and the United states has been decreasing in decreasing being window with the dog and buy\nAll kinds of factors that normally President Trump or before the press and Obama but a sort of brought or a change in the in the cultural was like guys\nTo what extent do you think those Obama voters those on again off again Obama voters might turn out this time because of two huge fears that center around immigration and abortion\nAt ...

Trump now fought issues they care about by most I Would need to see more more polling on that point clearly abortion is a pretty fundamental issue\nTo both sides in this ... which is goes I ironic because I think both sides make far too much out of Brett Kavanaugh let's assume that he in fact is is finally confirmed\nAnd that he votes to overturn roe versus Wade\nThere are people out there who think that means that the next day\nNobody can get an abortion anywhere Mm no of course not it means that becomes a state issue of there'll be at least two dozen states where abortion will be wide open\nAnd are in those states that are suddenly take advantage of an overturn roe that or you would see you probably have bus caravan you'd have special phones raised up and I dare say that if roe were overturned which I don't think it was a given\nWith a ... an automatic a confirmation of a Brett Kavanaugh but if it did happen I bet you you could go a year after that decision and you wouldn't find a single woman in this country who was quote on able to get an abortion\nI Can't really offer in a a a well informed opinion on that Jim I think that would clearly changed the atmospheric stuffed the country very significantly if there were no longer a a constitutionally mandated rights to abortion\nAnd and obviously that would be I think issues women who were a less well\nOff I was actually on we're going to have to fall on that do to continue that thought when we come back in the moment\nAnd populist conservatism is not the same as the traditional conservatism of the Democratic side I never hear the term but I certainly hear the concept\nOr if there are rhinos then there are those out there who are ...

Inglewood Florida to joined us this evening hello ... welcome to have you with us\nAnything uh you know I think on this subject to a rat I think you know the two wars that stuck out\nTo me was peaceful tranquility and as you mentioned as we have in our nation America\nOr that opposed to me one nation by did as hot as in an intensifying with the most recent issues whether it's the cabinet off or immigration or Republican or Democrat\nI'm Wondering what nation if as independent they just like when they will make a law of their own name we should look at her own United States and say OK\nCurrently I'm living in Florida because Republicans have a certain philosophy of the way they would like to see things on\nMaybe we should make Florida simply a Republican state\nDemocrats have a certain way with which they like to see things done or whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you\nMaybe we should make 'em Texas Democratic state\nAnd maybe if we had each individual day have the Democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that have those philosophies belonging to Democrats or Republicans couldn't live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell then as soon as the course of the people read freely mobile and also assumes that we can still be dictated one of the state is now granted election returns may also indicate a which direction estate goes but uh the notion of a viscerally establishing something\nAre and how would you feel in Florida was determined to be the opposite of you what are you going to just pack up and leave\nSure I Would say that there would be more peace and tranquility in a state that whoever supported\nMe they ... they whether it be both abortion or not for abortion people live in that state there would be much happier and it wouldn't be in my opinion and much more productive state\nMost people have much closer ties to localities and bad I mean you ... are quite willing to do move wherever whenever but other people have\nFamilies they have the jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful for suddenly all the Republicans are in uh Florida in let's say removed a joy\nWhat are you going to do it at the point of a gun I mean I mean it it just it honestly Helene strikes me as just a tad unrealistic really as long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a free society that'd be very simple but\nMuch lower than they\nAre not some are some many or not\nI mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and willing to send ... will light it's kind of like if they don't like it up north it's old St Louis downtown\nOh they can but you're talking about or forcibly moving them\nI think for a movie with the\n... [laughter]\nWell that they're going to be happy where they live well\nBut they're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave lift the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can only well let's look at what point their values are just the ... she used to be unhappy because my own but\nOf course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so you know again uh I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution do you draw any lessons from that you're wrong\nWell I I I think it raises an important historical point the United states was\nOr as you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the is it the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution\nWas a was a deal that was supposed to allow exactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character that Helene is talking about so all all of us are look back and are appalled at the at the question of of slavery\nBut we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nOr had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states have just messed up if\nIf you want it to live in that that kind of a place then then you would live in Massachusetts in Connecticut and if you want it to live someplace else then you'd you'd probably moved to New York\nAnd um\nIt it is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery um but but when you get to
