capitalism entrepreneurial is more going to dump all over them\nAnd there are a bunch of stories today along these lines ... the top one that comes to mind is there's one from Kim Kelly over a team

Kelly wrote this had seen votes they're trying to teach teenage girls that\nCapitalism is defined as an economic system in which a country's trade industry in profits are controlled by the company instead of by the people whose timing labor power those company United States and many other nations around the world are capitalist country\nThe capitalism is not the only economic system available throughout history other countries have embrace other systems like socialist communism what's important to explore what capitalism actually is\nHuman recently reported that sixty six percent of people between the ages of Twenty one and thirty two have nothing saved for retirement\nHowever according to the salon the reason many millennials haven't been investing in mutual fund or building up their own financial mess that isn't because there are two broke or did they ... personal responsibility it's because they think our current economic system capitalism will cease to exist by the time they're

not really a tax plan it's mostly ... taking money from some people and giving money to other people and people\nSo senator Kamala Harris has come forward with a new quote unquote tax plan isn't really a tax plan it's mostly just taking money from some people and giving money to other people and the people who are getting the money don't really pay much tax in the first place so\nTo continue with with Harris is ... she's offering as much as three thousand dollars a year for a single person or six thousand dollars a year for a married couple on top of the existing tax in France for programs dispersed either as a lump sum tax refund or his monthly payment as many as eighty million Americans would benefit\nSo who is going to pay for all of this the answer is that they don't care\nThat really is the answer they said that this is going to jog the economy because if you give a bunch of money to people at the bottom end of the economic spectrum this is what creates economic growth that is not true and never been true what jobs economic growth is the creation of new products and services that create new jobs and then also allow people to buy cooler stuff\nSocialism is about freezing the economy in place and redistributing all the pilots in the room\nThe capitalism is that expanding the size of the pie that doesn't mean that everybody is going to get an equal distribution of the pie but it does mean that you're going to be able to generate new and better types of pie bigger pie\nEverything that makes ... awesome otherwise you can just freeze it and distribute it until there is no pilot that's basically the socialist model so where are they going to pay for all of us I Love how the Atlantic describes ... proposal\nOf course the federal proposals would come and significant cost in some cases on the scale of the Trump tax cuts or the Affordable CARE Act\nWas not the same thing from the tax cuts are not things that costs money their meat paying less money into the federal government that is not a federal cost a federal cross you spending my money not and you're telling me I get to keep my own money\nIs not a cost to what someone keep their own money\nThe way that this measure doesn't say suggesting the Affordable CARE Act which is a government expenditure based on tax receipts is the same thing as cutting tax receipts by saying that people can keep the money is eight sleight of hand a fiscal sleight of hand\nThe brown legislation would cost at one point four trillion dollars over a decade the Harris legislation would come in at something like two hundred billion dollars per year which means to ... dollars over the course of a decade\nHarris has proposed repealing the Trump tax cuts to pay for her bill but that is not even come close to covering the kind of cross she's talking about and they're talking about universal health care and they're talking about free child welfare and they're talking about ... or ... free childcare and they were talking about free college tuition none of this stuff is going to get paid for\nSo why why it has is they're all this enthusiasm for this sort of stuff in a time when we have as of yesterday seven million unfilled jobs in the United states a four percent unemployment rate and historically booming economy why are we talking about undermining the pillars of capitalism because we've shifted our mindset in the United states\nAnd this is really what I Want to talk about today we have shifted our mindset when it comes to what our wives should be like\nWe believe we are guaranteed things here in the United states we believe that we are guaranteed a solid level of living because we live here you hear this from Bernie Sanders all the time in the richest country in the world should we really have people who don't have enough money to buy all the things that they could possibly all\nYou hear that from Bernie Sanders all the time the assumption there being you were born here you deserve stuff you were born here therefore America's rich therefore you get stuff baseline assumption you're entitled to things here is what you are entitled to in a free country you're entitled to adventure\nThat's what you're entitled to your born entitled to exercise your rights\nIn pursuit of adventure you get to make up your own story here that's the American dream the American dream is people who are coming from across the street to a place they did not know to an environment that we're not used to and building lives for their families and creating prosperity from the ground up the American story is people crossing the Appalachians\nYou're wilderness they did not know places that had not been willing to areas where they had no allies settled down roots and trying to build housing civilization\nDemocrats they'll tell them what they want to talk about what can we do to make your life better\nAnd the answer is very little the real question is what can you do to make your life better because every successful ... person on planet earth is a person who at some point said to themselves what can I Do to help myself\nAmerica is a country of people saying to themselves what can I Do to help my ... in life what can I Do to be more ambitious what can I Do to stretch my wings and fly\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that wind what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way what can we do to remove the barriers\nThat's the American way is not the American way say listen you know ... it's uncomfortable to structure wing it may be difficult to leave home it may be hard to do this\nBut it so so we're just going to make sure you know you never have to\nWe're going to cuddle you were going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits we're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy because he's coming from a place of you can innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can innovate your country on the basis of empathy alone\nAnd that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation and something\nIt's more cynical the purposeful innovation of an entire sector of the population\nSpecifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAnd after he look at tells like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades because the failure of this sort of of thinking is evident in major cities and counties across the United states\nIf he actually wants to reinvigorate the American spirit we're going to have to teach people the same lesson the gods taught Abraham at the very beginning of the Bible they get up leaves a hole that you were born in and go to a place you do not know\nThat's how we become bigger that's how we become better as hell wives become better that's how the world becomes better trade becomes better is why you have cool stuff is white culture has become better because they experience and don't talk about other cultures\n... this notion that we can hunker down now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do is hunker down and live in and redistribute what's in our backpacks those backpacks are going to run out ... there's not the way any of this worth okay so in just a second I Want to talk about this fascinating article in the New York times about why scientists\nAre are now attempting to avoid actual research out of your of the all right but first let's talk about how you go out at night you come home from work you need to get ready to go to a party you need to get ready to go out to dinner how are you getting ready a shower and wash the workday off your style in your hair brushing your teeth I'm asking because our US UN\nIf you are you should be a proud member of dollar shave club as I Am and I'm here to tell you no matter what you do to get

teeth are part of how you get ready to go out but no matter what you do to get ready DSD has everything in it we haven't even talked about their razors and shave butter which they are famous for right now you can get a dollar shave club stars that for just five bucks apiece\nThey've got a shower set toothpaste and toothbrush that's or they're famous shave butter and razor anyone of us at five bucks the best way to try other amazing product after you're suckers that partnership regular price get yours today a dollar shave club dot com slash Ben\nThat dollar shave club dot com slash men so there's a fascinating article in the New York times I Want to talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics the article from New York Times is titled why white supremacist are chugging milk and why geneticists are alarmed\nAnd here's what they say is from Amy Harmon nowhere on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetics being held in San Diego this week is the topic like many of its members they'll curry appropriation of the field research in the name of white supremacy sticking your neck out on political issues is difficult\nTo Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee\nWho sought to convene a panel on the racist misuse of genetics and found little traction but the specter of the fields and the media is passed which includes support for the American eugenics movement lose large for many geneticist in light of today's white identity politics they also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis\nOf hot button traced like intelligence will be misconstrued that racist ideology is an argument that I have a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane costs and over at Fox or Jane is black and\nAnd I think rightly has great sensitivity and they everybody should have great sensitivity but I think Jane would suggest that her background contributes to the sense to me I'm with regard to the races past of the United states and the and the racist\nAssociation between politics and bad science and so this has led to some serious conversations between the two of us about political correctness about whether in fact there was an appropriate time to talk about IQ for example or standardized testing for example or about that natural differences between men and\nLike one can't talk about biology without being condemned and sexist or racist you know real issues that we have to discuss and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that scientists out of context and then use that to ... mission minority group\nAnd that's basically what this New York times articles about his in recent months some scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers in far right Internet forum others have fielded confused where he's about claims of white superiority\nWrapped in the jargon of human genetics misconceptions about how genes factor into America sock racial disparities\nHave surfaced in the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gaps\nImmigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like school circumference and family pedigrees according to experts to track the far right\nToday's proposal racial hierarchy are making their case by misinterpreting research on the human genome itself\nInto base that have been largely limited to every Californian the scientist whose job it is mine human the humanities genetic variations for the collective good are grappling with how to respond if there's a real way to respond oldest\nPut out the science and then to fund the science that's the way to respond all of it and said the scientists afraid that their science is going to be misappropriated misinterpreted or used for bad reasons\nThey've decided that they're going to simply squash all of this discussion internally\n... University of Chicago evolutionary biologists\nHe says studying human genetic diversity is easier in a society where diversity is clearly valued and celebrated right now that is very much on my mind once my doctorate of Embry has folded into his recent talks to picks a group of white nationalist trucking milk at a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait known to be more common and white people than others the ability to digest lactose as adults\nAnd also she was a social media posts on account and called entered the milk zone with a map lifted from a scientific journal article on the traits evolutionary history and most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lactose\nSwitches off after childhood but with the arrival of the first cattle herders and Europe some five thousand years ago a chance mutation that left to turn on provided enough of nutritional led up to nearly all of those who survived eventually carried it\nAnd then the post shows a snippet of hate speech urging individuals' an African ancestry to leave America saying if you can drink milk you have to go back well\nI mean so what they're idiots in one of the great ironies of of white supremacist stupid people on the planet they're constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb houses it's one of the things that's so funny it's like if you're going to proclaim white superiority\nYou really shouldn't send your best is I'm In a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetic stuck in November he warned that research is wrapped in numerous habeas that are likely to get lost in translation\nBecause people are forcing DNA ancestry test indicating exclusively European heritage\nBut the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is a con founding factor when you look at it from eating racism to America so take for example\nRacial disparities in education\nSo there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels eligible to get them into college and the suggestion is that it is historic American racism that his ... that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system\nIn alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups\nAnd that's true not just with regard to black and white it's not worth forgot to white and Asian white people score lower on the SATs Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that is genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly fought question\nIn science but suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example test scores is a mistake and we just to the wrong outcomes and we just to the wrong measures students and deal with those outcomes genetics is not the answer\nThese disparities but neither is racism\nNow these are questions we have to be very careful that because obviously you don't want to give material to people who are suggesting that people some people are and they are inherently are inherently worse or more evil or more violence or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't wind up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because you're a scientist\nSo it it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo there there are doctors who have organized meet is a social scientist and social implications of the field newest tools David Nelson a Baylor College of medicine geneticist who's president of the human genetics and society says it will not stay completely quite on the issue is that there is no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology which\nIs true because racism is a moral view and genetics is they scientific view and scientific racism is the use of science in order to be racist and it's not the use of science in order to pursue good and\nOr the theme of the stories and Snow White shouldn't be taking apples from

him I did it back and back in that but on the Internet he had been in the public eye\nThese years and not one time that they call them those nasty nasty and they got to run against Hillary Clinton\nWell certainly there was a shall we say a major turn around and ... and when they want when he won\nThen obviously that is something that a major sector of this country has not come to terms with they cannot accept that he won make him out except that he signs bills into law economic subsidies dictates national policy in accordance with the\nThe constitution or this was a major problem for men and it's been about two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in ... yeah he really did win\nWhat willy willy with all of a complex Schmidt look at what he's achieved within two years have done more than Obama could do an eight year but they don't like that this than President Trump is not\nA career politician is a businessman I always say if you want to know what's going on with the body look at the head to head as prosecutors and successful the body of people are going to be profitable if that's if that's the one look at the day what's happening\n[noise] there's no question about the fact that he's really had a major impact into I'm Wondering how you you got to be connected with his campaign I mean obviously there are a lot of people out there who\nWho a rally to his his support but not many people have gotten to actually speak at a at a rally is held on for a candidate Trump and and then President Trump's how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nAt all I can tell somebody from is kept it out for us\nUm and it just it's spelled out from there he came in North Carolina there was no way that it was going to be in North Carolina we not be there\nSo it was a race for us to be at one of his rallies he invited on his day to day but it's like we didn't have to take his Mike He gave it to us to let us say whatever we want to say in front of all of those cameras back there that that was it was probably over a hundred of them\nAnd I'm Out there that that was that was just it just snowballs out there that I think that next January and Mississippi opening up for a rally\nAnd we've opened up the so many of them yeah um it I just can't column and that's I think they didn't plan it we didn't we didn't have to talk to anybody it's always been like that it's just everything just don't bother to all this and they\nReally think about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time\nHe is about the people he or the people real people um he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct Donald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president\nI mean he ... he look at who we hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire\nEven though he has a billionaire he just said activity that I don't yeah I Do with the people and hope that people have you know he was because he heard us go ahead\nSay Oh yes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to the people nobody bought him he's not beholden into\nHollywood or the lobbyist nobody bought him a paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in office\nTo analyze it all and look at the left wing media how they spend the laziest gossip stories and they always mayor who they fear they fear him because they know when they don't try to stop the losers but they will try and stop all winter\nNow they they certainly are they begin to aim at you of course now to where you are women you are African American and oh that really sets off the the far left crowd because you people have minds of your own and you're not doing what you're told to do another\nThat they will come a long time and they are taken out like\nYou know the air or what they're saying that

comments about\nThe two things that they're not in my mind is it seems like the rubber Germans Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and the\nOther quiet and I think we've been quiet because they do not want Donald Trump and start talking about how much money they pocketed the ending up what they said they were standing up for people's rights when really they were lining their pocket right or not talking too much and then the other thing I Would say is if you're the one more thing I just\nI I think it's very interesting in in in one of you just hit on it a few minutes ago you ladies are so smart\nBut

Hannah joke from Westwood One radio we're at one eight six six five oh Jim both one eight six six five oh five four six to six online find this a jumbo had on Joe dot com you can\nFollow me on Twitter at Jim Botox we will talk in this port to the program about the American role in the world and that is of course has been the subject of controversy from the moment this country was founded\nAnd it has increased in importance over the years as the size of the power of the United states has grown our responsibilities have grown and this old world of ours has shrunk because of\nThe jet aircraft in satellites and the Internet and the host of other factors we are a part of this planet and a major part of this planet whether we like it or not and so we're talking this evening\nWith Robert Kagan he is the freedom and senior fellow with the project on international order and strategy\nIn the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution a columnist for the Washington Post author of a number of books including his latest the jungle grows back it's published by come up and sometimes in America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nThey round me\nThat's a quite a title the jungle grows back and what's the derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know the well they've been living in for all its flaws it's been pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world a forces coming from China and Russia\n... or is that you know want to sort of destroy the oil and created and that's what I mean by the jungle growing by leaps continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over in the Gulf us\nAnd and now of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as or none of our business\nNone of our business let's just to stay out of the world to uh keep an arm's length here will just to sit back on our own shores and make our country better and we won't we will go meddling is somewhat but it\nThat we should intervene abroad in various places specifically the middle east\nHaving spent some time in our past life in official down the hall as the um I just disagree with his premise that the Iraq War was justified or that we should be after I started at all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years we've got changed ... of the country\nYou're thoughts police are\nWell I think we have not been effective in Afghanistan or you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacked some there are I think we would have been done better if we had taken a kind of out from Afghanistan or they had an opportunity to attack us which is something that we bought\nA ... during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I Know I'm not going to go back and say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I I still have a hard time believing which better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nOr that would be yet another vicious dictator or that we can now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes of the country or I certainly the stakes\nAre in St Louis about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there on our way ah unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nOr one as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the governments of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the\nProblem I think we have in many cases is thinking that we could do things like this on the cheap and the quick\nA particularly the second ... Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the or\nThe underpinnings of the ah Saddam regime and the entire country will rushed to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road [noise]\nThat's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we\nThe lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen what else to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists or says\nAh you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything that we should be everywhere but there are places what we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nWell six six five oh Jim Bo when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who comes in from east Texas and oh Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim or if it's a I always enjoy your show you know you it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now is a historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world that was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMap to the world and that brought marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map the while they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us\nTo the point that we are today and I feel if that is inevitable and America seems to be the uh the chosen vehicles or the inevitable\nA position that we find ourselves in the world today what we are combating a individualistic notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's that's\nSomething that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question that the caller's right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position or that no other country was in and I some of that had to do with geography you know we talked about\n... surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there a that would eventually Gulf us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect\nAn international economy the way the benefit of the road so I think that you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there is an arc of history I guess ... by\nA certainly United States has shaped history where that's where this since well yes\nAnd then of course it is that this might be if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet in a position to be able to\nAh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a available ah ah to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means or anywhere in the world and bus gill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight ... gill\n[noise] here's Jim I'm just weren't comment on uh on on your shirt views on\n... like a career and like Japan has um treaty ah arrangements are with the United states and under certain conditions are we going to be a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict with is is there for Korea or Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize it or not that many years ago this was United States territory\nNineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many ah potential\nThe United states territory [noise] until Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many ah potential major conflicts exist and that is to say I'm not sure just exactly how many countries out there\nOr are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a well artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters point taken\n[noise] All right let's not against comment about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea\nAnd the possibility that that these are arrangements might drag us into a large conflict of Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies or it will deter or\nA China from attacking whereas if we hold back and and and those kinds of it that\nWay will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we'll get thrown in that conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable our lives out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain ease and a half to get into wars if we think we could stay out of a conflict\nThat involve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last half century we can stay out of those kinds of consulates\nAnd if we try to do so uh uh if we try in other words to go for quote the peace and honor in our time will usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know we talk about all offshore balance but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties the consequences of that was a happy by a sore so I think it's better to ... or the or the security arrangements [noise]\nStay with us a more to come by one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Robert Kagan our guest use me Freedman senior fellow\nWith the project on international order and strategy at the foreign policy program of the Brookings Institution online at Brookings dot edu use a columnist for the Washington Post author of the return of history at the end of dreams\nAre dangerous nations uh paradise in power and the twilight struggle you served in the state department and the deputy for policy and the bureau of in American Affairs or graduate of Yale and Harvard University's Kennedy School [noise]\nWait six six five oh Jim bow our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six more from our guests Robert Kagan and your calls on mobile had a show in a moment\n\nYou know in a way it's precisely because there is such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually\nYou know the divisions we have today they're like neighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagree with people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line\nUh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had between a slave holding south and a capitalist north so I think we're we're obviously ingrained disagreement and we see polarization ah but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstances\nWell I certainly am happy to hear you say that and I certainly hope and and I actually think that you are correct Carolyn ... Pennsylvania now but eating and Carol\nYou say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call [laughter] Carol [noise]\nI don't really say much all I Want to say I am against the United states doing any first strikes\nWell okay I'm not sure that ah that we have any comment plated or as a matter of uh of your thought process Robert Kagan a I guess we would have to define a further first strike\nI doubt that were of a mind to go around and let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of auction of option although my guess would be that there may be\nPlaces and circumstances in which\n... proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion beneficial\n[noise]\nI mean we certainly I we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons in a first strike that's that's not been our policy in it and it it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a a crisis\nUh the might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA ... in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that or as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do it as intelligent lives selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about the\nEnd of the key is in the term of first strike\nA more to come ... six six five oh jumbo what should be the American role in the world regardless of what we would like it to be what

got away New Jersey on mobile Hannah Joe hello Lance\nAngry when can boast even Mr warrior wearing tank for going\nIn um where you're right there is a ... you know these human species are definitely in perfect better and we were highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original ashtray tragedy of the commons\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources or do they will come to conflict rather than a compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical so I mean\nPeople just don't get along at certain points in times when they think something of of reserve a value for them or their Vera ethnicity is going to be taken away in jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnother goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAnd at the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is any of the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was was somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course\nIndia and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that they in fact a later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you want to look at those conflicts alone or South Africa which is still troubled today to be sure but there's been no all out war there\nOr Northern Ireland which still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure what Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think the conflicts can be contained and that's what you know we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and help people evading shut us forever in fighting each other forever\nOr you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries\nAnd people said well how can how can we expect to bring Europe to peace and yet and yet we were able to now I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily do in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example\nA and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nOr not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nAnd then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test year ... things are made better I think that's a much more a plausible a litmus test for any course of action to thank you for your call let's go to Charlotte a\nCarolina Hi Charlotte [noise] hell in jail thank you [laughter]\nI'm probably going to be a very very unpopular color tonight but I guess so
