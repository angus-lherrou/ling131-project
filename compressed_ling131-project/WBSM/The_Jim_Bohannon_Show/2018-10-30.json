weekend\nWell let's let's jump into the news over the weekend obviously the worst estimates shooting attack in the history of the United states eleven people murdered in a synagogue during what we call it Brittany law\nA British which is where an age old boy\nCircumcised and the baby naming ceremony takes place at that point as a conservative synagogue not politically conservative synagogue a religiously conservative synagogue in Judaism in American Judaism anyway there's several branches of Judaism I'm an Orthodox Jew which means deeply observing keeps habits don't drive on Saturday keep kosher there's conservative Judaism which is\nSort of less orthodox people drive on sad that they sort of a former cabinet or they don't keep kosher but they have certain respect for it to our laws in any case\nThis conservative synagogue didn't have much security and an anti Semitic white supremacist but I repeat myself walk into the synagogue armed with an Arab Fifteen and proceeded to shoot up the ... he was screaming at the time all Jews must die so obviously cell phone\nSo why does this matter first of all I think that we need to get something off the table right away when an anti Semitic attack occurs\nYou generally don't need to bother blaming particular politicians anti Semitism is literally as old as the Jewish people literally as old as the Jewish people and other politicians and past who called for anti Semitism their politicians in the past ... actively called for murder of Jews\nI'm not seeing a lot of those on today's Americans being there are a lot of politicians on Native American scene hobnobbing with anti Semite who make common cause with anti Semitic we'll get to all of that in just a second but folks were blaming the left or the right for the answer to mention that happened yesterday white supremacist ... an anti Semitic attacks on Jews\nHave existed for decades in this country long before anything that is going on in today's politics and that's not to downplay what's happening in today's politics is what the rest of the show is going to be about but let's just be clear about this\nWhen it comes to attacks on Jews there is nothing new under the sun legitimately nothing new under the sun I don't know a single Jew\nShares a single Jew who is not one degree removed from a violent attack on a Jew and that's not say that America's violent country for ... it is not America is you have this country in world history for ...\nAmerica's incredible place for Jews but because the Jewish population is so small and because so many Jews know each other and because the Jews sort of consider themselves and extended family just as Christians consider themselves and extended religious family\nIt's difficult not to feel it deeply obviously when when an attack like this takes place in the history of the Jewish people are still the fractious division but history history the Jews the court closely bound unit Jewish identity isn't really a choice it's a reality majority has obscured the philosophy is that the fact is that\nDo you think that if the party that main line Keith Ellison and tries to make and head of the DNC after he uses and it's been years backing was ... or do you think that it might be the party that opposes that\nMainstream members in the Democratic party routinely hobnobbing with anti Semite she for the Jewish community really for for Jews really care about being Jewish there's not a ... of difference between a Jew being murder for being a Jew in Jerusalem a Jew being murdered for for being Jewish in France or tripping murder for being Jewish and Pittsburgh it's all of the piece\nIt's a real talk about anti Semitic rhetoric and who's to blame for white and Jewish that the world over a rise in hate crimes the world over the ... actually talk about what wants to talk about that I think what they want to partisan hacker it\nWell maybe are happy to talk about President Trump winking and nodding at the outright and

nodding at the alt right and twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen as I say and has said many times over I was there I remember I condemned it I still condemn it by the fact is we need to be honest about them\nLet's be clear about this when President Trump\nTried to wake and not at All right he was taking the British group a fringe group\nThat was not associated with the conservative movement and he was working and not to get them for political purposes and then you toss them out on their ear which is why they're angry with him in mainstream Democratic Party mainstream Democratic Party and the left in this country have decided that it is perfectly fine to hobnobbing with people who support anti Semitic terrorism\nThey've decided that's okay I'm not blaming those folks what happened in Pittsburgh that's not their fault either\nBut if we're going to talk about rhetoric and its impact on anti Jewish sentiment the world over I'm going to go with the folks who every time there's war in the Gaza Strip suggest that use the world over are to blame or suggest that Israel is to blame for defending itself or suggest that when Jews are attacking a kosher supermarket in France that that it it's a random attack\n... what's condemn murder it I'm happy to separate rhetoric from violence I'm having to that at all sides are going to talk\nRhetoric you have to condemn rhetoric when it happens where it happens and for whom it comes to I condemned President Trump when he was candidates from doing this nonsense will be All right I did it over and over and over at the same thing with folks on the left I don't see anyone on ... doing the same thing to folks on what they see them only doing it to folks on the right for partisan political reason that's all I'm seeing I'm seeing a bunch of people do get a\nGood damn when a Jew gets killed and Jerusalem popping out of the woodwork to say that the white is responsible for what just happened in Pittsburgh over while championing an ... millions of people have uranium have their way\nIn debt is partisanship that's disgusting partisanship and I'll show you that sort of partisanship in just a second because that's\nThe point where they were actually gonna talk about policy let's temperate rhetoric and policy for just a second hey ... again I'm the one thousand time when anti Semitic literature\nRhetoric that touch anti Semitism takes place I Will condemn it now when strongly as I have him go back and listen to the show I've done it every step of the way against people on all sides I don't care I'll keep doing it because it's the right thing to do well to the same thing with racist rhetoric I'm happy to do it on every side\nHave now let's talk about policy which policy is getting she was killed if you're talking about policies that lead the Jews dying\nIn President Trump's policy the bombing administrator and why the American people and promoted in ... that gave the mullahs the clear pathway to a nuclear weapon\nPresident from not only move the embassy to Jerusalem you also cut off aid to the ... the anti Semitic openly in Medicare supporting Palestinian Authority your bomb in his ration tied to make Israel make concessions to those terrorists\nIf I'm In ... in the middle of the Gaza War in two thousand fourteen threatened to cut off military supplies to the Israelis you're bombing minutes ration was just blatantly not only anti Israel but\nFrom a promotional or the wing of of progressive views for progressive isn't came first and Judaism came second\nSo if you're talking about policy that led to a dead Jews forget the forget the location\nThan you actually have to talk about not going to talk about any of that stuff obviously we're going to talk about any of that stuff so that was talking about how the media actually responded to this because it's ... it's just tremendously dishonest so let's start with a media story that\nSorry this is all this deeply upsetting deeply upsetting because we should all be on the same side when it comes to anti Semitism I think we probably all would be on the same side when it comes to anti Semitism but nobody's actually willing to call it anti Semitism and when and where it exist on any side\nReally that's what we're going now Trump allies set the tone for violence in as critics say well that's that's a fun way to journalism critics say the one I have an opinion I just say\nWhen Washington Post has an opinion they just say critics say\nHow convenient how convenient and then you have Julian ... is a show called journalistic GQ now she has a reason to be that a Trump back in two thousand Fifteen thousand sixteen\nShe wrote a piece for GQ about millennia Trump wasn't very nice and a bunch of all writers attach her announcement of fashion President Trump was asked about it he didn't condemn it that was gross that was stupid and that was wrong I said so at the time go back and listen to the take\nHay but Julie ... offer rocker here's what she tweeted too overwhelming gentile telling me what to think and not the ... and not going to think about the Senate auction today highly shut up today's or they'd be quiet\nNo everyone is entitled to their opinion the question is whether that opinion is good or not like for example Julie ... Jew or opinions suck\nRight here was her her second take on this\nAlert to my fellow Americans use the president makes this possible here where you live I Hope the embassy move over there where you don't live was worth it because she's now it's using Jews in the United states voted for President Trump or support President Trump now of drew loyalty they care about Jews in Israel but not used in America because the president is getting killed in America well he's being pro Israel\nFor the fact that the shooter specifically hated President Trump and except for the fact that you don't get to blame Jews for how they vote on Jews getting killed about blaming the victims\nNow do anybody at the synagogue voted\nMaybe they voted for Trump maybe they didn't it doesn't matter you don't get to blame people for the death of other people when they have no connections in the death of other people\nBut this is what the left and decided to do they've decided that every bad thing that happens in the country from an evil person has to be the result of President Trump's rhetoric now again\nI condemned President Trump when it came to the white stuff but you can't show me the connection that is solid between what happened at the Pittsburgh Senegal and President Trump's alt right the number one and number two\nIf we're going to talk about rhetoric that leads to violence against Jews that's going to open a whole can of worms I don't think the left wants to open\nIn ... she was just\nAn idiot and many of these Ralph ... Ralphie from from The Simpsons over and over ... weed out about Steve's college he just said this morning's attack as a reminder that anti Semitism and other forms of bigotry still persist in our society and must be confronted in combat at every turn Iglesias we didn't even do without the baggage\nEvery Republican is responsible for a white nationalist shooting up a synagogue ... I'm an Orthodox Jew this is a lie is a lot I go to synagogue way more than any of the people like what is so far in the show\nAnd not only that I'm seeing an argument being made we'll get to this in a second gun control argument that have been made by folks on the left in response to all of this you know my response to all of this is I'm going to start carrying a gun to shovel\nHey that's my response to all of this my responses Jews should be arm people and synagogues should be armed\nAnd you know why because white nationalist are not going to give up their gun\nEvil people don't give up their gun that means I Want more people at my school arm I Walk or security guards at Marshall that's all of that\nIn just a second but first let's talk about life insurance life insurance is certainly not the most enjoyable thing to talk about\nMost people don't like to think about what happens after God Forbid something happens to you but actually having life insurance is a really good feeling it's nice to know that if anything were to happen\nYour family won't have to start to go find me policy geniuses the easy way to get life insurance on line and just two minutes you can compare quotes from the top insurers to find the best policy for you and when you compare costs you save money it is indeed that simple policy genius has helped them or for a million people shop for insurance\nThey placed over twenty billion dollars in coverage they don't just do life insurance they also do disability insurance and auto insurance home insurance if\nYou care about it than coverage so if you've been avoiding getting life insurance because it's difficult for confusing your policy genius of tried just go to policy genius dot com air quotes applying minutes into the whole thing on your phone right now policy geniuses indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance there's no reason for you to put it off it's actually irresponsible for you\nNot to have life insurance policy genius makes everything really easy because again in two minutes you can compare quotes from the top insurers and find the best policy for you go save money policy genius dot com it's the easy way to compare and by life insurance\nAs I say members of the Democratic left have decided that when an anti Semitic shooting takes place in Pittsburgh that has nothing to do with President Trump is obviously President Trump's fault\nAnd they've continued with his narrative Franklin for who is a columnist over the last year and a phone call him basically on this idea that members of the Jewish community who support Republicans are responsible he tweeted the organized shunning of Sheldon Adelson jerk pushing on other ... as a matter of protecting the security of the community\nSo we got this right being mean to Jared Kushner is now going to prevent shootings and synagogues\nMhm being mean to Sheldon Adelson one of the great supporters of Israel in the United states and one of the great supporters of Jewish programs like both right in the United states that is somehow going to make you safer in the United states\nSo if you're ... or if you elect Keith Ellison or if you like a bunch of Democrats who openly hobnobbing with one that's our store and that makes you safer but if your son the most pro Israel presidents in American history\nAnd any Jew who supports that President even walk in his rhetoric than you are somehow making the Jewish community safer\nAnd then you get ... like Adam Schiff again Democrat from California he says President Trump\nTone of hatred this is easy argument only again this is just an extension of the argument made last week about the bombing attempt against democratic members that rhetoric is is what causes violence\nI don't remember any of these conversations happening on mainstream television after Bernie Sanders supporters shot up a bunch of Congress people on a congressional baseball field I don't remember these conversations happening for bolder than to date was out of the headlines immediately now we're going to get nothing but this for months because this was always what let's be clear about something this was always going to be the Democratic narrative\nAlmost has nothing to do as President Trump that President Trump plays right into the heart of it because you can't shut his face but\nThis has almost nothing to do with President Trump is this happening under President Bush you get the same crap and this happened under President Romney you get the same crap would not matter people on the left side to suggest that I was responsible for the bombing attempt last week or folks on the left side to suggest that I ... I Believe what happened in Pittsburgh\nAnd you can you can separate out all these issues you can condemn bad rhetoric when you see it on any side without doing this routine is part is in fact job where Adam Schiff that suddenly the great arbiter of decent rhetoric in the middle of a terrible political time\nNo one sets the tone more than ... ... and the tone that he says is one of division off in one of hatred or sometimes one of incitement to violence against journalists are and there's no escaping or collective responsibility but there's always scraping the tone of your search for the country\nOkay it's just ... again I agree that President from France in a better at home for the country to blame President Trump's tone for everything that has happened to your to Fort is insane in total the country was already off the rails by twenty twelve it's been years since we've had a decent political conversation in this country is being very very long time\nBut let's not pretend that the war started spending when President Trump suddenly entered the political spent ... scene and let's stop pretending that the Democratic party has clean hands when it comes to association with anti Semite\nNow what are the one of the more school is a tax on on Trump and folks on the right is be suggestion that if you're a critical of George Soros you were somehow anti Semitic\nSo there's been a big narrative put out by folks on the west that George Soros who was a lean democratic donor that if you criticize George Soros by suggesting that he gives a lot of money to causes there and the various than this means that your somehow anti Semitic\nNow you can attach or source in an anti Semitic way you can suggest that he's part of the Jewish ... tempting to run the country but it seems to me that the criticism of George sauce on the right on the mainstream white has been\nNo more market and the criticism Sheldon Adelson unless\nIt seems to me that the criticism of George Soros is very much akin to the criticism of the Koch brothers\nOn the left and yet the idea now is that we're going to spend every critique of George those into this is all about George Soros is Jewish heritage which is nonsense and but again CNN is pushing this let's say you're\nBlaming them are you blaming them and blaming them for pretty much just on the air and not you know correct and get him in real time and I so far so I go twelve hours later doing nothing about it and I believe me honestly at this level after we have soccer is also the lower end groove and I've known who these people in the past\nRight on TV every night on blaming the marriage where the Fox and the investors in fact what he's talking about here there was a far in this\nGas who said that the caravan had something to do with the Soros the soils run State Department or something like that and now is that as a medic\nNo and then ... idiotic but it's not anti Semitic and George Soros doesn't run the state department but the idea that going after George Soros various force in American politics is somehow inherently anti Semitic is ridiculous and the same way as ingesting the going after Sheldon Adelson is inherently anti Semitic when he was a major donor to the Republican Party\nBut Democrats are looking for a narrative they found a convenient narrative again I'm not going to pretend I'm not going to pretend that the left as clean hands when it comes to fighting anti Semitism and they certainly not in the women's march pointed out their sympathy for all of this and it's when it's read some benefits\nIn our grief to action with with at Jewish Action than a clear message that the Americans you know like a tax can never happen again if you're not in DC tuning around three PM ...

screen better [laughter]\nThe Jewish people have always stood up and they've said yes they're willing to stand with life is the free life synagogue and willing to stand with life and because they're willing to stand with like there are those who want that there are those who want western civilization broken down there are those who want religion destroyed there are people who are evil out there\nThe Jews have stood against that the Jews will continue to stand against this and and if you are part of the right side and you will stand against it too and you'll do so without maliciously

allow\n... that's correct and they also depend on people like your caller if they were\nLooking through the to the source something suspicious to call it and\nI I Would note a distinction and the two cases we're talking about and the this is my language not anybody else's but in the case of the pipe bombs we seemed to be talking about a total lack job and in the case of the Pittsburgh shootings were talking about\nA a a very dedicated true believer or two entirely different kinds of cases\nAre two different types of individuals you're absolutely right\nUh I'd be thoughtful about the best way to approach either one\nWell I mean I think that if we talk about say Iraq the Florida bombing suspect\nYou you're talking about a very good law enforcement investigation that brought him into custody within days of his first bomb being delivered to George Soros and the amount of work that the NYPD\nThe joint terrorism task force of the FBI put into it to be able to bring it to such a conclusion to come up with the print\nTo run the print determine where he was by licenses and then put it out in plate readers it was a plate reader that saw his cargo by that alerted officers to allow the FBI in swat and everyone else to end the following morning you know\nWe have a call from mark in Huntsville, Alabama next to the evening mark\nHi Jim how you doing and I think you write well him I'm I'm a

yeah we kill him today tomorrow or next week oh I should not be on the table\nAll right ah and certainly I I understand obviously the motivation put forward by mark or Thomas ... uh for the record I happen to believe that uh the definitely has a place in American Justice so many others of course do not your your thoughts about that\nI say a lowly sorry that police killed him in the shootout that\nAnd I agree with or is or is he is trying to get it which is right in this country because we don't want to give up the rights of of of a trial by your ears if he is ... face\nAnd something to be added to that we have a case of what I call stupid lawyer tricks in this country past a certain number of appeals in a certain period of time you are playing games\nWith people on death row and I would argue that keeping people on death row perennially used in itself a form of cruel and unusual punishment I think there needs to be a limit on just how many stupid while you're correct you could pull there aren't that many ways in which\nReversible error and that and other bases legitimate bases\nFor appeals can be made beyond that then then leads to sentence in my ... my view your thoughts\nI totally right I Believe that a certain point in time you see that you're\nRight to appeal if you can be in a case like this this is very good evidence that he was the one who commit a

O. in [noise] and ah dot com of course to ah Alex in Hampton bays New York from the Jim ... good evening Alex welcome\nHey Jerry oh fine thank you\nGood I'm I'm just going\nIt's just crazy how the less spins everything to being Donald Trump's fault I mean ... you got I got I understand that you have not Charles on either side so you have the job that was supposedly at Trump's order that ... you know those bombs and everything like that but then you have a\nSpecific shooting which is a terrible tragedy but how do you blame him for that well\nI mean he is on record the shooter in Pittsburgh it's believed that Donald Trump as they try to use\nAt ... anti Donald Trump either that or either that's true I I just don't understand how that happens and I think the more that that do the liberal media\nThat the more that the right rises up and it's going to get out there and vote because that's really the only way you can dispute this but I'll look it up there in both\nThe I certainly am all in favor of everyone the getting out there in the in voting and the lives that brings us to our guest\nI've I Believe the as the caller that there is a great deal of blame placed on the president when in doubt blame the president on the other hand\nA President Trump I think at times is his own worst enemy he makes enemies he doesn't need to make and it's sometimes more interested in getting an applause line from his base is in the thinking about the the way he says things he creates problems for himself in in my view a doctor banks in\nFact you know I think that can be said of just about everybody who's ever served and political office but he clearly you know we've got our eyes on him but we have to situation here in San Juan where we have an avid avid Trump supporter\nAnd then on the heels and that that we've got a situation where someone who gets five is trapped\nSo it's not reasonable to blame but I found that President we have issues like this before Trump as president ... hot I mean and we will wait well that is the state of the world that we live in right now unfortunately go to blame that on someone critical office that's just kind of a cop out in my opinion\nI Would agree with you completely certainly unfair to blame these incidents on the president\nBut it's I think is fair to say that the president sets themselves up as an easy target for criticism sometimes maybe not maybe not fair criticism but as an easy target a and he could avoid some of that\nIf you would would simply go about about doing so let me ask you a doctor banks than about the state\nOf a mental health care and facilities in this country right now I Would assume that you would be among those who say we need more of everything a clinics money a therapist what have you\nOh so you're absolutely right Sam you know it it's not good for sure\nBut then there's plenty of room for improvement you know as a mental health provider in the field for Thirty years I've taken a pay cut every year because the rates of Medicare go down and the insurance goes with it and then where we were asked to see more patient and a shorter amount of time\nWhere you need a certain amount of time to make an accurate diagnosis that an accurate treatment plant and one individual can't find help\nWhen they just go further and further into that and in many of the situation worse team that there is a history of at least symptom\nEven if not diagnosable mental health conditions about what we're seeing in America is that the American Psychological Association has found that fifty nine percent of Americans consider to be at the lowest point in the United states and that's causing them strap\nAlthough it might help they if they understood something about American history well it early the sixties only you only have to go back fifty years to find a comparable period and if you go back a hundred and fifty years to ... the civil war and leading up to it it vastly exceeded today so again we have\nNo rational basis for that kind of stress worst in American history only says one thing that you don't know much about American history if you believe that\nI Would agree with you Jan button there in life the problems that problem is that we're dealing with people's perception\nAnd their perception is their reality so whether we're talking about a gunman or where talking about you know I'm not they're concerned about the price of diapers is obviously a facetious example but it goes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "30"}
