are not engaged in ... have decided that instead of the reason people are angry because they're white\nBlow who's aptly named over at the New York times he has a column today called white male victimization anxiety\nAnd here's what he says he says during the swearing in of justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to cabinet and his family on behalf of our nation that he terrible pain and suffering you've been forced to injure repeated the tire lines that he and Republicans hope will stick in your the comatose base to electoral for her\nThat accusations of sexual assault against cabin up what part of the campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception they were\nAnd what happens in the cabinet family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process\nIt did but here's Charles Blow perspective to me this was not just the president and party worried about and approaching blue wave and trying to take political advantage of the moment the victory it was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome that has consumed modern American conservatism\nBox has called it the unleashing of white male backlash\nThis is very bad by the way white males are not allowed to to find the right to say do this is just evidence that they are privilege so if white males are given due process than that shows the privilege and if they're not given due process and then they get angry that also shows that they're a privilege\nSo just like every other major left his argument these days the conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nAccording to Charles Blow the woman accusing the white man of assault weren't the victims and said the white man was a victim well to be accurate the actual accusation is that the women accusing the white man of assault didn't have any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever\nIn some people's eyes as low he was the victim of political correctness majors overage a check your white male privilege culture drunk on its own self righteousness which is owned which is true because that's what happened but that's not really what this is about according to Charles Blow\nKevin O's belligerence defense and Trump's dismissal of the accusers he mocked one and a political rally and called the accusations I Hope you'll recall that some folks like me criticized that and said that he shouldn't have mocked Christine Blasey Ford because he didn't know the facts either but according to blow it represents for many many back against the wall no more space retreat moment to fighting back pushing back\nA standing proud in their patriarchy and proclaiming that it will not bed\nNow due process is patriarchy now presumption of innocence is patriarchy low continued they're saying enough they will see no more ground they will share no more power they will accommodate no more ascendancy and validation of the oppressed\nNow you don't want to have the word allegedly a press there because again none of those allegations have actually been supported by any evidence he says that is what they're telling us and they are speaking through Trump\nHe says the victims sensibility Trump is articulating is not generationally restricted\nIn January a PR I MTV poll a Fifteen to twenty four year old ... forty three percent of young white men say discrimination against whites is this your is a problem as discrimination against other groups from the nine percent of young white women agreed with them and nearly half believe efforts to increase diversity will harm white people\nBecause by nature the definition of the left at times to increase diversity include harming white people meaning what the left wants from diversity is not ideological diversity or diversity of experience with the ... says is that we should give slots\nThat belongs you qualified white people do unqualified non white people is an actual point that the wet leaves it\nI don't even know how to less than argue this particular watching it doesn't make any sense if you are saying that there is a group of college admissions which too many are white and we need to replace some of those white people with non white people\nHow does that not Harlem white people you have to explain that one and as for the notion that discrimination against whites is as serious a problem is discrimination against other groups there are two ways to read that question and I think that there's one accurate way more inaccurate ... accurate ways to say that historically\nDefinitely discrimination against black folks is just ... it's it's not as bad as discrimination against like ... which I disagree and then there's a way to rate which is that as a whole lot less interested in stopping white kids\nReality is nothing like this says Yashua among\nOver at the Atlantic as scholars Steven Hawkins ... got to Marion won tours and Tim Dixon argue in a report published Wednesday hidden tribes study of America's polarized landscape most Americans don't fit into either of these kids\nThey also share more common ground than the daily fights on social media might suggest including a general aversion to PC culture\nThe study was written by more in common that organization founded in memory of Joe ... British MP murdered in the run up to the Brexit referendum was based on nationally represented poll of eight thousand respondents between December twenty Seventeen and September twenty Eighteen\nAnd here is what they find according to the report twenty five percent of Americans are traditional are devoted conservatives and their views are far outside the American mainstream some eight percent of Americans are progressive activists and their views are even less typical\nBy contrast two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme hurts to two and exhausted majority\nAnd that would be most of us and the traditional devoted conservative but I think I Would also probably be a member of the exhausted majority their members share a sense of the tea with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints and a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority and then some just like political correctness among the general population is ... eighty percent eighty percent believe political correctness is a problem in our country young people\nPolitical correctness Seventy four percent between twenty four and twenty nine Seventy nine percent under age twenty four the woke or any clear minority across all ages race is also a bad proxy\nWhites are less likely than average to believe political correctness has a problem less likely eighty two percent of Asians think political correctness has a problem eighty seven percent of Hispanics and political correctness is the problem is eighty eight percent of American Indians and political correctness is the problem\nI Love this one forty year old American indian and Oklahoma said that's what it seems like every day you wake up something has changed you said you are Jewish is a black guy African American you're on your toes because you never know what to say it's a political correctness in that sense it's scary\nThe only part of the standard narrative but the ... data partially from is it black folks in the United states are more likely to support political correctness but three quarters of blacks still opposed political correctness\nSo it turns out the vast majority of Americans in every racial category are annoyed by the woke crowd and they're insistence that nobody ever be offended\nSo Charles Blow state which is that we are allowed to racially polarized so long as we are targeting one political group that is not popular that's not popular\nEighty three percent responded to make less than fifty grand just like political correctness just Seventy percent of those who make more than a hundred grand are skeptical about it\nIs that means that the rich or you get more you liked political correctness so it's not poor people pushing political correctness minorities pushing political correctness is disproportionately rich white people pushing political correctness\nIt's amazing now there is a political gap here among conservatives Ninety seven percent believe political correctness is the problem of traditional liberal sixty one percent you the only ones who really really really like\nThe ... culture I progressive activists only thirty percent sea political correctness has a problem yeah far far outside of the mainstream so who's in this group according to the last thing I Love this\nCompared with the rest of the polling sample progressive activists are much more likely to be rich highly educated and white\nThey're nearly twice as likely as the average make more than a hundred grand a year they're nearly three times as likely to have a post grad degree and well twelve percent of the overall sample in the study is African American only three percent the progressive activists are\nIts rich white kids rich white kid those are the people who are creating a lot of the problems in our society right now with talk of divisive polarization and political correctness\nIn one second I'm to explain what the study means by political correctness is that sort of important we have to define our terms we'll get to that in just one second but first let's talk about your online security with

mean by political correctness\nAccording to the Lancet extended interviews and focus groups participants made clear they were ...\nTheir day to day ability to express themselves they worry that a lack of familiarity with the topic or an sinking word choice could lead to Syria social sanctions for them so they're not really sure what it means but they know that they don't like the feeling of restriction at the woke left has created\nBut there's plenty of support for the idea that Americans are not as neatly divided by age or race as is commonly believed according to a few only twenty six percent of black Americans consider themselves liberal nearly half of Latinos argue that many people nowadays are too sensitive how Muslims are treated to invite black folks say that an immigration nowadays is bad for America\nIn other words this notion that demographics is destiny which has been pushed by both sides of the political ALS a certain extent is just not true\nAnd there is no shrinking white majority that is going to inevitably lead to liberal domination and there is no inevitably increasing liberal majority that is going to lead to incredible victory over time\nPeople's minds can be changed in other words we are individuals we are not just members of groups that's really important to remember in the middle of what is a very very polarized news cycle and this is why the left has some serious problems even going forward\nNow that doesn't mean that the white can't do things to alienate folks the right obviously can do things to alienate folks and I would say there's a difference between being politically incorrect and being a jerk and this is where the right has to be careful\nNot everything that you say that as offensive is just you being politically incorrect sometimes you being a jerk if you use the N word that's not you being politically incorrect you being a jerk\nIf you say that men and women are different that is politically incorrect and you would not being a jerk when I Would recommend is that if you actually want to side with that middle of America that is tired of the standards that are being prevented by the left\nBe polite civil and be politically incorrect say things that are factual specifically because they are of factual and not merely to offend believe me you don't have to purposely offend the left the left will be offended anyway none of it matters\nIs what will always be offended I just spoke at USC last week and assassinate him as a young black woman who got to ask a question and she said you've been accused of inciting violence and I said well you've been here the whole time have you heard anything that you think would incite violence and she thought about it for a second and she said no\nOf course not of course not the reason that folks on the left suggested I incite violence is because they disagree with me\nThat is why well it turns out that most Americans would rather have disagreement than a few violence to somebody who's not involved in violence and when the left equates speech and violence and then says it their own violence is speech\nAll they're doing is alienating the vast majority of the American people left is now playing a game the Democratic party is playing a game speech of the right they say is violence because right when it was a bad\nAnd their own violence is speech so in the left goes in pounds on the doors of the Supreme Court and ask threatening that's just a form of speech that's just the anger according to CNN but if folks on the right to say stuff that offends people that's now form of violence on CNN headline news when I say a man is man and woman is a woman and some\nTransgender woman grips me by the back of the neck and Britain's me bottle bodily harm those two things are equivalent me saying a man as a man and woman is a woman according to the left is the equivalent of somebody grabbing me physically on national television and threatening to send me home and in an ambulance which is literally what happened the left\nIs engaged in in this really polarizing him and most Americans don't bite and\nThat's what we found out in the Trump in ... in in the Trump era most Americans don't buy it and that doesn't mean that Trump's gonna win from here to eternity it doesn't mean the Republicans always when Republicans are not good at this game they're not and again when you mistake politically correctness for being a jerk or vice versa you're making a rather large mistake yourself\nBut it is important to note that this notion on the left at the woke majority is just all the black people and all the women and everybody else it's just not true\nAnd that's a very very important thing to keep in mind we still have more in common than than not and you can be fooled by watching our politics are watching social media I get a little too but it's not reality\nSpeaking of folks are not living in reality there is a leaked report from Google was leads to Breitbart and it's just an amazing report\nTo abide by reports and internal company breathing produced by Google and leaked exclusively to Breitbart News argues that due to a variety of factors including the election of President Trump the American tradition of free speech on the Internet is no longer viable this goes to ... folks on the left have decided that if their speech they don't like is it promotes violence and that's it must be shut down\nDespite like video footage showing top executives declaring their intention to ensure that the rise of Trump populist moment it's just a blip in its history Google has repeatedly denied that the political bias of its employees filters into its product but the eighty five page briefing titled the good censor the good I mean how Orwellian at that\nYou have to downgrade the Saudis are just no way around it you have to withdraw armed support for the Saudis and they have to be punished because this cannot be allowed to go on by

I. dot org somebody needs to be done about this tendency of Congress to pass the buck to the other like the bureaucrats in those three letter agencies and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start\nOf essentially writing general outlines of laws and letting him ... the agency filling the details right the laws\nAnd uh so I'm going to be done about that ah we have a call from a dog who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison the good evening doc welcome\nThank you for taking my call is all this land cuss to a warrant to a quick question is radius ... just set aside unless of course as always\nMr Lawson where you see this court editing under President Trump partner opportunity under us as a sport search and Kevin ... and if there is no justice appointed the second chapter or two just why did\nYou see this court filing turning back tributes out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future outs are what are your thoughts on that sir\nBut you did you have two questions that that was that was your are your ... where did you see the court going on to these justices and are you all over the future that we could turn back the tide of I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good ... going in other words I yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial boarded dude\nYeah I actually think that this is very very hopeful I ... in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kavanaugh\nThere are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this\nPosition I'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower court had to defer to the to the interpretations have various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely and so\nThat that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress or to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there\nHe's a constitutional list he's a text you list\nJust just like Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question and now he has four other just\nTake on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he wrote that ... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA ... it's a remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face the voters the courts don't what what are they so reluctant about\n[laughter] well I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public and I mean not even saying with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was white and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he ... he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThe judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nOn why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is\nThey need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president that Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people the courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that\nThose decisions in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd the effort by the president after that to a point seven members and that's changed the entire nature of the court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nWell we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota tonight good evening\nHey there thanks for taking my call sure [noise] I just mentioned just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh your guests mentioned ... I think you know he said that uh\nWhere Republican Mark sooner agree with that may be with\nYou know kind of the timeframe when he says the problem started you know it's all full all around that time were ... were you start became you know people started calling us democracy is not a Republican since then I heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean like ... one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's why although and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where those technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nUm we can even talking about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that a leader\nNo I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatism afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people governing through\nA legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure\nAnd so conservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that the the founders didn't like was it democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy\nPeople make the decisions themselves immediately and then in some kind of I'm On a conference or director but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the new and I don't know I was a good idea that's right well we'll get we'll come back to that as time allows but right now a call from Sharon in ... Missouri on that was Sharon or going\nAgain that's why I'd say maybe I Am right now that I'm\nA constitutional convention and that's the thing that I kind of out of it if we have one that we had her for a legislative branch and rainy and the power of\nExecutive orders a pack a day now is Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot I guess you have to worry about running for office stare at like\n... hours so that the court possibly you know they can play a little bit more because a lot of it's like more of a side or\nThe way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the courts actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to where I Would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself for Congress as Jim said before is that it's too easy just to pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nAre having to be made for the ... going I'm going to break that does that move here so we will amplify on that thought when we come back in the moment\n\nIs your basement or crawl space a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too

now there's a better way to remove these dangerous an odor it's with the computerized wave ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expel pollutants\nWell out of the comments that I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that to the constitution a is a a document that we can make up as we go along if we don't have to like what's in it it's not a view I happened to share but that a lot of people who follow that was all set right\nNow I just think it would be the fact is is yes it does it change will document the only the voters of the country are allowed to change\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve both are usually we abuse the constitution the or the Congress although the these conventions can also be the method are proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place ... three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convictions held and three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so a breeder\n[noise] yeah or let that ... exactly right that had to have a system with\n'em but it it's a important just to understand we have the ... the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves and we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing\nThe government to slip away out of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah that's the problem\nThat is the problem but of course it's a problem that will not be going

be said it has to do with the administrative\nStage in his new book judicial fortitude from encounter books and uh we have a call from both sides in Akron, Ohio and hello side\n[noise] Hi my question relates to the vast power trophy hunter Ryan think at the department and carrier has has soon he has gotten hit the one Republican senators and two hundred twenty Republican Congress person wants to\nDo to allow trophy hunters Ariel Hi Ken our national park in Alaska any down there\nIn regards to sea lion murdering gay well\nBefore we go too far off the deep end to Peter there ah I'm not sure that anything that has been done on this particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to beat her and in that or if in fact Congress went along with it however a wise or unwise that decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be the subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nA no not unless it was an action that was not surprised by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nPasses sometimes allows administrators even in conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nIt it's been that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it ... it or a ... in other\nIf the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary in a Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nGetting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get off on your your I agree with\nAlmost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my my own yes and\nI think it really is we're giving him some addicts federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time that it takes planning on your show but anyway um and then the the\nThe the main thing is that I wanted to call about is the constitutional convention and that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think I think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just cook veteran ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go often right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThan most of the major changes need to be made right now the term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress\nBe at a an amendment that would say the Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as it is has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendment start with Congress than we can forget about any of those things ever happening\nA beauty let me add one thing there Jim I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having a an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these bureaucracies\nBut how do you ... how do you persuade short of of of some method of of of course\nUh uh how how do you persuade\nThe uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they've gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean so they're not going to just suddenly say gee Peter your rights so you're gonna have\nTo arm was these people are going to have to drag them and I don't know how you do that just by saying please read his book is a great read but I don't think they're going to do is\nLet me suggest this and I I I agree that it's tough but we have five members of the Supreme Court now who are who are willing I think to take exactly the position that I'm advocating in the book\n\n\n\n\nThis is my first consideration ability for us for no back to regular programming progress\n\nSided affair folks are managed care\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nBut I hear your your eyes\nTo see what sports that's exactly the case eagles eight thirty four and a Thirteen and went out to New York giants\nReally now three and three on the season the New York giants now fall into one in five three at home cars and the one twenty six thirty six two hundred Seventy eight yards three touchdown now now galore free catches Ninety One yard ask Jeffrey catches Seventy four yard\nTo touch downs alone bright spot for the New York giants won partly carries\nFor one hundred and thirty hours in the touchdown also nine catches for Ninety nine yards you twenty four forty three two hundred eighty one yard touchdown and won the interception in the last oh down back and junior six catches forty four yards on targeting meanwhile the New York giants hats fine go back and junior\nThose comments he made an ESPN sit down last week talking about the coast shell from the play calling and of course one of the line manning\nIt is officially friday's game one of the national league championship series in Milwaukee claimed her shawl goes for the Los Angeles Dodgers left her manager Dave Roberts after member that just use in the house before this pressure and fall\nYeah we want we want us to the sharks are what we do this for ... ... is our focus sets out for the game seven or wherever she right now we can give ourselves some opportunity get back to what you do that was like a very small so I think we do a very good job of getting too far ahead of ourselves for understanding the ultimate goal I\nMean lots of yoga solace gets to non game on from gray counseling manager on me and for some of the sports radio\n\n\n\nFor\nWhy\n[noise] or three oh\nGee [noise]\nNumber three it's not like stadium the boy oh boy what a hog Lee affair coming to an end in what you would expect from an NFC mattress usually one of those types of games where it's\nA bunch of running slaves defensive effort not the case at all just completely disgusting fog games that we witness there obviously when we saw the New York giants get blown out by the Philadelphia Eagles and it's getting ugly a one in five New York giants team now thirty four to Thirteen they lose the eagles\nWell let's get some credit\nGive them some credit and the fact is they deserve a lot of credit because\nThey seemingly have right at the ship but what exactly do we take out of an eagles win against one of the worst teams in football right now the New York giants that is one of the worst teams in football\nAnd regardless of statewide Barclay having just a phenomenal game you camp and this one on him\nThirteen carries a hundred and thirty rushing yards kid average tenure to carry one touchdown\nNine receptions Ninety nine yards including a fifty five yard and one is well I mean got targeted twelve times caught nine passes and on the season right now say Kwan Barclay nine more catches for him he's now up to what like forty catches on the year or something ridiculous like that\nSay gonna Barkley is on pace for over a hundred catches pretty ridiculous if you think about it and frankly shouldn't be is you're running back\nOn the New York giants are falling behind so quickly in these games they have to abandon the running game and he's just not going to get the opportunities that you would hope he gets to run the football and instead he has to become another wide receiver a safety blanket for Eli Manning because the office of wind has been so ridiculously bad\nThat he's getting hit hard four times Eli was sacked he was treated like a rag doll by the eagles defense but\nOnce again the question for the eagles is this are they truly back is this the Superbowl defending champion team that should be incredibly scary now with Carson once seemingly a hundred percent healthy or is it an eagles team that still has ... has issues that just happened to face the right team at the right time the New York giants\nI think it's a combination of both it's good to see you know you know Sean Jeffrey missed a bunch of games to start the season Carson once needed a couple of weeks to kind of get back in rhythm\nThey seem to be there they survive today without not having Jay a giant but I'm not sure that's going to continue what do you think about the fact that when when del small would Eighteen cherries or fifty one yard that's an adequate Corey Clementa had eleven carries for forty three yards twenty nine carries for Ninety four yards isn't anything to write home about\nAnd are there are some concerns for the eagles considering you know said well Barclay and Wayne Goldman combined for a hundred and forty seven rushing yards against them maybe\nBut the giants just aren't good measuring stick because they legitimately are one of the three worst teams the NFL right now than buffalo and probably maybe Arizona are the three worst teams the NFL right now\nBut it's ugly it is but you have to give the eagles or do I mean that team played well\nThe eagles\nAnd I what I mean when people are questioning you and people are wondering what's wrong how is it that you go from being a ... you know a Super Bowl winning team to a struggling team getting off to a two and three start didn't have a winner and you know on the road they've had some bad losses that tendency loss was terrible\nYou know see a different Philadelphia Eagles team this is more the team that won a Super Bowl\nUp Nick falls won the super bowl not Carson once you get the draft\nSo given the eagles a lot of credit I certainly do for what they if they were able to do look they have a lot of weapons we have Nelson Aguilar Algernon Jeffrey Zach or it's that's a good group because you know receiving receivers in tight end\nUrges very good out Sean Jeffrey has been really a very solid pick up for them just playing his third game since coming back from the injury\nAnd obviously you know Nelson Aguilar a couple of years back just seemed to be totally lost ... couldn't catch a cold\nAnd his second year and it just seemed like this was the guy that was going to be\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThank you for being with us on the ... from Westwood One radio where is one eight six six five oh Jim both one eight six six five oh five or six to six online you'll find is a jumble had a show dot com you can\nFollow me on Twitter at jumbo talks is going to be talking tonight about parenting and a couple of terms that had been used over the years of one or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been reached by our guest Dr John Huber clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health Dr Huber thank you for being with us tonight\nWell thank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll right the first term is a helicopter moms or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is a term or referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you admit that\nI'm not sure that's a pretty good definition and uh I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserve things in life\nAt because their parents did those types of things [noise]\nAll right uh that's something else that it it seems to me that that the generation that has provided us\nWith helicopter parents or their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean ... it's hard for me to to think that before this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a\nA generation before that have parents that are essentially provided the role models for these people uh it it seems to me that these people sort of sprung up uh uh on their own and the the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back\nThat many generations does it\nIt doesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who've always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation it as a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents\nThreats of confrontation any chance of failure for their kids which you know a rational adult understands failure for children as a learning opportunity and teach you how to deal with loss and how to how to recover from that and build on your experiences and these kids are\nGetting much less of that than the helicopter kid from the helicopter up\nSo it's getting worse it's helicopter parents on steroids\nExactly exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others the tonight to Don who calls him from Albany, Oregon at the weather channel and even though and they're good at doing fine thank you\nYou're in great myself I just got to say the helicopter and warm or parents sound like the kind of parents who were glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles but that was possible\nWasn't now you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much they're a dichotomy there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think that the Don may be closer to the literal truth and he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I don't think actually correct unfortunately what that Creole too is a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit that completely entitled they deserve this\nAnd you know I was taught right off day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to to get anywhere in this world\nYou know what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts on because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo here right now are you know I I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally a course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not this category or I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and yes that includes bumps grapes\nA failures are picking yourself up dusting yourself off and and the whole learning experience is there any kind of a\nOf originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have ever actually met a helicopter parent much less a lawnmower parent [laughter]\nWell I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six until two thousand was Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last\nYears I we get calls from parents go what do you mean I travel got us thirty on their ... and I go well I Can't even confirm if your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean\nOr do you ever did actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAnd you used to be when I got an authority on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level not even at the high school level\n[noise] wow uh I had\nOne flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me [laughter] about their child's grade [laughter]\n... good heavens it well but that that does almost eight lay literal helicopter or this case an airline and I guess a remarkable I'll ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo headed show with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\nGood evening gentlemen said Dr miss question are okay I've got I've got a one year old grandson and on kind of worried about situation the daughter in law I mean I don't even know if she'd be considered a lot more pair and something else going on me\nShe obsess taking pictures I Love him to death if he stands up you know it's like he's the only baby has ever done it and they don't even she won't even let them\nSo like my myself grab them laughing I physically go there and grab them because always on top of them they you know you can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get in there are some germs you know it's like real estate and I'm almost worried about I mean\nWell you know maybe you should be more than almost worried I'd [laughter] Huber Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nI might have but I'm I'm assuming this is our first child\nHow 'bout that gray as it is very into\nOkay and you don't have first child you know like the kids are at the store and they are in the living room and they spent their pacifier out you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes before he can put it in back in ... by the time she has her third kid she's become\nDusted off it doesn't matter you know wherever it pick it up out of the gutter and throw them out you know [laughter]\nSo so encouraging more dads that'll change how well she\n... she goes by the new one Lewin\nAh oh well All right now the river on my mind said yeah going going longer\nYeah remind her that you know you you raise the child and spoil the grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy [laughter] okay\nA little cynicism there for the program I Love it to Tom in Port Angeles Washington good evening a\nGentleman he uh one of the things that generate show adopt or a mob just the amount of legislation that's out there that you're at the seat that the CDC the child to fill up the people in\nA in in the communities can get word of something in your your child got injured or you know did you leave the play in the yard and this happened or the charge if the car seat issue who you know you have the right one for your head at at that age right there there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that\nYou would never even dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my favorite is right\nAnd and my parents never would have dreamed you know that somebody would have a hand yeah and at the state or local level\nA show that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering got used to write on the front Federer is a fifty three Chevrolet pick 'em up truck and hang out with the truck yeah\nWe can't even right and the bad and the truck now yeah exactly no are now\nAnd and and and and it does you know the things that I could think of you guys go out and get that extra water\nWells that are your thoughts are Tom uh to what extent it has a government if not impose this on us at least encouraged this\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help yeah right yeah and\nAnd what happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out there and they raised us think and they stand up in front of a\nSchool board then governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have
