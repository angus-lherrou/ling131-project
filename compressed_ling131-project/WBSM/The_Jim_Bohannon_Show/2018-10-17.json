say we're in the midst of a very very weird news cycle\nAnd whether it's Elizabeth Warren falsely claiming that she's a member of the Cherokee Nation or whether it is the president of the United states addressing a former lover as ... we're living in a weird world we begin with the president of the United states who has decided that he doesn't like Stormy Daniels anymore\nSo here's what happened there was a lawsuit it's the only Daniels and filed against the president of the United states is always a frivolous stupid lawsuit anybody with a lot of green you this and there was a suit in which she sued him for defamation after he tweeted that she was engaged in a total con job\nAnd she he treated a sketch years later about a non existent man a total ... job playing the fake news media for fools when she claimed that she was stopped by a guy who sent by Trump and she sued him for defamation\nAnd that's not have ... she's a public figure decimation is knowing and knowingly and maliciously attacking someone false information at knowing English is the standard for public figures it wasn't knowing it wasn't like it was just basically free speech and him giving an opinion\nBut she sued him for defamation and then it was thrown out the case was thrown out\nAnd here's what the judge wrote the court agrees with Mr Trump's argument because between question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics in public discourse in the United states the first amendment protects this type of rhetorical state and not only that the judge ruled that Stormy Daniels now have to pay Trump's legal fees out\nSo the president to the United states had a had a response on Twitter remember this was in office once occupied by Abraham Lincoln George Washington Ronald Reagan\nHere's the president of the United states has Fishell statement on his Twitter account quote\nSaid really judge throws heads Jamie ... is that she was just trying to say that you ... and he goes he's great now I can go after or space and her third ... in the great state of Texas she'll confirm later she signed she knows nothing about me a total time well\nWhat a step on the news cycle so we could have done an entire week\nOf Elizabeth Warren now we will do an entire week of the president of the United states calling a woman he once had sex with horse fish\nYeah so that's the thing now a couple of different things to note here first of all if you had to come up this entire its entire news cycle in one mean there'll be President Trump as the Lone Ranger\nSilver would be horse face Stormy Daniels and Tom till it'd be Elizabeth Warren so our our artistic geniuses in the back of our cooking up that one right now but would that said um is it good at the presidents of the United states called any woman or say\nNo probably not a good thing is it smart and he calls the woman he once had sex with horse race well it does call into judgment call\nWatching his judgment regarding women kind of a weird thing to do like you have sex with a woman you're not married to and then you call her horse face and they won't rip on her or rip on your taste that it's kind of weird\nOK so President Trump he he's eager to go after Elizabeth lord\nAgain I still think we need the image of him with a publishers clearinghouse size jak handing it just to to Elizabeth Warren in order to basically have that image linked with Elizabeth Warren forever unfortunately it seems like he's level and he's less interested in whether Elizabeth Warren has a relationship with John Doe\nAnd more interested in whether it's Stormy Daniels is in fact over ... away\nAs we continue is you're on the bench Shapiro show why in the world didn't listen to foreign actually pushing the

the senator from Massachusetts not Native American but she kept claiming she was for years well why didn't she just kept claiming it and then apologized for having done so like five years ago there are a couple of good reasons\nHere's the thing there is a story that came out September first of this year in the Boston Globe and it just got a serious issue for Elizabeth Warren\nWas Senator Warren actually\nA professor at Harvard law because she clean Native American ancestry in other words wishing granted special status that sort of gave her in an upper hand when it came to her job at University of Pennsylvania or at Harvard law school was more article from the Boston Globe ended up research found that\nFolks at Harvard said that her Native American claims had nothing to do\nWith any of that that her Native American claims had nothing to do with our actual ability\nTo be granted professorship at Harvard law school they interviewed to like thirty one professor as many of them were on the admissions committee someone from I Know people like Charles Fried who I have for contract and he didn't know when we hired or it had nothing to do with her Clinton Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that it's time we assume she was white\nAnd the internal documents suggested that University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person and sorted Harvard law school until it became beneficial for them to claim\nThat she was a minority heritage for purposes of their diversity curriculum or they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of take it and said that she was Native American but that doesn't mean she got her job based on\nNative American Native American claims\nWas so with that said why didn't Elizabeth Warren\nA month and a half ago simply say look I was told by my family members that I had Cherokee ancestry my mom used to tell me that my uncles and aunts used to tell me that and because of that\nI simply assume that you're right I was going to assume that my relatives were lying to me those are the stories that I was growing up I guess that was wrong\nAnd so I never should have done any of that stuff but it didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory like Richard decorate was going to be great no matter what and had nothing to do with those claims so I Apologize Native Americans are having taken seriously the stories my family without checking them but with that said\nTo claim that I was a beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action is simply untrue\nAnd why didn't you do that well there are two reasons you didn't do that and both of them are telling reasons number one\nShe figured that she could get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her which the media did yesterday there were headlines in the Daily Beast saying Elizabeth Warren proves Native American ancestry there is a headline over at CNN Elizabeth Warren provide solid evidence of Native American ancestry\nSo she legitimately threw out a study that showed she was not Native American and counted on the media just said that the study showed was actually Native American and then it all to get in a ballpark because people can read and that meant that her narrative began to collapse in on her\nSo she thought she could get away with it because the media would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean the media have covered for the fact that they don't work in Texas was being treated as an Obama ask Kennedy esque new young figure\nThat that guy was involved in a gee why one who's twenty six involved him crossing over a median line smashing a truck and then trying to flee from the scene and they're still counting and is the big new next Democrat thing now\nListen I'm somebody had my license suspended for driving too fast\nAnd obvious about that I was not driving drunk and I didn't crash into anybody it was on an empty freeway they don't ... I was driving drunk\nAnd hit a diet and then tried to flee the scene while he was drunk and the media have basically said that big nothing and the same media that tend to George W. Bush and why that in the Nineteen seventies you know disqualified him in two thousand for money for the president he like weeks before the election\nSo Elizabeth Warren had good costs to think the media we're going to cover for her no matter what the media covered Democrats the way they cover Republican half of the candidates for Congress in this election cycle would be told it would be finished dominant at New Jersey would be done in the ... honestly any gun\nClaire McCaskill of Missouri would be done Christians Santa in Arizona would be just tell but they're not because I was in the poor and like every other Democrat knows that there is a grace as a sort of buffer zone\nThe media has been falling over him the same when they found over Wendy Davis\nThe former state senator in Texas who then lost by something like twenty points to Greg Abbott\nAnd now they're for governor in Texas they are doing the same thing with they don't work the Texas Democrat told reporters after a campaign rally you will not spare any it's spent in his own race he plans we've all the money he has raised out on the field the head of election day\nO'Rourke raised from July to September thirty eight point one million dollars he says that he is going to he's not going to contribute any of that money to other candidates which is kind of amazing because honestly if he wants to ensure his ...\nThe Democratic party you really should become a patron of yards right he should be taking that money and distributing it more hotly contested races he's not going to do any of that so that's a bad story for Democrats meaning meanwhile\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe the kind of undercover journalist\nLike he's going to shock journalists over a project very tough you've done some good work before he sent his workers in the sense some his folks into Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she is campaigning parts of the right where she actually is on the issues here some of what that sounded like I get a job\nBecause she does go to her [noise]\n'cause I Want to say so much so I think some of them is like in the semi automatic [laughter]\nShe doesn't like overly go oh gosh [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] because she works for her even though she's in\nK. so she has basically been spending about her own positions so Claire McCaskill is in trouble in Missouri person sentiment just three weeks ago was leading Martha McSally in the Arizona Senate race and now it turns out that all of her past has come out and Christians in ... so Kirsten Sinema is the Democratic nominee in Arizona according to the Washington Examiner\nShe apparently takes sorcery very seriously emails obtained by the Washington Examiner show cinema was invited say prominent come in a feminist which is in Arizona it was called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day\nAnd to protest the war in March of two thousand three coping protesters were Hank obviously nothing the women and black were black but send them to encourage the which is where colorful clothing and come ready to dance plural and stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nAnd send them a campaign would not say why she invited the witches or clarify why she thought members of the Colts deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning more peace which is in question is should be noted claimed practice only non violent magic her the about section on their Web page there is a peaceful and democratic kind of sorcery\nThe paying cluster focuses on sharing spiritual insights and participating in direct democracy divisions are undecided liberal many of their Calvin quote have roots in the reclaiming tradition of feminist witchcraft\nMhm cinema also went to an anti war rally with pay and later that year\nAnd a apparently she talked about singing and spiraling into pagan circle only five rose from the police line\nI and then the police arrested everybody so Kirsten Sinema you're just doing humans work on ... campaign also it turns out she organized for the Arizona alliance for peace and justice in one email she urged supporters of the a P J to dilute to deluge\nThe phone lines of a radio show hosted by an unapologetic unconditional supporter of Israeli policy so\nKirsten Sinema is basically toast in that Senate race as well Democrats radicalism\nIs the major issue here and all they have is President Trump which is why it's not good that the president of the United states goes around calling when ... [noise] I mean really does yeah we'll get to more of that in just one second the Democratic response to all the plus a kind of shocking story Carter Page is now suing\nThe folks over at fusion GPS will get to all of that in just a second but first let's talk about your sleep quality so there's nobody on the planet like ... why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe'll sleep they'll just we put it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to natural body type and sleep preference is to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper a hostile labor whether you like a pleasure from but with the ... there is no more guessing and no more confusion just go to ... dot com slash Shapiro\nThere are two minutes sleep was and they will match huge one

he'll asleep after so much but I went out and got one from my sister for her wedding it's just that comfortable it's just that convenient my wife and I took that two minutes leap was\nMattress came in the mail we popped up in the back in later we put it right on the best friend who was good to go and it's super comfortable helix link dot com slash a bureau for the special deal\nSo with all of this debt\nWith all of us that the the economy continues to do while this was such a good news cycle it really was it was such a good news cycle the economy was doing great and then new jobs numbers are just terrific\nNot only that we have the highest federal collection of income taxes in history and twenty Eighteen\n... if he if he just look at the numbers we're collecting more income taxes than ever before even though we have lower income tax rates than we did last year why because supply side economics works when the economy grows and the government actually takes in more taxes and if the economy is stagnant and we have higher tax rate the economy has been going great guns under President Trump got to the deficit and the second which is not quite as good but\nIt's a very good news cycle for President Trump's in the last three weeks you got a Supreme Court justice and watch left kill themselves over Capitol you got to lose with Lauren and one of the great ... political blunders in my lifetime releasing report saying she was Native American\nWhen she is less she's less Indian than actual people from India like actual people from India have more Native American blood that Elizabeth Warren does it's an amazing thing\nAnd with that said President Trump decides to step on himself with Stormy Daniels and calling people horse face this is the only line of attack that Democrats have is just attack on President Trump and so this is what they're ratcheting up Nancy Pelosi was looking at a bad Senate map right now\nShe's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the Saudis\nThat the reason that President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi Government with regard to them or a ... an American resident who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also with anti Muslim Brotherhood she says the reason from hasn't been harshest 'cause maybe he's being paid off by the shouting\nIn terms of Saudi Arabia I think that was I always wondered why he went there is the first country to visit to the United states of course as president of the United states oh the other presidents that to Reagan went to [noise]\nTo um Canada or if you want to Mexico grape juice Chevy Bush so in a hemisphere was that many friends and allies who could have gone to so there was I was always suspicious that there was some kind of financial transaction involved there whether for his businesses or what ever\nGood luck with his line of attack it it's pretty crazy that the that Democrats and the only way that they're going to be able to win election just by simply throwing out on verified and and verifiable information like this but it shows how desperate they are which is why again unforeseen errors are the biggest problem for the Trump Administration they've always\nBeen the biggest problem for the from the ministry Asian here's here's I think the rule in American politics right now whoever shuts up first one's really because this is just it's the worst tennis match ever\nHave you if you watch tennis players ... very often you'll see that that sometimes the best strategy is just got the ball over the net because sooner or later somebody is going to smack the ball into the net and then when\nThey said that there is a a great line which which comedian is it I think Mitch Hedberg is that ... that the name of the comedian um and so he has a line he says no matter how good the problem I have a tendency to no matter how good I got them never better than the wall well that's that's\nAnd in American politics right now if you are the wall you win if you are the wall you wouldn't at all if you are the person who just sit there and let the other side banging his head against you you ...\nIf you're the person who commits on force errors you lose the Democrats have been committing an force there after an forced air here\nAnd that's why it would be great if the president would just stop but and again I guess we're going to have an entire new cycle now that we're faced doesn't hurt Trump in any serious way not really but it does jazz up the Democrats again their minds and how much they hate President Trump when he goes away it's hard for them to talk about this as much nobody cares\nBut but that said Trump Trump Trump that's just the way that it goes now\n... as Trump also comes along with the benefit of ... there's always a good side to what Trump is in a bad side to what Trump is do the same guy who called his former lovers ... is the same fellow was actually trying to stop these immigrant caravan that have been traveling from places like Honduras\nSo President Trump on Tuesday threatened to withdraw funding an aid from Honduras if it does not stop the caravan of people that had is heading to the United states\nFrom the United states has strongly informed the president of Honduras that have large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given ... affected immediately\nUp to three thousand migrants cross from Honduras in Guatemala on Monday on a truck northward after a scandal police in riot gear and warnings from Washington to migrants should not try to enter the United states illegally and then the crowd more than doubled in size\nAnd they do this and they do this march every year where people are sent up from Latin America from Central America and to the United states for Trump threatening to withdraw aid from countries that don't stop there seems\nThat needs to stop we need to get that under control if President Trump\nWants to win a second term I Would suggest that we start talking in serious fashion about those deficits at some point that the the burning comes you will\nBe back here tomorrow with all of the latest I Can't imagine where the news cycle goes from here and we generally all I can say is I Hope the Ventura\nFirst patients will lead to a church street was Jill UPS [noise]\n\nI'm Jerry all they are the Saudi Arabian government says it had nothing to do with the disappearance of journalists ...

talk with Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killings series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and they were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until a killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\nSure um after Iraq killing pat and which I became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover biggest Patton\nUh was an occupier in southern Germany\nBefore he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing time I'd want to actually fight them you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the ... says did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get ... people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most vile human beings ever to walk the planet\nCalled Odessa and him we knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and him with what he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed an organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped him a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain South America and South Africa\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took him big guys and we took it I meant andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed\nSuicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kinda we proved that in the book by dental work [noise] so ... it's a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nYou win the world war two broke out they just signed up and put on black uniform with the debt said go on a cap\nAnd we're in we're in a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nCity you want to World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said just go on a cap and ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people would just ordinary people\nAre just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people that couldn't happen yeah it it it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are [noise] are raising their eyebrows right now at the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify want to this country and others the Vatican and others did in\nIn a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did ... and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had a black male to go after Adolf Eichmann\n... they had to say if you don't Mr President will lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and that that forced forced Truman to do it who who blackmail on it who lack my other\nUm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that have Truman didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people you knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo I number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will or some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest and the killing series\nKilling the ss and uh it is a a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing the ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about the mid term elections which we will do with Bill as well so stand by more to come on the boat had a show and just a moment\n\nOptics move crazy amounts of data even crazier speeds and find a cyber rise in is the one hundred percent fiber

know let me give you an example Jim and is it pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of\nEvil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed a writer for the cold air program put out a tweet that said okay well maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way bill is on his ... he said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff\nAnd certainly no one of my staff Bill O'Reilly dot com could ever put out its we'd like that and keep their job because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who still working at cold there to no action against it is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans have picking that up\nThe picking that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous you know\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragically ironic that people calling themselves and [noise]\nUh anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean to call themselves anti fascist is just tragic ironic and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them the the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody that oppose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics is the right to say the same thing but\nIn America you know a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland\nOregon [laughter] I have a lot of 'em do yeah yeah so\nI'll take a quick break come back with more from Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

modern times I mean you have to go back to uh to kill a and Jane gifts calm and these people um to to see\nHow badly this evil um took root and eventually killed more than fifty million in Europe alone and and so when the war was over the prevailing sense was relief\nWe're glad it's over and we don't want to relive it even the Nuremberg trials and and the um the action that was taken a lot of people turned away they just didn't want to hear it anymore and a lot of people in Israel did the same thing they didn't want to be reminded of it\nThey didn't want to be reminded of Israeli government [noise] their main thing was protecting themselves against the Arabs they didn't want to put resources into finding Eichmann andme angle they had to be convinced to do it\nBecause they kept saying we don't want to relive this Hara it wasn't like the whole nation was demanding that they tracked down I ...\nAnd and the ss who got away knew that they knew that there was fatigue and even sympathy in some quarters and Europe sympathy [noise] so\nIt was my job as a journalist slash historian of cut through all of that and to tell you look this is what happened\nAnd it distresses me that younger Americans have no blank includes\nYou know how much they should in school it's not discussed said this is what happened and this is evil and the reason it happened is because most Germans look\nAway they could have stopped it they chose not to cause they looked away and here in America we have a rising evil we people walking into schools gunning down students we have thousands of people\nBeing shot in Chicago by drug gangs we have ... molesting kids that's evil\nYes and in the word that ... that needs to be used to uh and not just swept under the rug one thing I Would add to

coming from they need to know who was the British spy that was producing this great amount of material because the Brits were passing along this stuff\nTo the CIA but they would never say where it came from that kind of one of the conventions in in international kind of spy craft as you don't give away all souls and so and my six would never explained the CIA where it came from and button ever among others felt\nThat they need to find out they need to find out who was that was producing this information and so they began\nTo trying to launch their own investigation into the identity of the British spy\nAs now those are in the book here I'll just quote\nAnd so with approval from above Gerber launched\nA discrete spy hunt early Nineteen eighty five instructed the CIA investigator to set about I'm covering the identity of the British super spy and my six our ally after all the British you might expect should know account discover what was going on\nGerber did not see this as a betrayal of trust\nAnd still less was spying on an ally he believed it was more aid tying up of loose ends prudent and legitimate cross checking\nAll right so far so good and now we come to the person who became a key in this operation it's a name we've heard before who was that\nThat was old rich aims role and why you know well\nI mean it's you know I mean it's new full of of button good but in

is that the older James\nOffered to spy for the KGB he went to the Soviet embassy in Washington DC in in may Nineteen eighty five and offered to give them everything he knew in return for money older James was one of those spies who really was made of eight in tiny by greed\nAmazing so you have here a double agent\nUh ostensibly Soviet been working for the west and his identity is now being investigated by an American a double agent ostensibly working for the U.S but actually working soon to be working for the Soviets I mean that reads like the plot out of a novel\nWhat seems completely unlike the doesn't it but it is I suppose one of the things that he's Saturday in the house of espionage which is that it's all about is that ... and it's all about\nKind of double crossing really ... and older changes the fact that he figured in all sorts of ways I mean he he did it for money but but you know he'd been a a an officer of the CIA for very long time and he knew a lot of secrets and he clearly\nNews the identity of that go to a ski he was able to have that I Would say between\nThe two are despite the fact that they both became double agents sound\nVery different from one another you you're right at some length about a ... a getting drunk at parties are are leaving classified information on a train he sounds like the exact opposite of a ... who was I guess I guess in many ways a very precise and very professional\nCharacters although in a bizarre twist of fate they would eventually meet little naively like go to ask you got out yeah and I'm you know after he escaped one of
