in a glass cage emotion a glass cage with emotion I'm so sad right now\nI'm the sadness overwhelms me at times if I should take a break to go cry in the corner ... rock myself and the ice cream that might be happening a little bit later in the show we'll try to avoid as best we can Nikki Haley made that announcement in the White House with President Trump today it was a shock announcement here's what she had to say\nOn it has been an honor to like I said\nA blessing and I want to thank you for that you\nKnow Nikki Haley was indeed a bad asking her job as the UN ambassador she basically spent every day going and yelling a despot which was injured great at it I mean she would go in and she would talk about\nHow the United states was exceptional and America was unique place in our allies like Israel ... supporting and how the UN was basically the most ... of the international institutional\nSort of lay out and she was exactly correct about all those things I Will miss Nikki Haley greatly she explains some of the things that she got done as you an ambassador to kind\nWith the United states on foreign policy [noise] now\nThey know that if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons\nIn Syria whether it was NATO saying that other country had to pay their share of whether the trade the amazing they yeah [laughter]\nOkay so they're bugging bunch rumors about what's going to happen next people suggesting that Nikki Haley is going to take Senator Lindsey Graham spot Lindsey Graham is going to become\nThe the UN ambassador that's not going to happen I'm just gonna say that right there right now Lindsey Graham has no interest in giving up a tendency to go be UN ambassador\nIt would be a great solution it'd be really Machiavellian to move her into the Senate where she could just do battle with Kamala Harris on a daily basis it would be spectacular I Would enjoy watching it and Lindsey Graham would actually make a terrific UN ambassador because it would be full time Lindsey Graham to point out that's all that he would do all day long would be Lindsey Graham to point out and just yell at people should be\nAmazing but unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen there some rumors that maybe it'll be Dina ... who was a former member of the administration or or maybe it'll be ... now who would be terrific he's our current ambassador to Germany I really doubt that they're going to call them back from Germany to make a ...\nThere are few other possibilities Nikki Haley is is not going to stay with the administration now she's out she is not going back to the Senate\nMy guess is that she is going to go back into politics maybe a couple of years from now but I get the sense from her from from folks you know her that she actually does just want to take some time out that you sort of been burned out on his job and I hear I mean that's that's a pretty brutal job and I met with ambassador Haley just a few months back\nThe Obama administration had suggested fifty dollars per ton and that was considered high at the time and all of this is just say that these estimates are are wildly overstated in terms of the amount of damage that they are likely to do the reason that I say that because of the report itself\nThe way that these these things get reported in the media is that there is virtual certainty in the scientific community that this stuff is going to happen the problem is that virtual scientific consensus doesn't actually exist a lot of key issues\nComing up there's another point that folks aren't really making about this IPC she reports it's a little bit of boarding namely that the ivy before has some very specific predictions about bad things that are going to happen but they don't seem quite sure of those predictions I was ... year old [laughter]\nSo how do you get ready to go out to shower you brush your teeth or even a human being on the matter

will be flooded out of their homes people starving in the streets catastrophe Mad Max type stuff\nThat's not really true and the eyepiece she she report even if most brutal statements and how bad things are going to be they seem kind of unsure about whether that stuff's actually going to happen and here's here's what you didn't know about the eye PC to the ... she she makes two types of production in this report\nThe first type of protection is that two degrees of global warming will be worse than one point five degrees and global warming Celsius okay and they say that with high confidence then they get to the actual specific productions\nAnd windows virtually every specific production they make about the amount of damage that's going to be done to the world climate based on one point five degrees Celsius of change\nVirtually all of their production or couch in terms of medium confidence medium confidence means a fifty fifty shot so basically flip a coin is whether they are right or wrong on this and then you're going to determine whether we ought to destroy capitalism on the basis of that so for example\nIn the in the first chapter well in the summary rather than the summary of findings for the Iraqis you report it says on the one hundred and five thousand species studied six percent of insects eight percent of plants four percent vertebrates are projected to lose over half their climatic ally determine geographic range for global warming up one point five degrees Celsius\nCompared with an Eighteen percent of insect sixteen percent a plant and eight percent to burn a bridge for global warming of two degrees Celsius\nSo basically everything is going to double everything's going to double\nOr end for insects is going to triple everything that's going to double and then for insects triple with two degrees Celsius of change versus one point five degrees Celsius of change but that is expressive medium ... confidence\nAre you willing to bet the future of the world economy and leave billions of people in poverty\nBecause now you're taking a virtual certainty that hundreds of millions of people live in poverty and increased conditions poverty and you're betting that against the fifty fifty possibility that some bugs will have less space to live\nNow that's a serious consideration but I think that there is also the possibility that number one the science is a wrong number two there is a possibility that technology tends to\nActually manifest itself in different ways that when you see serious economic serious\nEnvironmental problems technology is a good way of mitigating against that in fact it was the case you made the global warming because of the greenhouse effect has acted like a greenhouse you seen as an increased screening in certain parts of the globe specifically because of global warming and that's sort of repeated\nThing inside PCs you report the more specific they get the lower their confidence levels so for example they say about approximately four percent of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation of ecosystems from one side to another at one degree Celsius global warming compared to Thirteen percent\nAt two ... two degrees Celsius of global warming so if it's ... degrees Celsius well boiling Thirteen percent of the entire global terrestrial land area is going to be transformed in terms of ecosystem but again they say that with medium confidence so they say with full confidence is that two degrees is worse than one point five degrees but they say would medium conference conference meeting half half\nIs that this change will be really really dramatic\nMy dad that's basically the case that they're making now when I say all this folks on the left immediately say well you're a climate change deniers again I'm not denying climate changes taking place I'm asking what the actual impact of climate change will be and to what measures will be necessary in order to curb said climate change\nSo I Want to take another story that's in the news today because it's sort of astonishing and sort of astonishing\n... yesterday it guy won the Nobel Prize in economics and then as William North house she works over you and left champion this guy William ... billion or has has for years and modeling what sort of economic systems would be best in terms of carbon global warming and this has been his actual life for\nAnd good luck with all of that good luck with all of that\nOh this seems frankly like an attempt to avoid\nThe it to avoid the reality which is that we have to make economic decisions based on possibilities in probabilities that you don't get to destroy capitalism wholesale just because you don't like capitalism and when you hear people saying wild things about how the cities are going to be underwater and millions of people are going to die and all the rest\nJust remember that there is an agenda backing some of these folks and that the alarmist productions of folks like Al Gore had not in fact I'm through and we shouldn't take global warming seriously we should but that's why we should use money for abatement\nThat's why we should be looking at building levees is why we should be looking at creating barriers to two nominees in and and figuring out exactly how to move people inland it means that there are lots of ways over the course of the coming century for us to deal with some of the increased problems of climate\nBut exaggerating the problems of climate ain't going to do it and then suggesting that we overthrow capitalism to do it is not exactly a smart solution nonetheless radicalism rules the day and it's it's driven by a sort of weird ... ...\nAh this this idea that\nWe're ... ... and then we we are we're about to experience the end of time and this exist in a lot of religious communities nearly Christian Community thought that sort of the the kingdom of God was at hand it's happened in the Jewish community to you see it amongst\nWell you see it in second in the second world to the idea that we're living in the end times and the apocalypse has basically upon us and that means that\nHarsh action is necessary we need harsh action now we need crazed action now because if we don't everyone is going to die millions will die millions will die and we keep hearing this about the increase of hurricanes and tornadoes even though there's been no actual increasing the number of hurricanes or tornados\nWe keep hearing about these oppose an outsized impact of hurricanes and tornadoes even though for example in Bangladesh which just experienced is pretty significant hurricane or a couple of ... within the last year\nAbout four thousand people died in the Nineteen nineties there were similar size hurricane a hundred thousand people died what does that mean I'm at the banquet actually actually spent the money and provided the resources necessary that fewer people died in other words human beings\nAs intelligent animals have the capacity to adapt to our environment we've been doing it our entire existence nonetheless the feeling that we're living in crisis mode has permeated the left to a really extraordinary extent and that\nReaches all the way down to the lowest level of the Democratic party I mean the lowest level meeting the folks in antifa

finally broken her silence and it turns out just like everyone else in Hollywood and the music industry she's a person of left so here is what she tweeted\nMost expert on Instagram quotes I'm reading this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November sex which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee in the past I've been reluctance publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years I feel very differently about that now\nI always have an always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I Believe we all deserve in this country I Believe in the fight for el GB GQ rights 'cause this is the defining moral issue in Hollywood even though we all agree that people should be treated with respect and honor in the United states\nAnd that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong I Believe that the stomach races and we still see in this country

shove things under her fingernails and they asked her to\nIt meant that basically says she agrees with all the main talking points at last and she did so I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt

his doubts as well to Taylor Swift finally came out\nWhen the typical left view that everybody always knew she had and no one's really got upset about it except for Senate left once people on the

okay [laughter] we will not but that that was an a plus a Tom calls in from Sharon, Pennsylvania leaving dumb\nCan aiming Germans you guess you know I I was a kind of surprised with Nikki Haley a a saying that she was gonna leave at the end of the year two and a gym as you pointed out why now before the election you know suddenly she could easily a postponed I think before or two after the election\nBut then it got to thinking about it and and I don't know I I don't know how accurate the information is but I've heard this on a several major a conservative talk radio programs\nThat a Rod Rosenstein up was going around trying to get Trump far removed under the twenty Fifth Amendment buddy can only get a couple of cabinet members to agree with him\nNow it it just seemed coincidental that Trump met with Rod Rosenstein what just two days ago or something like that and all of a sudden you know she's ... she's going to resign I I'm just I'm just don't ... I have nothing to back it up it's just a sort of like a you know a gas in the gut feeling\nWell it's interesting but I I don't I don't really think that we're talking here first of all she's not always you miss it in a cabinet meeting she is not a a a a a principal a a a official and such as defined by the uh the twenty Fifth Amendment\nA and the so no I think that we're probably not talking about about that but I'll defer to our guest a Benjamin Friedman\n[noise] I think I'm with you on that to him I don't I don't see that a viable I'm not even sure how that would work but a\nHer patients I think for higher office are clear but I don't think there's any pathway for her right now on that uh\nIn in at least for the for the time being in one could imagine a if Trump gun impeached or in a tense needed a running mate that she would be on the list but that's pretty far out scenario\nYeah absolute by the one interesting aspect of this thanks for your call duff but just looking at the second floor of the twenty Fifth Amendment whenever the vice president and the majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments which would not include the ...\nOr of such other body as Congress made by law provide transmitters that or the president can do is jobs on and so forth technically speaking [laughter] Congress could say that whenever the vice president and the majority of the members of the Peoria, Illinois Rotary Club uh that that would be another body\nIt it's just a a strangely worded amendment but to the issues at hand alum in Redding Pennsylvania joins us now in the Allen a good evening\nGentlemen and for your federation that it has everything to do with real world the thing that are happening in real time\nThat real world event is that the Saudis might of murdered a um Turkish\nEntered the Saudi embassy now Trump is clearly doubled down on M.

[noise]\nUh well it's a ... or I don't think it's crazy I I think it's\nOne ... ... or one of the conflicts that might have happened was she want to see more critical of the Saudi on it but um because

with the summit sports to the program he is a columnist political strategist and contributor for the Washington Examiner and we're looking at a just a what all of a can be a a\nReasonably attributed to this uh this particular decision and the timing involved how important is this job in the the Trump Administration certainly has been a bully pulpit\nFor a a lecturing the role of a number of things and I'll very candidly ad but uh I Would agree with every bit of electrical I've heard today I mean it's high time that the world was told them the number of things and that Nikki Haley was quite effective in doing so your your thoughts\nWill he said it it is pretty much a bully pulpit or you know especially in the trunk administrator shady he relies so much media perception I\nThink especially in the Republican voters me Nikki Haley is very very very awkward especially along with it I mean\nPretty much the Republican women that I Know a wanting making elites are about twenty twenty four I mean I'm personally someone who would vote for I think she's a great leader so she's very very popular um and for that reason position is very important uh whether or not ... is important going or will probably determine on who goes it\nAnd if they can do a good of a job you know a drive in the media narrative is they really can and it's safe I work in close to the president like she has even though they will disagree on some issues\n[noise] it ... that's an interesting part of of the story right there back when the when Donald Trump was first running for the nomination a couple of years ago and South Carolina always has an early say so in that context of the governor Nikki Haley was not a Trump person at all I remember the ... so\nNo neither were half the people in his cabinet\nWell that's true and you can say about this man he hasn't exactly been one who was unwilling to embrace former foes\nHe makes these his enemies you know I mean you can so I'm not here I mean who do you hear and praising Ted Cruz\nWhat are you hearing say two and a half years ago that Ryan Ted Cruz lie lions had you know you shot you know my dad JFK you charge at your dad shot JFK all this crazy stuff you know and now he's crazy so this is this topic terrorism\nYeah it does uh certainly uh so seem a if you could look at a common threads that runs through a Trump Administration foreign policy uh I I have a little trouble uh of finding a common thread that holds for all parts of it but I I guess if I had to describe it\nIt would be an on again off again a partial embrace of neoconservatives them I don't know\nWell I mean I think you could describe it in that way I Would describe it another way which should be speak loudly and carry a much bigger stack you know I very much state ... trumpet someone who essentially likes it causes likes to call up people in his own way um and for him he's always laid back it up I feel like it except for ... for example\nThe type to really draw a line in the sand and generally not act on that [noise]\nWhich which was encouraging certainly are given the some of the uh the excessive uh uh uh\nThey've uh approach that was seen by the likes the certainly of a block Obama and the other world apology tour and a host of other ... out of that I'd never\nNever really struck me as as the particularly constructive for this country and the you can look that certainly the actions of the leadership in the crumbling and are in Beijing to see the extent to which we are not respected in much of the world\nOr let's get called her on ... go ahead with your thoughts and then I'll take a call here\nBut if you go ahead and take a call ... All right John in Landon bird Pennsylvania now good evening John\n... have a question uh ... you say why is Donald Trump or saving a a resignation from Nikki Haley uh my\nWell not not why I mean we're talking about the the the resignation submission and the timing of it uh but yeah okay I'll go ahead the\nTiming of it I think it's a it's a very intelligent timing of it is putting in a punch against the protestors for the ... election\nWhy why is that a punch against the protestors I guess I I'm missing how that that's connected\nWell a stake in the window of their sales\nAh I don't know maybe this guy shouldn't has shifted slightly for one day I mean why are we going to be right back into into a full bore Kavanaugh discussion tomorrow especially with the the the rioting that's taking place in Portland, Oregon or near rioting I if it was designed to\nTo uh uh remove attention from the cabinet or a controversy I don't think it exactly succeeded\nWell I'll tell you why it's going to go or one day because he's got to put his daughter Ivanka\nAnd he's already said he won't do that and she has already said she won't accept that so I think she said she wouldn't accept\nA she said she would

emergency pressing or Anthony ... very simple and you should find that book and other related topics\nFantastic covered by the way K. O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow at the out of the calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live out\nHere he was spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeway that America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith ... with a an on the major freeway but then if you go to a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence hurricane to flooding are closed that down then you need that\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going now they'll go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you ... you shouldn't start on the sidewalk because it because ... there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nAnd you just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh interstate and then and then then if that happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side Roach that's all I'm saying\nAll right well ... is the one that they go because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with them so when you're traveling on leisure early um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are gonna meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nSo when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem\nYou don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that the ... has to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach and we're going to go to through this direction to that location so this way\nFamily members who you rely on those even ask the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning the tax bill the email message wants that to our turns on and the people on the other side\nGet that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call the your thoughts your or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nOh and makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you can send an activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of\nWeather related problems such as Michael\nYou know the storm skin throw it down you know can take out technology and\nIf the towers that people that you're sending a signal to wind down\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way\nAnd on the other side it's important to understand that they will receive it once a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive the message and now they know what happened to you\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio a good old ubiquitous overly your radio always there just to review issues such moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the ... had a job with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening jumble of this uh this coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise to than being a good script per movie um why not just bomb or\nA hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive\n[noise] a wave or maybe a hydrogen bomb or well\nThat's a nuclear bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if uh it it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter [noise] uh I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other end practicalities of such an idea there's just too big and but I\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way let's say the United states was the last say ... you know in a state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the store and the story goes towards Alabama\nTexas now is the state of Florida are liable for this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another guy said let's say the United states there is that they start coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and it goes right through ... and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli arrival for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit that got to be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody would ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action led to what followed but this was this is probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea of\nWho you know I mean in\nJacksonville, Florida and so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn and head of the inland\nAnd the ... I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly uh\nUh one of the just simply changes course in damages somebody else in the ... who was liable and are you [laughter]\nIt could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do it with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an athlete Kobe\nAnd his book is the emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family is website the emergency prepping dot org ... where one eight six six by boat jumbo back in a moment\n\nStuff but it's already been done but you know what other um physical things kinda guy really prepare for you know besides food water and that type of thing or is there a um your goal kid would probably not even work because\nYou wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nIt's not that that's not necessarily true at all you may or may not you just simply have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that hit so you know twenty on the Richter scale of the every structure in road is flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely and go get is always a handy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances or your your advice for a a gym would leads Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean I don't kid is just that so let's say\nYour you have to abandon your vehicle and you have a whole trunk full of go can't above you had your backpacking you carry ... central south a few days the food and medicine than other\nThings that you can now walk and I get to the next town or wherever it is that you can have safe lodging or maybe even just they just sent nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know authorities start putting together what's happening now\nThink about it and when the last for McCain that came so farming malls stuff this face now are starting to take seriously you know emergency management of these type of situation like in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back to back\nThey taking it seriously the money and management of each county each district each region the state itself\nI mean we moved I think it was seven million people during the hurricane to ones that had um\nI wasn't or my camera member from so many names now but think about how many people were relocated not only in the state of Florida but to Alabama Georgia it was just in an age thing you know relocation of them\nAnd the whatever number no one was killed during this whole you\nKnow I was eight six six by low jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six that as we go to the break an important lesson to keep in mind\nDo the best you can uh again or the idea of throwing up your hands on the air and say well

call to evacuate the area we always hear about of course the people said well we're going to ride this went out your happens\nIt happens all the time people do ride it out but more importantly as long as the majority of the people are out of the dangers of yes\nThere's always gonna be the Straggler that want to stay they think that whatever they don't want to go the way they're going to ride it out and it is what it is you know at least\nThe authorities have a very minimum amount of people in that area but even now you know this was in the past where you can ride it out when the authorities that they find that this is an area that needs to be evacuated bailout\nSo everyone out you can't ride it out and these days especially if you're on the coast light and specially areas that are Paul so
