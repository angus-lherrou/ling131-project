the BBC so called eight hundred by one nine Seventy seven Ninety six us tax shield eight hundred five\nOne nine Seventy seven Ninety\nBack as I mentioned parish also new battle broken out not even real between right and left but we're both right and left over the interaction of the American economy and it it's all across the political Baron that's really\nOn the one hand you have folks who say globalization and redistribution what do we do with the people were left behind or working jobs that get eliminated\nNow the normal answer in the past was get up get any skill leaked out that's why America fans from coast to coast and isn't just relegated to the eastern seaboard\nBecause people legitimately gave up plots of land in New York and decided I'm gonna go out to the middle of nowhere and across territory where people want to kill me that was lost in the middle of nowhere to set up a claim and then I'm going to work on that claimed by myself at risk of death\nIn or is that I can make something more myself but that is the American ideal but that's where it was going by the wayside because we now believe that\nEverybody is entitled to things were entitlement culture and so what is broken down is to separate use of where the economy should go from here your number one is globalization in redistribution\nFree markets everywhere and if people are left behind than we have a a basic income but a universal basic income or we have a social welfare net a safety net and\nThat's how we pick up for the folks get left behind\nBy those people we just give them money basically the ... races everybody's living standard and then everybody who's left behind a little bit we give them a little bit of extra money to make them feel better and so that they can live better that was my number one\nAnd a lot of folks in sort of the Trump camp said that's not right and the burning camp said that's not right they say instead we really need is a new model of how to think and the model of how to think is about jobs how do we provide jobs for people because jobs provide meaning\nThat if you don't have a job you have less meaning\nSo what if we just restricted the free market itself what if we put barriers on the free market in\nTorrance credit or an ... he doesn't really ... were were recommend tons of restrictions on the free market he talks about different ways that we can shape public policy in order to make the markets freer actually relieve regulations to make it easier to generate jobs but President Trump has suggested restrictions on the free market he's ... he has suggested\nRestrictions on global trade for example\nAnd there's a real push by someone from the populace right to restore union power even though it is Americans voluntarily moving out of the union not companies breaking unions that is the lead to the dark unions in the United states\nSo that's my number two is you restrict the free market economy in order so that everybody has a job and that again is more of a left leaning version so it's kind of fascinating 'cause you have liberals were for globalization and ... in redistribution and you have conservatives for for globalization and redistribution and you have liberals who are for workers\nAnd not free markets and you have conservatives short for workers enough free market now the actual answer to this problem is look at what free markets to\nLook at what free markets you and if President Trump were really a free market minded guy that's what he would say right now he me ... all he would just point is that his economy because you're worried about technological development you're worried about automated cars and trucks and all the rest of it well guess what\nThere's no question that that capitalism has a process of creative destruction attached to it\nBut just a shepherd the famous economist coined the term creative destruction that every time a new industry has created old industries are destroyed the car industry destroyed the horse and buggy industry really went out of business early people whose job it was to make when wheels and they went out of business when cars came around\nBut guess what that created new jobs in the car industry and new jobs and making parts for those cars in other words certain jobs get destroyed what we can all live a better lifestyle and people have to learn to adapt and adjust and that's the history of humanity forget capitalism the history of humankind is adapting and adjusting to the environment around you\nThis idea that we can adapt and adjusted new technologies seems to be completely wrong headed\nAll the talk about how all these jobs are simply going to disappear thanks to technology and how we have to restore manufacturing jobs by restricting the free market it's a big mistake the reason that we live the most prosperous life\nOver there all of this again is deeply deeply ugly of course that doesn't actually answer the question as to what President Trump should do however\nAnd this is where president from best claim is that he's basically just a realist trying to make deal as far as possible and well he appreciates the human rights violations or bad\nHe's not going to stay up nice worrying about the Saudi Government\nCommitting human rights violations that we all know they've been committing for years on it I mean the same Saudi administration\nThat has been quite friendly with radical Muslims for decades on and the vast majority of the of the ... of the nine eleven hijackers were Saudi so if I say the Saudi regime is not exactly a wonderful wonderful regime but\nDoesn't mean the United states doesn't have interests with regard to Saudi Arabia\nAs an example of President Trump saying the sort of thing repeated like he was asked about Helsinki or do you remember he had that meeting in Helsinki with Whedon recruiting where he was very complimentary approved and it was not his finest hour Trish Reagan who has a brand new show on Fox Business which is well worth watching sheep pressed President Trump on Helsinki here's what Trump had to say\nThe longer the glove and have a boxing match with him on stage who's nice to have [noise]\nBut what happens when I walked off the stage everyone so that was great we're on the plane all of a sudden the St Lucie is an old from wasn't tough enough and then we do if I was too tough says a couple of years to [noise] I could have a very good relationship with Russia having a good relationship with Russia would be a good thing that a bit\nOkay so there was there was that bridge well when he says that about Russia he said the same sort of thing about can jump in and this is how Trump act with regard to bad dictators he basically determines whether he needs them or not\nAnd then he tends to treat them nicely if you need them because this is how Trump is personally with all the people he deals with if you need you he's very nice you if he doesn't need you and he calls your horse thing\nThat's what President Trump does and some people are confused that President Trump isn't calling mom and been so proud of horse race that's because that's not how President Trump operates\nThat does not mean however that what the west says about Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia is true so Ben Rhodes she was just the worst than roads a former national security adviser to President Trump\nHe's just awful he's just awful he was the guy who lives in the American people about the Iran deal\nHe's the leader of the Iranian regime outreach effort on the part of the Obama administration the actual outreach effort to an evil dictatorship lead sponsor of ... on planet earth attacking President Trump suggesting Trump is somehow responsible for Saudi Arabia acting like Saudi Arabia journalist everywhere\nAre less safe and then let's face it we have a president figure say stress or the state so for a values like freedom of speech and dissent\nCertainly are very endangered around the world\nThat syndrome on that I think it's getting much worse and and so this vacuum Fannie advocacy for democratic values I think is putting people at risk and there's nobody else who's going to fill that vacuum if the president United States and its America's not doing that\nOkay this is why Trump supporters are not going to resonate anything we are seeing these days the media covered for it and ministry and it's an outrage actual terrorists for years upon years upon years\nSo when Trump says listen I'm not going to go crazy over the Saudi think most Americans are basically going to say okay well All right now is that the proper action not a proper action is probably the sanctions that the very least an insistence on some sort of change and Saturday but we do have leverage over the Saudis to pretend we do is look but\nPresident Trump is much more of a foreign policy realist than some of his predecessors and\nAs for policy realist I think that it is not fully outside the bounds of propriety for him to suggest that it's it's a little much to abandon the Saudis in the middle of an actual ongoing Middle Eastern crisis between Sunni and Shia okay in just a second I Want to talk about\nThe great battle of our time which is not Saudi Arabia versus Ron or even Republican versus Democrat it is President Trump has a Stormy Daniels we'll

attorney simply Powell about the apparent murder\nOn the Saudi Government property a consulate in Turkey a dissident journalist and uh we're at one eight six six five oh Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I uh highest is thinking that there seem to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the\nSaudi regime or at least the portions of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope you should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a a presence and his in our nation's hill in there a dilemma that we're helping them with so that's my ...\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts or the ... to the caller\nHave been trying to think about different things that might can be done also and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here or not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this\nUm yes I mean I I see your point there is Jim and our talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are good and bad and nobody to non south horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it\nUsed to be in some ways yes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula of Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach the situation but I don't think you should give a fair pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts\nFor I'm not giving them a mass either I'm just not you know I Know a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it [noise] the brutality of their act\nOr the parent brutality again what we have so far or ... or you don't pass it off no no no no just must be clear about this loop we at this juncture does not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that when\nYou look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was the interrogation that went wrong no one gets heading during an inherent [laughter] yeah oh I agree as soon as I heard that I thought okay that what that means they tortured him of doing that very thoroughly agree on it have you\nKnown as ... as if this was never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm ... I'm simply saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose despite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nBut not wait just a minute we do not know the Saudi Government had anything to do with them idle at other tax\nThe a loan on feel the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when you have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world to act you have to do something and\nEven even at even do the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that al ... to ... this hour in ... just finished my statement before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula\nAnd how to improve things either for the people there or for this country\nYou think it's good to have a government that will take someone into a conflict poetry\nObviously and not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very ethnical ... out of that I go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement\nLuke how is what's hearing someone that\nKind of obviously you just do hire to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion\nThe answer of course the one I pose was it wouldn't be better and until you come up with some kind of a better answer of adjust were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nA harmful to the United states and that the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that are responsible answer a ... you know your thoughts from used that needs to go to the next call here\nYeah way they have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first or whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our strategic military interests around the world and everything else\nIt'd be a little different if this would be the only time in history that any regime as ever acted in a brutal way well guess what it is and I'm so sorry that the human condition is as bad as it is but it is and the notion that never happened before and all of human history I Would say\nHow outrageous unfortunately and this happened countless times Chris in east Texas cello\n[noise] yeah yeah well uh let's just calm down a second ... will watch here because first and foremost you're all are\nAre\nAre you behind on your federal student loan payments you may qualify to have your entire student loans forgiven with one free oh that's right and if you're a teacher police officer firefighter or work for a nonprofit federal programs are still available to have your entire student loans forgiven\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old male maybe it'd be fee or even with type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of portable term life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big move to an eight hundred for a one\nFourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big lewd dot com\nRemember big lose IQ he's on meds to\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars by some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Ira guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nI used to pay the ... only to sort through tons of resume to find a field a candidate for ... my hair salons that old process was not smart and I went to the appropriate here it's technologies games resume for me to find the right people and actively invites them to fly so I get qualified\nCandidates fat smart see my tape recorders read it never went by employees in the U.

jumbo as we talk with attorney suddenly Powell about\nThis apparent murder in a Saudi consulate in Turkey and do we have a call from Charlotte in Durham North Carolina Hello Charlotte and welcome\nThank you very much ... and this is a real hot ... has been for many years have failed to comprehend as somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give billions of dollars every year to the Saudis Christiana poor reportage she went in undercover in several places but uh you know really she could have lost her life that she showed where\nThe Saudis have thought king carrot go five states in their ... why are we sending them money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted the Sydney Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is that is a little hard to understand\nI don't understand it all I don't I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them a damn\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different but they are someone who can be useful to us who doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think ... point is extremely are well taken\nA one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\n[noise] hey Jim off this call into a suggestion or I'm trying to find a reason why the ... a wooden just but when they got this guy on the consulate\nWouldn't you revoke his path for a which is certainly within their borders Gustavo\nA claim that he's violated multiple Saudi law extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into jail and Saudi Arabia and his story on age six in the New York times [noise]\nAgain he would be just as out of the way the and uh I I think that the again we have a a very rational thought process for brick again it unless unless we really think Sydney power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of extreme brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think that what Rick just described would end up itself be ah shall we say I'm a pleasant enough faith to send a message to dissidents\n[noise] well it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman and evil sort of regime\nAnd they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this or this kind of arrogance uh\nMaybe that's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything by killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that was somehow pass\nOh okay you were only tried to made me a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are the stupid Linda in champagne Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that and\nI'm certainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe I'm came from a family of arms dealers have within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood support or he is the other dog in this or that that hardly makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to write in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed and now everybody realizes that\nUm and I don't honestly think that the Saudi Government would have been so stupid as to pull us don't like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really know what happened\nNo we don't but but I was thinking about this rogue elements in a consulate consulates these are not just places like boutiques on the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow but people can decide to do something that's\nNot smart and I think that the fellow called in about John Brennan maybe on something and it may have been done partly make Trump look bad and try and make a wedge between ... you know because\nI ... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you'll have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on the everybody on the left in the United states I mean I don't see the game here for the risk involved\nBut I'm saying that right before the election is is that you know causing the administration huge headache\nWell it's going to be administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it this is not this is not the Iranian nuclear deal is is not a a jobs than anything else I mean although we're we're making a big deal out of it because people get all upset about it but I cannot believe frankly Linda that ah that\nOne tenth of one percent of the voters in this country are going to change their vote because of this\nWell I I think that the minister rations handling it very well but I say I do think it's being blown way out of proportion ideally that we've been talking about it for many days early and I was\nLike OK suddenly you're take [noise] I really don't have anything to add to that and I just\nCan't wait to find out whatever we can find out about it for our

evening and welcome to the jumbo hadn't show from Westwood One radio we're with one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six online find as a jumbo hadn't show dot com\nYou can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox in this part of the program we're going to be talking to a certain extent about the extent to which were at everybody says all the time\nWhy is it necessary for the national dialogue to be conducted at that volume\nIs it necessary it certainly isn't\nConstructive it certainly isn't logical\nAnd yet there must be some reasons why it is happening well we're joined by position and psycho analyst Dr Richard ... who was trained in both ... and you're getting analyses to look at this through his book out of control\nApocalyptic psychology in the age of Trump and uh we uh we thank you for being with us up to my doctor grade\nNo thank you for having me do you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get into some of the details behind it why we seem to be out of control at this time\nUh I think it's probably many reasons but the the points of the book was really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology\nAnd I I think the psychological physicians are probably best trade with respect to the concept of religious conflict\nBecause I think for many aspects of what's taking place now that really ... to mimic what goes on between a sectarian groups are out of religious level\n[noise] ... okay I Am a a a a religious level All right uh ... ... please amplify further on\nThat are obviously we're not talking about a\nA two different religious sects per se unless you want to uh uh consider a I suppose the more traditional a Judeo Christian ethic on the one hand as a religious sect in this a\nNew uh identity politics a political correctness when the like as being a mother a religious sect or this is a is grounded in which I'm not a perhaps a totally understanding what you're saying\nLooking back to the gym that show is one of these six six five oh jumbo what does that work in this seemingly intractable national discussion about policy and politics\nThings do seem to be as this book is titled out of control Dr Richard ... position and psycho analyst and the subtitle apocalyptic psychology and the age of Trump or to a rod who calls in from a wire Hauser Wisconsin ... show good evening rod and welcome\nRon are you There God can you hear me yes you're on the radio go right ahead\nOkay I got my phone is like the old well okay thank you for\nTaking my call sure how I I don't consider myself a really elegant person but you know what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot uh-huh it they were talking about George Washington when he felt that it did not want a party them and I just think to myself\nWhat a shame they take it out because\nYou know if it hits you got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter or name up on that and that way I see it we don't need any other white\nUp on Capitol Hill or whatever something happened to the port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but up to me is not the issue right here at the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for ... ... oh we gotta wait till after the election\nBut now the issue is on the other what they had to get it already election\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before it deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society now can faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nBut the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility and I refer to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that and I think there's a psychological motivation ultimately for a\nUnified groups to ultimately ... to small of divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding connections or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is the extremes polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to this is ...\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the writing a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... going on\nEnjoy your show in the shake you thank you when you when you get sort of point when you go to a restaurant or or you go out and\nUh I I don't go along with the person or the establishment is left like whatever the hell or I don't understand this road once the ...\nBut when it gets to a point where you can't go out and have reason debate without someone screaming at you spin on you know and then you can't\nI really don't care of your disposition\nJust let's say let's have a reason to bake I mean if we can talk without screaming at each other ... which ... which I don't do and yet I'm there I called the Clinton machine\nThe machine has his just use to give up the fact that two years ago two years ago ...\nYou know you lost the election okay I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest and when you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nWell again I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons a specially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves antifa that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course if those tactics\nOf silence thing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so fewer and you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else then the only adds who were in my book and you could certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence on the street\nKnow well I think you're ready to several important point a lot of the points that I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that there's an increasing degree\nOf nauseous is within the society and the judge is increasing decree of moral perfectionism and obsession will drinking is in society\nAs a result when ... when when they encounter this those types of psychological structuring individual uh those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the that denied a self\nMakeup and to place them on people around them [noise] ah so you have a group like a anti FAA\nAre claiming that the anti fascist and you look at that behavior it's very very obvious that the behaviors that you have your one would expect\nFrom the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation\nLast project in on the ride for everything that they're doing a and and denying are claiming that it's the right to just doing it so that's I think the motivation for some of this behavior or in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely\nI think what was the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of false ... of the laws that are ... that are\nCurrently on the books are from a place like a Portland for for the mayor of port ... by and a half people rioting on the streets and if you say to the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions\nAnd boundaries or a free society must have\nAnd if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah [noise] uh again it it it is not something that uh that that can can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that go out and there have been other examples for some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought a rioting the balls are more and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass or behaving like civilized beings and that is [noise]\nAs as you say it I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is the is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so agree that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nKnow who has a yeah go ahead\nWell I I again absolutely but it's the role of the Gulf or off at the local level and the federal law enforce the laws of the country [noise] and if they fail to do that and you can expect a increasing outbursts or from the east coast because they're essentially and able to behave badly\nExactly oh we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond positively win or are they are told that their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated I stay with us more to come\nAs a doctor Richard crate and takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\n\nThat reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else would tend to agree with my viewpoint so it's almost a a a ... uh uh it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that hey I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with we must be wrong\nA door beat that no matter how right I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is the level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I just I it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising our children are children have been raised with this concept of preserving self esteem or the concept of self esteem is based on never criticizing never corrected\nIndividual in this carries on into the educational system\nSo you've ... you've got generations now at least one maybe what generation that's really able to look at itself critically a as a result they they have to preserve this concept of perfection and anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs as we go to a break and then we'll come back with some calls but I have to ask you\nIs this a terminal condition that has to say are these people beyond redemption is it impossible\nTo ever a inject them if you will with a note of rationality or have they been so ... into this notion that my self esteem isn't violet that they will for the balance of their lives which in some cases maybe fifty sixty Seventy years\nCease to be affected members of our society\nA well if if you want an honest answer\nI certainly do yes [noise]\nUh I think and also says I'm a clinical level is a very difficult thing to treat and I think that's what we're talking about around and so I I I see the prognosis for this generation is not good well in fact most suspicious\nThis is not good as a result though it certainly is well honest answers are exactly what we need right now will come back and talk some more with our guest Dr Richard crate in the book out of control back in ... it\nWould you like peace of
