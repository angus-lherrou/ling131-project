have been talking about that since October twenty sixty yeah\nYou know it's another one of those now you tell me now you weren't moment right uh and they did that when they did that have a few weeks ago where they were nice enough to write up a summary of the plot to attack America My my my book and\nTwo years later after they're written an article saying no information relevant to the you know Russia probe has no relevant information or to the Trump campaign two years later so why are they doing all of these posts scripts and I wonder if they're just trying to keep up with history\nSo that they can say hey well we we actually covered that\nAre in you know or it's another journalist who thinks he's going to write and so he spoke next year\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah well I okay and let's talk about this Rick Gates one so I felt that he is a ... who was also of course pled guilty right is talking to Mahler um this is talk proposals from an Israeli company in twenty sixteen create fake online identities in an effort to aid that Trump's campaign\nOr New York times reporting he solicited plans to use social media manipulation and gather intelligence to help Trump to feed his opponents in the Republican primary and then Hillary in the general\nI mean it's just more like ... is it they clearly were willing to take help from any foreign power to interfere in our elections right absolutely\nAnd I've been saying this for two years this is an octopus\nThere were multiple tentacles of where they accepted assistance from who they were soliciting wherever they were pointing out dates the papers that they were taking it from you know you have the Russian Internet research agency that's one of the best one cynical you have Cambridge Analytica\nThat's the second technical you add the attacks on Clinton staffers from black\nUh what did the black cute and his regime\nElite counterintelligence\nPushing it you know for that's another one and this one you're talking about with Rick Gates is side group side group as a group of former special operations intelligence people from the Israeli Army would have been working very closely with the United Arab Emirates government\nRick Gates was given a proposal from ... to do precisely what Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency we're doing which was makeup false Americans balls persona thousands upon thousands of false Twitter Facebook feed\nSend out so just in targeted messages supporting Hillary of supporting Donald Trump and attacking Hillary Clinton and in this case they they they didn't get the contract\nBut we don't know whether there was a bigger contract whether there was a secret contract because another person who who figures highly in this game a guy by the name of George Nader who is the facilitator for Schick Muhammad in shape college or in the U.S that's the the crown prince and the chief of intelligence\nAnd the UAE eat and he paid\n... group two million dollars for unspecified service\nYeah it was also attacked by the FBI earlier this year oh rested I was entering the United states and I guess he turned states' evidence so we don't know that kept up the involvement of all of these Israeli firms but we knew to November involved\nAnd when it gets right down to what was going to have something to say about it because\nHe had all ready subpoena the c._e._o. ... mile of this company or another group that they form called wiki strap\nYeah I'm here in the United states and shows them out\nAnd and and and his staff were investigated by a joint\nIsraeli police task force which sees their computers in Israel so again we only know a tiny piece of this iceberg right mother knows it all\nWell now what's and obviously people have said a him you know they feel like Mahler he probably is not doing anything now given the proximity to the election is that is that your take that we made they made me a big bomb after the election [laughter]\nYou know the ... you know I'm going to fall back on the Rachel Maddow saying right if anyone tells you anything is going on in the mother investigation they ... they don't know what you're talking about\nRight Mohler says you know these hundreds of FBI officers Seventeen capital prosecutors apply for a criminal fraud prosecutors are are not saying oh well it's September fifth let's just take off for the next two months\nThey are investigating and I wouldn't have surprised if there were new indictments against Russian intelligence indictments against the rich organizations like Julian Assad's and Ricky leaks Roger\nStone's overdue we're going to see him at politic on next week I think you have to we should ask\nYeah he's got his she's Jamie's ready and freezing gym you know and uh yeah\nLet let me get because we're running short here but are you concerned about Russian interference in in the mid terms I mean and I say this I always say that the fact that you're urging people to vote so strongly\nMeans that it is going to count [laughter] they're not that because that's what he's someone on the air yesterday said oh it's already rigged and I said don't buy into that\nBecause that's what they're hoping is people who are going to go oh they're going to steal it any way Russia's gonna you know I Am like no accent again go ahead anybody that\nSays anybody that says that\nIt says it's already read don't bother you are voting for Trump or you're working for Trump\nYou've got to cut that out and I'm seeing a lot of it on my feet don't protest don't march there were attacked us know that is that is an awkward station\nWe need to blow the voting Marge\nHow to wear any cheating whatsoever or we'll just blown away by the vote marching every individual needs to get out or I

Congress for you a school sings\nDrag them vote yeah I have a pizza party promises beer party for the first\nHave enough already seen have you and I were parents together you'd be a that you'd be good cop bad cop I'm I'm more about threatening to cut their on the kind of ... and you're on the nine year old and I think the parent I'm all about the stick\nOh no I got from Jared sue I got to go around you know uh but\nReally the if anything is going to happen they and this is where Clinton watts and I are both in agreement now I've been saying for almost nine months\nThey are going to\nWhich means that they're going to attack\nPossibly be photo red knot voter registration a voter tallies\nBut make it in the favor of Democrats so that Republicans call to nullify this allegedly yeah yeah yeah and the only way to do the only way to do that\nIs so low this thing out we need to turn out higher than the twenty sixteen presidential election ... literally be the last\nFree and fair election you have

I've never had any to thing I've never had a and I know how angry I Am I on all of my friends that have had that experience and then on top of it\nMock I mean we're a point where I think it was a Tony Schwarz said\nEven OSHA ... read even she played the clip and he's like I Wish you did you hadn't played I Wish you wouldn't do that\nI Wish you hadn't played that like it's so ugly mhm\nAnd I can only imagine how ... ... every woman that's been the victim of this but we are at a point where you have to make an editorial you're like this is how awful the president of the United states is\nBut but you know I get that it is psychologically painful for people even to watch him but that there's an entitlement we were just speaking about how cabinet\nAs a young man of rich entitled white boy was told you can take\nA woman when you want her you play devil's try and go with your friends without asking her and push or in a room it's like you're entitled now to be on the Supreme Court yeah it doesn't matter what it is there is a privilege an entitlement that an entire group of young men white privilege conservative rich men\nAre have been raised to believe in there and they take a woman they will take a seat and even the way he\nGrade he uh he drunk Donald who's a drunk TV what you need ... ... talk about I mean again that people's lives are are being talked about is if it's a game ... level the playing field you know that I'm Talking about this like a like a when you know I'm curious\nWhy was it they got you to have it from your worst strength about her and to fight for Kavanaugh at that point\nWell there are a lot of things happening or correct they were true there were a lot of like that were left unsaid and I thought I had it even the playing field as it was very unfair to\nJudge now I can you're very nicely if they just discovered or read right it was a very unfair situation do I\nAnd that was a tactic and that they dislike because it forces them to actually see their position\nWe'll turn their back on sexual assault survivors when Senator Purdue ran away from ... in an airport in winning it in a men's bathroom fever probably sexual assault survivors that he didn't care about their assaults and that he would not pull this fan or any other man of comical for it so you know\nThat's why they just like it that's why they try to discredit it because\nYou know they decided to be public servants and then did it like with the people in the public actually wanted them to be accountable for their accent\nYeah I mean ... they work for us and the fact that they don't even know how to just how the human conversation with someone and listen\nRight I mean just ... yeah I I mean we were talking about this clip did you see this clip of learning room in the southern ... on Fox News they're literally having beers and trying to take a selfie to celebrate you know getting the current attempted rape is done on the Supreme Court and he falls on his house\nShe just completely doesn't acknowledge it [laughter]\nBut I mean it's just it's like they don't have the missing some sort of human ship or something right didn't even pause to say are you OK wrote that was funny you're you know that was a human moment and didn't go how we ... I mean they're just\nAs sleeping become human talking points\nIt was I I actually wanted to take them for that because I watched it probably thirty forty times that I was like this is exactly what I needed at this mobile\nSo I Would say no to Larry how they cover the Trump Administration right like never admit that anything embarrassing or ridiculous has happened just to just hope that no one will notice that outline\nI mean I think that's the thing that we had been you know as somebody I was I was there on the very first day of the confirmation hearings I was the second woman I read that I was pulled out of the gallery saying senators we need to be heroes and vote now against Kavanaugh\nBy four officers I still actually has stars on my arm bruises on my arms that have not gone bully away from that incident\nAnd you know women were in that hospital they occupy the heart credit building they in and day out for more than thirty days Craig list of higher pot of what was supposed to be a cake walk it over and just a couple of days will be something that will be lasting damage for the Republican Party\nAnd let us not forget that millions of people were activated and we've raised over you know nearly four million dollars\nA barrel fun to take out Susan Collins the holder accountable for her vote that they will be in the Senate next year\nBut Jeannette than two years we we've got to focus like a laser beam on these midterms right now in the U.S you know what is it three weeks four weeks um because yeah I I mean they thought we were the day after the election and for the women\nI mean ... and we've got to stay in that state right\nAbsolutely and I I Would say you know right now it's so important to her father those conversations both the survivors told us something they taught us something\nIn the process of you know on my own staff\nOr you know more than a dozen people came forward\nAnd name themselves as a survivor of sexual violence including myself and my co executive director Ana Marie are the odds\nOn many of us had not full family not held our parents watch just people text messages to the parrot\nUm letting them know that they're okay they wait are you ready to talk but that they wanted to name this thing happened to that and that type of bravery we can all use a little bit of that and not to have conversations with our Republican friends\nAre Republicans is there's a Republican mothers young and and ... actually said this is the country we're fighting for it this is what we want we want in America where we can All right together and and\nParty is and it's especially this president\nIs dangerous to the brown people that I loved him dangerous to the black people that I Know is dangerous to the women that I care about\nYou know how real conversation we have to take this out of ideology or theory and rooted in the fact that there are babies being held prisoner intense in the desert right now and we have to do something to stop it\nYeah yeah I mean when you look at you you talk about race class all of that ... that you know this is a white the ivy league woman pointed to grow up in the same country clubs whenever is Brent Kavanaugh that was dismissed\nYou know in in ... you know you multiply that by all of her sisters of color in a you know the different classes and all of that an ... you know you realize I'm I I I really truly believe that and I said this for a while this blue wave is going to be ... feet is going to be female\nAnd look how many women are running right that we didn't that we've never had before\n... ... ...\nNo but I'm here to do I I I honestly just reflecting on what you're saying and you're right you know there are more women who have\nAdvanced in the primary in the Democratic party's than\nEver before it hit for our country and and many of them are are not women of color but there are kind of Democrat grade we can really be excited about going out there to vote for received a ... leave or Ilhan Omar\nYou know I honestly I I Would say you're a closet for because\nUh we have governors races that are going to be historic like save the Arabs and then sell is a skill um so it's you know it is an exciting time and it will be some Democrats that we're not that excited about that we got to get it that we gotta support and you know that's that's okay too but this is this a really it's\nIt's a powerful moment in us now both say we're going to take every action we're going to do for that so it's got to be more than just voting it's got at the organizing your entire network it's got to be knocking doors it's got to be giving money to black led brown lead and women lead organizations who are on the front lines for these fights\nThis is the time to do that to invest in them to help them get these races over the finish line\nYou know our partners in Florida Florida new majority an organized Florida they sit at a at a table where\nAre you know date Andrew Gillum primary victory was a complete shock to the establishment because based but their time in in like the you know an immigrant and black communities talking about the importance of the governor's race and those folks did show up at any modeling and so when he\nA stock and we can do that all you know we do that in practice against Senator Cruz yes we cannot in Nevada so that's what I'm excited about you know I felt pardon\nYou know for people to be heroes and millions of people showed up and I think that we can make that happen again on election day\nYes we can that's catchy phrase I think I'll use that yes we can\nRescue cat I'm Jen I Am a\nNervous for you that I was your adult supervision during law school but the best of luck to you anyway [laughter] and I think for fighting thanks for taking time first thanks for fighting the good fight we will see at the at the voting booth\nThink they're All right there she goes Jennifer\nS Allison [noise] it was amazing ... she's a we've got
