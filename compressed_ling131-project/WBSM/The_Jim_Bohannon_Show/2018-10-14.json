for Merrick Garland that ship has sailed\nI respect Merrick Garland I think he's a good judge yes he's widely respected judge I think that he was caught in political cross fire in a way that was unfortunate for him but by the way did you hear any conservative\nWhisper a word of smear or attack on Merrick Garland who was a good and decent man no the answer is no\nAnd and honestly because for people who think there is no difference between liberals and conservatives there's no difference between left and right in this country\nLook at the way that Brett Kavanaugh was treated versus the way that\nMerrick Garland was was treated by the way they were not as harsh to Neil Gorsuch do you know why not\nAnd a lot of these like well you know it's really not the less problem is Kevin O's probably notice last probably the reason they weren't that horse to justice Gorsuch was because he was appointed to replace Anthony and Scalia\nWho was the leading constitutional is the leading conservative on the court in other words it wasn't going to shift the court at all and by the way Justice Kennedy was no liberal\nJustice Kennedy was a moderate on the Supreme Court he was appointed by President Reagan Reagan he was he was a as a matter of fact confirmed unanimously\nYeah Justice Kennedy was\nAnd its Justice Kennedy who swore in\nBrett Kavanaugh on a Saturday Night a meanwhile

they postponed I'm considering his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nAnd nothing about the fact of the matter is actually a few sexual a felt\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important that um\nThere was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing involving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no ex wives there wasn't enough thing a clean record until literally\nAfter his hearing had concluded and then they threw a Hail Mary pass and thought they'd make some hay with this one which is totally uncorroborated\nExcuse me you are not there so you can\nI say it is totally on robbery to your right I wasn't there but what what is it that you think should this be the new standard now I'm going to\nTell you exactly what we should have done we should have done it thorough investigation fairly is no reason for us run rushing a lifetime appointment with all due respect we should have just white ... and do an investigation investigation and then actually done this or not\nOkay again off again if there was any available evidence\nTo confirm any aspect of Christine Blasey Ford story even the existence of this party the witnesses that she named said they have no recollection of central party
