realizing that President Trump is president\nClinton is trying to come up with a way to combat this what is your come up with believe it or not federalism Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates of federal power of the modern era she is now discovering federalism again amazing how this works Donald Trump comes along suddenly Hillary Clinton and the west they're discovering the states are kind of great\nHere's what she tweeted yesterday it reality of a Supreme Court with a right wing majority is it the states are new important front in protecting civil rights especially the right to the most vulnerable among us\nIs that really a new important front in protecting civil rights\nOr does it turn out that the states were always an important front in protecting so right now folks are going to say well think about the fact that states we're responsible for the call that's true\nIt was also states that were responsible for failing to abide by the fugitive slave act in an Eighteen fifty leading to the civil war\nThe federal government was trying to force state in the north to abide by the fugitive slave act facing the north refusing to abide by the fugitive slave act states are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policies only as good as the people comprised them the one thing that is certainly true is that the United states\nAs a mixed state and and national system as it is putting federal is thirty nine as a mixed system state governments are designed to preserve the sensuality of locality in American Jurisprudence\nAnd the fact that the west is only now realizing this as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like is the head of the federal government demonstrates just have this honest they are because here's the thing Hillary Clinton and her ... if they ever got in charge again how long do you think they'd stick by the state's rights proposal\nHow long do you think they'd be in favor of states right the answer is five seconds five seconds\nAnd the left is just dishonest about all this stuff at the same left that proclaims that Donald Trump is dishonest vicious dishonest when Hillary Clinton says she likes states right\nNow what Hillary Clinton means is that she wants to use any obstacle to prevent President Trump governing but she doesn't actually believe in states rights and she actually believes in states right and presumably should want to evolution of off the ... to the states from the federal government across the board including if she'd been president\nWe all know that that was never going to happen relatives ever going to happen and said the truth is well Democrats really want is to copy the policies of Scandinavian countries where people forget to tell you this but the policy in Scandinavian countries is not just a massive social welfare state is a mouse and social welfare state paid for by enormous\nUnbelievably high taxes\nThe taxes and places like Denmark and Norway fifty to sixty percent on everybody making more than fifty or sixty grand a year\nOr not talking about taxes on just the wealthy\nEven folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly it would take to pay for all the crap that they are talking about\nInstead what they will do is they'll just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing\nSo they're not really proposing federalism and they're not obviously proposing fact based legislation the left is proposing spending a lot of money so now we're going to get in the twenty twenty primaries from the Democrats who can spend the most cash so we have come out like Harris who's proposing giving every poor family five hundred bucks\nBased on nothing we we really don't know where exactly this money is going to come from how's he going to spur the economy any of that stuff Cory Booker says well why didn't five hundred why not do a hundred times five hundred let's get everybody fifty grand\nSo why not give me five hundred grand by the way my five million largest helicopter pallets of cash over Newark will just drop pallets of cash I mean hopefully people get out of the way if not there'll be crushed by money and die happy\nApparently the idea from Cory Booker\nSo according to Vioxx which is the repository of all things stupid that's not gonna say that everybody at boxers do but there's some intelligent folks box of all why they remain there is beyond the senator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor his idea is to get lower income kids a sizable nest egg\nNo again you're real human but you're not a real woman\nYou know why because you are not genetically it real woman they or if any or gender or gender and feminine that you're a male who had surgery to look more female and it you carry feminine attributes\nThat is accurate that is accurate using language and it's not accurate used language to say the or a female on Sunday news broke that the Trump Administration seeks to narrowly defined gender as an immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth\nWell actually they were defending sect that way and then you guys can play section genders he said the same thing I ... I'm a ... react to this latest cruelty which is obviously just one more cynical move clearly designed to stir the pot ahead of the election trans people or the latest conservative whipping girl like African Americans in the Nineteen fifties\nOr gay people in the Nineteen nineties in two thousand\nNope nope\nGay people can objectively claim to be attracted to members of the same sex\nThat's a subjective claim there is no way to objectively verify that so that is what it is I can objectively verify your such provided measures hay and black people white person who claims that there are a black person is not in fact a black person is Rachel goes all learned\nI was speaking of the F Scott Fitzgerald festival in Rockville, Maryland this weekend when I first read about the administration's intense since then I've thought about a lot about Nick tear away and the great Gatsby ah [noise] and then this this continues instead the actual world contains all sorts of wonderful variations of nature look there are two camps\nAnd there's a duck billed political is in a blue lobster and Venus flytrap isn't it a miracle that God has given us all these wonderful things truly if there's room in this world for these there shouldn't be ruined his world for me\nThere again nobody is ingesting that transgender people should be mistreated but you do not get to tell the entire civilization for ... to find biological sex on the basis of anti science positions because how you feel on the inside\nMy favorite part of this these isn't suggestion that science is on the side of this policy there is no science on the side of the policy promulgated by the left that sex does not exist so they started off with sex exist but gender is unconnected with sex and then they went to gender exist but it exist on a spectrum and they went through sex exist again but it only exist on the spectrum\nI suspected sects didn't exist for a while now does this again but it only exist on his back when there's a spectrum of sat there is no speck of must act\nHuman beings are sexually demographic okay if you if you want to suggest that there are other species where sex can change fine or you or not you're not a fish or not one of these ... and you are human among humans sects does not change that's not the way this works\nBut this has been pushed by the hard left and so you get the spectacle of Stephen cold there ... cutting Trump putting President Trump on this trans issue and how telling is the remark that he's about to make er it's pretty telling a ... second\nSomething amiss ration is thinking about writing new guidelines the same gender should be defined quote on a biological basis but it's clear growers in science now you care about\nScience [laughter]\nCrowd share that now you shouldn't you be happy that they care about science\nI'm confused he's is when it comes to climate change that the Trump Administration early anti scientific when it comes to the EPA there early anti scientific and that's bad but now they care about science when it comes to biological sex\nAnd that's bad does he even see the hip hop or seeing what he's saying himself the answer is no because of the left even scientists malleable now my position on climate change I've made clear multiple times on this program I did like an entire program on it a couple of weeks ago talking about the new IPC report\nThe world is warming it's warming at a lower rate than the scientists said it was going to according to their modeling probably a majority of that warming according to every scientist I've ever seen including why Spencer who is\nThe right favorite climate scientists suggest that the majority of that warming is due to human action that does not dictate global governance of the climate in order to dictate that we have to crush capitalism in spirit or an action\nBut that is considered an anti scientific position by the left is considered a ... and it is considered I guess that belonged to mention science when it comes to biological sex now\nIs this is a new democratic position good luck with this guy is the ... okay so I'm just a second we'll talk about some other democratic positions and why the news cycle continues to cut in favor of the president of the United states first\nLet's talk about what you do in the bathroom to get ready to go out every night\nWell I use dollar shave club because I Love the dollar shave club has everything I Need to look steel and smell my that's where I was even more is the fact I never have to go to a store I mean you know me I'm not a big fan of the human and that means I don't have to go outside to even get all this stuff delivered directly to me that can be fully thoughts and what I use I don't run out here's how it works\nDollar shave club has everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for the ivy covered head to toe hair skin face you know that they've got it\nAnd they have a new program where they automatically Kenya stocked up on the products that use you to tell me what you want when you want it shows up right at your door from once a month once every six months\nThat's what I Do I mean I use their their black pepper and said chapel which I really loved their ... which is\nJust delightful smells great and it leaves me feeling silky smooth plus with their hands from just held the more you by the more you save and right now they've got a bunch of stars that you can try for just five bucks like they're all haircut after that the restart box ships regular size products in regular price so what are you waiting for that you're starting to set for just five bucks right now a dollar shave club dot com\nAnd that's dollar shave club dot com slash then so how stupid is less agenda with regard to the anti science nonsense pushed by the transgender but but there's an actual tweet from New York Times science the idea that a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\nWell ... realistically speaking I suppose that's not true in the only in the most most narrow sense is determined by chromosomes is determined by genetics and theoretically you could have some sort of both male formation\nWhen you are born that leaves you bereft of the genitalia match up with your actual genetic so I guess in the very narrow sense it's true but the idea that that means that sex is on the spectrum among humans is just stupid\nOr loved is headlined the anatomy does not determine gender experts say right genetics determines gender\nOf the researchers who have studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon hole the typical male female pigeonholed lived there just created by society\nSo that the Trump administration's latest plans and find gender goes beyond the limits on scientific knowledge the idea that a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is not true we've known that it is natural for decades as John as Joshua safer and endocrinologist\nAnd the executive director of the ... the center for transgender medicine and surgery of course and the mount Sinai health system in New York you don't talk about a scientific stuff\nLike I talk about whether they're beneficial effects you transgender surgeries overtime pay there is not good evidence to suggest that the end effect over the course of decades is actually significantly superior to do surgery and yet this has become part of the transgender movement shtick now\nLet me be clear we live in a free country you want to go cover up your own genital such a problem or you can find a surgeon is willing to do that for you\nDo for the free country but let's not pretend that the science is on the side of all of the claims that are being made by love it they buried down in this article I say genetics does play a role though oh you think\nOh you think so in ... by the way you know you know it's not just got to tell you because they mail where did you have his twig and berries physically removed in some sort of action and he would still be a male and if he intends to do so in the surge where we are not supposed to consider him a female\nThat isn't that is not logical I Want to talk for just a second about the sort of propaganda that's been promoted on on this issue and it really is insane propaganda so the the notion that has pushed by the left that transgender isn't is not a mental disorder is completely a scientific\nHey now what the what does that they like to say things like the diagnostic and Statistical Manual because the DSM five suggests that\nGender identity disorder is no longer a mental disorder instead what the DSM five says is that a mental disorder is equal syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition emotion regulation or behavior they're flush the dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental process these underlying mental functioning\nNow this is the this is the the funny part socially deviant behavior and ... and conflicts that are primarily between the individual in society are not mental disorders unless the devious or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individuals described bumps in other words\nBut yes something it makes you think that a pink elephant is talking you know if this makes you feel bad this is not actually a mental disorder according to the DSM\nThe definition makes room for it's making critical for politically correct posturing right if I'm having a significant problem ended up myself oh I have to use lemon on society's intolerance is no longer consider a mental disorder\nAnd so if you are suicidal because you're a man who believes he's a woman\nDid yes I can still find a way to blame it on the side you have to say is the reason I'm suicidal because people are mean to me and society not because I've suffered with this\nTerrible conflict inside my inside my brain for my entire life and now societies fall is how the DSM five avoids the obvious implication that if you're a man who believes your woman you have a mental disorder if you're by the way if you're a\nLeaves or skinny or a skinny person believes your fat we all acknowledge of mental disorder if you're a skinny person who believes Europe at its called anorexia it's dangerous and it's a mental disorder if you're a person who believes that you do not need a left arm and there's something called body just mafia this is a mental disorder dramatic believes your woman and you don't need a pianist then it's not a mental disorder it's fighting salt\nYou explain that one to me\nAnd none of it has anything to do with science and all of it is specifically designed to blame society for what is\nClearly and obviously a mental disorder the reason that I'm curious about calling in a mental disorder and the reason I Do so in because\nYou can't actually treat mental disorder by blaming it on society if you want to come up with new treatments for mental disorder the way to do that is not by saying that society at large is responsible for the discomfort people suffering from the mental disorder and somebody who takes mental illness extraordinarily seriously my grandfather was either bipolar schizophrenia\nIf

capable missiles on their territory oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article uh that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat weapon\nA there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange of weapons could include a an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense system but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack and that certainly is not good enough so we want to do I think\nIs all set with the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so divided as the star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing\nAbout the notion of a missile defense that is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles at the speed of computers\nAnd the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like and it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get it better I mean we have systems right now our our strategic missile defense system station and California and Alaska are

I I think one of the differences is\nIf you if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level of a level of quality that she didn't have before [noise] and I'm not saying it should mean this much but it does and and the fact that\nThat suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent is who your sports teams play and there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide\nTo a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps their CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job on on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes the pop culture and a major league sports team mates you culturally relevant I mean when Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players you know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're\nOffered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly um that sends a message that this is a good place to live\nA ...
