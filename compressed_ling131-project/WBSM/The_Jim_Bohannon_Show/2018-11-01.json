Kanye West in an attempt to staying Robert Mueller with a fake sexual assault accusations and that's all of that we begin today with the left continued narrative that right wing rhetoric is driving murder across the United states\nNow that there's a lot of talk this week about radicalization and polarization and the idea is that right wing radicalization is being led by the right wing rhetoric at Fox News and\nAnd the right wing rhetoric from President Trump expressing their viewpoint today is Paul Krugman who is legitimately one of the worst column in America yes heavy competition over on the New York times editorial page\nWith folks like Charles Blow about Krugman is truly an ... comments I usually reserve that word only from Michael most but it's certainly applied to Paul Krugman as well proven has column today called the hate is on the ballot next week\nAnd here is what he said just in America ... what about Islam is last refuge scoundrels and both sides has them in the last refuge of cowards so his suggestion hair provokes you don't know what these words mean\nWhat about is is a attendant newfangled word for it you don't want to pay attention to the stop your own side is doing the blame the other side so if you're talking about President Trump's sexual infidelity and then you say oh yeah well what about Bill Clinton's sexual infidelity\nThat would be what about it and I think he's saying and what about as and is now taking place on the basis of rhetoric just if you hadn't noticed\nThe wave of hate crimes just in the past few days bombs were mailed to a number of prominent Democrats plus the and then then a gunman massacred eleven people at a Pittsburgh synagogue meanwhile another a gunman killed two African Americans in Louisville supermarket after\nFirst trying to unsuccessfully break into a black church if he'd gotten there now earlier we probably would have had another mass murder all of these hate crime scene clearly linked the climate of paranoia and racism\nDeliberately fostered by President Trump and his allies in Congress and the media telling black people is an old American tradition but is it experiencing a revival in the Trump era that sentence is purely despicable\nThe idea that killing black people as an old American tradition but it is an experience and we were Bible I assume what he means by that is that slavery and Jim Crow or old American tradition and that Trump is reviving those which of course is a complete why he ... he continued just\nWhen the bombs were discovered many on the right immediately claimed or fake news or a false flag operation by liberals but the FBI quickly tracked down the apparent source of the explosive devices\nFanatical Trump supporter who many are already calling them ...\nWell that would be all of the folks on the left you wish to attribute his actions directly to President Trump the man arrested at the tree of life synagogue Paul Krugman right has been critical of Trump who he apparently believe isn't danced medic enough but his regime's been fueled by conspiracy theories\nBeing systematically spread by Trump supporters the claim that Jewish finance ears are bringing round people into America to displace white so here when it gets to the point is how our Trump apologist dealing with its ugly picture partly through denial\nPolice shot by police officer was shocked that Dallas a couple of years ago ... years ago\nPresident Obama has had a lot of things against the police just before that\nObama wasn't responsible for the shooting but if we're going to talk about radical political environment that oftentimes is involved with raising the temperatures that violence breaks out to ... to ignore all of this is just ignorance and not only ignorant deliberate attempt to drive you nuts\nIt's a deliberate attempt to raise the temperature and and that is unsustainable\nComing up I Want to talk about how we are being ghastly there's a lot of talk about political

[noise]\nCan mention the restaurants out but what each claiming that it's only the only the right is responsible for inflammatory rhetoric and that is what is causing all the problems in our society that it's called gap lightning and it just driving people up a wall\nAnd the Democrats adjust it but they are responsible for none of what has happened President Trump is the beginning of time with President Trump the universe burst into the lawn suddenly the big bang or politics occurred and certainly time began flowing forward before there was no such thing as time then President Trump run on the scene\nAnd suddenly he was the creator lord and master of all bad rhetoric in the United states I Will condemn the President Trump but I Believe they get used inflammatory rhetoric I'll condemn other host right think that they're using inflammatory rhetoric or exaggerating their case or making things up\nI Do it every job lay on the program but I'm not going to get by and pretend that the law is not responsible for at least an equal amount of this sort of rhetoric\nI'm not going to pretend to anti Semitism among white supremacist is somehow a massively greater threat Jews across the world and in the United states and the Democratic party full embrace of radical anti Semite like when did start store that's the mainstream Democratic Party doing that\nIs a mark of both political immaturity and deep philosophical\nI've been a big advocate of everybody ought to look in the mirror and it's all of our responsibility to take the temperature down that's something we actually ought to be doing\nBut Democrats aren't interested in doing that they're interested in raising the temperature to St Paul Krugman thinks the temperature is raised or lowered when he suggests that Republicans are all a bunch of evil people who don't care whether folks get shot at a ... I think he's making the country more or less polarized more or less radicalized when he suggests\nThat President Trump and Republicans are responsible for terror attacks do they think they're making things better of course they don't think they're making things better and if folks on CNN can accuse Fox News host of dialing parading in CNN is doing exactly the same thing with John Bass and I'm amused amused\nBy Democrats and and CNN hosts you suggest well Republicans are engaged in conspiratorial thinking we never engage in conspiratorial thinking really I've been alive for the past Twenty years\nI'm old enough to remember when you suggested that haliburton was behind the Iraq War when he suggested that George W. Bush lied specifically get American Soldiers killed because Iraq was a war for oil I'm old enough to remember when you suggested without any evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump actively coordinated with the Russian government to skew the result of this election\nBad rhetoric has been a part of American politics for very long time and his ratcheted it up in recent years did not start with President Trump president from exacerbated because President Trump has never lowered the temperature on anything and his wife\nThe media have ramp this thing up to eleven I've been saying for years President Trump is it a lot in the media are at eleven and then they're surprised when the temperature is is overheated you gas light people they get angry they got radicalized\n... I've never seen Republican conservative as angry as I saw them about a month ago during the Brett Kavanaugh saga\nThat was the result of the Democrats engaging in extreme partisanship an extreme rhetoric failing to recognize what exactly is happening here calling it what about as him when you suggest correctly that bad things are happening on all sides and that everybody is kind of acting like garbage right now\nThat is contributing to the environment that is making things significantly worse\nAnd I think folks on ... but I think there's some some left you don't care because they're so ensconced in their partners in world view that to even acknowledge that folks on their own side are engaged in bad behavior would be to lend credence to the other side and when it comes to defeating from\nOn the basis of this stuff is cynical now but that said this President Trump have an unfortunate tendency of putting his but so far down his mouth and it goes through his calling out his ass and then back into his mouth again creating an ... stupidity you buddy does President Trump tweeted this out after visiting Pittsburgh\nI I mean it's it's just ridiculous he tweeted out ... I was treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh the office of the president was shown great respect and they very sad and Saddam day we're treaties so I'm really means treated smoke protests was not seen by as staged by the way\nThe fake news stories with just the opposite disgraceful\nShow it is true as I say that the media have missed covered this story from beginning to end it is also true that when you go and visit the site of a mask anti Semitic shooting the worst in American history the key central part of the story is not how you were treated that's not really the important part of the story\nIt's not and it looks like grandstanding Mr President please don't do the ... I always say please don't suggest he's not going to listen but this of course is not is not helping in any serious way okay well meanwhile\nThere are a couple of other stories that that we must comment on here so as I said long ago live by the ... job by the tiniest Kanye West\nBecame a love of the right for the last six seven months after he started making noises about how he loves President Trump and he was wearing a mask I hadn't even saying that he was thinking freely all of which is totally fine but as I tweeted as soon as you started doing this\nLive by the current age I buy the cognac Kanye West is not a stable figure\nIs not somebody who decided to become a an ideological conservative after reading that combined works of William Buckley in Russell Kirk\nKanye West is the guy who sort of says whatever is on his mind that day well that resulted in a reverse on Twitter yesterday he is not rejected President Trump or written to President Trump but you started tweeting out about sort of his political leanings now is that I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most\nI support prison reform I support commonsense gun laws all make our roads safer and then he continued he said I support those who risk their lives to serve and protect us\nAnd I support holding people who misuse their power accountable I Believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents are fighting to protect their children from violence and more Calvin sounds like a stump speech and then he gets to the point\nHe finally he finally to reach out I introduce Candace Owens became so and the the black conservative who was associated with with ... moved to the right\nI introduce Kansas to the person who made the logo and they didn't want their name on it so she use mine I never wanted any association with lots of it I have nothing to do with it so blacks it is a movement that ... that can this has been pushing and Charlie Kirk has been pushing to get black folks to leave the Democrat\nAnd in announcing blacks at ... suggested that the logo for blocks it was designed by Kanye West he obviously does not feel that way and he's upset about it and he pointed out my eyes are now wide open and now realize had been used to spread messages I don't believe in ...\nAnd distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative so out ... and also ouch so that's not good but when you bet on people who are not the most stable people in the world and you pretend that they are deeply stable\nThis is a not unpredictable consequences I think it's fair to say that is not the least predictable consequence that has ever happened in human history\nFortunately that was not the the ... story of the day the dumbest story of the day came courtesy of a guy named Jacob wall I mean explain the story you in just a second because it is too wild and ridiculous\nFor me to forego on this of all days we'll just go in just a second but first let's talk about the fact that at some point here we are all going to plot if he ever faced up to that reality because it's uncomfortable and therefore you haven't gotten a life insurance you're being a responsible you need life insurance everybody needs life insurance having life insurance is actually a good feeling it's nice to know if anything were to happen to make\nMy family wouldn't have started off on me well if you are interested in getting life insurance the best place to do it as a policy genius and the easy way to get life insurance on line and just two minutes you can compare quotes from the top insurers and find the best policy for you and when you compare it costs you save money it is indeed that simple policy genius has helped over four million people shop for insurance\nThey placed over twenty billion dollars in coverage as well\nAnd they don't just make life insurance easy they also compared disability insurance in auto insurance and home insurance if you care about it they can coverage so if you've been avoiding getting life insurance because it's weird or confusing\nGive policy genius of tried just go to policy genius dot com get those quotes applying and it it's the responsible thing to do you can do the whole thing on your phone right now and you should policy genius is the easy way to compare and by life insurance again go to policy genius dot com the best way to compare and by life insurance\nSo how crazy our politics will Kanye West to the second craziest story of the day\nThe first grade your story of the day yesterday was this crazy story about folks who are trying to think Robert Mueller they're very upset with Robert Mueller and they believe that Robert Mueller is somehow it deeply compromise how's he compromised well\nHe's compromise because it investigating Trump and therefore there was a scheme\nTo find women and pay them to lie about being sexually assaulted by Robert Mueller\nI kid you not according to the Daily Beast scheme became public on Tuesday when Robert Mueller staff only ask the FBI to launch an investigation into the matter for weeks and it's been simmering below the surface with numerous reporters haven't been tipped off by a woman who claims you've been approached with promises of cash at the center of this game is publicity hungry Republican lobbyist Jack Bergman\nWho's repeatedly dabbled in Internet conspiracy theories in the past\nIncluding promoting the idea that murder DNC staffer Seth Rich was killed by deep state government operatives Berkman denied involvement in any attempts to pay people to frame or accused Muller but he also claimed his witnesses were going to expose the special counsel\nAs a sexual harasser you scheduled day Thursday press conference a Holiday Inn in northern Virginia to introduce his first accuser\nNumber one if you ever are attempting to launch incredible fashion some sort of accusation you should upgrade from the holiday in just a recommendation site there we are in the parking lot motel six\nThe lights always left on for you and good luck with that that's not the part that is a Berkman says we're going to prove that Robert Mueller as he drunk and the sexual abuse or\nYeah sure you are but that's not the part that's best the best part is that Berkman apparently hired I he hired a intel agency in intel agency that was that was supposed to investigate\nRobert Mueller and his efforts to dig up dirt on the other Berkman appears to enlisted outside help Jacob\nIt right wings cut her personality who's tweeted inane things for years about mad mad that President Trump he's a self described credit birth and he said Berkman had told them eat hired Matthew Cohen who claims to be a managing partner at the private investigations companies surefire intelligence\nTo assist with the investigation only one problem who is Matthew calling who is Matthew calling Matthew Cohen as it turns out is Jacob all okay and Jacob well apparently set up a bunch of fake linked in town for people who worked for sure fire intelligence\nBy grabbing all these just random pictures from the Internet and using them as employee pictures where his take business\nSo for example he ... he said that the investigator was named Donald tree horn again as a stock photograph of an actor and he just use that and then that was in the ... and then the television station chief\nHe called the ... have only one problem that's a picture of ... the ... the Israeli supermodel\nSo he he he went through all this trouble I feel bad when all that he went through all this trouble to create a fake business to hide what he was doing from the government and then he went and got pictures of actors and use them as his state employees\nThe financial investigator a surefire intelligence is supposedly a guy named Simon ... who Simon ... a picture of Christoph Waltz Supreme salad higher there [laughter]\n'cause then I got the guy from Inglourious Basterds to be the financial investigator insured by our intelligence pretty ... I mean Christoph Waltz in in Inglourious Basterds does have a good record and tracking people down\nBut I mean my goodness apparently the deputy director of operations for sure fire intelligence is Dr Mike hardening of the first Baptist church of Troy, Michigan so well done this is the best part of it is that ... was asked about all this and he denied all of it and then\nIt turns out that he registered the website under the name ... under the phone number of his mother\nThis is what the Daily Beast ... suffice to say our politics is too crazy people have been driven out of their minds short buyers website domain data listen email address during wolves name and then of a legally suspect financial firm he held next management\nSurefire website also contains images upload it to the same Google Cloud accounts wall wins it at the mall or investigations on Monday nights night any involvement in or knowledge of surefire he said he works for an influence marketing company in LA\nYeah turns out that I'm not so much so\nYes things are crazy out there and everybody needs to calm down now that did not end the crazy yesterday there was a lot of crazy yesterday my favorite bit of crazy actually was not even that it came courtesy of Joe Donnelly this was late breaking crazy last night Joe Donnelly is the Democratic Senate candidate in Indiana is the current senator in Indiana and\nHe was in a debate and he started trying to describe his staff um it didn't go well for Joe Donnelly had to say\nOr state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job or director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine but\nOkay the same thing is true when it comes to this sort of stuff because in a country that is free where you started is not where you end up in ... the idea that where you started is where you end up is a way of ensuring that people don't do all that they can in order to better themselves\nIt's really really dumb stuff is really dumb stuff well we'll be back tomorrow to break down the latest\nInsanity I'm sure that there will be some between when you hear this when you hear my voice will break at all now may be Ventura\nFirst [laughter] the street and why do you do you\nOn dairy all they're in an exclusive interview with ABC News the White House\nCorrespondent Jonathan

in Philadelphia Halloween has\nSort of come and gone out a lot of interesting things not as many casualties this year that I've\nSeen yet up people wearing the wrong costumes though so\nI Want to talk about too big things is our one President Trump a lot of fire tonight because he's proposing he hasn't done it yet\nSending Fifteen thousand troops to the border and I'll give you the CNN take and how they're making this out and what Trump is essentially saying is we're going to form a human wall there\nAnd the caravans there's more than one caravan coming our way they're not going to be able to bypass that that's what they've been doing it just turn away from whatever the authorities split up in Mexico or in an ineffectual manner\nSo CNN has found all kinds of a legit military people appalled to shock this is outrageous\nAnd the bigger broader issue is Democrats and they're willing accomplices and the media are saying the big issue in this campaign is health care that's all that and it really it's Trump on the ballot from their side\nAnd why are we so divisive on immigration we'll get to both tonight it's because what the election\nOf twenty sixteen one of the major elements that wraps together a lot of stuff with President Trump and that American citizens and workers are concerned about\nIs headed our way that's why so sure there's politics involved but it's also a very very substantive issue for American sorry you get to me eight six six fifty jumbo will do it eight six six fifty an hour how we\nGot to get you in on this because you may be in the middle of doing it on my show until it helps you had found the other day a book I Know there are people that don't like\nYou have out candy this is ridiculous I Know about giving out apples and some people have given out toothbrushes but we found a guy that was giving out forcing material kids coming to their door can you imagine forcing material\nWasn't a dentist either what's next day water pick a step in here

and rightfully so why do we can ... it's the men's pie of Halloween so I got a start up tomorrow going after ... pie but we're also talking about here in the ... show President Trump's sending Fifteen thousand potentially\nOf our military to the border now you have to understand that ... percent of that it's not an easy thing with just ... we have a lot of stretch thing around the world\nBut he's potentially going to set up a human wall say you're not coming into the country and if you cross the lines you're going to be put in tent cities and you're going to stay there until we adjudicate you and send you home that's the way it's going to work\nI think the American people say that's a winner they'll get them let's go to dawn in Montana let's see what she has to say in a big Senate race out there Hey Don welcome in\nLow um I mean she Tina that except for a long ... I loved candy or\nOh my ... peanut butter cops our number one I don't dislike them but you know you don't need the peanut when you have chocolate here hey and with all the allergy shocking that they're number one\n[laughter] yeah I Know that's all the children that are allergic yeah yeah mhm well\nThey do like candy corn and I think we should send our troops down there to force back an invasion\nHistory that's an invasion ... tree\nWell look I agree and that they don't like the word invasion because by and large they're not armed\nBut just the mere idea of four to ten thousand people were just going to a bottle of the border and that's it it certainly is an invasion the word is appropriate yeah\nYeah I think it's an invasion self will not scared at [laughter]\nWell thank you Don well ... what what I have two is what you're going to see is they have mobile fencing they can thanks in large parts of it and then bring people in and out to Jane and put 'em in tent cities\nIt's doable but it's going to take an awful lot on and you know Fifteen thousand or enough to blockade that kind of thing and that's a signal Trump presenting I'd she got a candy corn that was horrible stop and I love that candy corn song\nUh in addition to that\nNumber one is receive peanut butter cops I never in a million years would have guessed that and in fact peanut related candy bars are in the top\nFive or three out of the top five by\nThe way right next door to me and I know we reach Wilmington, Delaware is number one candy or lifesavers what what kind of places that have chocolate out there and you go on with life savers maybe you ought to secede along with California from the union or something like good\nLooking for people who agree with um CNN Tonight though in the military people that bring when they're saying look this is a stunt and you really going to take Fifteen thousand military given how stretch we are around the world\nI think Trump is making a play here and he may do the Fifteen thousand to say you are not going to get in for once it's just it's not going to work and I think people are saying just common sense will be for once no\nYou are not going to do what you want to hear that is not going to work and all your pocket Mimi ACLU lawyers and everything else it's not going to work\nTo go to Dave and crushed in Iowa next with ... year Dana\nHey Dave already ah let me give it up phone lines\nOh let's go to Charlie he's driving through Iowa hey Charlie welcome to the bone ... show\n\nIt does not go I was talking about war where I've gone to figure out who that you know I'm just kind of wonder why\nI'll tell you what they ought to wait a minute I'll answer I'll I'll tell you what they say they're running on in the media allows them\nTo champion this they're saying this election is about health care and they're running on it now they may say that and think there's an advantage but clearly what they're running on is you're angry come out stop Donald Trump and will impeach him that's what they're running on\nBecause I Am old war or whatever I can I get an answer to say what you know but don't ... your ... you know what they paid him and say\nWell where I Am in Philadelphia they think they have an answer thank you thanks very much\nYou know we used to call them the soccer moms I'm calling them the ph D moms because they're smarter than the room we have a couple of big congressional races that depend on the so called PHD moms who are enraged so they're saying they're running on health care what they're running on his rage\nAgainst Trump rage against something they think was taken from them rage from the type of person he is and rage of Trump voters they rose up against both really [noise]\nThat's what it's about let's go to Janet Long Island New York hey Janet welcome to the show\nHi Hi thank you for taking my call yoga I likely says I mean what what uh are you serious lifesavers\nThat's Delaware's yes

LA relate to\nIt so that the reason I call it because um [noise] the people around me everybody here and I am Hispanic um we had they call each month on to tell him to seal the border um\nYou know is this just he's responding to the people that are calling him and he's done the research we do need troops down there if these people want to come they have to do it legally we are a nation of laws okay and enough said enough already and\nI hate takes given the area what they do what they did in Mexico is they just bypass where the authorities are so if you don't have an unbelievable human wall there they're going to be able to bypass it thank\nYou Janet standpoint care of that and I and I trust that Donald Trump in weight loss and thank you so\nMuch you Janet thank you happy Halloween post

Seinfeld show about nothing\nThe real pitch for the show was just a comment about how comedian get to the material on the show about nothing was just a joke and an episode about the show within the show the pilot was filmed that stage of as you Luca Lanka studios the steam studios where I Love Lucy the Dick Van Dyke show and the Golden Girls were filmed and is currently the red digital cinema camera companies studio\nIs responsible as we head towards the midterms for this current booming economy\nOkay\nForty seven percent believe Trump is responsible Twenty one percent say Obama is responsible\nNow you might say my God will come on Trump's a President Trump at these reforms that Trump has put in and these two years\nThat's the way I see it but given the media given the stubbornness of all kinds of things\nIf Trump or not such a brand or there's a lesson for Republicans here always be closing always be brand he's the one that did it\nTax cuts\nKnocking down regulation optimism that's the reason for it it's still want to get some to forty seven percent of the universe is president over ... responsible wow you know he said the pillars emotion this was all going to happen Trump's just lucky came along oh stop it\nBut still forty seven percent said Trump if this were another Republican I bet they wouldn't get anywhere near forty seven percent it takes constant branding\nConstantly showing your keeping these promises as hard as it is to believe Twenty one percent still said President Obama is responsible for this booming economy when his policies are diametrically opposed to the Trump policies\nIf the economy goes south or they're going to say Obama's now than Trump will be responsible\nI mean there's a lot of areas of baggage for Trump I get that but the economy is not one isn't it amazing in this election cycle the economy tax cuts knocking down regulations all racist I fall on what I can tell nationally they're not a big deal people don't care about this for some reason\nOn one side or another it's only two things\nIssues like immigration immigration and what it means to American citizens American security American workers\nAnd on the Democrats' side we can hardly wait we're going to get Trump and we're going to get a big time six days from now by voting out Republicans in fact coming up\nI'm going to have on my show

state rep dog catcher the whole thing\nIn all five publications you can't vote for any Republican they claim if you support the Trump agenda and you voted for Trump you have the fever have you heard that before the fever\nLike the yellow fever or something you have to be cured and the only way you're going to be cured is if every Republican insight loses six days from now wipe them out and then it'll doing on you'll you'll wake up the next thing oh which Trump we've got to get back here with all these Republicans we don't have anything now\nHe said well some would try to paint a false equivalency that both of our major parties are bad lacking ethics and their slaves to a book tour reelect speed and see we find ourselves unable to agree\nOne party has been ripped by a mania a cancer and seems unwilling or unable to return to its roots and instead Panthers to fear anger and the worst instincts of a minority of its members the Republican Party\nAt this point we can only see one way to break the fever stunning and unprecedented losses at the ballot box because of that we cannot and will not endorse any Republican for any office this year in any way shape or form\n\nHe says these are sacrificial lambs\nBut so be it it's necessary because huge Trump voters have a fever have you heard that before the fever got to break the fever\nIs this kind of like therm of flu penicillin antibiotics wipe them all out what was the Republican it'd be like the week party then people will wake up and stop being zombies were Trump\nWhich gets to who will be blamed for Republicans don't do
