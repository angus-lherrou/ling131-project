these are political ads these are like public service announcements that they put out I was just in St Louis they had it there\nThe this image is in their mind and you see on the Internet where they say to each other a limited nation is rhetoric which is words where they talk about getting together and taking care of the liberals when Trump said that\nThat is ... ... we got to stop using the word dog was yeah these are medical phone calls for violence\nKnock them like what\nAbout how in many ways all these stories are connected the the New York times bombshell\nThat you know we all know that
