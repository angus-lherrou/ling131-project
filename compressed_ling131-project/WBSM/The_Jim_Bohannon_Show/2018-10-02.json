I'm I'm Lindsey Graham ...\nThere's just a motel on al sham since I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy are you a gang rape touched no I cannot imagine what you and your family's gone through\nOil power God I Hope you never get it out the American people can see the sham that you knew about it and you held it you had no intention of protecting doctor for not\nShe's as much of a victim as you are God I hate to say it costs these had been my friends but let me tell you when it comes to this\nYou're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friends\nDo you consider this a job interview\nThe vice you can ... it was like a job is considered that you've been to a job interview I've been through a process of advice and consent under the constitution would you say you've been through hell I I've been through a hell and then some\nOkay so now then but by the way all now what they say was over in Tucson right and then you get angry look ... look ... so now Lindsey Graham goes on George Stephanopoulos listen to this exchange\nIt appears that the FBI will not be invest it will not be questioning those college witnesses who contradict Brett Kavanaugh's testimony about his drinking oh isn't that a relevant given that there is clearly was drinking going on at least it's a lot of the party\nNo I think ah you're trying to betray Amazon stumbling bumbling dropped gang rape bust whoa during high school and college was Bill Cosby ... bay I background checks over the years or whatever on uncovered this\nOkay now I Want you to remember\nWho George Stephanopoulos is I'm going to get to the point of this humans George Stephanopoulos from the documentary called the war the loan was built by Hillary Clinton to defend Bill Clinton from the accusations women credible accusations that he had a salted exposed himself to even rent\nHere is George Stephanopoulos Nineteen Ninety two bullying a reporter to tell a story about an affair the bill Clinton was having during the elections\nAgain Kim if you did it in other words you know\nWhen you don't want it and I think that it will be ... people will say nobody believed him and people hanging on me [noise] that part of it that\nWay because of his campaign people this market [noise] and you have a campaign\nThat understands and difficult time there's nothing like [noise] um and you know that's what I mean than anything we can't do anything slaves or anything like that but you you know that he did the right thing and they didn't\nGeorge Stephanopoulos working for Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton who went on Matt Lauer show to say that the women should be investigated Matt Lauer was Marilyn ... of a shock in so many women one of them turned over sure and was in the middle of taking her when she did and meeting\nMedical attention that's who's reporting stories\nThat she was ... or putting together ... ... ... that's ... and that and NBC and CBS where Charlie Rose doing the same thing can not be a little suspicious\nCannot be a little suspicious of the way this narrative was unfolding we're being told from watching it on me four percent of their time is spent with him at Kavanaugh side of the story on the one percent\nJust say hash tag men are trash [laughter] really yeah we're hash tag hate man yeah these go and these are very common it's true at every level it's from the activists level it's true in the media it's run academia it's for politics and it's true and the government\nYou have all of these examples so I think the most\nBlatant one comes from the media came out from the Washington Post fairly recently\nFrom Susanna ... new tell Walters a professor of sociology and director of women's gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University\nUh she had a piece out that asked why can't we ate men [laughter] the headline not why not and she ... by the way just in case you want to blame the editor of that piece in say was a just a tantalizing headline she lives in the article what\nWe have every right to hate you you've done is wrong hashtags because patriarchy is long past time to play hard fourteen feminism and to win\nWell not just the Washington Post the New York times recently hired Sarah Jong yeah to their editorial board Sarah Jong I Can't read ah everything that she wrote on Twitter because this is a family forever and she did say white men or\nUh she said oh man it's sick\nHow much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men well those are some of the more polite things that she said about men goes on and on and on there was a there was an outcry from reasonable people mean to say conservatives\nTo say are you really going to let this woman on your board they said absolutely and then Twitter which is now censoring hate speech gave her a little check mark because she is now a\nA big important person you know and whenever you choose them of this whenever you actually hold the stuck up to them they always say well it's not often and this is just this feminist here in Athens there but that to me\nIt's like a mobster saying we're not all hidden it only we only have one or two hit men but you know they control everybody you know you have these people and you know denounce them well one of a deal with\nThat is white and you say it's not all feminists it's just the public ones [laughter] ... yeah I Would even say it's just their leaders but it's not even just their leaders leaders of feminist in all of these areas so the one excuse or there was a magazine I probably can't even say this on the air or a female dog magazine\nAnd a and they said that all of these things ...\nIt's just who formative miss an injury but uh uh well it is certainly being performed but then you look at people like that Hawaii senator uh Mazie Hirono who says many to shut up it's time for them to shut their mouths and do something good for a change\nYou know other than creating civilization [laughter] other than forming our policy\nIs ... what do you think she ... price for that with an electorate that I assume it's half now well\nI yeah I think her poll numbers will go up because her her base I mean Hawaii is quite far to the left and so her base or these feminist men and women and these you know there there were sixteen hundred men\nWho took out an ad in the New York times full page at\nJust said that they believe all women and they are the good ones there you know they're not the bad guys and but it goes it's all over the place even the ones who say we're just kidding a Huffington Post at a piece on this uh what women mean when we say that men are trash\nIs a quote it can actually be directly translated into masculinity is in transition and it's not moving eh thing fast enough\nAnd this is what they're really talking about this is where academia is coming in this where these senator senator who run was coming in is they're saying no no it's not it's not all of masculinity it's toxic masculine oh that writes stocks English so the CDC has a study the toxic masculinity\nAnd ah but what they what they define it as\nIt comes from hedge demonic masculinity this is a gender theory which is that a ... has your Monica masculinity from or W Connell formerly Robert O'Connell he's a transgender guy who is now a and he's now a academic\nHe says that it's the oppressive characteristics of masculinity boys and men must assume and perform to be considered a real man\nWe have to say what defending the country and fires and things like that going on taking care of your family I don't know I'm ... and so that's what they're getting it and they and then as a result of all this academia all of his activism we're getting these bogus statistics the CDC is saying that in America one in five women is raped\nOh come on if that were the I mean I ... or they might be studying downtown ... [laughter]\nI don't know if your dog or a or Chicago is enough but according to the national crime victimization survey\nThat the actual number is an order of magnitude less at the most so you've got in a in a culture where you've got it where it's permeated by lives lives by the media lives by politicians lives by academia or you're going to get a culture that says men are trashed the trouble is the reality just doesn't match up\nThose old that thought just a second\nThis radio show is just one small corner of bench through a world that you want to hear more\nYou should head over to Delhi wire dot com where you can catch up on any than shows you missed or listen to me on the Andrew claiming show or ... or you can have some more like a moles if that's your kind of thing you can listen

satirical destruction of left wing culture or ... what was the state or whatever and also the entire daily wife team has it's lingered on the pulse of politics and culture and we'll keep you up to

it does create a pretty ugly politics\nWhen I mean this is a you know this is a tension that goes back to the ancient Greeks that that we're getting a sort of life's a straw to situation there was an BBC ran this interview with a few mothers\nAnd the question was why his feminism affected the mother son bond a mother was interviewed she said she was furious because she gave her her little boy\nGender neutral toys you know dolls to play with this or that\nBut he gravitated toward the traditionally male toys guns and army men that sort of thing and she's furious over this what is she to do\nThan a million studies about this the kids do this without any training whatsoever yeah\nOf course they do and I got to tell you your your Prager videos coming out of the right time because last year\nFeminism was the Merriam Webster word of the year this is the end or an surprisingly so but I Can't imagine\nThat this can go on forever there's got to be a turning point here because what they're doing is is they're creating this uh the sense of panic based on lies and and slander and they're in this case obviously destroying a good man's reputation and Brett Kavanaugh how long can that persist\nThe for people of good faith and reasonable the apple and a half a half of the global population those men say a week if we can no longer tolerate this this is a vicious this is wild is based on lies\nYou know it's funny I had friends who had two boys and they wouldn't let them play with guns so the voice took a piece of wonder bread without the center made\nIt into a gun and shot each other my goals for Michael Walsh shows thanks so much for coming on a great job and I will be listening to your show later on ... not\nA wire things I've noticed about young men I work a round a lot of people who are much younger than I Am and I've noticed that when we talk about women as which is what men talk about him and talk a lot about when what we say the same thing you notice that women has the same traits we can see them with our eyes\nAnd experience and in life but the younger men are angry about ... minutes angry about the trace of women and older men tend to talk about the trace of women with great affection so if you say that women for example women are more emotional than that and that is true women are more emotional than\nMost of us older guys kind of find that charming and the white phones and he's kind of softens our lives to have a woman in our life softens our lives a little bit because it reminds us that emotions do play a part in life and we should pay attention to the\nYounger guys feel somehow cheated by this and of course it only took me a while to figure out the reason is the younger guys had not been told nobody told them everybody told them men and women are the same any difference you see society lean juiced okay\nAnd so there ain't ... shaded they've been lied to the same is true women it used to\nAnd the women told their daughters watch out for men they have a very very powerful sex drive they lose their heads they do stupid stuff there's sometimes cool some of them are bad guys you have to really pay attention to this\nYou know and and once you knew that you understood but when you're dealing with a good man when you were dealing with the men who didn't behave that way you were dealing with somebody read a lot of restraint somebody who had been trained to respect other people to understand the women were in fact other people you know and that was very hard it's very hard for young men when they are awash\nIn testosterone to get that through their heads and it's very hard enough for them not to think like\nTarget you know there's the target females target female that's what that's everything in your body is telling them to do it\nSo girls will reward and we were told him ... most men most men are pretty good you know most of them are pretty decent especially when they're sober most of them are pretty decent and they they learn to respect that as well and they learn to respect them as power and they moved to respect his strength\nIf you lie about what people are\nNarrative it's because of that that the conversation we're always reacting to the conversation rubber making the conversation it's ...

thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre are are\nUnder ... parks on an airplane every state\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the gym ... six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six delighted to have you on the program tonight as we are talking about the new deal that's been were dealt with Mexico and Canada\nAnd do that deal has a a is designed to replace NAFTA was something that is a little more American friendly we'll see just how that goes over with the Congress or whichever Congress it turns out to be of course with the midterm elections coming up and keep in mind of course\nThat uh although there are elections in November the new Congress will not actually take power until January so you could have sixty days left with this Congress I'll be at a with a a a lame duck Congress\nAnd the doctor Michael ... is our guest is a public policy analyst and professor of finance at Stockton University\nAnd a lot of what we've been saying here I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think what I'd probably most surprised about is\nThat we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first and it's the Canadians\nWhose economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would uh address my theory a professor you may give me an a through an ethanol take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless that less than developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nSuppose the uh and here's the example I use my classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they need coffee so we're very efficient at producing wait we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of wheat\nWere not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like Columbia let's say and South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say\nSuppose the U. S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for your wheat\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why somebody complaining you would say\nAnd the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example\nAnd make just sweet anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go make weight but the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up\nAnd that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we done\nBoth countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens to the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but they say we don't want to do something else yeah we plan to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the Rob is with with Canada are\nYou calling from Sheridan Crane Missouri yeah good evening Sharon\nDating can and that's a good thing I heard today only what a radio is that China has announced that they're going to be paying terrorists\nI specified item and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items and second\nHave bad trade agreements that we had had\nThis I'm Sorry I I just I too jaded anymore I Do not have some stake notion of well we've got to help everybody else\nThere is one that well it's not all of their lives to politics tower and follow 'em money and if you follow in Florida\nIs put on our politicians\nBy that lobbyist by governments by our own government if you follow that money you will find exactly why we have had traded right at five\nWell we're coming up on a break your I left the doctor did was linked here I'm sure more ruined their opinion after the break a shirt I had a couple of statements ear\nTo what you just said please stay on the line\nOr one would be of course that are no matter how much lobbying cruise on behalf of foreign governments and goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much and you know do and the second thing is I think you are vastly underestimate him the extent to which so many elites in this country ... oh so so guilty about how rich we are I'm ... and we'll be back in just a moment\nOr\nAre you behind on your federal student loan payments you may qualify to have your entire student loan forgiveness with one free call that's right if you're a teacher police officer firefighter worked for a nonprofit federal programs are still available to have your entire student loans forgiven\nYeah except we don't have to have them built the tanks in the planes but\nIf the tanks in the planes have so much steel and we can buy to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost ... for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves we're better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce a cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nRaises another point and I had a ... or something I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you you said that ... we\nWe shouldn't have to give the the Chinese our ah our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese have extracted from us\nAnd we'll come back we'll talk some more about uh some of the the Chinese are applications that possibly this new trade agreement with

that's the football and the NFL right now why all off the ... you know what the next NFL coaching job to go to Mike Leach judge seriously should go to Mike Leach\nMy God he's a ... as creative as anybody\nYou know we might lead shouldn't take another phone team and just got it on a plane of defense rate went over Utah otherwise we right this is what you do your higher Mike Leach and your pride weight Philips away from the ramps\nAnd Mike Leach should be smart enough to say you know what I'm not gonna give wedding advice remember that last year which is hilarious by the way we gotta get back on the shows and I love my college I'm having Mike Leach withdrawal okay I've every time I see Washington state I sit my girlfriend down I said that's the great Michael each one of my favorite people to interview\nAll right 'cause it's just so funny so and the other side of it is\nYou hire defensive coordinator knows what he's doing and you let him do his job\nYou and football games because this leak has become Mike Leach what it is\nNow who invented that are running shoe dolphins mouse Davis something like that who was who who's the architect of the running shoot Wayne fonts who was it somebody like that you know what he's still alive bringing back\nAny off ants that that had anything to do is passing bring it back because it's back here to stay this is incredible look at the yards okay you weren't you Wayne fonts save us okay what ... how about this are you ready Sean\nI was I was thinking somebody in the Houston Oilers back into the war and moon because they run around and shoot\nThey did Ernest given Curtis Dunkin' Webster Slaughter they're Great Hey we're Jeffrey hey we're Jeffries already ready for this memory when someone for four thousand yards meant something\nRight now there are six team quarterbacks on pace for over four thousand yards right now you have it quarterbacks on pace for five thousand yards yeah that's what we're looking at right now\nJoe ... of all peoples on pace for five thousand years I I Believe he is he's never crossed a he's ever pass for more than four thousand ...\nOver twelve hundred and fifty two yards which would put them on pace for five thousand and he's on pace for thirty six touch thirty two touchdown passes as well this is from ... Joe flat goes in your number eleven in the first ten years of his career he threw four thousand yards once\nOnce and now he's on pace for five thousand yards\nAll you have to do as light a little fire owners reruns named Lamar Jackson and look at Joe Flaco go your wind them up like a toy and look at him go by the way\nI feel bad for march ...\nOkay here's why for so I don't because he's a thirty second overall pick any gets guarantee that money and blah blah blah al ... and then if a quarterback but the way they use them in Baltimore as such a gimmicky player right now it's kind of pathetic so what do they have them do he comes in he's under center and\nThey're running a wild cat\nOne out of style years ago when it stopped working 'cause every NFL defense figured out how to stop the wild cat and they do stupid thing where Joe Flaco goes out wide 'cause he's such a great athlete so Joe Flaco goes out why Lamar Jackson's under center and they're kind of afraid to have him from\nYour drafted a thirty second overall I Hope to God he can throw in for some reason it's getting to the point where when he's ... he's understanding you kind of no he's not going to throw because he doesn't\nSo why even put a man there I mean that's not what's winning your games right now Joe flag on the field is actually winning ... games I'm a little just perplexed every time I see Lamar Jackson going there 'cause I'm thinking this is a distinguished college quarterback who's got a Heisman Trophy\nAnd you're using them as a gimmick right now so somehow he's going to go from a gimmick to being you're starting quarterback next year sadly Joe Flaco screwing up their plans because if Joe Flaco social five thousand yards at thirty two touchdowns a handful of interceptions\nHe essay by Joe hey lemar\nI'd love to see that if this team which is an eight and a team wins ten games or make the playoffs and by the way they could win that and then I have seen nor they really good weather because Pittsburgh stinks right they can win the AFC North I'd love to see the women MC north hardball keeps his job of course we get that hot seat for him\nHow to use a note uh Joe Flaco and release them or trade them for Lamar Jackson of Joe Flaco keep this up\nJoe ... and ... it's going to be great I I you know people have chaos right people are hoping for baseball chaos people walk college football playoff casts every year by the way I'm One of them I liked the captain sports show you like to cast and sports too it's fun\nI Love to see the chaos and Baltimore with Joe Flaco you got to put a little more Jackson who you're afraid to throw the football right now as a starting quarterback next year of a guy throws for singles or forty five hundred yards and thirty touchdown and goes to the playoffs you get rid of Joe Flaco\nNo you're not you still want to contract oh that would be some chaos I can't wait I Hope it happens to be honest I got kind of like that stuff is funny by ...\nIt off on case came to me as early as you say OK skied them is the night that way screwed up again by the way we can do it looking at a running quarterback oh so he gets handed Peyton Manning so he's a freaking genius\n... no he wasn't handed pay them he inherited the Broncos team with ... yes as a quarterback coming off that play off when the ten people had\nAnd then he ... landing takes guts\nTo bring and Peyton Manning that you remember this is the ... men and we didn't know after his neck surgeries would feel ever ever would regain is where you take this the risk as every other team that if I wanted to write but he had had I'm like no but he had a talk many into that and there was this fermenting yes he had a dream of credit\nI give him credit for manning\nEvery other quarterback decision is made doesn't work trapped in past ... number you know first round yep tending to raise your drivers simian\nYep giving money that case Keenan offering Brock a ... after

Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nBut I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact it's been a long uh but I remember\nA severely castigated the defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not uh and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know the images is baloney uh although I was using drugs or languages Mex but let's talk to a\nA General David uh about that uh that part of this or\nThat in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nA witch and which is what it was just what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that should have been made available to you\nWere out semi I think any commander was a would always walk more resources but I think the um um\nOfficers who were in command physicians senior to me made it very clear to the national command authorities that um armored vehicles were required for survival ability and um that basically protect or for so\nYes obviously um [noise] you know the more on where you can have around you that each side is usually\nGood so um yeah we we certainly could use that but we didn't have it or the situation dictated that we use ... yeah and so that's what we do\nThat is true and they're not ready for it yeah there's a U.S please continue ran a yes\nNo I just want to build David Mike I wouldn't be went into the gunfight that night in a Humvee an armored Humvees and like Mike that in the trailer it's like going in you know in a court and vertical Corvette a parade everybody shooting at you know they were in on armored on be more than a thousand people\nAnd we all recall what happens to armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say ... and\nAnd uh ... uh it it was I assume common knowledge to everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee or right\n[noise] well I think that is true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and and the safely protects humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to be starving Somalis I I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going and into a firefight and I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years that a lot of time to think about it when we we had this turn coal peacekeeping operations in from my perspective there's nothing peaceful about those kinds of operations\nI'm In this case you had a set of ... you had to drive out though that have a good beer\nYou brought the un and the un became my third drive by the power who was the uh the the thing that I had the most value they're fighting for that and I'm In an escalated I mean there were things that occurred back in June and July with the ... the house race\nAnd I don't think the folks at home recognize that there was a firefight\nOr by until we got the three or so and so\nI think a lot of the calls for armor that we're not consistent with the information that was coming out of theater with regard to what was going on\nWell maybe not to the general public would have to think the defense secretary Aspen had that information\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not sure that you have the ability and I can't really speak for Les Aspen I mean I I can only say are the perspective that the folks that are I was around on the ground have at the time\nAnd that was that generally speaking or there was a very little information that was flowing out of Somalia back to er either D.C or back to to uh to centcom\nIndicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure that everybody really
