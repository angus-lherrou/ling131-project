Morsi in West Virginia don't rule out of ... in Wisconsin when I went my run down that got us to Republican night a plus five wins I'm not really expecting that\nBut I mean if the way it can I think there's a lot of discuss growing with the media right now over the non coverage of the care of it\nSo I think there's\nMisunderstanding about where we are in terms of the\nThe electric way there is no blue wave there might be a right away I think people are mad at the media I think there are rallying behind the president there running around some great candidates and this could be a real surprise

of foreign policy today what I most like because I teach come on you and I don't agree about originalism I'm an originalist but I like the way you laid it out when James Madison went through\nBut I'd like to get to the thing that I think is most important\nEight thousand people ratify this document I never trying to discern the founders intent I Try and discern what those states delegates thought they were voting for and that is useful me of the federalist papers in the anti Federalist Papers\nAnd it's a vast amount of thanks so you're you really knock Heller pretty hard so I went back and read Justice Scalia's a decision I'm Still persuaded bicycle you that he's right have you gotten into it with say Randy Barnett at Georgetown yet talk about originalism and how it plays out in the un American dialogue\nI've talked to him yeah in fact I he wanted me to come to his class there and see what yeah yeah uh yeah and I talked to a Ginsberg who's a originalist is sort of moderate or there's a\nThere's a spectrum of the ... opinion within the originalist a physician and most that's correct the federal ...\nMost people in the federalist society or originalists them the extreme originalists are the ones that tend to get nominated for the Supreme Court and um I think Kavanaugh and ... were such such creatures of I guess what I'm saying is that\n[noise] and this will you on the\nPresident's ... such creatures I think they're wonderful man and extraordinary jurists and I do not to but when you say in this political environment I liked the human eyes rather than the humanized you agree with you\nAnd I don't mean to I mean did not I don't mean to dehumanize them at all\nAs that's great you know they're they're just very very firm originalist they are um\n... committed texture listed the document as it was understood at the time of the frame\nRight but where will disagree is that I think that\nThe Heller decision which I pick because the decision is two thousand eight it's the one on the second amendment as you well know and um that the school is called that his masterpiece\nYes that therefore it's the the clearest articulation of originalism in the Supreme Court decision though far\nYes and and so when I look at it\nAnd look at the actual behavior and thinking of Madison and the spring of Seventeen eighty nine when he's writing the second amendment and the debate in both the house and then in the Senate and then the debate in the eleven states ratified\nWhat's going on there has nothing to do with owning a gun it has to do with whether or not\nA defense of the republic will be in the hands of state militias or a federal army and their great fear of a federal army as big as a standing army not just a fear of what the British Army represented those that's primary even of the continental army\nYou're absolutely right that is the Justice Stevens descent and I think American dialogue exception expands on her way that he did not uh that might persuade young people are undecided on the other hand I I Am persuaded by the general understanding in the states at that time consuming firearms and frontier defense that even beyond the militia people of course\nHad the right to carry weapons in the steward discussion instead of what I wanted to get to what I really liked about American dialogue and I want everyone on my team the originals team to go and get as you explain how James Madison came to bitterly at first and then\nI'm a resigned himself to and then maybe even a applied equal representation in the Senate as the necessary means of getting to where he wanted to get which was to solve but he didn't want to get the dough sovereignty\nHe wanted more he's more Hamel Tony and then most people know and you lay it out there was no doubt in anyone's mind at the end that the states would forever have equal representation in the upper body correct\nYes though he regretted it I mean but he knew that it was absolutely essential if the constitutional first to pass and then be ratified because it was a gesture towards a state sovereignty\nUs and that the the the makeup of the convention and then the make up the ratification conventions\nWas are filled with people who were very dubious about\nAny federal government that created a consolidated power structure\nThat was the creation of the British leviathan they thought they were escaping from and so if he had made that compromise um it would have never passed and he was as I was saying earlier committed to a a a making those kind of compromise decisions\nAnd he later said you know that was the only thing to do and but when he first left\nThe convention in September of Seventeen eighty seven and they wrote to a Jefferson he said we failed\nUm because the Senate issue that you're describing who is still gives the states\nOf a stronger a subset of authority and power than we thought we we we can allow and that that will be a problem for us so\nIt requires a unanimous consent of the states to amend that provision and therefore I don't think it ever will be I have one suggestion\nReruns on I Know I agree that the the big decision they made was Nineteen\nLike like a like a lot of the state legislatures are the people at large it would have supported that you are but there does come to be a problem in the sense that let's say north and South Dakota have representatives with the total population that's less than half the size of Los Angeles\nBut if you look at Rhode Island versus Virginia the framing that sort of disparity in Vermont even worsening Vermont had the greatest disparity with Virginia ...\nThat's true although Rhode Island didn't count because they show a\nRabbit Vermont did let me give you a suggestion that hold your overthrew the break if I can professor at the suggestion is I always use or when Jim risky about an hour and some I mean are are are committed man on the left but he has a

is not in the habit of letting people know where they are in the course of an investigation because they can shoot people and they don't want to let home or or ... or whoever did this\n... that could it could be a false like they might not be focusing on Florida honest to goodness it's an investigation they wonder whatever you can to catch terrorists ... you may not put out real information is certainly aren't going to help them\nSo Nancy it's a last question for you I think the media has to go back to covering the election and covering the caravan not the packages or they're going to lose audience share what do you think\nI I think we've got to cover all of it you know I think that the fact that these devices were sent to ten I'm very well known\nAs currently and formerly important people in this country is a is an important story but I completely agree with you that the caravan which has gotten a lot of coverage and I think should continue to get a lot of coverage\nUm it certainly has certainly been a focus for us on the CBS Evening news every single night and will continue to be um and and obviously as the congressional correspondent you're not gonna get any argument\nFor me about how [laughter] how about how important your coverage it says thank you for making my my case for me\nIt's good to talk to all be watching John Dickerson on Sunday on face the nation and um let me run down again thank you Nancy Curtis a why I'm not a bubbly optimist but I Am looking at the numbers I'm a numbers guy Kevin Cramer has won North Dakota that is so over he's fourteen points I had\nThat one is that that's a plus one Republican Marsha Blackburn is up six and rising in Tennessee not going to lose that seat the Democrats had happened to get the Senate\nI'm Josh Hawley Mike Braun are ahead in Missouri in Indiana respectively\nUm and I these that's a combination of real clear politics average an internal polling and my sources in fact they think Missouri's out of reach for Claire McCaskill\nLet's pick up two and three I think Governor Scott wins by virtue of his record and you heard him on the show at the beginning of this hour that's pickup number four\nI think Martha mix Sally is easily the most exciting candidate across the United states the first female attack pilot in American combat aviation history is Martha mix out and she'd young and she's smart and she's tough\n... survivor of sexual abuse by the way talks about that on her campaign trail and she's up against a hard left left the\nOut out there on the edge Christian cinema

McSally holds that seat\nExcited Dean Heller I didn't really think could hold on to Nevada because it went for Hillary\nBut there are two polls that have come up with a real clear politics average has him down\nAgain I mean just very very honest with you here I I actually use me real quick ... politics average has seen our up one point seven percent but some internal a stuff I've heard and Jon Ralston post lead me to believe it's just a dead heat you can't even tell\nI I Am not done believing John James can win in Michigan\nHe took it was by Twenty one ... a month ago he down seven now you know why he just growing up on there and gaining like Debbie Stabenow has money now Debbie Stabenow is the nice nice lady who's been around forever and then nothing for you\nJohn James to find a Jew in an attack a helicopter and Apache commander a West Point graduate then he went and he's selling up his record by getting his MBA from the University of Michigan but we can put that aside probably even helps in Michigan\nAfrican American brilliant smart fun funny but on the show dozen times people are starting to know John James am I on Twitter at John James am I on Twitter he is rising with a

embarrassed about it is going you know almost convicted and removed\nNow Bob Hugin could sneak up and I I think ... a pat Morsi and German ac could surprise because of the deep red nature of West
