just six days she's confident enough she says should the American people knew her as credible\nI never did any such thing never did any such thing the other people alleged to be there don't recall any such thing as such a thing had happened it would have been the talk of campus to women I knew in college and the men I knew in college says it's inconceivable that I could have done such a thing\nAnd the New York times is reporting that just last week the person making the accusation was calling other classmates saying she was not sure that I had done this again again just asked him for a fair process where I can be heard and I can defend my integrity\nAs you say a battery out classmates were asked by her they were called the incident and told them that she couldn't be certain that Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself so she takes practice and uncertainty given a doubt ... are you surprised that the New Yorker published this account [noise]\nI'm not going to comment on the

finds a single person one single person to say that he heard this story and he's pretty sure that it was Kavanaugh that is\nYou know I mean it's just beyond it beggars description first of all the New

his great credit just pointed it out on doing a story\nYeah again coupled with the fact that I mean if you can't put him at that party\nYou don't have a short party of I don't want to point out did you have time for a bit of an anecdote of how we're going to change I guess so going to take it back to two thousand three before you and I had met before I started to National Review I work for small wire service and one of our client papers of the Boston Globe and by that point I developed a source close to Senator John Kerry shall we say\nI'm working on a story it mentions carry it mentions ironically John Edwards and my carry source has some quote that I can remember the exact line it was something like you know John Edwards has to do this and he talks a lot but he doesn't really help us much on this on this issue\nAnd so he was but he can't use my name got to keep me anonymous so I'd say\nOne Democratic Senate source says you know John Kerry is that do face and doesn't really help at all on this issue I send it off to the globe and the globe the Washington bureau chief was a terrific guy was a mentor helped me out a lot of my younger days as love Jim you can't put an anonymous source trashing somebody like this one here if somebody wants to trash somebody like that you got to put their name on it\nBut it's got to be a darn good reason you can't just do that now [laughter] yeah you know the New Yorker piece has an unnamed source saying the cabinet was quote\nAggressive and even belligerent when drunk\nWe don't know if this source really hung around with Kavanaugh we don't know if you hung around with Kavanaugh once twice a bunch of times maybe never met him we're having named to go off than we are to take the word the New Yorker that this person with no identifying information\nOr was in a position to seek have non could accurately characterized it with something like that\nYou know this is why they believe journalists anonymous sort of you there was once a time where this was not an acceptable standard where you could not have an anonymous source just go to town on this guy don't worry about whether they want to know who's\nWho's more over in the narrow space and the New Yorker piece they say that\nA misery mirrors has brought some New Yorker by a civil rights lawyer who is not identified\nAnd it seems to me if you're going to be an agent a smear or you've got to be identified partisan politics is nothing new but this level of partisanship this level of the sequel is new how did we get here\nIs there any hope of the escalating the madness Michael ... where the ... professor Yale and author the book the Constitution's\nLet's let's go back for a moment to this confirmation process and the post script in the book you have a some suggestions that are fairly radical\nThey could actually help us avoid the kind of mess that we're going through now that we also went through with the Justice Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One what should we do\nSo uh I proposed actually an oversight committee a overseeing the present generally with a certain kind of structure\nBut you could imagine taking this proposal and applying it to the Senate Judiciary committee itself the proposal said we there should at least these on the Senate committees where there are all with an equal number of Republicans and Democrats no matter\nWho controls the presidency which party and no matter which party controls the Senate\nIsn't isn't that true of the ethics committee\nI was just about to say that is true of the Senate Ethics committee but no other committee but you could extrapolate that to other committees and then there are a couple of other reforms that I proposed\nHow should that come in and he'd be asked chosen\nYou could imagine a system where the Democrats\nPick the Republicans on the committee and the Democratic caucus and the Republican caucus picks the Democrat so each side is trying to pick what they consider the most reasonable senators on the other side of the aisle you could further imagine a committee where each other off\nHe um had subpoena power um you didn't need to have an ... a majority which\nI'm a ... would mean that for example in cases where there's a unitary government where the Senate controlled by the same part of the presidency the opposition party at least still have some oversight ability\nTo try to pry loose information to make sure that the American people are really seeing what they want is Eighteen so we are radical suggestions but you know we're living in a world of radical polarization\nThe woods with this committee that you're anticipating would that be for specifically looking at Supreme Court nominations or any judicial nominee I had\nProposed it for a presidential oversight cause a problem with\nPresidential oversight is when there's divided government that's all the um the Congress does is just hearing after hearing after hearing and try to prevent the present from doing anything but when there's unified government uh when the presence\nParty controls the Senate these congressional a watchdog become lapdog since I was trying to even things out a little bit I proposed for Senate oversight committee of the present but you could imagine that we do it for\nThe judiciary and here's why you might imagine that we do that\nBecause we live in ... or so to speak a nuclear world not just with nuclear weaponry but to the nuclear option today for Supreme Court nominations it only takes fifty one votes not sixty as it used to in an earlier era\nUh now what that may mean\nIs um is that I'm at this and this may lead to sort of very nasty intense polarization um when the majority party jams it down the minority party throat um and when the president doesn't control the Senate maybe at everything has blocked that was the garlic\nI'm so he swore to himself he would never let that happen to anyone and yet they still per pursued him even though they cleared him of all that\nCheap let me ask you how's your personal life or people rallying around you and your family and your former friends with the department of your former
