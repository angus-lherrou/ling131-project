or we don't want our kids to suffer [noise]\nWell I don't want them to ah to suffer from dreaded diseases or or a crippling auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life\nThe the day to day method of of learning by doing and by making mistakes\nThat's a necessary part of growing up and in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up that's how you do it that's how you grew up is how I grew up making mistakes\nI a good look back on on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about boy was I'd dumb [noise]\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that the wasn't fun but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd it sounds to me that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation the parents engaged in such behavior\nAs if they\nNever thought about it\nAs I say it it is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\nWhy would a parent what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright and you could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate my child will not ever stop there do they will learn nothing\nI Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of of formative life and learn nothing because every chance they had to learn how to get away and make sure that they don't learn except maybe they learned that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better\nThe way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment when they they've followed by the side with correct the behavior all the things that are yes hassles ... and sometimes\nEven pay for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce I mean yeah you're having a kid this is what you're supposed to do\nIts it interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can figure that out [noise]\nEverybody I'm Talking to right now talking with that one eight six six five oh Jim boat\nWe were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes you grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult so that they can cope I won't always be here\nPeople who are parents get older they die the kids were supposed to carry on that's the whole point I Would have produced kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone\nIt it just strikes me as all I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that or am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past ... lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment or heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem\nWhen I had six six five oh jumbo is our

sounds like a trend not a universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend that you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all I don't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculates this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they ... they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say [noise] life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain no gain some pain of course we don't want our kids to undergo other other types of pain I mean it's

America to your tax cuts work dot com is a great sponsored my program\nRun by John critters network and they are now organizing for the vote in November by providing tools that tax cuts work dot com to get people involved in these elections mobilized I'm joined by Alfredo Ortiz CEO of the job creators network good morning Alfredo how are you\nGood for a new I'm doing great how are you doing\nGreat first question eight hundred point drop on the Dow yesterday what's that mean\nIt means the market fill up almost forty percent and that Donald Trump got elected often [laughter] but\nNo reason to worry no reason to be upset just part of a normal correction in advance of the market\nYeah headache\nYou know abolish had the advantage of basically having free\nUh money out in the uh the economy in Europe percent interest rates the fed had it and you know it was then\nAnd then it just kind of a natural cracking a great economy um that has decided to rate them of the interest rate and the market itself is raising interest rates because the dollar strong right but doesn't that kind of a natural reaction out at all indications that the dollar is strong and the and the economy is hot\nNow the job creator network cares mostly about jobs as given by the name and tax cuts work dot com cares mostly about tax cuts how integral or the ladder to the former\nOh I completely integral we looked at the overall that one of the things we got a number is looking at the unemployment rate first of all on jobs all of the lower regulations let's read a lower\nEconomy where at least twenty seven percent unemployment rate is as you note you know that's the lowest rates in Nineteen sixty nine that's Neil Armstrong walk on the moon [laughter]\nIt is it is a kind of remarkable thing and people are taking it for granted but I saw polling this morning suggesting that the American people are not connecting the tax cuts with this this perfect economy why is that message not getting through or is that in fact bad polling Alfredo Ortiz\nNow you know he I think that that is probably correct point and I think part of it is when when I Lived up people kind of forget when times were bad right people forget that we had an unemployment rate that was about ten percent\nUm that we had the Nina growth rate is less than two percent of the Obama administration and ... you know ... or ... or point two percent four point lead ... percent\nUm and expectations are we going to close out the year it over three percent right people forget where they come\nAnd people forget that they're better off today than there were two years ago they got to keep asking themselves as they go into the open up a number Artie Iraq Today than they were two years ago\nNow you are headed to page to Indiana where there's a Mike Braun Senate race obviously than voting begins I Believe today you're headed to Nevada where Dean Heller is going to ... point lead over um the Democrat he's opposing then you're going to Ohio which the tougher Senate race in some congressional a congressional seats are open\nYour non political but you were going to where the jobs have been created Indiana Ohio and Nevada\nThat that's right and you you know West Virginia is another stop you know I've been a at with vice president while to go in the air and read on the valley is that you know I've had now all the old days polls are really close to ... ... people understand and realize\nThat this president does understand how to make the economy work and at the end that\n... years ago but this is what about like come November say the paycheck to paycheck on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot you know great retirement accounts IRA pension you know that are seen great return all that is on the ballot come\nAnd we want to make sure that people understand that\nTwenty six states or the election tax cuts worked are kind of people can get involved there but the big\nBig question remains does energy on the side of the job and be employed the newly employed and demographics that are employed at levels not seen in modern time do they get the message that the Republican delivered for them Alfredo Ortiz\nCertainly I Hope it won't [noise] then\nAgain I go back to the unemployment rate job numbers I mean every single\n\nWriter you're broke it up on all I'm\nSorry about that buddy are the are you guys are out on the road so much that you get into the cell areas where you need your patriot mobile cell but tax\nCuts work dot com America go get involved in the fight I Do mean that do get involved

see what happens and obviously during the president the campaign had a lot of rhetoric about China that was very tough\nThat is Eisenhower strategic ambiguity that his Nixon's madman theory and here you have Jared Kushner family basically telling you the theory of the Trump presidency is Keaton Ghassan\nYes absolutely and uh having just been in Kansas City doing some work on the book promoting it\nUh something called the Edgar Snow foundation which has a longstanding decades long standing with China\nA part of it related to my alma mater the University of Missouri I met my many prominent Chinese officials who are in here in the next day to travel from China and they don't understand Trump and they kept pulling me aside can you explain Trump to us can you explain Trump to us I'm like I can offer you some general observations but this ambiguity component is important and\nJared Kushner the president believing it obviously Henry Kissinger believes in it and it is\nPlaying itself out and the other component of the Saudi relationship I said there's something about Jared and his effectiveness with the Saudis early on that for something that maybe in America we don't appreciate enough and I'm not saying we should I'm just saying it's a factor that's real families for his family were them\nThat's more important than a lot of\nA moderate graphs that you've published her citations you have an academic journals or degrees you've achieved or other titles that you've had your family their family they are\nHeld it higher esteem they believe dealing directly with a family member that gives Jared and I think when people talk about unappreciated aspect of how he can be effective I'm not saying that's the only part of it that would be disrespectful but I think it's important and sometimes overlook component\nNow I can function and he can ... success succeed\nWith major Garrett his brand new book Mr Trump's wild ride I just printed out people after reading 'cause it's actually very serious thought piece as well as great reporting that I ... I just thought good reporting was coming I didn't think he'd actually\nDive into what is going on in the dynamic here I Want to go back to ... and ... yeah I've only met Jared once for about five seconds are introduced by Lighthizer somewhere I don't have any field for him I don't know how smart he is I don't know I gather is very smart I don't know how he uses his ambiguity\nBut what do you think he is a ... about ... because the the the Congress and vote Magnitsky yesterday and that's not an option I mean that's not we can't break off relations with the Saudis\nYou know we can't it's very difficult situation and I don't know what happened we don't know what happened but no one feels good about it and each and every passing day we all feel worse about what probably happened and one of the things I point out in the book is that\nThe Trump Administration was signals during the transition and the administration itself\nGave very strong signals to the Saudis that they were as long as they were allied with us and reliably so lots of issues Yemen financing for refugee relocation both in Jordan and in Syria\nAre not picking up the cause of the Palestinians letting them know that look you're not the longer you wait the deal that you're going to get what the ... covered ministry says only gonna get worse so don't wait and don't expect us to save you all those issues gave them a lot of latitude that latitude lead to a miscalculation here I don't know that is the deep fear\nWithin the administration that\nThere was a sense that they could do something like this\nAnd not suffer repercussions and that has got to be dealt with\nYou're not in ... I'm going to be talking later today with a senior ministry official about this but made you get I Want to go back to your book or the White House press corps is now divided pretty clearly down the line and I put in to the people who read and think and those who simply shine who want to be on TV [laughter] you're a reader in a thinker mind not saying\nThat 'cause it's a nice thing about the radio show I appreciate that I didn't expect that when I read Mr Trump's wild ride but thank you but I'm Wondering if the White House is going to he's going to be able to map\nThe serious people in the press corps and work with that\nTo communicate or not to propagandize but to communicate\nUh I'm certainly open to that uh I haven't seen a lot of evidence of that um\nBut every everything evolves in politics and even with this administration which though because of the president it because of his innate sense of confidence about himself approach things in a\nPretty ritualized fashion but ah if they're open I'm I'm always I mean literally always there and\nWhat I what I Hope from the from the book is that people will make exactly the conclusion you did that this is a serious assessment of things that have actually happened and there's some thought and some deep reporting there and it's believable and it's therefore of\nUsed to everyone who is curious about this story there's always a big story you know and\nI hear it's huge and the north Korea side of it uh let me conclude this way or you quote Madison as being the key player Derrick Christian or the key player we've also got secretary of state Pompeo and in ... ...\n... of course at the CIA Gina Haspel ... a fair agent and ban cook hits the strongest national security team are they working together major Garrett or are they all pursuing different agendas and occasionally overlap\nNo I think in the main they're working together because the president's directives are very clear their unambiguous there are times when the president says things or imagine things or throws things into the mix sometimes simply to provoke\nA reaction or to see what people say or just think outside the box trust me he did that a lot and I think he's still does with Afghanistan I think he's ... devil about what to do in Afghanistan because it just\nContinues on in this sort of grinding way but in the main America First means America First a national security strategy was put together in rapid fashion it was direct it was comprehensive it covered a lot of things\nPrevious national security documents didn't\nAnd that reflects the core beliefs and the core approach of this president and in that sense the signals are clear other times and the president sort of put ... in the universe with is Rick and traits yes for sure\nFor sure [laughter] Mr Trump's wild ride is just must reading the thrill show screaming and occasional blackouts of an extraordinary president ...
