J.\nIn late the mullahs are are yanking turkey in the direction of are becoming more and more of an Islamic state and that's a very bad a circumstance both by virtue of the size of turkey which is a has a very large population\nA bigger than any nation I guess in a in the western Europe\nAnd uh a country which is remains a key part of NATO which of course with the increase belligerence\nOf Vladimir Putin's and the Russians are NATO remains a very important alliance the Turks for a while or tried to obtain membership and that other Western European gathering the European Union but they at the time they were applying they simply\nWere moving in the direction away from a political freedom\nAnd uh they didn't pass muster\nAnd are these days are turkey which was once a a pretty reasonable ally with the the Israelis has gone the other direction they haven't got all the way there's really not Iran or Sudan\nBut this latest the circumstance is just the latest example of of what can happen when a country that falls into the throes\nOf a religious fanatics and that's the direction that turkey seems to be heading so we're certainly glad to hear that a river and Andrew Brunson\nHas in fact\nBeen freed and I think we can safely say he will never return to turkey which would feel like a pretty smart move on his part\n[noise] uh\nCourt in the turkey had sentenced him to three years in the months in prison for his conviction\nA but since he had already spent two years in detention he will not serve any more time Brunson had rejected the espionage and terror related charges in strongly uh maintained or to the country the hidden gauge than those such activity\nAnd it it seems again that [laughter] it's highly unlikely that he did or that he would uh what it sounds like\nHe has another attempt at taking a shot if you will\nAt a at Christians in this world and I'm just curious you are your thoughts about all this is this a case of hyper sensitivity on the part of Christians as if the case of a a exaggerating it would seem not by the statistics I gave a just a moment ago\nThey were granted there are an awful lot of Christians in the world are but there does seem to be a fair amount of persecution and what is particularly telling in many cases is the extent to which much of the world will look the other way [noise]\nAh like they're they're only Christians\nAnd that's a a an odd attitude\nUnless of course I suppose you you fall in with the identity politics kind of nonsense that well Christians tend to be a a rich wealthy quite western countries or some such nonsense which of course by the way it is not even that can be true but if it were it still would be ah beside the point\nWhere or at least it ought to be a beside the point\nIs that it is ironic indeed that some people in the west who\nMost express themselves with the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them it it's ironic certainly if the forces of fundamentalist Islam or where to take over this country the people they would go after first\nWould be what they would consider to be the liberate teen residents of say places like Hollywood for example\nAnd yet those people in their mad quest to appear to be extremely tolerant uh we'll try to show tolerance for the most intolerant people on the planet is kind of bizarre just kind of bizarre most of the central tenets of western civilization\nOr actually nourished by the Christian Church and I certainly would not be one to say that the Christianity has an on blemish record in this world certainly the or the Spanish Inquisition just to be at one particular example\nBut in terms of a of a civilized and influence and in terms of of the push toward personal freedom\nOr despite any number of of instances you can point out on which ah\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free had been nations in which Christianity has been the dominant religious force and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea or the area of the world that is most consistently um free\nUnstable on wealthy would be the swath of territory from roughly Morocco across North Africa eastward through Egypt in the middle east and the further east do you get as far as Pakistan that swath of predominantly Islamic countries is ah\nThe armpit of this planet in terms of most ah\nStandards of uh of human conduct of behavior and the living conditions\nAnd since Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant\nOr if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise\nYou'd have to give him credit and since\nIt's not then so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate\nAnd uh again yes of course there are many fine Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith and not necessarily because of it [noise] so I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses of Islam particularly in that portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way\nAt persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become a force and one of the principal forces in support of the notion of free expression of individual rights and the host of other things that could be put under the general a title of the western civilization\nJust a sad circumstance\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson\nIs a sign that this is changing and turkey are my guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in their policies the Turkish government is moving\nPretty stride and Lee in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO not good for Europe of course the tiny chunk of turkey remains of the European continent with the bulk of it of course\nA minor it's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact uh this story has had a happy ending but there's so many others that has not been the case and I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nThere are many things in this world which are get curious er and curious or as they used to say in a Alice in wonderland\nAnd it is it is odd indeed\n\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom and the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally crew of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as it as persecuted\nWhereas a a a force which with the exception of the ... versions of a of a communism that still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic or I'm Free portion of the planet\nThan that portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that's not a condemnation of every Muslim\nBut it is I think a fair condemnation of the poorest of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown\nDemocracies of that area where are the home grown supporters of a personal rights and the like uh the homegrown supporters in that part of the world for freedom of religion for example\nOr the answer is\nThey are anywhere they don't exist\nIt's a it's sad will come back we'll take some calls but it just struck me that while I'm happy for a Reverend Brunson that uh this is a\nA happy episode and what is the remaining ... a very unfortunate dismal and depressing world condition and that is the the persecution of Christians who are considered I suppose handy by regimes such as the\nThugs who currently run turkey one eight six six five oh Jim bow our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six we'll be back with more in just a moment\n\nYeah that's what we're observing but you know what I Want to talk about is the Turkish government of today is not Turkish government when I was there\nNo no absolutely not uh they were they were completely different um\nIn fact the way I understand the constitution is written in such a way that uh for the most part Sheree a law cannot be instituted now that's the way or the written yes yeah air to one is trying to change it now\nAnd the ethnic so he's trying to change it officially unofficially I guess it's largely changed\nThat yeah it's and that's a shame because when I was there I mean I got along with a Turkish papal fantastic and say to this day I have several Turkish friends and what I get a kick out of most of among restaurants when I walked in the first time a greater to miner navy native language they looked at me like I had two heads\nBecause they never had an American do that to them but you know it's a shame that a country with the history that it has and the inroads it has made into modern technology and how they have developed or cities\nIn the last uh forty years uh is going to is they're trying to pull back into the dark ages and I think that's a darn shame and I don't know why the people of that country or standing around in allowing that to happen\nBecause there are various factions just as has happened in Iran you have any number of people who who ah can ah followed the notion of a of a individual rights and and free will and choice but you also have any number of people who frankly uh tend to form the leaf educated part of the population\nWho were buying anything a mullah tells them to do and that's the split you have in ... ah once you leave a a anchor ah ah ah extent bowl at places like that you're going to the countryside\nAnd you find a lot of people who uh\nCould easily be a part of the the Taliban if they were in Afghanistan\nYeah and it's just I don't know it's just it really bothered me like I said I I I Love I absolutely loved the Turkish people I Love the way that I was treated when I was there [noise] you know they treated me with a lot of respect a lot more respect\nAnd their treat each other anymore and the weight on my one buddy who circuit we sat down and talk about it he says a lot of these ... these are new slums or fight over who is the closest relative to Abraham\nTo say or you know it's a neighbor him like face and that is what they are fighting over this truly say they're the closest

of our conversation\nAny doubt in your mind that there was part of this president to any Iranian backed terrorism on United States territory or against American ships are flagship\nNow I think he's been very clear on this not because we want hostilities with Iran but the opposite we want to be very clear about what our redlines are and I think the president's done that over and over again\nSpeaking of red lines a Chinese ship came with a hundred and thirty five feet of an American warship these are American sailors if we're threatened well our sailors fire on Chinese ships\nLook at the rules of engagement for US Navy vessels worldwide but particularly and potentially dangerous areas like the south China Sea are clear that the commanders have the authority we need we will not tolerate threats\nTo American service members were determined to keep\nA international sea lanes open this is something the Chinese need to understand their ... behavior has been unnecessarily provocative for far too long they got away with\nA an awful lot under the Obama administration I Would say\nChina a is one of the new bills coming due that Obama ignored or mishandled badly\nPressures now and President Trump is responding in a way that has the Chinese confused\nThey'd never seen an American president this tough before a I think their behavior or needs to be adjusted in the trade area and the international military and political areas in a whole range of areas perhaps we'll see at the G ... meeting in Argentina next month\nHe Asian paying willing to come to\nTurkey on some of these issues are but the president feels very strongly that China's taken advantage of the international order for far too long not enough Americans have stood up to it now's the time to do in\nChina fears of weaponized the export of commercial technology in recent reports from Bergen elsewhere was there an arms race which we were completely unaware and not participating we were\nBeing taken to the cleaners for decades ever since China came into the world Trade Organization\nOr they have pursued American to list the economic policy and what should be free trade environment a and they've gone well beyond that they've violated rule after rule after rule and they've they've defied the production of those who advocated admitting ... to the WTO that if they came in international pressure\nWould make China conform to these rules and norms of behavior they've done the opposite they've gotten worse\nThey steal our intellectual property so they're able to compete with us without the investments that is required and research and development they forced technology transfer from American and European companies they discriminate against us in terms of their domestic policies\nAre and and because of the economic growth that they've sustain\nNot only by abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating\nOr the international norms we expected them to comply with they've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic strength they built military strikes I think what the president's doing because of his business background or among other things she's challenging on the economic grounds\nAnd if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology or their military capabilities would be substantially reduced and a lot of the tensions we see caused by China would be reduced\nThey have a lot of business partners in the United states should Google should Facebook be helping the People's Republic of China to develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this as a nation that has admitted that a million like ours in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point at his speeches the Hudson Institute last week and I think the biggest applause line he got was when he said to the information technology sector don't cooperate with the Chinese in in this effort I Would say the shareholders of these\nCompanies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future\nReally you want to make money off of repression I if I were shareholder I'd I'd want to know what the answer of our corporate leadership was\nThe shareholders though we certainly would not have allowed him pre war Germany Americans to sell the crop iron works the design for new artillery are we is there a role for the government to step in and the Silicon Valley and control technology transfer\nWell we were looking at the export the control area it look we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear\nChemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile development I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing that because we've abandoned free market principles but because we have to be realistic about the adversaries\nWe face in the world today that use the fruits of American freedom against us and we shouldn't let that happen we want to do in ways to protect our open economy\nBut the night others the ability to take advantage of it\nMore with John

temperament and I thought to myself if you had not been angry then I Would question judicial temperament because you've been accused of cereal gang rape or they granted slander\nPossible actually ah too but what was that what what is what is wrong with our commentary at in this regard\nYeah well we're supposed to bow you know to these things and uh you're not supposed to supposed to what you know\nI I don't I I think it was a very good judgment not to attack professor Ford uh I think she didn't seek all of this I thought Susan Collins stateless eloquent about all of that I thought it was

country if\nSomebody a stage allegations and you know I said there's no proof available\nWell it's a little worse than that right because if you read that thing by the by the council for this to me that interviewed her the details of her story are inconsistent and you know so there are some things that are verifiable\nThat are not as she said and she said more than one thing about things and some of ... that are actually lose it\nWell don't blame her for that these are old memories about something painful and uh but but the truth is to make that cause to disrupt this thing is failure of the rule of law\nNow in terms of the presumption of innocence and due process what the most astonished me about this is it so many people\nBruins so quickly with the idea that an accusation without contemporaneous corroborating evidence can be vetted in public without damage not just to the accused but to the process\nI mean it is it is nowhere in our tradition and the common law or to allow someone to convict the accusation I mean that goes back before the country was founded\nIf and she just contest a little bit right this is not a trial he thought nobody has brought charges against him this is a political event\nAnd it's certainly true that is right it's fine to raise charges against him and it's even ... rage wild ones but\nThe hopes that won't be effective but look what happened here he goes through a a a set of exhausted hearing is investigated he interviews privately with every senator who was willing to talk to him\nAnd then the other thing is he has a long career this guy has a paper trail and he's not so young guy just out of the box right he's he's been so there's a huge amount of material and it's obvious that they're getting ready to vote for him\nAnd then this stuff is brought up and that is not the air or a good political maneuver and if she transferred to add to\nWhat it would take to convict the guy of something which is rightly a different standard than

Democratic side but the Republican leader a dime tried to him and that was kind of on your on your not listening to move the history is it exactly as I told you\nWell we have we have a disagreement about the history but I'm very aware of immigration\nNow Larry aren't here is the history in Nineteen sixty eight when Abe Fortas was nominated in an election year\nHe was filibustered by the Republicans and Democrats because of ethics issues but there were sixty four Democrats in the Senate in Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd the Republicans were not cooperating they were seeing that unless they were to stop him the or the impeachment process it was going to go for it could have sixty\nFour thirty six in Nineteen fifty six William Brennan was recess appointed because it it had not move forward under a Democratic Senate so Mitch McConnell actually was right and my friend John Dickerson was not\nBut there is abroad and the way it's a great ignorance about the basic fact the Senate is a majority ... institution that agrees\nTo operate by super majority in rules in some instances rules which they can changes Harry Reid demonstrated on their whim and which Mitch McConnell changed after Harry Reid changed him with regards to the Supreme Court justices and the fact of the matter is I don't\nI think we will we will if a God Forbid adjusted drop dead three weeks before the election\nOf a twenty twenty I think the Senate would come from a replacement [laughter]\nI wouldn't be surprised at so first of all remember what the kind of did at the moment when he delayed Merrick Garland it looked like Hillary Clinton was going to win\nRight and so he wasn't he was actually making the authority of the people more telling or stronger in the process this is one of the things you get to choose when you vote for president\nSo the idea that he was trying to for people he actually involved in more in the process and I'll say it's it's actually opposite because you know in the great you know the miss it earlier the first term\nOpposition party throughout the governing party by a popular vote without violence was in Eighteen hundred in America and the federalist party which had built the country for goodness sake got hammered\nBy Jefferson's party and Madison's party it would also built and so what they do they have all these midnight appoint ask election after they know they've got hammered and they just got days to go take a whole bunch of people in there\nAnd they don't get 'em all down and that's what gave rise to the great court case Marguerite versus Madison\nBut they were you know that was in the eleventh hour saying you against a popular vote this is the opposite of that\nYou betcha but they were ... we both are legitimate and and what I Want to point the rules are laid out this is not\nSecret we operate under a constitutional structure that was meant to be read by and was reading debated by farmers some of whom are not literate but who would listen closely and we over complicate this this is the Senate\nHas the right to not hold a hearing the Senate has a right to confirm in one day the Senate whatever the majority of the Senate wants to do the Senate can do and but the election\nAnd there's a link and soon right and so if they do anything that people don't like the people can punish them right now and that's what keeps dishonest you're right about that right and\nAnd if you ah if ah\n[noise] well look look what McConnell understand and he's proud of himself right because the election who would have predicted it All right the presidential election when they win\nAnd the Harry Reid changed that rule I wished by the way that they would restore the filibuster generally two is nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century meaning and then they can pass a lot more laws and when\nThe other guys get in they could pass a lot more laws and then the people get a chance to choose and it looks to me like McConnell has been maneuvering us toward a better position in regard to that\nHe's been doing he was an absolutely amazing leader and I know that some here in our number on the right\nDo not like him for reasons I cannot figure out but he is a master of the Senate he has set up they confirmed Fifteen judges yesterday there were twenty nine appeals court judges I did the math last night Larry\nAt Seventy five

going to serve between twenty and Thirty years at Seventy five thousand opinions at the people's court level and all this from currently here sixty to\nSeventy five of these things a year so that was mostly where the law in the United states has made this at that level and Mitch McConnell with Donald Trump and Don McGahn who's the unsung hero here has worked a revolution\nThat's it well they were serious\nAbout it from the first minute and and remember this to a Donald Trump as a candidate announced a list of the kinds of people he would kick in other words he has submitted his direction just
