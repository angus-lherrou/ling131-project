was talking to our local well\nBut I mean it's if people do the stuff themselves rather than higher in the first guy that comes along or the pickup truck\nAnd says I'll do that for X amount you know and then they normally have to get that re done\nBut you know I I was at the local Wal Mart earlier picking up so I you know run in and grab some stuff get out and I was talking to one of the workers

logical debate\nBut I'm a big issues ah we ought to be United and and yeah there's issues about whether base plus works and all that stuff but I Believe the Bible teaches that\nSalvation by faith alone and that's what all the just and Paul by the way did not see the eight and start a new gospel from Jesus Christ when Jesus turned to the thief on the cross he didn't say you'll be with me in paradise\nIf you get circumcised and do some good work and get baptized on the way the great he said you know he he's had manifestly trusted in him so he's going to be with him and Paul taught as a salvation by faith alone and Jesus Christ it's all the way through his letters and I think now the Catholics agree on that anyway I don't think we have a big dispute of them\nKnow that the churches are back to back on almost everything they have their own unique problems but every charges had problems that every time in history David let me ask you about um your life since she became overtly evangelical how has it changed\nWell I I just thought it was always up uh I've always believed in God that I didn't embrace the Bible\nAnd it was not because I study that rejected it was because I

hope our side is finally waking up finally it's an attack on such a decent man is as Brett Kavanaugh wake up some of the slump rank path that's on our side of the aisle and that and I I really do think there's\nAn intersection here between politics and and\nAh and I don't like by the way I don't like to talk about I don't like any pastor to talk about politics from the fall but uh I don't want

because of the timing of the the interview with Juanita Broderick on a on NBC when that actually aired\nUm and I I think there was a sense from the media was coming on the heels of impeachment and this this this whole category of Clinton's life had just been litigated to it never\nFully exploded but one of the one of the things Democrats were saying back then was essentially that they were treating it as um [noise] well hey the Republicans you know I've been trying to take down Bill Clinton since he became president you know Hillary Clinton had a term vast right wing conspiracy and\nThey tried with whitewater and and ah ... it'll be Ken Starr and Monica Lewinsky and indeed this is just the latest in a line of sort of increasingly desperate things Democrats or Republicans have resorted to\nTo try to take down Bill Clinton it was viewed in that context and and it's it's it's language I I've seen on the other side in relation to to Ford in ... in the last week\nNo yeah it it will resonate with everyone on every level but let's dig into the nineties I think probably the seminal moment is not the election of Bill Clinton do that is for history but for politics it's the counter revolution in Nineteen Ninety four\nI was live on PBS in LA I hosted the local PBS show with Patt Morrison kind of medics when we went live on Nineteen Ninety four I can remember Claire Isabel if it was a fight they stop it it was such a traumatic event for the Democrats fifty two house seats lost nine Senate seats you know Richard Shelby switch parties immediately after\nWhat made the carnage even worse I don't know that twenty ten or twenty fourteen whereas traumatic to the political system is Nineteen Ninety four what do you think's the current acting\nI completely agree and one of the reasons twenty ten and twenty fourteen weren't as traumatic was because we'd been through Nineteen Ninety four and and I had to put it in perspective for folks who who who weren't following it back then or maybe a forgotten a little bit I mean it had been forty years in Nineteen Ninety four since Republicans had control the house\nAnd they hadn't even been close you know we've got a midterm coming up right now we're Democrats are again of twenty three seats away it's it it may it may not happen but it's doable for them and and it seems like every election and we'd go into these days it's it's conceivable that control the house could switch\nUm it was inconceivable for decades in American politics from the fifties into the Nineteen nineties the Republicans would control the house it was known as the permanent Democratic Congress the speaker's gavel was it was handed down almost like a hereditary tool\nUm from one democratic speaker to another or Republicans were you know eighty Ninety a hundred seats buried in the majority\nIn the minority excuse me and it was an expectation heading into Nineteen Ninety four that it would be a good year for Republicans you know the Clinton presidency had been very rocky his approval rating\nWas pretty low but the the thought going into election night Ninety four was head goodnight Republicans will pick up the Senate and make a dent in the house\nUm when the return started coming in I mean things started happening that night like a speaker of the house Tom Foley last reelection in his home district that hadn't happened since the civil war\nOr Dan Rostenkowski this just sort of old bowl chair of the ways and Means Committee he'd been\nUm he was later you know prosecuted but I'm a Dan Rostenkowski lost his seat in Chicago I mean is this is like this is a district that was like forty points democratic and Dan Rostenkowski loses his seat there Mario Cuomo who is the\nThe um it was the most famous uh in Bolivia liberals in the country in Nineteen eighty four loses in New York state I'm just happening all over the map and and to go back and and relive the the the way this was regarded in the moment and Newt Gingrich of course become speaker of the house this was this was also unsinkable in politics\nBecause he'd been a a back then churn into his own party even an irritant just a few years earlier\nUm but it was they were serious discussions of in the media in the wake of that election that not only was Bill Clinton finished that was taken as a given but that the Democratic party and liberalism itself where we're headed for in immediate extinction\nIt was also the first media shock now I have often told people if the media had a concussion protocol we'd all still begin it after twenty sixteen you and I were together on election night twenty sixteen but\nThe shock of Nineteen Ninety four was as great it was like Nineteen eighty and it doesn't occur very often and you read describe it for our millennials out they're going to be fascinated by the way it's the ... that in the red and blue\nPeople who are still on the front page like Nancy Pelosi are playing very large rules I Want to cook from page three sixty nine where\nA speaker of former Speaker Pelosi at that time just the leading Democrat was commenting on Monica Lewinsky uh I don't think it happened but if it did it comes to the big surprise I don't think for one moment there's an atmosphere of sexual harassment and the White House\nI read that because you're not easy on anyone here just telling the story because I Want my conservative audience understand the ... plays this right down the middle and the right of the blue you're not this is not an advocacy book this is a narrative of a a multi decade\nI think you were saying that because that's exactly what I Would I aim to do here I'm In I'm just trying to explain how we ended up the goal with the book um is to use as sort of the endpoint election night two thousand and it's the closest thing to a perfect time we've ever seen\nIn a presidential election in this country comes down to it was five hundred thirty seven votes in Florida the Supreme Court ruling the recount and all of that and I think that division that map that just almost perfect split down the middle of the country [noise] I I think it's the product of of all of the political battles and political wars in the Nineteen nineties it did just\nPolk Americans and and made them choose sides Democrat or Republican\nI'm In and I think each party and its own way contributed to it the way it the way it responded to the other party the way it played off the other party the way it unintentionally reinforced what how their party was trying to do um you know I write about one aspect I write about here is sort of the rise of Newt Gingrich and his style of politics and the house\nWhich of course culminated in his his grandest our that that night in Nineteen Ninety four when he becomes speaker and one of the things you see I I think that I that I Hope people see at least in reading this is in that long rise of Newt Gingrich in the house\nUm he is absolutely changing a lot of the norms and traditions in in blowing them up and embracing a much more combative style\nBut the Democrats who the prominent Democratic majority as it was known back at that time they played right into his hand and they ended up pushing it through the way it's a particularly house speaker Jim Wright says the guy from the late Nineteen eighty particularly the way he ran the house\nIt pushed Republican moderates into Newt Gingrich's camp and it left the moderate thing you know what we're getting nowhere with the leadership we've been following it for three decades let's give this guy new to try\nBob Michel a great gentleman but not a change agent like new I Love the fact quote the first thing they did was sick at the Harvard on page tonight or through it you know Seventy three out of
