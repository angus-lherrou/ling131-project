I think what the the best job regardless of party but you're familiar with that lake area I happen to live in a fairly Republican county but\nFor the primary I pretty much if I care about what goes on

than the answer is you get what you do there and anybody who doesn't see it her way and that and\nThat's pretty much store so I'm Glad that God gave us the opportunity to add to their family and our friends because well logical not so much well I mean we\nDon't we don't get a chance to choose our our our biological family now you're talking about somebody here who apparently has already throw down the gauntlet so your choices are either to a a separate yourself from your sister so that at least there's distance there and it doesn't have to be all out animosity\nOr getting together\nIn which case I guess there would be\nA a total blowout that would would wreck even ever talking with her again I mean it seems to me that as as sad as it sounds you pick the lesser of the two problems just avoiding this person at least a ... you know you're not you're not yelling at each other right\nThat had that has already happened it is part of why I live here and she lives in another state

that your choices are a void contact or get to do it all out shouting match and then the void in contact with the the the lesser of two evils that's too bad I'm Sorry that your your sister is that way
