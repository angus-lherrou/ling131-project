Ben Sasse was written them published by St Martin's press and ... why we hate each other and how to heal talking about the impact of pushing us away from annoying for example lose two doors down\nA a warning you're a ... alert coming up yeah back in mind that being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because it was a cool place to sit on the porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess and at that point oh I I still do the people I had known before but new people to move into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\n[laughter] and I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory um so it would give you another one that that's not from my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point\nIn the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U.S has grown by more than three acts more than three times larger average new home size now compared to the midnight in fifty\nBut what are the things we know is that when your house gets larger and your life get large it gets larger the separation from your neighbors gets larger and you end up having fewer of those relationships in your community and so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot\nAbout what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other are\nAnd there is there's a move in some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes ... at one of the things to try to do is move from a big huge back deck like I confessed we have at our house to a front porch which is closer to the proximity what are your neighbors are walking by there is happiness it's correlated with\nHaving gone through that shared experience not just the getting to converse\nWith your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house but frankly\nHaving even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch of because you didn't have the air conditioning it was something you went through to gather humans are relational beings we are social animals were not just now our verbs we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people\nAnd a lotta times shared experiences even if they're perfect\nOr become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue or on your on your fourteen year old or on your seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future memory\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem it's not about relationships\nOr at least I don't think it is ... this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence shura the next generation has been or opportunity is higher income or education and they live longer what happened\n[laughter] yeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's a consensus emerging in the last five to seven years um but the number one health crisis in America is actually loneliness ten years ago you couldn't find\nHe at the national institutes of health that would have told you anything other than obesity as the number one driver of health problems are and and public health expenditure and the U.S now about Seventy percent\nOf obesity is viewed as a phenomenal of loneliness or is it downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends it's\nThe people get lonely and then they get fat and so at the near term biggest driver of costs that American health care is obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight and out a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folk\nUh ... most of that as a downstream consequence of loneliness\nOpioids addictions overdoses suicides a whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and your life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community\nNot having membership and a lot of organization this is really new we've had\nPretty good public health data on what people die of\nFour eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time and the last sixty years had even two years is declining like expectancy\nIn Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy this you're toning Eighteen we're gonna have a third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\n[noise] and it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose and opioids is one of the the big drivers most all of that is related to decline and community that's not to say there are also\nEconomic consequences but there was an interplay between declining economics and declining community\nSo bunch of places in America that we think about sort of the industrialized you have economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meeting falls shared work with other people and the declining sense of participation\nIn neighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or or the crises are vicious cycles\n[noise] All right and that covers the problem is most of which I think we were vaguely

so\nUm she's one name I think ... with the current health minister who has Ben I'm kind of the the the the conservative wing of um Chancellor Merkel's party\nOr he's been a thorn in her side I'm trying to get her to move closer to um the conservatives he's been the leader of the young\nCD movement I think he's got a very real chance I'm certainly uh the the defense minister a minister of underlying Ursula von der line she's a ...\nPress a person has been a member of the city for a long time she's done well at the defense ministry um so I think she's got a chance or the one of the issues I think in in German politics is they tend to look for somebody very young because they want somebody to be a around for a long time\nI'm not sure that that's going to happen this time there have been some talk about just getting somebody who can do a really good job for a couple of years and not have to have somebody who's looking for you know a ten to Fifteen year span\nThat's very a kind of an German they usually want somebody who is going to bring stability for very long time if they went with someone who um you know really knows how to how to run the country has been in in a in the power\nUm seats um you could look to Wolfgang shy blah who is a long term um finance minister and now he is\nUm the president of the building just dog I mean we're going to be six years old and he's a little bit older but I think the the business community really looks at Wolfgang shy blonde says this is a guy who really knows the system and knows how to carry us through\nWe're going to want stability in Europe that's to me I I Hope whoever emerges from this and that you are working with those are ambassador provides for stability in a post brags that you I have to ask you a brick right now as a passenger to Germany a neo Nazi\nAttacked and killed Thirteen eleven people in Pittsburgh and we've been grieving that but I look up and I see my friends at MSNBC with a ... that says how Trump quote sets the tone close quote\nFor anti Semite and and my heart just fails because the president is the least then I got my problems with them I always have that but he is not got a lick of anti Semitism in and it\nIt's outrageous and you know him better than most what do you think of a crime run that says how Trump quote sets the tone for anti Semite\nIt's completely outrageous it's completely divisive the president has made a T policy decisions um\nAnd and really focused the U.S government on a on a number of issues that really are not only pro Israel that are a pro Jewish community\nBut that have really set the bar I think unlike any other president in trying to to make sure that I'm tolerance and diversity celebrated look it's no secret I I'm I'm gay and and I've seen some of the the same types of\nOf arguments about the president um when it comes to gay rights and I have to say just from my personal experience I've waited a very long time to have a president\nWho would embrace me embrace the community and and really set a very strong message of diversity intolerance and I think this president does it\nA similar smear that spread yesterday was against GOP house majority leader Kevin McCarthy who would criticize George Soros and others for spending lots of money\nOn Democrats which they have done and the mean began he use those names because they're Jewish named he's implying that Jewish money is attempting to our politics of course\nThe Koch brothers spend a lot of money and shopping Adelson was also a Jewish friend a lot of money on the Republican I think it's just an outright smear Rick we're now you've been around your your in diplomacy now but you've been around in American politics a long time is there no limit to how low the left will go to smoke smear people\nWell let me just let me just say this um because you know I Am in a diplomatic position and I want to be very careful [noise] um I I Want to say unequivocal early that I'm Kevin McCarthy as my friend I Know him from California and and that's\nThey just charge against Kevin it's wrong it's ... it's outrageous and and we should not have politics of destruction like this\nThat is exactly are you and I both know McCarthy and the idea he that he talking about SARS and Bloomberg inspired giving money that that is somehow anti Semitic when in fact that it's simply an objective\nLook at who is funding just like ate all sitting and coke or funding us a record outlet make let me close by asking is um how soon will it be when we will have clarity as to who the next German Chancellor will be\nWell first of all we will know in December who the next party chair is and that will be um largely the signal so I Would say in December we will know um how the transition will go in and how quickly it will be\nI appreciate your joining me on short notice and basket or Richard gr now the United states ambassador to Germany always a very powerful it effective voice for America abroad and in Germany good luck in keeping us posted in keeping our interest represented well in Berlin is he has done for the past year I Want to tell everyone out there\nAs well [noise] one of the uh\nI I Will not let this Kevin McCarthy is let her go unanswered right it is it is traffic in the left I've known Kevin since Nineteen eighty nine he is as the middle east and I ate there isn't a\nInch at tank sure of anti Semitism in his as welcoming to every one of all races and backgrounds as anyone you possibly could and that it's being ... isn't it I again I'll tell you the Democrats are desperate they thought they had a blue wave they don't have a blue wave\nThey thought that the bomber would help them and hasn't helped them they thought that um or they could somehow make the president responsible for Pittsburgh that didn't work nothing is working for them because people don't want Nancy Pelosi back as speaker and they are voting to increase Mitch McConnell's\nMajorities in the Senate and therefore it's just bottom of the barrel time and smearing Kevin McCarthy as an anti Semite is the lowest of low\nOr the lowest of low and I won't let it

States Senate impacts everyone one of those races in West Virginia where the attorney general about great state pat Morsi is running against Joe Manchin a Chuck Schumer and supporting a Democrat and Patt Morrison joins me this morning from West Virginia morning general good to have you with us\n[laughter] hey good morning you it's good to be back on your program\nAnd it's great to have you back give us a rundown how the race fans eight days from the vote\nWell you we have a lot of momentum going into the final stretch early voting just started on October twenty four and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm on our side as people come out to the old\nI think people across West Virginia were absolutely second by what they saw on full display in Washington this fall\nAnd they're coming out and we're feeling that we're growing in the polls we have some poll showed us tied to poll showed us up but the most important thing is that we're trying to get our message out and get her vote out in the final eight days the president is coming back to West Virginia on friday\nJust another big site for us and as you know President Trump is very popular in West Virginia he won with forty two\nPercent of the vote this is ... started coming back each time these car we've got a big boost to the polls and\nI think we're right there for the ... we know that you were just or another massive amount of money in\nAnd we just have to fight and keep our vantage over the next eight days\nNow Patrick Morrisey in his mind you that the desperation unless the attempt to claim the president and it's all over everywhere this morning the president is anti Semitic that Kevin McCarthy then I submitted the Republicans are responsible for violence that there's not a bomber somehow representative of Trump people\nI think that blows up in their hands and I don't mean the bomb I mean the rhetoric because ... the idea that\nThis crazed killer would be killer is somehow representative of Trump supporters or West Virginians is to me going to drive people to the pet more see a vote check what do you think\nWell look I think that's right and whenever people are seeing these mobs I think they're beginning to associate with the with the crazy what happened because people literally going nuts on the other side of the aisle and I think more and more people know if Joe mansion or to get elected again\nThis first voters for Chuck Schumer that whole Schumer Pelosi Clinton obstruct resist impeach mob that's what it's all about and\nPeople can connect the dots now and there's more and more activity occurs where people ceased crazy behavior on the part of the liberal leadership and the people that are trying to gain control of the house that\nI think that's a very motivating factor more and more I think folks are understanding what these are not West Virginia conservative values they don't my record I'm the conservative fighter took on the Obama administration repeatedly it'll warn protecting coal fighting substance abuse\nAnd standing up for conservative values are Second Amendment and pro lifestyle you\nJoe matches the opposite and even more importantly when he votes for sure it's a vote for the mob mentality\nAnd that point pat more in shape the does the average voter connect Joe mansion with Chuck Schumer because we all know what matters most is the majority in the Senate when it comes to judges and while\nJoe mansion may have voted for Brett Kavanaugh his party didn't they did everything they could to destroy him and he tried to stand aside from that wreckage but do voters know that if you vote for managing your voting for more of the cabinet or attempt to take out\nWell we just started a couple of commercials all that I think that it is a sport they know that the craziness they saw that didn't come from the Republican side of the aisle they know that it's not always Schumer and Pelosi Hillary Clinton\nI mean Hillary Clinton said that they kept the civil I mean that's a quote from Hillary Clinton\nI think people can connect that and obviously Joe mansion doubled our supported Hillary Clinton even after she said\nShe was going to put a lot of coal miners coal companies that works I think they are you there are bringing together because they know that this side represents a complete hundred eighty to return to go back to the Obama era the Hillary Clinton era which they really hate it so\nI feel that the energy on our side we're seeing it all the surveys\nIt's growing and growing at ... as a problem as voters up it was just going to be a big issue

make that lower third Trump's role in stoking violence among American\n[laughter] well listen I I again I'm In New York camp I totally disagree with that you have to figure the individual but I have said this is the president I said as recently as yesterday we had a conversation yesterday if some of my TV appearances why not try the tone down approach because\nYou know you're you're at forty seven forty eight percent or you could get yourself it in the mid fifties she's doing several while on so many different fronts\nUm and ... why why have a head when you you can use these people um you know he's on the opinion that there's no to feuding of these people that they're just going to continue to claim that him guns blazing no matter what he does end or says and reference a yesterday me on the phone\nThe speech on anti Semitism that he gave on Saturday\nAnd it is just no kick up of that in the mainstream media uh and so and then I went and checked that went on that and looked around and sort of the criticism was while he was reading in the army or he didn't really mean so\nIt's just you know he he is right and a lot of ways you not going to get a fair shake that I feel for perhaps you may feel that he deserves a as it used\nTo be whether or not then that\nI played three clips of the I I play three extend equipped with his Indianapolis speech denounced the anti Semitism I think it's probably the first than anyone driving to work this morning as heard them because this is where I wanted to get to the ... inside and you do\nA let's get our Harvard law school brains on here you know that the media has monetize hating Donald Trump you know that and that's a problem that's what's going on is that a\nCouple of of cable channels have monetize hating him one is monetize loving him that Anthony is bad for America it's just that I agree\nWith that well I told I told you that I think that we see that objective standard and the business model of these companies now fragment thing to go to people that have come from biases I think is a very big issue you know when I go on time uh obviously if a pro Trump supporter\nWrote a three hundred and four page book about what I saw the campaign short stint in the White House but how he was able to steal the base\nOf the Democratic party and I go on you know what I Would say are adversarial programming\nUm and I just get lit up and destroyed on Twitter out and and people why do the politics of personal destruction and the politics of dehumanization and you know you're mentioning my Harvard law school degree but you know Seth Meyers was calling me like fat Tony in the White House you know I mean\nBut he says well I don't understand you're you're one of the guys who came into the Trump Administration and nobody knows that\nI was I was a walking pinky rang according Seth Meyers I was at a gym and laundry uh Jersey Shore cast member and so I mean it's just funny I mean you're allowed to do that to Italians are not really allowed to do that to other racial groups you know we're at but that's fine I mean the point the point I think the more important point you just have\nTo stop this nonsense um it's just bad for our kids because the kids are going to get out of the discourse and that they're going to\nPut us in a position where they're ah they're no longer are involved and I think some of the politicians not to sound so cynical actually lawful you either left office since\n... lab before we run out on a because you advise the present you talk to them\nI think he needs to do more television with more adversarial people like it used to go on with Anderson Cooper and that's not my network I think you had to go on with Scarborough I think you got to go on with Matt either got to go everywhere because he never loses one on ones and they cannot not televised um but he stopped doing that during the campaign\nHe was ubiquitous on every channel at every moment totally interviews on radio what do you think\nWell you go back to my ... plan I wrote a seven page ... plan that literally said exactly what you just said I was about to implement that plan on the thirty first of July and I got fired at nine thirty seven in the morning but\nHad I had been able to implement that plan I Would have put a big dog out there and all of those situations and I think he would definitely be
