cabinet man in your life that will be the cabinet standard and I'm Memphis\nFalling people are not aware of that they're aware of the new standard dream forced upon the process here\nNo I I I think they're picking it up and and this is the case you also this particular case was brought it out but the thing to remember here is that the the logic of this is is not something new this just didn't pop up after twenty sixteen and because of this particular case this is\nThis is really the really the the logic of kind of post modern liberalism goes it's this is identity politics this is what I meant by the academy comes to Washington it doesn't matter\nWhether the rule of law is upheld doesn't matter what he's innocent until proven guilty it's all about identity politics and how he's defined in that and he's on the outside this is this is more like North Korea right he's violated the\nPrinciples the deep principles of the of the party and so therefore we have to have find him guilty of a trial later maybe this is Alice in wonderland I don't know but but there's a clear this jumped here that\nSome it becomes obvious in a peculiar circumstance this is this is a a wonderful example of how we talk about the principles of the overarching in every once in a while the circumstances just make that patently obvious\nAnd murder in our Roberta in Philadelphia should Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nYes that I had a different perspective I'd like to tell you I attend Temple University senior program there's hundreds and hundreds of people that go every class and I go into the nearest snide remarks\nAnd the teachers and the fellow students and you had a self selected audience and we call him because we care and the other people do not get this message they get their messages from other sources CNN and MSNBC ABC CBS whatever\nThat that's true absolutely but ... I I Believe and I I Know this nearing liberals don't believe in the talk radio audience this is not pre screened\nWe do not care of people are against cabinet or they don't want to believe and so when you go out I've got no thirty plus callers if not pre screened you can't make this I\nKnow I I think it's right I I go back to my example of of of the cab you write it\nI I think we would ... what is a an amazing here is that\nThis is a moment where the people are engaged in a way they've not been on a lot of things they're looking at through the lens of their own background their own lives their own families and there's so much information out there ... having so quickly it's hard to filter it there's just so much and they're\nPicking up on this argument I think that tells you something about the the general health of the American public which I think is good we're we're still divided by all means is is it an aide to much divided country but a lot of people who hear two four we thought were only lightly engaged and not interested in politics\nOr they see this that that strikes me is a very powerful statement\nAbout the the uh the the human ... but also about the permanent strength
