I find that hard to believe\nAs well as those but I have a very odd that the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such\nA again or even if they they drag more than they should uh there are gradations of drinking and they do not in my mind constitutes a an issue of uh of confidence to hold disposition especially for someone who today apparently or drinks very responsibly so\nTo me that's that's not the issue here the issue is the credibility of the sexual assault charges more like a one eight six six five oh Jim bode one eight six six five oh five or six to six audible hadn't show as the FBI is doing they're interviewing the Supreme Court term has become an eighth justice term will see\nWell that that changing the law doesn't affect that crime or yes all crime subsequent to twenty twelve and that law was passed now suddenly have no statute of limitations but if you did a certain bad thing before twenty twelve\nIt has no statute of limitations you cannot make a law that applies to things that happened before the law was passed so uh that statute of limitations for a Brett Kavanaugh even assuming that he did what he was accused of doing a would would still not apply\nYeah and the other thing too that I don't know why a lot of people don't understand or surprised by this whole thing because they don't really see something like this happen in the United states wants before\n[noise] I well I mean there were certainly there were charges were brought against Clarence Thomas before his Supreme Court confirmation that consisted from from one person of course\nNot not on a variety of such people and and of course the the piling on goes back to the days of of Robert Bork and in fact it is even become a verb now for a nominee to be quote board unquote\nWell the the other thing is we had the sale of Salem, Massachusetts where we had goes away trials you\nKnow I mean it's it's been a long time but but you know we can't have people make accusations that are on substantiate it on that that have no ... while they may have merit to her\nBut there's no proof I mean there's like sure wonder where am I going with our society will emerge guilty before with presumed innocent\nWell again some people to keep in mind here from a purely legal point of view Dave and that would be that the presumption of innocence\nTechnically legally only applies in a court of law or the presumption of innocence as as a matter of general practice usually applied before a congressional hearings\nBut it does not apply a as a a thing more than a usual

quest for confidentiality they live just to the media the last minute because they were on a search and destroy mission for Kavanaugh said only last talked in November I think it's important that women feel they can come forward\nThat's a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society a woman came forward here\nUh and you're saying basically she said nothing credible how can women come forward\nIf when they do they're they're told that not credible\nShe came forward confidentially to Dianne Feinstein signed Feinstein did not share that with the proper authorities\nChuck Grassley her counterparts with him she served for decades and the FBI that could have reviewed this matter confidentiality confidentially then they leave it to the media and the greater rating the circus environment you're saying for the last two years time went full hulk hulk\nOn face the nation just smashing the Democratic talking points John Dickerson is a fair man but\nHe bought into the narrative because it's a blue bubble\nThe DC's a blue bubble no one no one hears like I've heard from people across the country today God does he goes back to Arkansas ... number twenty four oh John first off let's understand why we have had this hearing\nMiss for these allegations and accomplish a letter to Dianne Feinstein in July shortly after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated the very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process into a search and destroy mission these allegations are completely unsupported my any evidence what evidence there is twenty thirty six year old climb\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh their argument of course was that doctor for an ass have this housing confidentiality\nAnd if they tried to do that and that's what it was let's let me let me alone I don't know no no John let me talk to you about that when you talk to your listeners about your views about that there was a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could have showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted this inquiry in July and August without betraying their sports confidence is and they have a trainer they pointed her lawyers\nWho Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers gonna have to face of D.C more investigation and the miss their misconduct time Feinstein and her staff is going to face and investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly happens hundreds upon hundreds of times every year and the ... committee doesn't have\nTo keep going ... number twenty five John any impact this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault John encourage them all to do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respect her request for confidentiality now when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence and against proof and we would have known that confidentially inside the new share committee wasting its time\nAnd I don't know what I don't know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found that the committee staff is already interviewed all the witnesses that misfortune added\nInterviewed miss forward and judge Kavanaugh for six hours and ... and she sent a letter that was an interview but you're not read it so they've either interview them or they receive letters under penalty of perjury I sent for now these are actual interview so I'd be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change\nTheir statements that they've already given this year well is\nIt ... number twenty six keep going John we already know what everyone who's alleged to be at the party has said they've submitted statements or been interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change their statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is\nVery highly qualified nomination\nIn in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was that may end up as a good judge cannot truthful and everything he said in his testimony I found him to be truthful around this testimony I found them to be turns out he he wasn't\nI found him to be appropriately indignant ... at the smear campaign and I I'm disappointed in what Christ said on the video leading yeah and it reminds me of the old proverb this animal is very wicked it defends itself and attacked if they didn't
