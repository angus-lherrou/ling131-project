soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two we haven't really gotten into this in great detail but uh\nWe should point out I suppose of the important\nOf course is just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather that is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes absolutely the limits on a breed or very very special breed of a white holes are found in the interests of Spanish riding school they have been carefully bred for hundreds of years hundreds and hundreds of years by the Austria Hungarian empire\nOr they performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high school of horses um is very very stylized and of course if you guys are Vienna today you can see this and they ... the palace and that bloodline was absolutely pure and the Germans grab these whole says\nWith the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you like an area in a kind of super whole for the gentleman army\nThat's absolutely unbelievable but but nonetheless that was the circumstances that occurred so these words is at ... at the at great importance or from the standpoint of justice those who love horses but also from the German point of view of the master race even to and including\nHorses themselves so as as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of these horses\nAnd uh they're going to have to convert German trucks in order to transport them back to American lives and the in the meantime I gather that the fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat is correct to have this little outpost of the U.S army twenty miles behind the German lines uh the the other gentleman troops in the area where it was getting on the most of them have stood down and leaving them alone however there is an F s unit looting up which has been defeated elsewhere and that coming up and groups of several hundred\nOr and they say this is some kind of a red flag to a ball or some kind of opportunity\nAnd they launch a couple of consented attacks on the ah the little town which has defended by only you know a couple of hundred Americans with very light weapons in the small vehicles and uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of\nA fabulous areas battles if yes has said managed to break it and of course it would have led to a ... um and the other thing is it leads to the creation of something codes to its foreign legion which is the interesting part of the story\nOf bleeds eliminates learn more about stewards foreign legion\nWell they also say it was left in Columbus guy pulled a captain told us to it and uh you know he's any officer he's very combat experience but he's left with a really difficult situation is simply doesn't have enough men to defend the town and the sad\nSo he looks around and of course when they came in they all said liberated some allied POWs there was some Americans Brits poll subs French\nExcept for and they've been working with the horses for some years\nAnd he is able to um some of those were captured gentlemen weapons but it's still not enough men so he intends eventually to the German prisoners that they have taken and um he re arms field expedient\nA quite a number of German soldiers and then a non check points along the side ... and us soldiers\nAnd of course this is known to steal its foreign legion where you throw the facts and his wife into this twenty on ... and of course when they uh S. S. actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and contacts and everybody else to defending the ...\nAh the townspeople and of course the er\nAt the women and children of the stuff so it's an amazing story\nForeign legion that this is a collection of people who if you put them all together in a bar or some place they would take very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats in the in in\nBut it's very ... of a pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think the ... was that ten they rule in in this together the whole is whether that ticket out you say when asked behind they would fall into Soviet captivity the Germans could expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA if not being shot on the spot or for the others of course ah they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the host has become the ... of the men and women and children that are also there as well so\nIt's very complex on top of that we have one more play it we haven't mentioned which just each episode back a communist POTUS hands will also operating in the forest they would like to snatch these whole says as well because they see them as being checked prophecy because they are on ... land so we had another added die mentioned to this as well\nDid they manage to to get a new way of the operation these check Mart as\nThey try to as the Americans were taking them out they manage some road blocks on the very edge of check territory on the very end border and a couple of American officers had to ... a real showdown with the guns were caught and loaded and pointed\nAnd it was you know in case of who I think fast fortunately for everybody the checks playing fast tend to allow the Americans but that German or allies and everybody else to pass through the whole says into safety in the area\nWe have concentrated on the horses a unique part of the story but of course as you noted the American forces discovered a lot of human there as well refugees and the like ... everybody a person's ah horses that they managed to get out safely\nBoth kennel read them initially didn't want to take out refugees because he thought it was a military operation but then when he he came up himself a couple of days later when he saw the clients of these people and he decided that he would turn a blind eye to what was going on and if they to join this great long straggling call on the people\nWhich was code name operation cowboy\nOr to move these people whole says and everybody else into the area\nThat will be old well and good because\nYou know a lot of these people are with us today and Germans and they had a either being born in the area or move around announce the occupation the checks hated them and the checks with a time and to get rid of these people out of Czechoslovakia\nGoals regard to respond [noise]\nTogether we can save lives ... stations will change will lead to Bedford streaming worldwide on the bill you don't do you\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard can't you\nHere's your early warnings your wireless device will sounding alarmist to Eighteen pm eastern time on Wednesday the federal emergency management agency conducting his first nationwide test of his wireless emergency alert system\n... says it expects the alert to reach Seventy five percent of wireless enabled devices including your cell phone and smart watches the agency says the alert will not interrupt a phone call or active data session but the man the FTC says they're working to make sure the information reaches more people\nABC's mark ... threats civil libel lawsuit after a New York times investigation into President Trump's path to riches raised allegations of suspect tax schemes resident\nTrump has portrayed himself as a master dealmaker who turned a million dollar loan from his father into a multibillion dollar empire\nI started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay back with interest\nIn New York Times reports much of his fortune is built on what the paper called dubious tax schemes and outright fraud the president's attorney called the story one hundred percent false and highly defamatory but state tax officials said they're reviewing the allegations which are too old to be prosecuted Aaron ...
