place\nYeah I agree and what a ... a hearty amen to that Louis ... first of all it so much of what we're doing in life is consuming in shorter and shorter hot takes right now and that means we have less and less wisdom\nI mean there is actually lots of data showing Americans reading significantly less than Thirty years ago if everybody were reading Lewis like that or even lion the witch and the wardrobe\nOr or the weight of glory and other s as there is so much weight there that starts from that assumption of the modern day\nSort of the Judeo Christian tradition the assumptions that people are created in the image of God and they have that he sold human soles are immortal and so if you treat people like that it means that even if I if it was somebody on policy and there's lots of legislative\nPriorities and policies that you're going to differ with your neighbors about\nThat doesn't change the fact that there are human worthy of dignity created in God's image and ... a descendent of a line before them and maybe the parents of line that's coming after them and if my neighbor Fort doors down and I for completely on this in my view the stupidity of a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and all the economic destruction that will cause that doesn't change the fact that we're going to root for\nOscar's together and I'm going to sweep their kid up in my driveway if she skins are knee falling off the bike like that not go\nAhead that is the that is the rediscovery of community but now applying for me senator Sasse to a problem which I've been talking about all morning there were seven thousand human beings marching towards our border they are human beings they are embargo day they they deserve dignity but at the same time our laws cannot be captive to the mob you\nCan't march into America and if seven thousand people can next time it'll be fourteen thousand then I'll be fifty thousand how do you want to frame what we ought to do about this for the public\nYeah so let's go back and and this is not a you know just trying to blame the prior administration because I Want to be clear our immigration problem starts decades and they called the\n... part of this problem is in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen when we didn't send that clearer signal and Central America that the assumptions that people and especially bad people I mean they don't have the image of God that we can distinguish it we had more time between the electrical right just as a civil rights\nBut human traffickers are in Central America\nTold people they told moms and dads when they were trying to take big payments out of that to say we can get your kids into the U.S\nThey told them that the U.S is catch and release policy in twenty Thirteen fourteen meant that if you got to the border you were basically guaranteed admission and passage into the U.S the U.S has to have borders every nation has to have orders\nAnd if you're kind of security or border that means you will not stop the upstream or in this case downstream the goals\nThat are telling people our policies are so dumb that if you can get to the border and turn yourself into a border patrol agent we can't ... process the backlog and sold immediately just release these migrants straight into the U.S and they'll have a six month asked until their trial date and some super majority of them I don't know the current statistics\nBut a hefty percentage of them don't ever show up for their trial that\nUh for their deportation trial that was stupid and now we have a big problem because these assumptions have been set for so long we need to send a signal\nThat the U.S has border is hard and getting harder and needs to be heart and more\nAnd that you won't get in under that dumped catch and release policy and at the same time we need to make sure that the ways that we communicate that continued articulate the US's grand division of seven and a half billion people ... being created with dignity that doesn't mean the free passage in the United states where\nThe fence must be the outward expression of an invisible resolved to both control your border but be a welcoming country and let me play for you then as we talked a lot senator during the confirmation of justice cabin up\nChuck Todd on meet the press on friday has been all over the country doing what I'm doing doing meet and greets with voters his conclusion ... number four\nIn my travels this week\nAmazing how consistent some of them were people running some of them will be ... some of them are people voting all up\nWashington Democrats than some of them went by a man named Jack some of these [laughter] these are Democrats out campaign trail frustrating to cap it off\nTo stop so Ben Sasse why the Rick oil I think Chuck is right I've heard the same thing it's in the polling there's a window if the Republicans back what is it about those proceedings that caused America to shutter\n[noise] well I I I'm going to be delicate about this because I I think the backdrop is the gender gap in America at thirty five no I'm no I'm you know ah\nTrying to think ooh my ... my favorite pollster of the moment as unbearable bowling expert but when you have a gender gap a plus thirty five um historically Republicans usually trial you know for ten point uh which one\nWhen you have plus twenty five with women and now for Democrats and now a plus fourteen ... ah for Republicans with men sometimes just fundamentally broken in the country so there's a lot to say that isn't just about the Kavanaugh hearings um but I think in the Kavanaugh hearings\nYou saw an attempt to politicize and hijack the me too movement and bake it something that is owned by partisans in Washington DC\nI'm I think the beach a movement is incredibly important 'cause I Do think we have a culture of a lot of sexual violence in this country and I think the V. chip and is on that a very good thing but I think you saw it in the cabinet hearing an assumption that politicians can just grab any cultural movement and do what they want with it\nAnd the reality is we have a long\nTradition and the British and American legal tradition\nOf rights not just of the accuser but of the accused\nAnd there were people talking rhetorically around the Kavanaugh hearings like there's no such thing as a right of the accused and I think um you know moms and dads don't want that for their sons they don't want sexual violence for their daughters um but they want a world where there's a lot more cautious deliberation that was that was happening in that media circus\nA very quick I could a senator in my case it says to justice love ... with your God that's kind of internalizing every Christian in America and Jews as well I don't think kindness was on board and justice was certainly not present in that Senate proceed\nNo you're right I mean that the the big gap there where politics and politics for instance TV um happens like that for so many people who are the politically addictive class of Washington\nThat is because I think and again why I wrote the book them of of upstream things that are happening where digital revolution is undermining combat community the nuclear family is in statistical collapse in America\nDeep friendship has been cut in half and the last twenty seven years in America job to ration is getting shorter local worshipping communities are declining or becoming so large that their suburban commuter campuses all of that undermining of place and the stick relationship\nInevitably undermines our ability to think about our neighbor as whole people not just partisans on the other side of the political aisle politics are important but if it's the senator life something fundamentally broken\nWe will come back and talk more about them next week the new book by Senator Ben Sasse when I'm back in my voice as whole senator says thank you really factor dot com coming up America this is a huge huge\nFiber
