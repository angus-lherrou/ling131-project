[noise]\nAnd all of the polls all across\nThis country show that the election coming up in just Fifteen days from now no it's a yeah it's Fifteen days from now it's a tomorrow's Tuesday\nSo two weeks from tomorrow is election day and it's going to be a series of very very close elections if you look at the the Trump Clinton election state after state after state was incredibly close\nUh most of those states that were incredibly close President Trump won Hillary also won some states that were amazingly close New Hampshire Nevada\nThat she won I'm at the point is we have close elections\nAnd that's exciting and there's a reason everybody should vote but you have full confidence that if you go out and vote your vote is going to be counted and it's going to be counted fairly and it's not going to be basically invalidated by all sorts of phony votes\nWell there's a new book that says you got to be concerned and the book is called fraud\nHow the left plans to steal the next election and you might just sort of throw this on the pile and say well this is nothing but actually it's a book by Eric eggers who is research director for the government accountability Institute\nAnd he's worked with Peter Schweitzer who's been a frequent guest on this show on the Clinton Cash or extortion and secret empires which blew the lid off a different kind of corruption right now\nFraud is about voter fraud and one of the most ... basic forms of fraud imaginable a Eric thanks very much for joining us and congratulations on the book\nHey thanks so much Michael it's great to be here\nOkay first of all we seen this in the New York times and the Washington Post time and time again there is no evidence that voter fraud has ever ever occurred\nCan you or I help people with a a little bits of evidence about some recent voter fraud that really made a difference\nWell absolutely and I think it's important to point out Michael 'cause you touched on this earlier about uh the idea of you know people have should that concerned that their vote count a real concern is that their vote\nWill be I think invalidated the true weight of it won't count because of illegal votes being cast and what you hear from the left it voter fraud is that you just mentioned incredibly rare or certainly not have their scale to swing elections but that's because they defined voter fraud in the narrowest possible\nUnder inclusive curves are they defined it only as an intentional acts of impersonation buying the legal\nOr a on behalf of illegal voter right but in fact I think most people would say well anything that makes my vote not count as much as it should\nThat voter fraud or and the reality is that happens all the time uh and you have to look no further than the tactics being employed to get illegal voters onto the voting rolls just in Texas\nThis week there was a story about the Texas Democratic party sending out a voter registration forms with the boxes that yes I'm a citizen check to non citizen voters or there's bloat in voter rolls all over the country there's actually two hundred and forty eight\nCounties in this country that have more registered voters than citizens of legal voting age or the Supreme Court size to fix that nearly three million people are registered to vote in more than one state and it GI where I work\nAs part of the research for this book we did a national study in which we found Twenty one hundred instances of double voting in the state of Florida alone in toy sixty and Michael you remember\nThat's nearly four times the margin of victory of a presidential election this century so clearly it's happening and it's happening in the scale of the largest swimming lessons you just noted a the Trump election prince sixteen how close that was a so so it's a very real problem and that's one of the reasons why would\nYou do you um can you point\nTo any specific elections where you do feel that evidence exist that the the result was tipped by Muslim voting for instance I Know a lot of people look at the Al Franken I'm a Norm Coleman election\nBack in the in two thousand and eight\nThat that's exactly right there was I think that the election ended up being settled by around three hundred vote and it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately what they discovered more than a thousand votes were cast by I think felons and people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way in Fort no\nAl Franken went on to become the sixtieth vote in the Senate\nSo anytime people ask well what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look at your are rising insurance premiums because African essentially became the the vote that locked in Obamacare\nAre in New Hampshire and twenty sixteen New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting they have what's called the intent to reside law so and I write about this in the book that the Democrats extra state of New Hampshire\nBill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of\nTrying to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly yeah Audie she ended up losing by one thousand votes\nIn twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people registered to vote on the same day in New Hampshire and they had these buses that come in from Massachusetts and neighboring states six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire residents\nSo are those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you got mayor's races you got share is racist or the sheriff's rate\nIn Florida that uh it's basically been proven that they have they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the elections basically been certified or the ... the judge has ruled that well we have to give these felons due process though that's not enough evidence for us invalidate so\nIt happened a nationally okay would\nWould you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because I think it really gets down to the blowout in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida\nI've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is to let people vote\nNo one wants to suppress illegal voter\nBut because of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities\nThat I think are actively exploited by bad actors so I mean that the Texas Democrat and mailing the the voter registration form is one example but you know you've got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Ralph stop at many voters as possible regardless\nOf those voters right you've got voted but I I Know one ... one of the things you're\nOne of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice now that's a legal but that happens a lot doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean they're nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme Court sided views that are ... that says twenty four million voter registration in this country are completely wrong so that's what an eight by the way\nAbsolutely uh some cities are issue in municipal I uh I mean some people to lie to vote with a gym membership right or credit cards and a half and half your picture on it so it's not like you have to have an honest to goodness driver's license at\nAnd she was only ... to me that if we if we talked to start talking to people about getting IDs hit it's such a handicap for somebody not to have an ID because he can't cash a check and you can't I mean all kinds of stuff you can't just\nSo if you're actually helping people by giving them IDs at the same time that you're requiring IDs for voting doesn't that help precisely the victim groups that uh we're supposed to be protecting\nIt does except for when it enables I think um the city like Chicago and San Francisco\nWhich is you hear in Germany right after jumble on and on the news more money WBFO ... new positions\nDesigned relief factor as an
