example I suppose you could [laughter] you could opt to receive a dollar a year for a billion years I [laughter] probably not a good option but does most of us would a would grab the the big money I mean what's the difference really you know for the in the lives of most of us between five hundred and sixty five million and a\nA thousand million or billion I mean it would not change I think the impact on my lifestyle measurably you know what do you do with that money well that's what I thought I Would ask you what would you do with the money what would you do with the money it's so much money\nOr there was a a movie a few years back and started to Richard Pryor and and in order to\nTo uh get an inheritance he had to spend a certain amount of money and the whole thing was about his

you\nBut I Would do it why is I Would use\nThat money to try to get rid of his foot ... than I Am I signed my house and now the\n... and ... fertile picture I enjoy it and it has to mind by Sunni well I'd have to ... to a lot of people that are not raining a lot of charity and how to keep fit in\nWell well that's certainly a very uh al ... thought to read it and we uh we obviously a wish you the

Hi\nThanks for taking the call oh actually there's a lot of thought in the past and I've got a pretty foolproof plan first would be to give it all the surveys\nSo all of it tries to do that I Want to make sure we all heard what the Andrew said you said all of it\nAll that every penny okay hurtful to us okay this\nIs the tax load then then I Would use that money you can borrow from your own trust and hurt just four point five billion in a middle income property [noise] than with the money from those get paid I could trust you got all the charities they give a billion Saturday in real money plus interest\nAnd you've got ... five billion in properties yourself\nWow how'd you get up from from a billion up to four ... four point five billion that that's that's quite a rate of return they're\nTwenty percent down on a sore point five billion or the properties\nOh okay well you've given this a lot of uh do you do play a mega millions were Powerball\nOr only occasionally\nOnly occasionally well obviously here's a man is ready for it gee whiz Andrew okay that that guy's got to the guy that planned out already Lewis in Mitchell South Dakota welcome to the Bo Hannah Joe\nHi Janet I'm doing fine thank you are\nI'm not as planned Donald ... but uh\nUh I can tell you that ah from a divorce or five years old uh I was supposed to be removed from ah\nMy mortgage that I had a lady and I haven't been done so the first thing I Would do is call that mortgage company and a pay that off first ah and then uh\nAlways had a dream car I owned it for about seven years and then I have a solid uh which was the\nTo have generally so it's going to cost me about eight thousand to get their\n... I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nUh I Am only guessing gym because short and now for five years you're I'm guessing that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure you're you're just a committed there between the mortgage and uh and getting your version of the general leave the old dodge see aren't who you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred and sixty four point eight million dollars [laughter] what do you go to the rest of\nIt I I I I um I've got three kids and unfortunately a through the\nHorse or a they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and uh\nAlso I'm a big animal lover so\nUh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a no kill shelter and instead of helping volunteers run it to have it be something to where they're paid employees a man that's about all I can think\nWell very good okay neither the uh of course two million each of the three kids at six million you're down to five fifty eight point eight million let's assume that you you get an extravagant on this center the you're talking about it was

mean you know most of the cars I wouldn't want to buy\nWould get me a a a a speeding ticket that would cost me a driver's license in in rapid order I mean it would be tough for me to think of things to blow this money I'm not a gambler I'm not a big drinker anymore and uh\nIt would be tough for me to think of what to do with it All right thanks very much the Lewis Carroll in Rochester, Minnesota

dot edu because there is abroad in the political discourse a really dumb argument and a hard life is hard but it's harder when you're stupid and it's really hard or when you do not understand what the Senate is about and I have seen it everywhere doctor on\nThe Senate is a deeply offensive institution when in fact it is the the uh the tendons spent a whole country together\nAnd we were talking about why New York didn't want a Senate and white Virginia didn't want a Senate but we had to have a Senate in order to have a republic please continue\nWell in New York in in Virginia and and the Massachusetts big big powerful states they've been very reluctant about a strong central government in general right and then and then the Senate\nProtecting the little states that was you know that of course they didn't want that and they you know and it's it before you emphasize that interest drove all of these discussions too much there's a way that they came together for ratification that this proves that and I'll mention that in a minute\nBut of course right now you know they're trying to they're trying to unite the country and they they and that just that's the ... 'cause you have to think back to the fact that this had never been done before\nNobody had ever built a country like this this this started out with the basic principle which it's born and then extend that to the consent of the govern made necessary by that principle this is the first thing in the world in human history to undertake that\nSo so they um they uh\nSo they have to you know they're going to figure out a way to do it and you know if you think now you know that big countries of the great rule you know but the truth is they aren't right the European Union is an attempt to unite the European continent\nAnd it's falling apart right and China has got intermittent at this assemblies of itself right and the Russian Federation you know is strained at the corners right\nAnd so and and yet these big powerful countries have a better a means of defending themselves and the small weak countries you know if you want to keep your independence for sure and certain for the rest of time\nYou don't really want to be Belgium 'cause they've managed to survive\nBut it took some really big countries getting on their side to help that happen yeah so how do you hold them together right and this is you know this is the American experiment right and remember this experiment was conducted on a new continent right never been anything like didn't know how big it was you know I think much about it really\nAnd so they so they uh their idea was local things will be governed cheaply by local things\nAnd then the Senate becomes a protection in the national thing of the prerogative of the local things and that that device\nThere's a powerful um it's a powerful a protector\nYou know I think you need to you need to explain that again it becomes a powerful national interest in the protection of local interests would you ...\nWell it was better when the Senate was ... was appointed by state legislatures although I confessed filled the Senate was often not very important in that time because first of all there wasn't just whacking big federal government with the ability to reach into every\nTown I mean there's a federal institution inflation basically in every town and they do they don't just do the post office anymore now there's you know local and\nPrivate thing of all can that are that are that are that are\nInfluenced by the federal government and so that that wasn't possible when the Senate was chosen but the state legislature that I Would go back to that old I think there is little prospect of it because I think that would be a really good ah um\nYeah we're not going to I Would I we're not going to reopen the seventeenth amendment as a practical matter I'm against the conventional the states as a matter as well but when we come back we're going to continue to talk about the glory of the Senate and this current eruption of attacks upon it as an institution\nNot on any particular decision the decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a great and good decision\nBut it launched it triggered on the left a mad\nCap rushed to denounce the Senate and we stand here as we always do every Friday at this hour with Dr Larry on and they held their own dialogue reminding people there were rumors ones and they were people on genius said too [noise]\nPortions of the huge your brought you in part by patriot mobile [noise]\n\nBe the first to know about some stories like WCBS now must have nonstop\nAction type information [noise] issues you is this coming right back [noise]\nYou see of my head in the day of battle amen based on the true story of an army chaplain and his wife and I only stand before you today because Jesus as my wrong because I have a family loves him believes one marriage one family under God she made me appreciate family\nPowerful back home and find help I think we all have\nInvisible rated PG Thirteen may be inappropriate for children under Thirteen in theaters October twenty six for tickets on Showtime so to indivisible movie dot com\nThe backyards looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask home advisor home what home advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice but how much does it cost\nA home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download to bring home advisor ...

Democratic Senate equally steak represented Senate the right to confirm and the house was excluded from that process\nAnd I think it was because Dr aren't they did not want the majority ... influence on the people who would be making the laws\nThat's right that's right and well you know 'cause I remember the whole point\n... you you can't say that without also at the point that that ultimately it is the people in their majority who should rule\nAnd so how do you set up a system where there is deliberation and debate and ultimately the people rule and if if if\nIt's a you know any people by the way if you if you look at a mob anywhere in the world what you're saying is a bunch of human beings who are capable\nOf good behavior yes and and so\nNeed a system for them to participate in\nThat will respond to that good behavior and not to they're marching in the streets you know I read this article on the fact that having badly a long time ago that the Palestinian authority\nOr when they got their govern their parliament set up they passed a law that it was the death penalty to sell the land and land in the west bank to a Jew\nAnd then apparently a court of them left the place and marched down the street with a bunch of others and arrested some people and beat them and that I think they might have killed one of them right so you\nKnow that it's a mob and ... you can't have that and that\nAnd so this idea that it's just you know as Jefferson said right there and had a way with words he said in all cases majority rule but for the rule to the rightful it must be reasonable and protected the rights of minorities and\nThat when we come back for the final segment of this week's Hillsdale dialogue is what will focus on how does the majority\nRule even when you have an aunt that majority institution like the Senate\nAnd the answer will be they rule constitutionally through mediating institutions that are designed exactly and functioning exactly as they were designed to do and
