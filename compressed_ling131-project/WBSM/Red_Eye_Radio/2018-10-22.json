I think more than anybody else almost eighty percent in every year Roger they have a um\nA event barbecue event where everybody dresses up in western garb and I was given a beautiful citizen hat and I put it on and I posted it on to it and I got some snarky troll that said you are not of that culture\nSo I attacked an article about all the number of black cowboys are and I'm a cynic to this person and I did not hear back because I'm sure she was unaware that there were in fact a number of black cowboys the number apparently has been inflated over the years but they were there so I thought maybe you would clarify first of all how many black cowboys were there how did the number get inflated\nWell yeah of course there were black cowboys just like there are black Teamsters in in ... in settlers and soldiers in every capacity in the west or\nA blacks blacks were there along with a with a white but much lower percentages because in Seattle\nEighteenth sixty five and thirteenth meant a great majority of blacks were in slave in most of them are of course in the south [noise]\nUm but there were a few few free blacks who were out in the west in the\nEighteen fifty seven and a during the civil war in the west and some of them were were uh were killed boys [noise] ah the ... the large number of black cowboys though we're in Texas and former slaves or as the teen sixty five or six six\nThat were employed as ... as cowboys and they participated in the long drives to the Kansas at camp towns um now the percentage just got wildly inflated over the years\nAnd um it probably began with\nA couple of ... a professor with a book the negro cowboys [noise] ah this was a came out and making sixty five\nOther couple a ... a professor of English who who thought will there hasn't been enough a literature western novels and such that that that featured a black cowboy swell and they said\nAfter all is looking at our anecdotal evidence we think about twenty percent\nOf the cowboys are most cattle drives for either black or Mexican will somehow the Mexican component of that was forgotten about and dropped and they said oh Jesus ... twenty percent were blacks on that\nAnd then somehow that grew to about twenty five percent make us our quarters in like a better round number [noise] um\n[noise] and and that is people started repeating it one at at no actual basis in fact uh on on the other hand it's certainly beat up and brought to the general populace at the attention\nTo their attention that there were black cowboys of course I'm an individual black cowboys are some of them were more famous\nWhat was a boost I hurt a who was the right hand man to all of her loving can we got killed by commander in chief in New Mexico and then his partner Charles good night\nPros I

murdered where the labor force it was a brutal for the Turkish government first point an accusatory finger at Saudi ruler\nThat alternative exploration is rogue operative took it upon themselves to carry out the murder of Chevy by mid week the world still lack a plausible answer turned the middle east expert David Kirkpatrick than the New York times and a personal acquaintance of ...\nWhat was your relationship with your market show ...\nWell he was a source you know he was somebody I was friendly with them is that we would have lunch together and shit you know not somewhat I Would have or to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew he was it was hard not to like\nWhat do you see happening David where the mood music for that\nIt created that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services uh the jerky boys likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that Jamal show he had been killed inside the confidence in Istanbul\nAnd that seems like the way things are headed at this hour of the uh well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia and identify the person they're going to say is responsible he put it more honestly and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and intelligence\nHad the authorization to carry out some kind of a rendition and that went horribly wrong if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that has seemed terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia or for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nThis is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid ... well no one written me of this troublesome praised him for him it was nice ... can America the drill it works in the drama in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think will\nWill what his works mean you know for them and the government to make do with a partial troops fairly often\nOr the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish ah officials and all this been confirmed it's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his were his reputation\nYou know he he'd gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up became them kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover rendition gone bad input cage NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do you think the royal court changes in succession\nOr two elements there first of all I think this person is a intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person is dry that person will be tried in Saudi court\nSo that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the ground ... uh you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nSpeaking with Patrick I mentioned his recent book into the hands of soldiers and then he'd been in the middle east correspondent for the New York times such as well qualified to unravel the often mysterious geopolitics of the region or conversation continues\nSaturday and it has changed crown prince ... consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key levers and so the best handicapping is there's no one in a position to challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over this he's made many enemies along the way\nNone of them seems to have enough left to push him out a lot of succession as long as their dad is okay with it and his dad is elderly and may not be that company right now [laughter]\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king I'm not too long ago and she expected me with the ambience when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that there is within the guy and this was just a range of ... have you been in the ... second option which is your responsibility\nBut not a guild the other one is you say someone was trying to take me out a rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the Orioles an eye on improving the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know and to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that's what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime but in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend\nOf a crowd Brits around but Solomon who felt like he had the okay it from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nWill that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would uh the second defense be six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence\nTurkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflicts showing who did what ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence got a ... who often work very closely with the Turks\nThen that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S and diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now does that impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses Jordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront the who you are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome ah as being a necessary for corruption in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure this has any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish tennis whatsoever about what's been done here and so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept\nThis explanation he was even yesterday you know getting out of the Saudis\nHad already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begin to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it is an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this\nAbove the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley the keys enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they're no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nAnd as you said if I
