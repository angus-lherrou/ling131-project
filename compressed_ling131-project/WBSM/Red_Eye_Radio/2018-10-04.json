to the visceral rejection of the McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and uh this uh this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or a not display the appropriate temperament on the bench\nThis man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked judge or sugar corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut he shouldn't be expected just to uh take uh this this slander these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position\nWho feels like they had been falsely accused I think would be angry and uh be justified in showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be obliged in good faith because of the FBI report not to vote for um judge Kaplan I I think it will be a huge mistake unless there is direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her\nCareer done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the ...\n[noise] well I think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for ah for the judge there are some of our colleagues who for whom this FBI supplemental background investigation was requested they said it would be necessary\nBut I Believe that there is no cooperation which I Believe will be the case that that will eliminate the last obstacle to the judge getting confirmed\nAnd then completely off the topic will the u._s. and see a path the necessary margin in I don't know if it's fast track majority of the treaty two thirds but the new now that will it passed the Senate\nI think that it's going to be an uphill fight because uh when we pass trade promotion authority there were Thirteen Democrats forty seven Republicans to pass that and of course we've seen just visceral um opposition\nTo everything that the president proposes and so it's going to be a tough sell but I certainly hope we uh we can do it and ah it'll require fifty one votes as you know\nI didn't know that so it's only a fifty one vote number\nThat's correct we probably not going to get to it I wouldn't think you until after the first to the year given the the timing of of this so uh
