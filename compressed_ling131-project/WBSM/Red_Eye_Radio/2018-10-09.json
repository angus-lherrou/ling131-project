Pennsylvania\nWell Lisa I can answer that question for you I don't know if the sports illustrated people ever got around to reply to you I can tell you a very simply why their coverage was one page and a few photos and that's because nobody watches the WMBA [noise]\nBecause it has very low attendance at any time it's on TV which is sporadically of the ratings are terrible the\nWNBA exists only because the NBA the cast male league has chosen to subsidize it any women's independent basketball league has gone under\nIs not always a bad notion and even if in fact you feel that there is something that is wrong and doesn't require you to become totally outraged and indignant about everything and as we go to some calls let me know one of the problems is becoming outraged about everything if you become outraged about everything\nWhen can you actually show outrage you've taken away your main weapon if you save outrage for genuinely outrageous moments people notice you but if you're outraged all the time nobody knows is oh\nJohn or Jane are outraged again we don't even pay attention after a while John in Seattle calls and believe me John welcome\nHey Jim yes yeah um my take on this or is it I think it's tragic that a young lady that's Eighteen\nYear old today that goes to four years of college whether it's higher institution of public or private\nThere's this constant drumbeat on campus that all men are evil that you always have to be looking over your shoulder but how does this prepare young lady to go out in the world and have good social skills\nTo make a living to raise a family I mean it's it's almost like it's the Victorian area you know it's like there's this real narrow defined a idea that this is how men and women are and that this is how\nYou have to relate to the opposite sex I mean it's just so narrowly defined it's just like a throwback to Victoria\nWell in many ways it is which is which is ironic because of course to many of these people are rather rather liberty and in in their views about a a things though that the upset the Victorians but in terms of of being easily offended some of these people come forth like they are one giant Ron nerve ending\nIt and I I I think I could walk out with some of these people that I could say a good morning and they would say what you mean by that [laughter]\nI Know it's a it's supposedly a liberal approach but it it's more like a really\nReally a really conservative Victorian I mean it's so narrowly defined about how men and women are supposed to be able to one another so anyway that was my thought on it you have a good night\nWhere language show thank John appreciate your thoughts one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six on the bull headed show and in Pittsburgh is Liz up this evening hello Liz\nHi Hi know what I wanted to say on don't get me some of these ... watery but they can't put that on on man and see that all men that allow and ... just because they're ... they're not gonna take it out on all men\nMen want to read to\nIt does happen it it does happen that you're very correct it does happen\nYeah man you know going around Cape is often anybody they they are eight than they are accused of rape selling that not really in the ... and some ... some of these women\nWell in some cases I I Will I I don't know that I can get down to a comparison let's say of a of rape versus an accusation of rape or an accusation of rape unfounded would be a terrible thing\nUh being raped I I have no idea what that would be like and I'm very glad that I I bring Noah Noah ... ah empathy if you will to the subject it's not something we most of us want to be familiar with but I certainly\nIt lives and and I mean again Rene\nInto an all men not mind because some of these moving more rain and I sympathize with them and my I mean it's wrong I like it being I think his name but they have no right taken out on on ...\n[noise] well it certainly is not a ... a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were to say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nWell of course everybody would put down that notion of what are you saying oh women are liars\nAgreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nIn which a there are charges against men and assuming all men are pigs I'm Sorry that doesn't hold up either every case is different every case is different and has to be judged on its own circumstances in bed I think is the message that we should be getting across your along with the notion\nOf tried to put your outrage or indignation and some perspective a Steven and you're in North Carolina joined us good evening Steve\nHey miss Ken but Pete whale yes or as you too\nUm did you hear or listening dolls Saturday here and the hours of ...\nA ... fan which was a control this whale tried debate and can hold her shaped like but you know it was like\nOrchestrated interruptions are\nAbout scream in power and people um\nThat that's all some of these people know that they're incapable of rational debate no no high right I I therefore I shout I mean that's all they know they are in many regards some of these people are in their twenties thirties forties and older but they're they're like like small children having a giant tantrum\nYeah and I uh get mad at the politics of objects Supreme Court justice have allowed less site um so that's behind this um\nI think if I really do that gets the culture I mean when you grow up and you're a little bit older than I Am but I'm old enough to our house ate a lot and there are a lot of things [laughter] I fall some boys that\nThat ... or stronger tougher and they they may\nI play in sports wow almost uh-huh you know we had to face up to the source of dies you don't always want it don't dial Rolling Stone you don't always get what you want [laughter]\nYeah that's true as the old song the says uh uh absolutely true and that again as I said before and we'll keep repeating because it's obviously necessary for some folks out there I have no idea of how it feels to be sexually assaulted\nI cannot imagine that it it it would not be the worst thing I ever I ever encountered I'm sure it would be but again\nWhat happened to you does not and and whether or not you feel you were given justice and maybe society didn't treat you as with as much deference as you thought maybe the\n... the law system didn't uh didn't punish the trends grassroots as much as you thought all of which would be terrible but but it has nothing to do with the circumstances of another case\nJustice this the scales with justice are not chipped\nIf in fact we railroad through a a a a kangaroo court on somebody because they're a guy and a and that that does not tip the tables just because you may as a woman they have not been treated fairly I'm Sorry that you weren't even in fact you weren't much\nBut it doesn't doesn't alter the fact that\nTwo wrongs in this case do not even come close to making a right so I I certainly see what you're saying Steve into and share your viewpoints\nAppreciate them very much thank you very ... absolutely ... Washington now hello Tom\nHello Jim both thank you for everything you do like you I got a statistics I got this statistic for you and I've heard it more than was I Believe it\nOr it's a thirty percent of domestic violence Collins come from a man about wives being like much larger than they are and [laughter] beating them up\nIt does happen many men of course they're very very embarrassed by this and they won't make the call but do you are absolutely correct there are many complaints\nAbout the outrage guy like commentary Oh yes yes please\nYes Trump is our procedural outrage a lot of people are are are are wondering and some of them are your contemporaries your worries the outrage to all this stuff\nWell a list I make anything any worse and me and my friends said Trump is our procedural outrage and it's working so you're back up on the need for outrageous already bad enough that you\nAim in All right thank you very much appreciate your thoughts are Tom one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six uh I'm I'm hopeful I don't know that I'm optimistic but I'm hopeful that ultimately we can back off just a little bit of this outrage about everything\nRight now like\nNo one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number back in a moment\n\nWhere the brain is for for me the way I see it the school shootings where women are treated in this country what's happened in the sea all this going on I'm going about Ninety percent of it on Hollywood\nThe movies and the courage to go there for the last forty years the violence is shooting this has nothing to the young kids right now they don't know what it is when they watch it on TV\nAnd the school shootings I never heard of Hollywood bowling for any of that\nWell I'm I I haven't heard them I have heard them blamed the movies and everything I have heard them in fact\nThe blame for it and in some cases I think that that is probably justifiably so I I don't know of Ninety percent would be the appropriate figure but certainly yes there is a a a a reason why are some of it should go in that direction I Would concur one eight six six five oh Jim Boehm Marlene in the ...

that in the negatives they don't think he's behaved well but what the Democrats managed to do here was to put their behavior on trial\nAnd and and by definition shift the focus away from what had been

I don't want to necessarily associate myself with with\nYour characterization going to be with your general said I keep in mind the one thing you which is that if people see the events differently

in the middle the moderate independents the true independent people just call the those that but the true independents will they see a mob rushing through the capital or will they the victims of the
