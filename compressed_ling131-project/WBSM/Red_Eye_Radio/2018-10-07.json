a they're a great day in his greatest nation on God's green earth a great day when one of the great dividing lines in the United states is not only the dividing line between liberals and conservatives between peoples in states that Donald Trump can do no wrong\nAnd those who think he can do no right there is also in a binding dividing line\nThat continues to be a painful reminder of some of the more troubling aspects of America's passage of dividing line according to race\nBetween black and white or or you could save between black people\nHave had a unique experience in the United states coming here originally as enslaved individuals and uh everybody else\nAnd uh there is a new book on this subject by someone who was in the past is very very critical of black leadership his name is Juan Williams\nYou see 'em on the five very regularly on Fox News he's a regular contributor to Fox News his new book is called what the hell do you have to lose\nWhich of course there's a line from President Trump and the subtitle is Trump's war on civil rights a won congratulations on the book\nYou know kind of prickly issue uh but I think it's so important that's why I appreciate the opportunity\nWell one of the things that I liked about your book is you give proper credit or to the Republican Party in particular to Senate minority leader at the time Everett Dirksen for the landmark civil rights bill well let's let's start there because one\nOf the things you remind people of is how profoundly that civil rights bill that was passed a with very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act the sixty four so that you know we go through

were speaking a before about basically okay or\nOne you question polls that show the president's approval\nRating I'm a strengthening and I'm I'm In improving particularly among African American people\nUm but ... if you were to advise the president about how he could bring the country together could improve his standing up and service to the black community will be the first thing you tell them\nWhere I think there are number one thing would be economic\nSo you know the president whenever there's a chart of racial in fact the pivot you were just outright racism in terms of his language or tweeting or his policies\nHe says hey what are you talking about historic low black on employment but you know again he doesn't say that in fact most of that took place under President Obama and then he doesn't mention that you have twice the level of unemployment among blacks or if you have a white\nBut what I Would say to him it's let's look at the policies because I I was saying earlier Michael the number one achievement of the civil rights movement to me is the growth of the black middle class in this country\nSo you want things that report continuing growth but that black middle class you do not want to destroy programs intended to help black entrepreneur you don't want to destroy\nCommunity development programs or you don't want to go after people who are in middle management in terms of limiting their ability to get overtime pay you don't want to diminish efforts\nTo try to get people into better schools by saying oh we're opposed to all affirmative action even when we know that\nGosh there's a tremendous history of people being\nHeld out of the schools you you got you can't do that and then expect people say oh yeah we like you Mr President because your program is offensively directed at damaging their ability to get a foothold\nOkay I didn't just to just about let me just finish the play I spoke\nTo earlier about the growth of the black middle class\nThe tremendous story but they're still remains not only twice the unemployment rate but a huge gap in terms of wealth between blacks and whites so even black up and moving up there still striving to achieve or to a crew that kind of wealth that exist in black and white America stocks bonds real estate savings and the rents\nAre good at ... you say rightly in and I think we can agree completely on this that there is a great on St whole story of black economic progress\nNot all of that is because of government programs in fact most of that and there's something the CERN storms have documented and I know you're aware of their work because you said it is a than Steven avid Lucerne instruments has shown that a large part\nOf the black economic progress occurred before the civil rights revolution help to set it up and then it continued in\nAnd gathered steam and gathered momentum because of the civil rights bills but you're not you're not trying to say that a black progress\nCan only continue with a a government programs I\nKnow I I don't I I'm certainly not saying that in fact I think\nWhat Abigail and Steven third from had showed is and it was a different era because then you had the black community you know ... much stronger in terms of everything from its own baseball leagues through its own newspaper's general who were segregated society\nBut in terms of how they could then black business prosper and grow\nA it was limited uh air and curtailed I mean there was a it's a it was a segregated society and four and a government aid backing to that segregation and obviously violence in places like ... we're we're used to estimate that black\nEconomic growth and black or business but\nWhat I Am saying is let's not be indifferent to the idea that if you look at the white middle class in this country are so much of it was built behind things like the GI Bill behind things like\nGiving aid to mortgages so that people could buy homes in this country and don't forget again GI Bill job training educational opportunity after World War two and that was often done again on segregated basis so I mean government has a role to play\nBut that's not going to be it seems to me the be all and end all in terms of economic empowerment is Jeff that you don't punish people unfairly\nEither and I I think I think every every poll people good well should certainly agree on that and speaking of people have good will you played a courageous role during the Clarence Thomas\nConfirmation fight in in defense of Justice Thomas in and I knew you were a supporter of his confirmation I'd do you think that history is repeating itself to some extent in terms of the the kind of attacks that have been ... level the judge capital\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee in the comic case it was a ... hill and\nYou know it was very slow to come out but then the committee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they dismissed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then it came out so it's very similar because look at professor Ford she sent a letter to a congressman ... and it makes its way through guy and Feinstein\nAre and then her name as we or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... what doesn't seem similar to me is a level the charge I don't think that anybody that\nUh you're Clarence Thomas ... on a better\nYeah but one there's a difference in touch and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do and he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission he was a government official\nAnd he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh has to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is ... er of character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because you know the whole presentation of himself urging a choir boy he's got a book he was and then ... all his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved the parties don't count\nOkay wait a minute if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe some day I don't really mind it therefore\nHopefully Kelly in Washington D. C. becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but many minutes of one um would you vote for ... confirmation\nNo on at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off even making all sorts of projections regret Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats are I'm thinking\nA minute

she remembered exactly that she had one beer\nThat night but she couldn't remember which house it was er which year it was as she couldn't remember how she got home after this alleged incident happened which is a big thing that Rachel Mitchell emphasizes in her ... she was the prosecutor who asked the questions of her and actually set them up pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was a Sarah Sanders in them a pasta or about that to President Trump's comments\nSince there's something wrong with the president of the United states mocking somebody which sucks when you're so\nThey seemed to me that he was stating facts that Dr Ford herself\nA laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at examine picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at ah whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nSo he drinks a victim all this\nI think those Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nA are victims of the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford

soon as we were unfairly to these still supposed to behave as a judge his edited ... should be disqualifying me showed no judicial temperament\nBut we know one thing he does not had the temperament to be a judge\nOr the Supreme Court I've never argued in front of the Supreme Court but I've written amicus brief and I've I've sat in the Supreme Court\nHow can he fit credibly on the court and claim to

decided and not all about temp Brent Kavanaugh his personal life but look\nOne of the things is clean court has decided is that believe it or not we in America still have a right to read the Bible\nAnd even to talk about and that right is being defended and champion even for students in public schools\nIt's not tomorrow October for us is going to be bring the Bible to school day it's sponsored by focus on the family\nAnd it is the fifth year that they're doing this last year they had five hundred thousand students who participated across the country\nAnd this year they're hoping to have even more it's my pleasure to welcome gym daily who's had to focus on the family which is an international Christian communications ministry based in Colorado Springs Colorado I've had the great pleasure speaking for focus on many occasions\nOr a gym of first of all and people are hearing this\nAnd a lot of people are saying is it illegal to bring the Bible to school\nAnd Michael it's great to be with you absolutely not that's the thing in our culture today these religious liberties that we have had for over two hundred and forty years in this country or they're simply not exercised every student has the right to bring a Bible to school if they wish to read it during lunchtime and free time\nNot during class time or it's disruptive\nBut you can do that and it's completely legal in fact we provide a one sheet illegal statement for teachers and administrators who invariably come to the student on this day bring your Bible to school now say hey it's illegal for you to have that you're giving your Bible we've had teachers confiscate buy\nInto the student shows that once she legal brief and they read it and go oh okay it looks like it is legal here's your Bible back it's almost like this a head in the sand kind of environment where we don't understand our religious celebrities in this country anymore\nI yeah and what's strange year as I'm sure a lot of the people on the left who would say oh it's terrible to bring a Bible to school would absolutely defend any child who wanted to bring a caller run\nSchool for or wanted to bring the communist manifesto whenever they want to bring\nRight absolutely and we get that question off and why why don't you champion that we're we're Christian ministry we champion bringing the Bible the Old Testament New Testament to schools for Christian kids to read on their own or with others and invariably this as a lunch setting typically we're a little Thirteen fourteen year old girl or a boy\nOr has four or five friends around the table and they're reading the book of John or something from the Old Testament it's completely right I mean you think of Michael that's what's so frustrating to think of the impact of the Bible on western civilization\nAnd here in this country people are wrongly saying teachers school administrators wrongly saying hey what are you doing with that\nLegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNot knowing does entirely and see what what I ah I see from the materials that you prepared for this\nYou are emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people and saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell or or I I hate you unless you come in and joined me in my face\nI you you're also emphasizing the kids who bring their bibles to school\nTry to bear witness you know winning and kind and a friendly way\nAbsolutely I mean one of the things I often ask friends who you know have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what's he missing in his resume he was a person who exposed\nReally espouse loved joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and to the people at the school that they bring their Bible to one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school all brought bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians but the whole class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that you know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they're going wow we never knew\nAnd I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for the left in the progressive to talk about the um you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message they sure do a lot of shaming for people of faith\n\nI started hearing about my pillow like most of you first time a couple of years ago and initially I was skeptical about
