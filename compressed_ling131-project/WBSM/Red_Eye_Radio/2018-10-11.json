climate change and on and on it which now are\nYou noted one thing just a few minutes ago that I'd like to return to that is the the notion of how we teach history of course uh uh there's one line that comes back to me from a by grade school days stays with me to this this very date I suppose\nAbove my grade school days stays with me to this this very day I suppose someday it could be the

with a few other facts I guess it's an important thing to know but but you're right there was a lot of rote memorization\nYes that's entirely true it's the primary way in which we teach students history here\nToo and most of our text books are written hits the way most estate exams or it's most state exams test for and it's the kind of knowledge for students might have for the test\nBut it's

identity of the certain key people at a certain time for example had Abraham Lincoln not been elected president in Eighteen sixty or our history would have been the dramatically changed in all likelihood so\nThese are important I think that it doesn't strike me as impossible to to teach this way is it\nIs and they're already programs around the country that are doing this or their simulation fair game for the last three years the foundation in teaching history teachers in schools\nHow to teach using game ... games but more importantly let's go back to your Lincoln example so Lincoln arrives in Washington\nHe's had to sneak into Washington to avoid the assassination attempts he arrives at the White House\nAnd we tend to think of all of history as it inevitable\nWe tend to think of the people who had those jobs as wax and figures out of some prehistoric time Lincoln arrives he's a flesh and blood man who comes from the mid west to Washington DC and he's run against three other people\nAnd certainly doesn't have the support of many many of the mirror and colleagues Lincoln has a real choice\nBecause he wanted to go to war or does he want him to go she is way out of this\nIf we can set up the conditions that allow students to role playing game where I Am\nExaminer documents in depth in ways that we don't permit field studies how real can we make when you get

of adopted and they're all paying a grim projection of our ability to get to three hundred and fifty five at any time in the next Twenty years in fact I think the early projects that thirty so this is going to require\nA president on down directive just as it required the president and John Lehman working incredibly hard\nDuring the Reagan Administration to achieve this because as the defense industrial base report lays out or they have does she makes a very fragile right now you can't just flip a switch so the longer we delay the longer we don't attack us with a sense of urgency or the more we're going to struggle to accomplish that very important promise that the president may\nWell when you have oversight hearings with the secretary Spencer or secretary man is that what is their answer to the fact that there is NO PLAN and it's a presidential promise\nWell I think uh they always talk about the need for example um you know when you're talking to them like a small surface combat more transitioning away from multiple combat shift to the future forget the need to while also attacking us with a sense of urgency making sure that you have a very robust\nCompetition so you can get the design that you want\nYou don't Russia ship into projects\nProduction that is basically obsolete upon arrival and so there's always that tension when it comes to ship building in particular but military acquisition in general but the fact is our acquisition system is absolutely\nBroken antiquated outdated um we just don't have an appetite for fast failure in the Pentagon there we're seeing some nontraditional companies get\nOf the defense space but they do still very warily because they don't use the defense department as a reliable customers so I'll be given that some um budgetary certainly over the last two years the final thing I'd say is that there's a lot of concern particularly if the Democrats get control the house the Senate\nThat there will be no budget

urge him to look for in a UN ambassador\nWell before we look at a future let me say how how grateful we all our president myself our entire\nAdministration for the extraordinary job or that ambassador Nikki Haley is done for the United states at the United nations or she is she has a ... you know\nTaken the presidents America First agenda uh carried it into the\nThe floor of the United nations that she's traveled around the globe advocating American interest uh and uh we will miss her in this role she is a personal friend of mine and she and I spent a little bit of time or after she was in the oval office with the president I just\nI just told her personally grateful I was uh for for not only the job she's done but the way she's the way she's done a with courage and character and and grace and we wish her and her family of every blessing in the years ahead you\nVery tough act to follow so how do you follow it\nWell I think I'll be sitting in for the president but\nThere are a number of men and women are that ah that that would be a very qualified very able to follow on in that role but what I can promise you as the policies aren't going to change I mean one of one of the things that has is I think than than most uh uh admirable about the job\nEsther Haley did at the United nations that are secretary's day my ... my ... doing now John Bolton is doing\nIs is every single one of these folks and gets up every day to carry the agenda that we were elected to advance on behalf of the American people that America First agenda on to the world stage and so we're we're we're looking for folks that are that are not only can follow in the big shoes that Nikki Haley is going to leave\nAt the un but we're we're going to be looking we're going to be looking to fill that spot a with someone who comes in with just as much bigger to advance\nAmerica's interest to advance the America First agenda and to and to continue to see of America um\nRespected again on the world stage you know Nikki made that comment in the oval office today and I I can tell you having\nHad the opportunity to travel around\nThe world over the last two years few\nUm and uh I'll be headed to the Asia Pacific here in in about a month\nOr as a as I've met with world leaders as I have witnessed or the response to President Trump's leadership\nUh on on the world stage there's no doubt that America is respected again and that has a credit to the president and the entire team and and uh and we are so grateful for the contribution to Nikki Haley made to that causes well\nIt does take some spark on some charisma like ambassador Haley that's why I bring up Grinnell Robert O'Brien and and James ... we got to have some sparkle there\nWell look it's a it's the United nations is a big state and are having having the right talent they're all of those people are are outstanding people there are other people there's actually there's a great number of people that have already expressed an interest in that position but I\nI I can tell you I'm I'm I have every confidence that the president or we'll we'll make sure that the United states is a once again well represented on the floor of the United

were commitments made by president Jean to the last administration that they\nThey would never have a military assets on those islands I recounted last week that that is no longer the case or that

trade to move\nFreely and American goods to move freely\nInto China at those things have to change that all of that being said um let me say President Trump and I and our team continued to be hopeful that we will see change not more words but deeds\nBecause of truthfully the president has forged a a strong personal relationship with President gee if China or they met in the United states last year they met in China last year I expect a you know I expect that the relationship\nOr will continue or to go\nForward and our hope is\nOur hope is on the basis of that personal relationship that President Trump is former president gee that will finally begin to see China take the kind of actions that will set it or\nThat will set it on a pathway toward a more economic exchange and a and in greater respect a greater respect for nations around the world\nTo more questions about China's rise president the president made an explicit promise of a three hundred and fifty five ship maybe in

president's going to continue to rebuild our military and the uh Seventy billion dollar increase in our military and our first budget\nUm now will be at seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars total
