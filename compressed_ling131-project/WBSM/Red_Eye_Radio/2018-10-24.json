they going to check their uh\nTheir physical pain you know are they going to be sick or what\nWell they certainly need to be petted and the variety of ways\nYeah I mean they don't have any any right to come up here I mean and we got this big ship out and and to sign that says a you know\nIt's it's as soon as the right thing to do by laying the command if you don't let them come in you you can get excommunicated from the Catholic Church when that's absolutely ridiculous where the Catholic Church has all these other problems they've got and he got a fish you're talking about this so\nWell yeah I

right and a stick them so thanks Charlie DJ in southern Minnesota hello\nGood evening sir good weather to talk to you yesterday and what's on your mind to my\nMy my idea what this is okay first of all the people don't discuss may but\nThe others just when they had their attitudes disgust me yet but go ahead\nYes the other gentleman had a good a good point where people came into the country the right way through Ellis Island you know through the the right process\nI don't understand and I am a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries I don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through that show we deal with it and they don't have to\nThat's right they are they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially\nA toilet to flush their uh unemployment and other problems on to the United states Yes sir Ben Stiller absolutely\nAnd I I I'm forty nine years old I'm a I'm a war veteran and I voted for the first time for president this last election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he has planned on putting our military on the line to stop them is absolutely correct\nI I don't see how there's an argument for that\nOh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough it's always interesting for me to hear all the people out there who were so generous with the your dollars in my dollars\nAre demanded or he'll morally superior so thank you for your service DJ and for your good thoughts David in Gainesville, Georgia lizard a WD un radio

I Know you got troops that are\nAll over the globe a cold there for border to North Korea border you're different places\nRight when I was just one or do you think maybe the president of the ones that pressure point\nIs for A M a S H ... n ... fish will require us\nFor ... years\nOld they're ... they're order that why you think it's an air troops there so or order like\nMexico southern border yeah\nWell first of all I\nMexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that uh we need the opposite way they're quite capable of guardian that border as they have proven over the years you know suddenly decided\nThen they're still they're advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they have suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new a new president and in Mexico city ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David then obviously I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I uh I Do believe that that's the appropriate way to go\nAnyway by the way I almost was in a visiting your good friends Billy Joel on the devil due to the un this past mourning but at the time was a having a dental problems so it was

by you know figuring out who's in charge and who's paying them your problem it\nYes I think that there's absolutely a somewhat behind this uh if it is a a a a Americans that wouldn't surprise me at all a\nA judicial watch president Tom ... says that there is evidence that this is a care about is comprised mostly of military age males and was in fact financed by people in the United states so uh

are given a rehearsed answer this is not politics this is about poverty\nShe tweeted that uh there were women and children but they were at the front of a caravan smaller numbers none would say who

twenty two\nMinutes after the our good morning to you thank you so much for joining us for the Hugh Hewitt show my name is Bob branch off sick today after his rally in\nA Pittsburgh last night when I was a tough one a railing against the president [laughter] no it was a battleground soccer store event in Pittsburgh obviously with you and a lot of colleagues Michael med better than others I'm sure it was great event but uh\nUh you have that deal in Pittsburgh while battling the ah the illness that took his voice from him yesterday so I'm very happy to be sitting in for them today from the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer\nIn Cleveland so the president\nA rally last night as a mentioned uh for Ted Cruz but also rallying for himself and for just the conservative Republican vision in this country and why it is it's so important is so integral for\nThe Republicans to not only a hold on to but maybe expand their majority in the United States Senate but also to try to hold off\nA the Democrats whether it be a waiver a trickle just cannot let them uh and the president says of course I'll take over the house\nWe cannot deal with Speaker Pelosi we cannot deal with a Democrat that shareholders I'm a chair persons of various committees a which will wipe out important investigations are ongoing right now which will start new investigations that will be politically motivated in more so\nYou know the president is doing everything it can I said before the break you know his energy level is absolutely\nUnmatched I say that not to just be you know overly overly complementary of the leader of my party but\nQuite honestly if President Trump and his ability at his age to continue to turn out these performances and this high level of energy to try to rally people for um you know congressional votes for Republicans is simply amazing you've never seen it before President Reagan didn't do this\nYou know President Bush won or Bush to didn't do this you can go back further than that\nThat nobody does this but the president is just continuing\nTo make this worldwide are not worldwide but nationwide tour of a of rallies in order to support Republicans if they do not when I'm going to say something about President Trump\nThat needs to be said\nBecause he was mocked for this in some circles a few weeks ago when he said that if we don't when um the house or maintain control of the house don't blame me and some people mocked importance out Trump's trying to avoid responsibility you know when clearly if a reporter if a voter turn against Republicans it's going to be a repudiation of Trump\nWhat the president meant was and I think last night as another great example of is it's not for my lack of effort don't\nTo me I Am going around and I am doing everything I can to rally support for people to uh you continue to enact\nThe vision the the agenda that was laid out in twenty sixteen when I ran for office I ran for office and said I Would do a B C D and all the way through dizzy and I am doing it but some of it I cannot do because of congressional obstruction\nAnd I'm doing everything I can to support that Congress and to make sure that we remove the obstructionists\nAnd that would mean the Democrats and we have to not only like I said hold on to hopefully grow\nIf it doesn't happen\nIf we lose the twenty three to to to twenty seven or thirty seats or whatever it is that is the average and this is what happens in the mid term election the opposite party of who's in the White House loses that number of seats in virtually every mid term election\nIn modern American history political history this would not be a repudiation of Trump it would be a direct\nUm you know following of of of historical tradition just in terms of voter norms\nIf she is able to buck those trends if he is able to stop that that wave from happening\nIt would be one of the most amazing accomplishments in modern political history\nIt just would he would be he would\nBe stopping something from happening which is expected of the minority party which is to gain that number of seats if you somehow heads at off not only should be given all of the praised in the world for his ability to uh to rally voters in the face of incessant negativity from the media about his own\nParty to keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history in the same way that he bucked up when he won the office of president and the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously are spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and tying it to the\nCaravan why and how [noise] quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of that care event [noise] he says we're going to stop it and he says we will have nothing that we will not used to stop that terrorists [noise]\nWe're gonna talk more about that as

got into the DNC servers because they couldn't see a simple fishing expedition in their own security systems but they got into the DNC servers in ... where the leaks get that information all\nThey got that from Russia we can't let outside foreign nations and foreign born individuals' impact in American elections and yet the people that screamed that about twenty sixteen are continuing to scream or excuse me a bigger part in our our well actually they continue to dream about that because why they support them other investigations so much\nBut now that we have literally evidence of foreign born individuals people from a foreign country trying to impact in American election by way of illegal immigrants being allowed to vote [laughter]\nIllegal voting suddenly they're silent on the issue that doesn't matter that's okay so the president or getting that message out there last night and also talking about I'm speaking of our our relationship around the world look\nWhile the Democrats continue to push for an advocate for open borders and essentially that is what they have done is they are calling for open borders we see it and we hear all of the time uh they're arguing that these people should be allowed to come to the United states because we are in should have been a grandson humanitarian this\nDoes the humanitarian concerns or be or the you know the model on the statue of liberty and so on and so forth [noise] ah they they simply won't open borders they want people to be able to come and go to the United states as they pleased turning it into a world a nation of global nation as opposed to one with sovereignty one that must be protected the president\nStated something last night that it's not going to play well with the people who hate him but the good news is these people already hate him so it doesn't matter what they say when he says this cut Thirteen\nAlways got to be\nTo do it fast and you know what's happening right now as a large group of people they caught a caravan [noise]\nEverybody that this man\nI think Democrats have something to do with it and I think we made a mistake because people are seeing how bad it is how pathetic it is they made a mistake\nSo that is an assault on our country [noise]\nAnd\nThen you'll have some very bad [noise] you have some very bad [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country and it's not\nSo the president went on to say that he is a nationalist he is not a global as we missed that part in that clip but he says he is a national is not a global as global is of course are concerned with the worldwide a care of people around the world as opposed to\nCaring for the people that you were voted to support and voted to ah to represent\nPresident made that very clear by the way very early on his presidency saying I wasn't voted president of the world as well as what the president of the United states and that's what I'm supposed to do is represent the interests of the people of the United states rather than the global is the gender advance by the likes of rock Obama\nHere's a hundred percent correct in that now as it pertains to stopping that caravan\nThis is very important I Want to make sure you understand this\nAnd and I know because you're a human's Hugh Hewitt audience the Hugh Hewitt listener you already know this is your intelligent or about the I Am a the immigration and nationality act or from Nineteen fifty two section to twelve effort is one of the most important\nA congressional powers granted to the executive of the country\nThis wasn't written for Donald Trump\nThis was written for the president whomever it may be was done in Nineteen fifty to\nThe president has vowed to send us many troops as necessary to the border to keep this caravan of migrants and they're not migrants their invaders marching under a foreign flag trying to cross the southern border eventually\nMarching under that foreign flag and demanding access to the United states that they do not deserve\nAnd the president says he will send as many troops is necessary to the border he is one hundred percent correct in doing this by way of two twelve F\nOf immigration and nationality act of Nineteen fifty two that means he doesn't need Congress he doesn't need a judge to sign off on this the president can stop this caravan in its tracks using military if need be because of the powers given by the Congress quote\nThis is to twelve F quote whenever the president signs that the entry of any aliens or any class\nOf aliens into the United states would be detrimental to the interests of the United states\nHe made by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem inappropriate\nI Want you to take that with you I Want you to share that with every one you know that language you may be familiar with again as I Know he was audience knows most of this but if you don't know this take that with you and share it with every leftist that you know\nIt doesn't say Congress gets to make those decisions it doesn't say a judge has to sign off on those decisions this Congress giving the executive under his own judgment the authority to make those decisions himself\nSo very very important for people to understand that we'll discuss it with David I'm ... will be joining us next block grants joining you live or from Cleveland, Ohio on the Hugh Hewitt ...\nThank you bought I Want to take a

hundred and five to zero one two three four specifically to answer this question\nTo what links do you believe the president of the United states should go in order to stop this caravan of thousands from coming to the United states using a bogus claim asylum which is all they have to do is use the right language and they've all been coached to know what that languages\nTo claim persecution or based on their race race or their ethnicity or their sexual orientation or whatever the case might be and then of course knowing\nThe outrage that was expressed by the left\nOne the last caravan came through in these people are made these claims were then held in families centers detention centers if you want to call them that housing centers some parents were separated from their kids kids kids can't be held in the same facilities with adults and all the nonsense that we saw\nBy the way even if we didn't want to use those now we can't because their full\nThese people are then going to be

those dollars to their families are waiting them over a are back in Honduras\nOr El Salvador Guatemala or Mexico or wherever it is that they're coming from\nThat's what their goal is you're still to

at what kind of what what kind of work were you in down there if I might ask\n[laughter] I was working for the DOD\nOkay fair enough I I was just trying to get a I was just wondering if you had a sense of\nThat forty six years of my life working in this country that's a good endangering their address it in your country\nYes it is I completely concur it is exactly that um however and I thank you for the phone call and thank you for your service to the D O D by the way Mark I'm\nHowever or a ... unless they're\nEntering this country or attempting to enter this country by force meaning using guns of their own or assaulting or committing violent acts I don't know that we can just turn around and start committing violent acts here's the reason I ask what you did down there I wondered\nIf somebody could give me an idea of what life is actually like in Honduras or I Believe it's probably every bit of what President Trump once described\nA much to the outrage of the left you know one of the black hole countries it's third world it's impoverished we understand that but that does not give people in those impoverished third world countries no right to just circumvent us immigration law violate our sovereignty and and pour into this country unabated it\nHappen we cannot be the world's dumping ground for all of the rest of the world's problems\nAs it pertains to asylum this part as important as well and I and and I want people to understand there's three basic requirements for asylum first and asylum out an applicant must establish that he or she fears persecution in their home country second they have to prove that they would be persecuted if they go back\nOn account of one of five protected grounds\nRace religion nationality political opinion or social group in other words a Honduran migrant or invader\nComing to the border of the United states after plowing through a Guatemala and plowing through Mexico and getting to our border they would have to say if I go back to Honduras they're going to persecute me on the base of my race weight your hunger and\nOn the base of my religion what religion are you that's going to be persecuted in Honduras my nationality again you're Honduran\nMy political opinion or my ... participation in a social group in third the applicant must establish that it's the government of Honduras than is persecuting you for said things\nNow we just heard from one of the migrant or our we've got one of the migrant caravan ah members in that piece that I played last hour from Fox and you heard what he's saying is that why you why do you want to come to the United states and you were when he said jobs we want to come to work\nWell that's that's not fleeing persecution which means when they go to the United states port of entry they're going to lie and say I'm being persecuted when the reality is they just want to come to the United states take jobs from Americans or from\nImmigrants to the United states and then repatriate the dollars they earn for those jobs back to their country\nThat cannot happen\nThat is a violation of American sovereignty there's no two ways about it let's go to Houston Lucas look yes you're on the Hugh Hewitt show where you at the rally last night in Houston\n\nWith my father in law and my family\nSo you know where that amazing that is fantastic and you told me something\nCan you give me an idea and I know you didn't call about this but I just have to ask you can you give me an idea of how many people how many thousands of people were still outside the bad menu a and could not get in but wanted to stay and cheering support the president and Senator Cruz\nNumbers wise I cannot say but I Know all of downtown where shut down because no cars could drive through because of the amount of people still outside trying to get in and just trying to celebrate freedom\nThe president's ah estimate from his team was around twenty five thousand people outside\nThe venue but your police chief down their heart Acevedo said ah maybe three thousand people\n[laughter] no I think it was probably more like ten to Fifteen I mean all all the roads were shut down all around ...\nI Know they they try to minimize the president's impact in fact they they do that all the time and I know or do something and it was a very very liberal a sheriff down there and ah I Know when he stands for but at any rate what'd you call about\nSo I mean I I'm a marine and I feel that just because of government our government says one thing doesn't mean that might be or be not best for the people I thought for this country I don't fight\nTo a sit back and watch our country being invaded we've already made\nCertain understanding that they're not being there not leaving on doors because of prosecution they're leaping because they want what we have we've fought for what we have and they're not ready to grab a gun and fight for what they want then they can sit back and kill them we can sit back and just do it needs to get done the problem today is is we don't drink a cold beer out of the death\nOf a skull of our enemy that we've fought we don't but\nDead bodies on a wall to let people know that you don't come in here\nWe are a great country and we're only great because we fought for it we didn't walk in someone else's country and take it\nAnd that's what they're doing they're not coming here because they need help they're coming here because they want what we have we need to stand up and fight for what we had before we all lose that\nJust because the government just because Trump or the Democrats or Republicans it doesn't matter or country of one we all need to stand up together as one and fight back not step back and just hope it got it doesn't affect us in our little town wherever we live\nTell me this marine how do you feel when you see these people marching under a Honduran flag\nI feel like we need to take a hog ward and just go down that road to take care of 'em real quick\n[laughter] thank you for your service to our country God Bless thank you Lucas ah that that would offend me as a member of the United states armed forces had I served more than anything else\nWe fought for our flag and these people are marching toward invade our country not carrying our flag so showing they want to be one of us carrying the Honduran flag saying they

with us Peter as a member of the United states commission on civil rights and we're talking about the migraine caravan though a gallery of it all the politics of it all and now the security of it all Peter\nThe president said in an interview on air force one yesterday there is no limit to the number of troops he's willing to send to the border to stop this caravan he repeated that last night it as a man in Houston for Ted Cruz he has the plan a re power\nTo deny any body admission to the United states as long as he deems it in the interest of the United states has has granted him by the uh immigration and nationality act of Nineteen fifty to\nThe question is this how far do you think he is willing to go and how far should he be willing to go in order to literally physically militarized that border with troops with tanks with James with whatever's in order to stop these migrants from getting to the port of entry where they can dust then make their asylum claims\n[noise] well I think he's willing to go as far as he can go under the law I have absolutely no doubt about Hughes motivation and his determination to do that as opposed to some other presidents\nHowever a there is a you know eat a certain conflict in terms of the law and it has been completely adjudicated as far as the terms of how far you can go it's got some historical perspective as to how far he can go\nBut although he's got the right I think you've just indicated and we discuss this ... asked\nTo deny classes of aliens entry into the United states and it's sort of critical light the means by which he does that is subject to dispute because he is constrained in terms of the use of the military domestically policy kind of taught us act\nNow there are some exceptions to that and hasn't been fully litigated as to the extent of the president's power in terms of using um [noise] uh troops to do that\nWith the president can do for example is he can ask the states to to you I'm a deploy the national guard you condense federalize the national guard troops but if you federalized with them again he comes up against the policy kind of taught us that now what they can do\nIs engaging non law enforcement activity that his act as a deterrent but they can't be seizing equipment or vehicles that can't stop and frisk can pursue individuals\nWrecked as law enforcement or you know a law enforcement capacity but there are at least some with maintained there are exceptions to that and let the president might have the ability\nTo have a two for quest that the national guard retain their state status and then there they may potentially use them in active use if uh it's deemed necessary to do so but there's there was a real gray area in terms of law now\nSetting that aside as to whether or not there was affected me by which refused federalize National Guard or army troops or even state National Guard troops to engage in the kind of interdiction activity\nThe presence of the army there or a troops there\nActs as a deterrent and as a back to back stuff now you may recall that earlier in the year the president said that he was going to send troops down there in support and to do and just typical assistance\nBorder patrol in others to engage in order\nFor something activities and I think that uh you know look he's got plenty of resorted to do that that's without question uh there was a real question as to whether or not you know some would say well the this so called ... and that's coming in who knows how large the by the time it reaches order is not really an invading force per se\nOr it doesn't have weapons but at what point does it become a threat to national security\nYou know many of us would argue its own radio threat to national security goes to several thousand that are a threat to national security it's Fifteen thousand what about if it was just local what we saw in Europe where it's and it was a thousands maybe a hundred thousand\nIf it's on the way it it's on the way by the way new Mexican news agencies now say that caravan is at fourteen thousand and it only started a short while ago went from two thousand uh fourteen thousand by the time it gets here you know several days from now because there's still a thousand miles away Pete where we are going to be in the tens of thousands\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered in reading for suspicious which could uh uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray area there but I think\nThat in the first instance because the United states as the commander in chief needs to do what's necessary to secure\nThe for the border that may not include teaching in law enforcement but a Detroit how are you going to is\nThat it is indeed that Peter thank you so much Peter personnel us commission on civil rights for joining us twenty seven minutes after the Auerbach brand sitting in for he went right back after\nPortions of the Hugh

we're loopholes our job is our guest he's the director of government relations for fair the federation for American immigration reform defined the loopholes that you want or Congress to come back from the campaign trail and come back and vote to close right now\nYeah for example we have our our credible fear standard what these people do is I think everybody can agree\nThat that these migrants coming up they're not refugees they're not ... their economic migrants listen if they're saying they're fleeing some violence in Honduras\nGuatemala or El Salvador and they cross into Mexico I think everybody can agree that Mexico is a safer environment than where they're coming from so you're automatically not a refugee anymore but what happens is when you come to our border\nYou come to a port of entry again this is why a border wall and itself cannot solve everything because you just ... they these people just go to a port of entry and they claim credible fear they say I have credible fear of returning to my homeland and that's their initial basis for an asylum claim\nAnd and we we approve those credible fear claims and math so when they say I claim credible fear\nThen they get an appointment before an immigration judge\nTo women I mean there are ... let me interrupt for a second to clarify something\nIt's it's my understanding that that credible fear has to be on the grounds of one of five protected grounds essentially race religion nationality political opinion or particular social group\nNone of these people are ... they're all on doors so we can't be rice or nationality is the religion I I unless they're claiming their Muslim and they're they're being discriminated against and largely Christian population which I don't know that they are political opinion or public particular social group they don't have\nAny book where you're writing mud on those grounds\nYou're right but but you remember just look how organized this caravan is these people are coached their coach they know exactly what to say when they get there\nTo fall under that credible fear determination and a lot of the times works you know these people are getting approved in large numbers they were approved and a lot larger numbers in the Obama administration but they still are and that's just the initial German determination\nSo they come in they get released into the interior of the country or asylum backlog is massive it's a I think it's around five hundred thousand sometimes it can take years for their claimed to be heard so they get released into the country in some cases they even get work permits employment author is\nSo that's what they want they know that can happen and a lotta times again they just disappear so Congress needs to tighten our credible fear standards and again with these family units in UA sees in our law right now\nUm Mexicans are the only people that can be promptly deported\nAgain Central Americans can't be promptly repatriated at the TV PR a loophole it's called our listener asylum system is is riddled with loopholes I mean those are the main pool factors for people to come here and as long as Congress just just sits on their hands that doesn't do anything these caravans will still\nCome and keep happening and again President Trump's talking about the border wall securing funding in December but a border wall will not do much good overall with this current crisis we have in less those loopholes are also close\nOr ... helped me out helped me understand this it was reported yesterday that are on Fox that the Mexican government has offered asylum to these people\nUm if that is the case we don't have to repatriate them back to Honduras or run a mile or El Salvador we can repeat your pay dripping back to Mexico there are no longer in fear of persecution from their governments\nIf we're not sending back them back to their governments were sending them to the country that well actually we're just saying stay in the country or in right now you have been granted am not asylum at amnesty by the Mexican government\nTherefore your claim of persecution by the under a government holds no water\nYeah I'm I'm I'm at we're not clear how it's exactly working out with what the Mexicans are doing in one in one instance I saw it as well that when they reached a certain area in Mexico Mexican authorities were right they're offering them an opportunity to claim asylum and then the care of and blue right past them\nAgain so it it's it's unclear kind of how that would be treated when they do get here but again as you mentioned\nYes these people are no the fact that they entered in a safe third country they entered into Mexico shows that they are no longer fleeing violence are not willing to stay right where they are in it we can all agree is markedly safer situation\nSo if that's the case then I mean how how do you why do we have to then go on through the process of allowing them into the United states or is that what you're calling for you know our job when you talk about let's bring everybody back in the campaign trail and vote on this and we if we if language does not exist in our laws that maybe that's why we need a ride and then if you know and granted\nIf you've been granted amnesty or asylum by a third party country here than your claim of asylum in the United states is no longer about\nRight now that's called a safe third country agreement again too and that that\nThat is something that needs to be that done with Mexico and it's something that but again those people have to be interacting with the Mexican authorities NAFTA actually interact with them rather than blowing past them and just continue on to our border I mean they have to they have to enter a process if you will but again\nThis is just something that Congress needs to rectify and I know President Trump is working his tail off on this issue and and and he wants to stop this caravan but again in ... in some areas the administration's hands are tied again you see what the travel ban it anything this administration does on immigration ending DACA other things like that\nThey get into these open borders groups for um shop they go find an activist judge who who doesn't who doesn't care about our sovereignty\nAnd then they get their ruling that they want the administration can't can't ... can't act\nOn on our national security it's simply ridiculous that's why Congress needs to act and if Democrats want to obstruct than they should do that in front of the American people and let them decide\nAre you familiar with the Merida Initiative and if so what what what good does it do to have this uh but not familiar with that I\nKnow it's ... it's also called plan Mexico a it's a security cooperation between the U.S Mexico and the countries of Central America in which they are all agree to essentially not allowed to have happened what's happening right now and uh obviously music is playing\nAnd I answered RJ next time around thank you so much for your time today RJ Holman is the director of government relations for federation of Americans for immigration reform ... she went back
