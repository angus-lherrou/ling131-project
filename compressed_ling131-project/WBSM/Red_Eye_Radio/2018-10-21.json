suggesting\nThat people will be punished for having children out of wedlock I'm not suggesting is preferable that a baby who was conceived out of wedlock be aborted\nOr dispensed with what I Am suggesting is that we get back to the idea that in this society there\nAre norms norms are worth preserving and one of the norms would be\nThat it is worthwhile\nFor people to come together to form a durable relationship and to raise a child in that context it the truth as a matter isn't you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating it is a common lie\nIs a misconception it's not just a misconception is a\nTotal distortion that most marriages or even half of marriages don't last anyway so you could get married before a baby and well then the baby ... now it's true not all marriages last but the majority do\nAnd particularly for four people today today people are getting married a much older age is an average American Woman\nNow has her first child woman who's going to have a child at age twenty seven that's still pretty young that's up from twenty two and Nineteen Seventy\nAnd one of the things that they're blaming for the out of wedlock birth rate is the fact that people spend longer in school but the ... the idea that you're getting married at age thirty or age thirty one or age thirty five or aged forty\nVets that doesn't mean that is not\nValuable for your future children to be in a committed long term and chances are permanent relationship\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the traditional progression of western life has been reversed says John ...\nWho teaches at Columbia University he says cohabiting partners are having children before getting married that's a long term trend across developing

uh you know that much richer show high\nOften a parent would die in the child would or maybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded and end up capture these tranche\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends of sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse that would help\nThat would uh specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parents situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government daycare centers\nI think over ... ... would be one way I think manners where you'd help you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay do I let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI yeah I Know you're going to hate the ... but uh I I I'm going to say the ... were cut defense spending because it's just it's just not not necessary and we should also raise taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd if you are going to say and I would that

Michael made that show\nBy Michael thanks for taking my call again you're there you go\nUm so I just want to say oh there's there's a difference of the impact of statements when it coming from different group\nBetter disparaging other groups I Would I mean as it has a history of white supremacy throughout the world for a long time ago in particular when you're looking at white versus black or white first do you have Germany you have the United states for different places where you know blacks were\nOver centuries in factories in generations um attacked in that way that hadn't been the case of a history of black supremacy on issues or on white people or something like that so there are different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it's obviously much more serious if somebody in public office say is that saying something that is negatively racist then if somebody like Lewis\nKind of saying it however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he'd received from David Duke because even though David Duke is a joke and a loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above\nA she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone who respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan because if you look at Farrakhan history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country\nThe idea that he should be on stage as he was at a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden ... Louis Farrakhan his old at this point\nAnd because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people and as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill but deserves some kind of sanction go ahead like yeah I\n... I understand that Michael can act that one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a black people who are you know very hatred of the mayor have full of of whites where it's coming from is there a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them at the people over time whereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever it was attacking people not because they did anything to them they made up conspiracy theories and made off that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians\nAnd the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also make knowledge or be wreck and so the Armenian people were a cruel to the Turks and they were undermining it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith or there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you ought to be shut down by the government but it means that

com bust you're going to want to move quickly on that\nUm [noise] a a quake\nDisagreeing tweet that came in says Michael this is from a Jeff\nAnd Jeff says Michael it was reported today that the budget deficit exploded Seventeen percent year over year do mostly to the Trump tax cuts the Jew so often preys on your show\nPerhaps you could comment on that instead of this ridiculous Elizabeth Warren side show very glad to comment on that uh let me just tell you that those people\nWho are saying that the reason for the budget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are partisan ... it's not true how do I know it's not true\nBecause revenues year over year at the same time that the budget deficit went up revenues went up they didn't go down the increase they increase slightly but ah my source for this is\nNot only government figures but the New York times and the Treasury Department the New York times\nThey um they report that as a matter of fact the\nTreasury reported that federal revenues rose buys zero point four percent\nFrom the two thousand and Seventeen fiscal year to the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year and uh they view that a treasury as a sign that the tax cuts are paying for themselves and the New York times takes issue with that\nThey say well the growth in revenues would have been even greater without the tax cuts okay they might be right to the growth in revenue would have been greater\nBoth in revenue is still growth in revenue we're taking in more money\nThe problem\nWe have is we are spending too much and I actually think President Trump did a good thing and advising the cabinet that he expects every federal department to cut at least five percent and the knowledge that we should do more let's go to on disagreement day Christine in Seattle you're on the Michael method show\nShallow Michael I'm I'm calling today because I just to be with your aunts and marijuana I'm I Am a survivor of\nYears and years domestic violence and um I\nBecause of that developed pie TST and\nI go to therapy I've been in therapy for about three years and\nThey recommended me to be on you know\nLike pharmaceutical drugs\nWas scared to do that and I didn't want to become reliance on it so it's a combination of therapy and smoking marijuana I Am recovering\nI'm I'm very happy for you and I'm Glad to hear it and marijuana is legal medical marijuana has been legal for a long time um but you said and you're right you didn't want to become dependent on some of the pharmaceutical drugs shouldn't you also be concerned about becoming dependent on marijuana\n... yes I actually am a gun that is a concern of mine um however I proven to myself I'm a numerous times that\nLike I'll go I'd I've gone through fans in the past ... years have no you and then I use a cage and all and then I can like turn it down\nThat OK early when I Do use I use it right before a therapy session so I agree\nAnd and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you ... the the basic position that I Would have on marijuana is simply that being dependent on anything\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times they have a advice column whole sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nAnd I was saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and they say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said at the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month as lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but the ideas looked life life has all kinds of challenges\nAnd sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go to a Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael method shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I'm\nMy disagreement today is that we all are to Saudi Arabia why um because it's carrying on hundreds of thousands of

from somewhere else\nThat's for sure absolutely they would they would first probably get them from China or Russia and a ... again what have we accomplished ... I Do I Believe that Saudi Arabia's a problematic country I think it's a corrupt and brutal autocracy it's a very problematic country\nBut do I believe that it would help the United states to completely alienate ourselves and end the working relationship with Saudi Arabia Thomas Friedman is a big liberal wrote a find peace in the New York times yesterday\nAnd that piece made the case that look we need reform and the whole Islamic world we need reform in the religion because the essence of what happened in September eleventh was not paying enough attention to the real threat of radicalized murderous a neo fascist\nOne of the one of the reasons I guess every once in a while as it's worth looking at some of these wonderful celebrity couples and I think the Davidson can be very funny and Ariana Grande is obviously very talented\nThey don't think either of them are thought leaders or are enormously season a or in depth commentators on the passing scene but I I only think that because I don't regularly read teens old\nAh [laughter] which says uh end poverty by ending you can end poverty without ending capitalism I mean well I'll I'll tell you can and pain love you can but it sure helps and pain when you get good relief factor or this came in from growing up and when she said\nIt might be alert as well or to your bedroom New Year's\nDay just forging damage I mean the whole floor and yard sales going on now with incredible deals lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin\nWould look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off three finished\nHardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nEach year nearly nine hundred thousand people in the U.S experience of blood blood new medically has drawn boosters which can cause a heart attack grumbling about stroke were sudden death from ... vt yet most people don't know much about this condition or how to prevent\nDr Gary rash GOP chairman of the world through most days during committee\nTrump also says the formation of potentially deadly blood clots in an artery or vein this can be dangerous because once formed the car can block normal blood flow or break loose and travel to an organ\nThe most common scenario is Venus from where I was ... or V.

I'm not making this up\nOr Salvadoran that's the hard way south wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also military veteran you think should

Democrats would have nodded in agreement that today is hate speech and he lost his job but tonight their losses are gaining Marsalis joins us now\nMy thanks for coming on the show um did I miss state that I mean did you have to leave your job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that I stand for the flag I knew what the cross loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which reminds me it was over a year ago that I hosted that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light try to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee so\nI I look I'm confused I'm I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time not a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like

happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that it is a personal matter and I can respect that ah however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from many of them\nThat's a shocking what is the saving you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if ah there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't
