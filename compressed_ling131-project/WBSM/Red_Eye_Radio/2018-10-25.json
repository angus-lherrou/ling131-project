they were suspicious now\nHillary Clinton has a has a I gather given credit\nTo ah their Secret Service detail\nOr would presumably they go through packages that the Clintons receive my guess is that the Obama Secret Service detailed does the same of why the others would have been suspicious I don't know\nThat that's a good question uh and and again it's not clear to me whether they they were open

condemnation of such activities I have yet to see any linkage between the AT T for groups that would be quote Clinton machine\nNor have I seen any linkage between this bombing attempt at the bottom

just bizarre were really motivated anecdotally we're\nWell I'm Glad to hear about the motivation on here's what I Would say in response to your your production of the blue wave is is just a made up media creation\nUm the reality of the situation is that historically the party that is not in power in the White House does gain a significant number of seats often times as many as twenty twenty five thirty seats in the next midterm election it has happened that way historically throughout you know a recent ... you know American uh uh uh elections mid term elections\nSo the idea that the Democrats are going to pick up a bunch of seats is not a myth based on history is a fact they are\nThe question is will it be enough to actually take the house back to take over control that is not absolutely not guaranteed um and and I'm not suggesting that it's guaranteed that the Republicans are going to hold on to it but I look at all of these ... nobody does this better than you\nAnd I say there's not too uh you know just a you know stuck up to the namesake of the show but but nobody is on top of these national races and where the battleground races are and which ones are the toss ups better than

added in\nBut when you narrow it down to the sixty\nOr Seventy closest races [noise]\nThe ones that are toss ups it is literally a toss up it is literally a toss up between the red in the blue

about his pride in the United states is pride in America first that he wants to put Americans first he said I I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris that's nationalism\nIt's it's it's anonymous quite frankly with patriotism and yet you hear that being ... you know I'm decried as being some sort of a dog whistle racism is on the silver\nDoesn't Joe Biden's sound awful nationalistic in this in this summit\nWe begin to tell the American stories about timing this or has a jet that hell and\n\n[noise]\nWe're number one where the United states of America unlike any

of the hour Seventy good morning\nMorning to you thank you for joining us okay so the story of the day seems to have more from the caravan at least for the time being anyway to what it means to be a nationalist the president of course declared the Houston rally\nThere he is not a global is to you as a nationalist and he was instantly seized upon as being a white Knight well asked anyway by Jim Acosta don't you mean white nationalist\nIs it possible to just be a nationalist meaning I care about Americans before I care about the concerns of the globe\nHere's the thing this is your son necessary or a great way to articulate that you're a patriot a patriot be someone who defends our nation or the value of our nation above all others in a perfect world could you say well that could mean a nationalist to win a perfect world you could\nBut we both know and we've heard from the lakes have extraordinary leaders like John McCain that's not a word we need to use it as a dog whistle at a time when we are seeing racism and xenophobia on the rise let's simply be better and not use that word\nWop wop wop while your organs if it is anonymous with patriot which I agree patriotism nationalism\nI said in a perfect world but we're not living in a perfect\nWell why don't we strive for world instead of playing to the fears and the and the and the racist the allegations of of people for political partisanship why don't we make our appropriate world\nBecause it's not like we're saying it's not like we're hearing from someone that has a high anti gets word who strives for ... for a perfect world is is a president who took him time after time and time again as he avoided a speaker saying that he didn't know David give\nThe president has already said in the last week up there are good people from the middle east on that caravan and you and I had those though is the dog whistling straight out of the gate since he came down the elevator at Trump Tower wait\nWait on wait a minute wait a minute this this is this the president said after he pulled out of the Paris climate accord I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of terrorists is that a dog whistle or an acknowledgement that my first duty and obligation is to the people of our country that is one of the dog was the old adage there's no loyalty to the to the people who elected them\nThat's not a dog whistle so I'm not saying\nIt was not saying everything is on a nationalist oh about ... people before the people of Paris or the people around the globe\nI'm not saying that what he said specifically about the Paris climate accord was a dog whistle but many many other things are including many sides speaking about Charlottesville word dog whistles\nThe president's Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to glow\nNot comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second\nA national is think about our country first in the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear that this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree\nGiven the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer if he was extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on the ... so we're going to agree to that ...\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know what is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that so I'm not confident and it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many things president has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable has been you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway\n... you know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or a nationalism in globalism in were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better take her out of the market\nIs that is not an economic nationalism but is that not economic nationalism is my question\nNot if you look at the way the president is conducting themselves that gives you the truth\nIs that an impact would engage in things like the PC to point out and partner with our allies that have attacked\nStephanie rural thank you for coming on your first year that she is on MSNBC Live at the top of the hour [noise]\n\n\nNon stop action packed

indifference to the loss of American lives in families who will never celebrate Christmas or birthdays weddings or grandchildren with their loved ones because Congress wants to play use immigration is a political football rather than doing the right thing and this if they're not going to act on\nYou know four thousand five thousand people marching toward our border\nIn defiance of our laws why are we why are we let allowing them to continue to sort of represent our interests because they're not\nYeah I completely agree Sharon Sharon Thomas Hodgson is our guest from Brazil county Massachusetts by the way you're you know the numbers recording I think our sadly outdated or\nYou know two days ago it was up to seven thousand Mexican news agencies were monitoring the ah that massive a caravan through their country are estimating the crowd now at fourteen thousand so\n... and they're still weeks away from ... thousand miles them not to go to get to our border it could be twenty you could be twenty five by then so here's what I Want to know from a law enforcement perspective share\nWhat do you and other law enforcement officers going to do when these people get here because they are coming in Congress where you're writing Congress will not do anything they're busy campaigning back in their districts they're not even at work or in the capital now\nSo they're not going to change anything which means when thousands and thousands of people come to our border and start claiming asylum as you well know we cannot detain them we don't have the facilities to detain them at the border\nPlus it's been decided that that's inhumane ah and we can't turn them away so they're going to be released with a promise that they'll come back I'm an honor their ... we know that eighty to Ninety percent of them don't so this this crowd I I'm sadly just accepting the fact\nOf now fourteen thousand which could be more is coming and they're going to come to Massachusetts they're going to come to where I sit in Ohio they are going to come all over this country\nAnd spread themselves out never to be seen again until of course uh sometimes it's too late then we see them for the wrong reasons\nWell yeah and and the thing that that is important to point out too is that in in uh\nBut just at that point just a second but it's also important to know that you ... you ... county right now the Colorado River leasing a hundred two hundred and fifty family units per day back into the community are taking the bus bus stops\nThe greyhound bus terminals ended up putting them on buses and not because ice wants to win but by law it can only hold them for twenty days once that happens they have to give them their court paper when they have to return\nThe court dates for example in Massachusetts for some of the arrested today on immigration charge\nAnd he's told the come back to court the court they start coming up to twenty twenty four where do you think they're going to be twenty twenty four\nAnd how we gonna find them that's one that you know I've talked to one person I think about the thousands that are coming in never mind the fourteen thousand right now that are supposed to be coming across each trying to come into our country so yeah we have to do some this is why this is this is an urgent situation and this is why can't believe Congress\nSits on their hands and it's more interested in their politics than they are and taking care of the public safety of the people in our communities and our national security I mean this is this is as bad as it gets in for Congress to to not see this\nIs a fundamental responsibility they have is to protect the citizens of our nation that's what governments fundamental responsibility so I've been talking to the sheriff's Bob across the country and we're talking on the phone with western shirts\nAnd talking about what are we what can we do I mean we're we've as you know we started that crowd funding page funding for the wall dot com I think we're over a hundred and thirty thousand right now we're getting ready we're working on a presentation to\nAh to um [noise] I ... I mean to a da chess or the first installment and then and then we hope that at that point when that happens we'll see the activity pick up across the country I actually had a guy like staff came in ... before I went to Washington last week and\nSaid look you've got to read this letter and it was from a gentleman in Ontario, Oregon I opened it up\nThere was a five dollar bill five one dollar bills with a note attached to it said please build a wall between the United states and Mexico\nAnd I see Iraq's the envelope and the five bills and the five dollar bill and I sent it to only sheriffs around the country that went with this to Washington from the thirty five states said listen\nThis gentleman represents the best of America he's maybe of modest means but he believes in some way that he can help you know joined with the sheriff's across this nation\nAnd fight to get this wall built which we've been asking for for Twenty years and um protect our neighborhoods because he sees as most Americans do our communities are getting worse and worse when it comes to the victimization by criminal illegal aliens\nAnd um and I said you know this not only does he represent the best of America that this represents why we a sheriff's now have to take over for what Congress has refused to do were elected by the exact same people that Congress are\nBut it's it's our time in history now to step up stand with our people and let's get this border security and lets you know fulfill our obligation and are promised to the people are in spite of what Congress is doing the work against us\nWhile it is extraordinarily important and I'm so glad to see people like you taking a leadership position because again we you know we we're gonna have to accept this I think the president's intentions of the best absolutely I think he you know his promise to put military at the border is is a great thing although it's nothing but show because they're not going to fire on people they're not going to physically\nYou you know a stop people with tanks and ... they're going to just be there for show as a backdrop\nBut at the end of the day if they come up and use the right coded language the code words that they've been coached to say when they get there as far as claiming asylum they're going to get a they're going to be given a you know a summons to come back and have that concern but it's going to take many months and as we know they're going to be here they're going to be\nI don't know if you saw Bob I'm going to solve this but it's important again for people to really understand what's going on and who's behind this\nSteve I'm obviously there are people in this country who are encouraging it or right before the midterms absolute part that if you look at the two thousand five or ... they were showing it to two thousand five tape on Obama said we cannot allow people just to come into this country uh and and violate our laws and\nAnd the way the president
