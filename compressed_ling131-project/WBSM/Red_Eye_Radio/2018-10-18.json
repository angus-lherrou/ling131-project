to me and they say they have been the victim of a sexual assault than I Am full of sympathy and I am saying I Hope very much that the person who did this is a apprehended than charged prosecuted them

politically incorrect limit us it was published by St Martin's press\nLooking at uh the circumstances of the Supreme Court today a we reached the point where you can look at almost any given issue and if you are a veteran Supreme Court watcher\nYou could pretty much call the outcome or within a vote because the court has become so completely illogical that there is a very bright predictability about how the human justice will vote on an issue do you think that's a good or bad\nIt's bad [laughter] each one\nAs we all should should be thinking quite independently and not\nA ideologically and not as part of our herd mentality of any kind that's the God given genius that we can be different and one of my sorrow says that the intellectual life with the academic life has turned into\nThe sound of one left hand clapping and no tolerance for diversity intellectual diversity there's a lot of desire to have ethnic and racial diversity but what about thinking to yourself\nWell why don't you that I don't think thinking for yourself is encouraged in fact I Would have to ask you as a person who would again but the drum legendary is a is a\nThrown about to do casually having these days but the the call you a legendary feminist leader would be accurate and now you've written this a politically incorrect feminist my guess is you've taken a fair amount of heat for this book\nWell I think I Will but I have written on the books and I've taken hates them I wrote the new anti Semitism when I saw the ethnic hatred of the Jewish people rising and coming to us from the left him from the Islamic world not merely from the white right wing neo Nazi world\nAnd I took heat and that I wrote a book called the death of the Senate is where I look at the failure of women's studies which became rapidly gender studies sexuality studies gay and lesbian studies but no women the women would disappear and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues what forgotten\nAnd our feminist knowledge was not systematically passed on to next generations and that's why the me too movement arose\nAs a way of reinventing the feminist we'll we\nIn the early Nineteen seventies and speak out on rape condemned it we worked on legislation we set up a rape crisis hotlines we changed how police handled it\nTo some great extent\nBut this was not born in the university's law was all work\nOn domestic a woman battering\nOr incest taught\nSexual harassment in Nineteen Seventy five Linda Farley coined the phrase and she published a book about it in Nineteen Seventy eight and then Catherine McKinnon did so in Nineteen Seventy nine I Will bet you a lot of money that\nThe women's studies majors at the ivy league college just don't know about this\nThat would be tragic if crew looking at the landscape it's out there today a in terms of the laws on the book and in terms of a fourth one of those those laws were is the biggest problem in terms of this whole issue of sexual harassment and assault the laws or the enforcement\nOh God that's a good question what we've seen for the last year and today is the one year anniversary of exposing Harvey Weinstein is the exposure

to dress up all the women in Pakistan or turkey or Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia expect what are they going to get\nThere and like I mean in many parts of the world and let's come out and seeing it in many parts of the world\nThe predominant viewpoint is all the we've just describe it is not a crime or even a problem the way it is women are as very or their property there to be treated bus we I mean and there are people who will\nNot only the ... were were ... with righteous indignation no yeah I Know I don't think there's any hope for people in those societies for the foreseeable future am I just a pessimist\nNo no I think you are real is but I think it's very important and\nVery powerful that women that means barefoot women and women with educations both are crying out to you have somebody like Malala Yousafzai also kind of Nobel Prize was shot in the head because she believed that girl should have an education was mentioned places\nWhere there is no hope and with the the ... is barbaric there the women are also rising that's interesting\nAre you in all encouraged by uh the steps however tempted than had been taken in Saudi Arabia which is allowing women to drive by and large standards they seem so so pathetic and yet and yet they are steps do ... are we consider them as meaningful progress\nIt's a step I worked in Nineteen Ninety with Saudi women who organized the first drive in\nAnd they were put under house arrest for a year\nAnd they lost their jobs\nNow there's a little something that's going on and in a society like that it has to come from the top you

... club does not make contact with that than he catches that ball\nIf you looked at it in super slow motion he had it lined up the jump was perfect his glove was open and then the ball hits the fans hand and the side of vets is closed glove\nIf he doesn't make contact with that than he's making that catch and that was the opinion of Joel West who made that call on the field and when you watch the replay that that theory is correct\nThe problem is with the wording of the rule there's no fan interference supposedly is\nThe fan does not reach over and if the player is jumping up into the crowd\nSo I think that it should not have been called ... so I have great that's would have made that catch so we want to me that catch if you didn't contact the fan but that's not fair to fence that's just him going into the crowd has his own risk neck so according to to west\nThere's no boundaries basically of a player can just go anywhere and hoarding go anywhere catch the ball anywhere getting out anywhere because ... is crazy how this is not a home run and for for mentally\nI quoted according to Joel West according to Joel West he felt that the fan reached over enough to impact ... beds for making that play\nBut I don't think that that is sitting matter that that is in it 'cause I don't think he reached over no it shouldn't matter because the rule is if the fan reaches over its interviewed on okay\nBut he didn't he didn't reach over we know we have to see and I watched it a few times I read it to\nThe problem is the problem is is that they didn't CBS didn't have that one side angle that would have ... that would have given it so they're not ... they're not seeing the angle that we see on TV\nNo no no they are but there was another camera that would've been definitive that's the one camera that's on the fence that's going straight down the line like imagine the fed imagine the fence is the goal line in football alright okay they have a camera that's on the line\nBut there was a security guard looking at the play and so that camera just\nSo that camera caught the security guards back it didn't you didn't see\nThe play now if you would've saw the play that angle would have given you the perfect view to see if the fan in fact reached over that imaginary line imagine is the goal line ... ... you would have seen the fans hand\nOver that line and then that spans of fairly new 'cause it's reaching into the field of play but dude even on the TV is version you can see\nThat the fan and reach over that yellow line\nI understand that I understand I'm just trying to tell you they couldn't and it it would we can see the angle that ... the ... what were the Nick\nThat's not their job is to look at it remember the ruling on the field was not a home run the ruling on the field was fan interference and so in order to overturn a call that is on the field it has to be definitive proof and there was none in the angles that they saw on the animals that we saw\nBecause you can watch those NGOs and you and I might agree on it but five other people might not agree on it but for one definitive look was obstructed they didn't have it that would have been the look that would have confirmed it a hundred percent either way\nBut that's it no run and that was the first and there are plenty of opportunities to win this game he's the national center you

exactly what happened and who made the decision\nYou know I read that it would require ten million dollars to reopen the line and I thought to myself that is next to nothing compared to the strategic

the ethics and I've seen is that it would take two billion in five years to restart the line but it just a question of what timeframe or would have some since you're making get the planted a production um I think I I tend to disagree although more planes will be better and obviously it's easy to go back and look at that two thousand nine decision with\nA lot of regret but we really need to do is we look through the prism of this long journey great power competition with China and the capabilities China is developing is we need to accelerate the beach Twenty one production in order to get range back into the air force\nAnd therefore reallocate some of the balance from fighters to bombers that's really the challenge is presented by China and rising great powers and so we need to get that range back ideally you could do a bit of both but you know resource constrained environment you have to make very difficult decisions like that\nRight now let's talk about what you wrote for real

I'm always walking around with guilt over things I did didn't do and I felt guilty after our discussion last week I didn't feel like an answer your question about\nWhere's the plan for three hundred fifty five ships and so I went and I started writing my thoughts on paper and talking to a a bunch of people because as you pointed out a three hundred and fifty five ships\nLeave was looking at your defense campaign promise to then candidate Trump and basically the vice president talk with you said stay tuned\nThere's more to follow a well I don't think that's acceptable right now the question is is a navy backtrack\nWe had a two thousand sixteenth force structure assessment that endorsed the three hundred and fifty five ship number now since then we've had a change in administration and the new defense strategy and in light of these changes that make sense that the navy wants to review the size and composition of its future fleet the problem however\nIs the way in which this was happening back in March the navy told us that they were planning on conducting a new force structure assessment than they renounced a forthcoming new assessment just last month do some time and twenty nine seeing\nWhat we don't really know is what they've been doing in the six months in between his announcement for why the new study won't be out until more than one year after the N.
