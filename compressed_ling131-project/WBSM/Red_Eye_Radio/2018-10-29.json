what did you make of that audio I'm sure you've seen the tape or Nancy Pelosi was also assaulted this weekend what do you make of this\n[noise] yet to what end what are these people think their goal is\nA ... right now there are so many people who are allowing their political passions to swallow up everything else in their lives\nThat they're thinking it's normal to just scream of people at a restaurant throw their food on the table there's not a question about whether or not your First Amendment rights allow you to protest they certainly do\nBut America starts with a fundamental assumptions about what the good life is and we don't think that power is the end power is a means to maintain order so that people can have dinnertime discussion and debate with family and friends that even people they don't agree with everything\nBut shut and people down in a restaurant and throwing their food on the floor or or doing what folks did diplomacy it I think we're headed to a dark

we've actually made it profitable and a path to celebrity\nTo be a jerk and yell and scream and people I don't know that the people as you say and thought three and four and five moves that because that's a path into stores ever increasing confrontation\nYeah well said I I I really do think we we have and we don't have a shared understanding across three hundred and twenty billion up out of the moment in which we're living both in media consumption and media maybe as a subset of technology more broadly I think the big tension and our moments that would be useful for us to reflect on it and a lot of why I wrote the book them\nIs the tension between ruthlessness and rudeness or the happiness literature is showing that something that you know sort of thoughtful people and give people who had grandparents than older wisdom in their life has probably known for millennia\nBut there are about four things that Dr happiness you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships\nYou have meaningful work and shared vocation and co workers and do you have a local worshipping community those four ingredients are basically what Dr whether or not you but they're happy that's all the all that stuff is about ... and our technology is allowing us to start to think of ourselves as completely ruthless\nAnd the way that we're consuming media and the way that we are thinking about political tribalism is a function of that sort of TMZ mindset your flag right there\nI'm sure you read David Brooks his column the rich white civil war last week based on the hidden tribes study and it is in fact not a problem of the center is a problem of the extremes on the left and right\nThat they constantly mode accountable abuse at each other but it's also one that is powered my anonymity and I'm Wondering senators asked what do you think of as a non um his comments and the tenor they bring to our politics\nYeah great great flags on both points first of all I think that the study of referring to hitting tribes is great every your listenership go read it\nI'm David Brooks peace in the New York times early last week was one of the mass summaries of it and one of the things that he says that so really it is when you take apart so these demographers and social scientists tried to look at America and figure out where are we on politics and so often we just think of it as right versus laughed\nBut there is another dimension which is intensity of thinking that politics should crowd out the rest of life\nOn the second or third most conservative voter and the U.S Senate but I'm a huge skeptical about the idea that you can put politics at the center of your life and actually live well and love your neighbor well and what what Brooks like was two of the seven tribes that are identified in that study hitting Dr\nTwo of the seventh that are most politically it at that or the eight percent on the far left that pay constant attention to politics that are rich and white\nAnd the six percent on the far right the pay constant attention to politics that are rich and white and eighty six percent of America is saying go away you people are weird politics is a means to an end so that I can coach little league and live in my local\nCity and the site yet that politics should crowd everything else out it's it's wrong or it's never been an American I yeah and right now a huge part of what we're going through um is that fourteen percent telling the eighty six percent you're weird that you want to live in communities eighty six percent or right\nAs America inches closer to

went out to ask white people what they thought about voter ID laws and on and on and on the east a white college kids start to voter ID laws were racist why because they thought black people were just

I just wanted to ask you a day at the outset you eat your piece was actually scary and sad\nAnd very honest how long how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I uh smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it so a long time\nHow do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm sober I can look back on some of the uh some behaviors when I was high and and realize that that pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having\nA public meltdowns even temper tantrums even uh getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also was a sleeping normally and and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time\nThinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume antibiotics as consumers with about trips I could take that revolve around marijuana and you know it just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while right\nNow I've been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still and you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I've I've published does got published ten bucks\nI had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for you know pretty much every English language publication ... except for the New Yorker you know it's it's not like I I was a um an on ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I I certainly would have a you know live my life took more integrity and and carried out my ah my business affairs with maybe more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nAnd how long how long have you been sober\nMy one year anniversary is November eleventh\nAnd what advantages do you see now the cheered non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of work to want to buy because\nIn some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I was you know I I wrote almost all my books I all the time and I came although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting high I think there'd be fewer of those but you know I it it it helped me come up with certain flights fancy indecent jokes\nAnd he was a creative stimulant in some ways\nBut uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative\nSince I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't there's not as much chaos and ... and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat that was happening when I was using marijuana so I'm not having those melt down that would characterize a sort of my my addiction cycle\nYeah one thing you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years did your wife never shared a urine says yeah them for a lead\nNo and in fact you know she was just the opposite no she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I was just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know because the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive than in some ways it's considered a health food um and so I\nJust you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family um\nYou obviously have the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me um maybe it should have you know they've always ducking behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym it's like you know take a hit like it'd be high wall was working out there that's not the signs of someone who is necessarily healthy but uh you", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "29"}
