what do you think\nI think that's too optimistic remember you and I've had these conversations off air oh yeah\nI'm not I'm not a\nAdvocate I tried to tell the truth yup\nAgree with you about Texas a tendency I think those races now on\nI think that North Dakota is definitely a Republican pick up\nI think it is tied in Missouri I think that Indiana could be competitive\nI Believe Montana will end up in the Democratic column\nI I didn't I didn't mention Montana that's going to take a lot more\nYeah and and the issue with Florida for your listeners is that the place that was destroyed\nWas the place that was the strongest Republican votes that there'll be fifty thousand is less Republicans voting because there are no places to vote to Arnold schools there is no electricity we are twelve days away from Thirteen Days away from the election they don't even have only place\nAnd they've got no place to go\nI read I was in Tampa last week and I read the governor's executive order on this and the one who wants to vote they will come and find you and let you vote by a mobile machine you got to look in just called the voter registration let me talk to you about um Martha excel in Arizona or because I think Christian cinema\nIs not fit the serve are based on what she said and Martha McSally first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to be close friends I just can't\nI Can't see that being any more than two points in either direction\nAnd I think that that one is is done yet I think that that by the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum and this caravan that's making its way to the border\nBelieve me in the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out efficient effective border security that his head democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona and that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there at the Newseum is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the caravan I ah it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nThe public looks that goes from says why do we have no control over our borders why is it still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting ah the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path\nTo legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants would so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of a barrier and genuine border security with the American people are saying is first fix the border then why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their own\nI Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nBoth actually my audience is very much beyond that my audiences pro fence and pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audience is reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree people who are in the country already we're not lawbreakers can stay but we want to double sided strong call fence with a road between that\nAnd I know my I I've been talking about this for Fifteen Years of my audience there you'll find other audiences that are harder line but my audience is very very smart very affluent very educated very a Christian\nVery faith ... people who do not want to punish anyone\nNow Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying\nAbout big farm and and you also it's also the other no my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma I Know the good that they do the drugs he developed everybody gets that but this pricing it's crazy what should a Republican say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if the pharmaceutical companies refuse to do it voluntarily the public does not want to invade\nBut they don't want Americans pay more than Canadian that if they will not lowered drug prices here as they've done in in other countries that Americans should be allowed to purchase drugs under FDA supervision 'cause nobody wants the the ... the poison\nAbout Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that won't change alone\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying\nBecause of the pursuit of profitability reminds you of conservatives do believe in the free market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged that's what you've got in this situation\nNo secretaries are of H H us has been a guest on my show a lot he's talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the ah new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about\nWill that feel the need or does more than that need to be done Frank lots\nMore than that needs to be done at least from a public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face low doesn't help it's actually finding a way that they will still be profitable\nBut that people will be able to afford the medications but they they want competition in the marketplace they want the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available at\nThe tired of all this money going into things other than research and development when they claim that all the money that they're spending is going into research and development they want integrity noticed them and they don't feel like they have it now\nOkay I Would like a very quick response to the bombs I Believe that the FBI when they have seven to eight or nine bombs are more new bumps being that I report it as we speak in lower Manhattan that there'll be able to find is sending them you can't give the FBI that much evidence without creating a trail unless\nIt's a hostile foreign nation using professionals which is I'm not roll that out what do you think these bombs represent ...\nI think they represent what's wrong with which horribly wrong with our system right now it's horribly wrong in our country right now most of your listeners I notice the optimist hopeful for the future they work hard they play by the rules\nAnd they become successful for their families and communities but there is an ugliness in this country\nAnd we have to address we have to acknowledge it and we have to address it\nTake you brag that people will die we'd have to address it and uh I'm Glad you've come back soon followed HBO and vice I have to address really factor dot Gov

underneath eventually going into the new deal and FDR and some things happened in the last couple of decades\nThat took that middle class that grew after World War two and sustained us allow people to buy a home a lot of kids to go to public school and it's been gradually diminishing the gap has been going greater and greater developed ... is less and less that gap is less important than the ability\nOn the mobility doesn't allow you to rise to the system then the whole democracy that depending on I think is under siege and assist serious as that and is manifesting itself now the symptoms of our polarization the symptoms of our\nYou know are terrible rhetoric right now in the course of the language it's just the cause really and we have to keep remembering and until the economy can have more equitable distribution of the natural wealth of the country to the people who are working for it and it's got to be clearly an underlying fire that's ready to be put in this lame at any moment\nAnd then I Believe a new era of trust busting is we're on the cusp of a new era trust boasting that could only be avoided it if\nThe tech titans distribute there not their money they get their money but distribute their jobs in places where there need that's why the Google going in Arbor such a great idea why hope\nAmazon goes to Columbus or Virginia or someplace that needs a lot of jobs let me turn to the end of leadership in turbulent times because it was there we find\nMaybe the best friends with since the current era and President Trump you write about wiccan TR FDR and LBJ the fame they craved the recognition\nBears little resemblance to today's cult of celebrity for these leaders the final measure of their achievements we'd be realized by the Supreme cue are\nVery mittens tune in during plays in communal memory before we talk about President Trump and that goal what is an enduring place in communal memory I think I Know where it is but you explain\nWhat I think what it means is that at a certain point when a leader goes into politics they go in perhaps for themselves at the start but at a certain point it gets transferred into an ambition for the greater good to accomplish something that will stand the test of time that normally means something that creates\nMore economic opportunity and a greater degree of social justice\nWe know when we look back at our leaders what happened during their era did people be able to share more in the country's\nGoods did people feel better at the end that something had happened in their lives that they had more opportunity it's not hard to figure it out or was there a war that was prosecuted that has to be one and that was what was your depression that has to be lifted off and the leaders will go into communal memory\nBy those who have great challenges to face that is what Abigail Adams said great necessities create great virtues but it's not always do that they are up to those challenges though sometimes they can go into memory in a very negative way I mean James Buchanan was the president when the country was falling apart and the Eighteen fifty and was\nOnly able to exacerbate the problems rather than hailed him and he goes down as one of the worst president history\nI'm not sure that um that Herbert Hoover was capable of his given his temperament of dealing with a depression is extraordinarily good man but how to fix ideology but he stays the same challenge that FDR was FDR goes down and communal memory as does Teddy Roosevelt and asked us Abraham Lincoln\nAnd even at that Lyndon Johnson having faced civil rights as a southerner and made his conviction that the civil rights bill it'd be his first priority the risky to\nThat memory of civil rights will go down even though the war in Vietnam will always be a scar on his legacy though it's not celebrities not doing what you want at that moment it's not just\nCampaigning it's really going forward and mobilizing the country toward tasks that will make the country and the people in the better it it's a big thing and and that's if that's your desire it somehow lift you above the daily struggle\nArguably the greatest leader Americans had in terms of the longest period of time would be like a leader of a ... D Day invasion we're sharing a NATO\nLeader of Columbia University of course eight years in the White House during a period of time when the Soviets reached parity with us from hydrogen bomb and we had to begin a recognition of the new world order with a nuclear age I could pull that off but I I don't really think has a place in our communal memory yet Doris Kearns Goodwin do you\nI think it's missing place I think there will be more biographies of Eisenhower\nI think the way he handles the presidency and the dignity that he brought to it and clearly the leadership he brought during World War two and two the beginnings of the Cold War I I think these leaders sometimes it takes a generation\nOr it takes a biography written about the person to put their whole life is you just did in in those moments in perspective not just but he did his presidency but what his whole life meant to be\nAn yeah I think he'll come up in the presidential historian polls they come up and down after a period of time and sometimes it's looking back on an era from the context of our own era of the relatively peaceful this of the Nineteen fifties I thanks so much that us now and we don't take it for granted\nThe way we might have what now that we've had a period of such perpetual war on our side similarly the looking back on Lyndon Johnson ability to deal with Congress get I've partisan support for nature legislation not great civil rights laws but Medicare PBS NPR headstart immigration reform\nImportantly bringing both Republicans and Democrats together and are broken political system that looks so much better what we took for granted Doris Kearns generation but I'd say I said how is it per se definitely ready for great leadership stuffy\nDoris Kearns Goodwin west question about leadership and turbulent times has to do with Donald Trump whose numbers are improving is change the Supreme Court is one of the third year battle for the Supreme Court military spending rebuild the economy was coming along but of course we're divided country and I'm just watching the news this morning was blaming\nTrump for the pipe bombed it cetera what do you see emerging which way as his reputation going to go based upon extrapolating the first two years in the next two and possibly six\nI think the main question will be is there a point in which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he hoped to do and that and try and he has to reach out to expand the base not just do the base and try and become the leader of all the people that is a huge transition that still has not taken place\nAnd the question will be yes people are feeling better about their jobs they may be feeling better and that's important they may be feeling better even about the confidence in the economy\nThey feel better as citizens right now they feel that the country is in a more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way they wake up every morning and they see something on television that they wished they weren't seeing\nThat sense of feeling good about being a citizen as a country on is another level I think of judging are you a better or worse off having been here for two years and simply the material goods that are at the bottom which absolutely important as well\nSo let's see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and if it leads into even more violence as we might be seeing potentially in these last couple of days and I think we have to get out of the standard for its leader leading us in a direction\nThat is helping us become a better country\nOr is or the discourse that he's not only responsible for but it is escalating under his watch and when he joined

love the Kavanaugh hearings were World War one of the saddest chapters in the history of this and that I think the behavior of Senate Democrats was a highly ah and I do think a lot a lot of Americans saw it in and and what really horrified because\nThey weren't endeavor and you have a fair process they weren't trying to find the troops that they they just wanted a partisan witch hunt and and they were willing to go into the gutter as they were willing to smear judge Kavanaugh smear his family by the way for the record I Am not Spartacus\nHuh [laughter] you know I don't know how you keep a straight face with us here in the center for the ...\nBut but that that's not right you got to have a sense of humor you gotta laugh I'm ... that that's part of I I actually think for Republicans it's important when the left as so angry so bitter so filled with hatred one of the things I urge conservatives all the time don't respond in kind\nWe should be happy warriors we should be joy for you and and and in part because the policies were fighting or they were low taxes low regulations it works we're seeing an economic boom throughout the throughout the country that is incredible and and so we
