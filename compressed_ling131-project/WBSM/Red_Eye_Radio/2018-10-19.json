I Can't help but wonder you know I you know all the comments that Donald right after he said there about how great he was a very smart man and all he could you welcome there anytime a well\nUm you know that being said don't really think that what would he have said can you got up there and told him what our or above holy was all this other stuff but he's still be a great man and you know\nWell I think we we I think we know our president well enough to know now that no the the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy uh compliments if he liked what you say and heavy complaints if you don't so no I I think this you've used fairly of Andrew drone question there David Noah obviously uh uh what was said had everything to do with what the the president had to say in response ah Charlie in Manhattan, Kansas and the good evening Charlie welcome\nSurge jumbo how're you doing I'm well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country uh ran into him all the time going back to your age maybe a little over ...\nPeople don't know how to critically thing I mean let somebody else to sink in for him in a ... one thing I heard that I saw it on the Internet today park sold it for ex President Carter was a great thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA fifth because the layout burst and they wait conducted himself and his performance ... in ah the hearings well you know he or I don't know Carter been there a court room with a capital than in all the decisions he made\nYou know using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges had been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context\nThat Kavanaugh wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so\nYeah I I can I must say I would Jimmy Carter in the category of ah\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just wanted to tell you listen to your show all the time on my way home from work and make far I'm actually calling from my car\nOn that I I think\nWhat the kind of a west and the cello slashed Gail and I'm an independent I'm not ...

just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how to how to vote I just think that um they just again they just have millions of followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well form an opinion based on what some celebrity says and and that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out of without question without question are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect you I listen to your show a lot and then again I think that\nI think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get the vote out there now\nThat ... in which case band that

we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control Dr Lisa gross cause a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it's going to be we're right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExactly and for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty third team there\nWas something they need to realize and that is the flu virus was a very sneaky thing that keeps changing honest\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change on flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season into the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nThis look back to last year than the uh what kind of the season was that\nYes so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's severe seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths\nUm we had one hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season\nAnd one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one\nUm all of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen\nBased on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and\nThose are the very youngest in the very oldest um those under five years of age particularly in his under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill\nAnd even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year um the two basic types if you want to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine\nShots are given with a needle generally and they um are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't multiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all confident to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ... one of the many things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season\nAnd that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nUm so the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take the flu or it'd be like every year we were told be sure to always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flew um and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended\nDenise and I are loving our new roof is nice knowing that the last
