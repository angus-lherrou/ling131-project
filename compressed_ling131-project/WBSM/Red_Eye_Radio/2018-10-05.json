Botox is there a light at the end of the Kavanaugh\nCONMEBOL well probably there are some indications that there's still a lot from answers in every regard we're all the undecided senators as it's fairly come down but uh the first vote on this coming to a procedural vote\nAnd then are there after perhaps they file a vote as early as Saturday an actual confirmation then that means that Kavanaugh it'd be sworn in ready to report to work Monday morning at about what the the new nine person Supreme Court\nOr we will see we do know following the release of the FBI report\nThat not not that it was really nice but then it was given to the senators and we're we're hearing basically that either you if you're a Republican you know that there's nothing that would support any of the charges against Kavanaugh on if you're a Democrat of course it's not nearly enough for the lot nearly\nExtends even I have a big long enough time to go into the ...\nYou said and uh so that that tells you a lot about what's in there because believe me if in fact it had the support of any of the charges against Kevin ... of the Democrats would have leaked every last bit of it and the trumpeter to to the the uh sky

Indiana good evening RG\nFind you know I I yeah\nBut after a mild heart and the newspaper ... that's ... ... to get in on a pool on the election results up air\nFigured that maybe in a couple of bucks out of the election at and it turns out nobody is giving any uh whatsoever on Mr ...\nThan it's Joe Donnelly for those who don't know he is the Democratic senator from Indiana and uh again that of course the state carried by heavily by by presidents\nUh that's that's interesting that that you couldn't even or even get a any takers on that I find that remarkable\nYeah usually if somebody else it is and I was out here about two weeks ago mhm\nAnd and I was deployed and of course the Republican candidates so it looks like a light on the edge of a Roach now I'd say uh\nWell it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of or these senators from from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nAs a fill in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly that I think that all she wants to a cabinet position in a democratic administration I I don't know I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue that seat in North Dakota\nAl thirty ... thirty cents a second clock they just did I understand\nUh it's vice it to say that uh that does not look good the Donnelly again not out of the question or a McCaskill in Missouri and not out of the question a right to be seen more to come at one eight six six by boat jumbo in a moment\nOr\nThe ... the vice president of the United states however they lose two then it becomes fifty one to forty nine against Kavanaugh there is no tie breaker and Kevin on loses so I I have heard that that also said\nNo they cannot lose two you're you're absolutely correct ... their stupidity here but it's not yours Steve\nThat will do the age break uh at at uh the half hour\nWell again the we don't provide the news on the half hour those come ...\nI'm not saying that but you but I learned today that they were in the wall and because of a wedding\nOr for that like that\nYou know a lot more closer [laughter] [noise] uh we didn't need to lose ... on you know for for any reason uh I mean I I guess I can understand them playing ... or\n... or something of it is important I think I Would say that my daughter I Hope you understand as the daughter of a senator the importance of this the voters come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say just what you just said and and my answer would be no\nNo this is more important I mean it's not like your your daughter is not going to get married later getting married tomorrow or are in this case if you're talking about ... to get married Sunday\nUh he does say that he will attend the his daughter's wedding in Montana and uh uh\nI don't know this is interesting thing right here that there's been an unusual late night phone call in which a senator Danes of Montana Heidi Heitkamp colleague call Kavanaugh and personally a short and that he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed\nSo uh for whatever that's worth a I I guess he's found a way around this\nSo that that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised cabinet if he needed he will be there so again a law that makes me feel better and asked me feel a lot better too I got to tell you Steve a I had been bothered about that and I just reject ah ah the wires here and uh\nThe GOP could hold the session open bar they overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be\nA a whether or not the the cabin uh uh uh\nUh whether or not Dave's promised to cabinet means he would appear for hypothetical Sunday's vote is not clear but the GOP can hold the session open overnight\nOr that could happen so technically uh in the Senate parlance that would mean that a Saturday would be a Sunday will be redefined the Saturday or they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a\nIt is fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee you that is what the Republicans will do and then the Danes will fly and quickly making a fifty fifty tie and then Pence would cast a tie breaker so that clarifies that for me I I had been the\nMost curious as to how how that could happen and apparently that's that's the circumstance that day ... of of Montana will be there for Kavanaugh if needed we'll be back in just a

then I second guessed myself and I thought well I'll let you and your listeners decide for themselves but I like a guy named Alex Jones\nAnd I find is a news coverage on certain things to be a pretty

CIA out a little out so\nWell as other family members that worked there too and\n... what's the guy doing working in Palo Alto since the CIA is a cast with overseas activities only\nUm but again this is this is just a rumor and ah yeah um yeah I I don't know how to Tibet it on my on my own but the the story was sort of an expose a of sorts that uh explained that\nWhat she does as a as a job description ... is not a memory induction\nAnd that there's ongoing research as to basically hotter plant memories in such a way that you can plant and memories essentially\nWell I don't know exactly how that would be considered a a CIA function uh and uh again I think that this is branched over so deeply into the realm\nOf ah [noise] ah well\nI'll just say it idle speculation\nI'm not aware of any any CIA connection to the doctor for does head and I'm not even sure how that would necessarily be relevant to this story so it's a assuming that for a second but she did work for the CIA would
