well you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seem to provide 'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which where they say that ah the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some\nReally pay their full freight um and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure um suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price [noise]\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be one of the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return\nWas four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage that's twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later\nThere's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes\nAnd I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars will have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say\nThat they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate and so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invested in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was when it was given\nRead before you came on I talked about the ah\nAh Joseph a

like this also\nOr in the u._k. and most women we interviewed a by this piece put up by the wall Street Journal started was condescending it'd be market\nWhere here at the famous Christie's auction house in London\nTo celebrate the financial needs one hundred women I'll pick the one hundred most influential women working in European financial markets we put up with a woman to Austin what they think about proposals to impose quotas for female board representation I think misguided if I'm honest I think ... or a last resort very\nHeavy stick and it's much better that companies engaging targets and proactive policies the downsides of ... it's called back to focus on constructive proactive spent his instead\nI think they can be unintended consequences of quote is because the problem is you select one particular population within the workplace\nAnd then it makes it that population they may not appreciate it but ... says everybody know selected\nThat can be a reaction which is quite negative so you get people appointed interim physician and the question is always did they get that because of the quota or on their own merits and that's a bit of a button for anybody to do with\n... and so I've been working with the fact that you could think up for the last to Eighteen months then we're very excited to play so I think something needs to be done about when it falls on women's throughout organizations through the lights on we think that needs to be done in ... fitness is needing to issue as opposed to having it and put his just when\nI was like ... coming from Europe I think we're in a strange situation at the moment Web Brussels I deciding that they actually think I have full move closer wet companies would be fined and sanctions if they didn't have at least forty percent of that boys as women\nUm it's a very strange place to be in because not all companies are the same and the oil companies are able to move to that situation anytime soon\nAnd so I we need to have a great concern that we're talking about legislation rather than a natural evolution two wars more gender balance on board\nIs critical we do get gender violence over time but they're on getting stuck incentives by stepping companies might take a little longer to get that in certain areas that are left within maybe so actually qualified to take on that role in certain sectors but that said to me to say that we should stop\nThat we should encourage people to get on with that but I don't think legislation is the way to go at this point in time I think it\nProbably send the right signal a new order that we actually get\nPrecious that down the organization the only place because we can make a difference at this point in time is out there very far and then culturally that should actually help all the way down the organization of course they need to grow the base of a strong capable women who were actually able to work their way through organization quickly and unofficial\nEfficiently and effectively but\nIn all honesty we do need a pressure from the board done so that we had bought them up on the top down approach I think that could be the most helpful way we can actually get that but we could maybe look at different\nTools that people so we don't look to the usual suspects to actually fill these positions and that should have put in more like a pool so we find talented women no matter where they might be\nAnd the question of quotas I must say that um it's a controversial one because I've been out there trying to make progress especially in the natural services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress a little bit now more most recently\nBut that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quotas you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and\nAnd the representation and so as a result I I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas but what I Do think we need which is sort of what we're seeing here in the ... and not because if there isn't some type of the pressure\nWith the perception that there are consequences on the back and you know I think the excuses for inaction running so it's really incumbent upon us too I think what that little bit of pressure keeping a spotlight on the issue is a type of thing that hopefully\nIn that light light people feel that the needs a new and then once you actually start to get a more balanced representation shift a little bit you get to the tipping point and that becomes organic and it's also

of due process that have stood the test of time\nLike the presumption of innocence for at risk here\nI turned to a strategic voice in the Senate that senator Joni Ernst of Iowa\nWhat have you been hearing well I Am hearing of course a mixture of that cause I get at the office a lot of them are\nAre saying get Kavanaugh armed and then there are others that um are you know adamantly oppose way the those folks on the TV all the time um but what I Do hear when I'm Out in about ... people just can't understand why we haven't moved on with uh\nYou haven't confirmed they understand that he has the right to um credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done soon\nI Want to review a few things with you about the testimony\nFirst of all there was a story and political that she had a fear of one which is why that had to be the way it should never actually said better so but that was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers\nHer former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she some earlier with polygraph said never discuss sexual assault\nThere was a new real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows that was not about claustrophobia but a second entrance for an office there wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the ritual Mitchell Report\nI simply do not believe that that testimony could not Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I'd do\nHonestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point or do I sure do I I I think most folks would agree with that however um even the witnesses that she called forward actually uh\nCan't corroborate or simply hair down that that testimony that she gave about\nUm uh some party that she had attended so unfortunately for her I don't\nFind that to be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma but I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me telling the fourteen year old will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people are not stood up\nTo ... to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is but none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse is allegation was libel was slanderous and immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\nWell I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put\nThrough um the the worst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and and discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we'd have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up\nBe nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it's simply takes an accusation and unproven accusation which can put a family literally through hell\nJust look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance it is about what can we stop and put in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way to stop\nThem from doing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and\nKnow thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop us at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it is a stopping the tax cuts in JOBS Act what ever it is\nThey try and delay delay resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that for\nThe disheartening spread over the place in the United States Senate\nVery good news came out of mid week\nThe new trade deal was filing signed with Canada several weeks following assigning with Mexico it's the United states Mexico Canada agreement for us MCA\nUs MCA will replace NAFTA which dates back to the mid nineties Larry Elder joined us even more of the Heritage Foundation will pick up their interview with more\nThan a huge victory for Donald Trump I mean we've got a new NAFTA modernize NAFTA by the way I\nI always thought now there was a pretty good thing I mean it unified our North American continent or Canada Mexico and the United states and but\nIt needed to be modernized there were a lot of things in the ... that were out of date and were unfair and you know Trump had a big victory here first she got Mexico to sign on and then he's you know tighten the screws on Canada and they made some real concessions here Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make\nAnd now they're such a Trump very nicely\nPut negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come hopefully with China because they they are the worst abusers of the trade laws on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump had his press conference in one of the points he made\nHis he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the tactic but boy is it working because these countries are reducing their Tara\nSteven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries\nAnd the University of Chicago survey of top economists sound Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI Do it you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped pass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety three Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to
