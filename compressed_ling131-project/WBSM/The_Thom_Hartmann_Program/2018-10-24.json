Lehrer I Am saying is\nOne of the other thing I have to make sure you're doing both out before you invest in you make sure the oldest working but I think you know both can be done in large\nThank you for that question we're safe here are the audience either on there I'll drop and sort of course I guess recurring theme that we're getting a little bit for however have enjoyed a renaissance in inner city like an arts programs and then he's like a hot air and performing arts center\nI'm such a program called about because of public investment for the federal government and these sorts of programs and and the arts\nAnd I think the national Institute the arts is important my wife and I actually own a performing arts school in the town of hands and um my wife and I met in New York City she had just done a Broadway show when we met on a blind date and um we ended up going to LA for a few years to see if she could do TV and film so we love the arts I actually uh helped her both\nIn the studio that we have had now for Seventeen years\nUm we put our life savings into it we\nWorked really hard to build it up six years ago we were able to build a new building in our in the town of Hansen to specifically be dedicated to teaching dance and acting and boy so we're certainly advocates for the arts and we certainly support the arts as well I Know Eighteen million dollars in Massachusetts is spent on the cultural council to make sure that there are grants\nAround the state I think that's wonderful and of course I've been supportive of that as a state legislator I look\nForward to continuing to support the yards across the state and of all the great things that are happening here in Bedford is well\nThank you I question is I'm about education additives support expanding charter schools in urban gateway city districts and why and how would you support funding for public education um in general and create a holiday of opportunity\nOf course I'm I Am a supporter of charter schools but I also believe that there should be a cap and you know we've had a uh raising the cap you know not too long ago I Do see that um it is tough to see funds diverted from public schools when I first ran for office I was on the Finance Committee in the town of Whitman and that\nWas specifically the liaison to the Whitman Hansen regional school and I was seeing how the state wasn't fully committed to funding some of the things we needed transportation uh reimbursements\nAre obviously healthcare costs for teachers at the time was going through the roof and special needs education was also something that was very difficult of the state representative I'd feed it to when my seat was vice chair of education he voted to adopt Common Core with zero hearings I thought that was a step back for\nMassachusetts education I just eat charter schools has a chance for someone to um have a choice in education beyond their ZIP Code\nAnd I also think that green competition in the marketplace is not always such a bad thing um if charter schools create a situation where maybe better practices are are instituted that might help our public schools but at the same time the biggest problem I think in Massachusetts has been the inability or\nIndecision of moving forward to revamp chapter Seventy education funds\nI have signed on year after year to legislation to try to get the chapter Seventy funding formula change so that we don't have vocational schools poaching from school districts because you know what ends up happening is you've got vocational schools that pulled from the regular school district and the costs were vocational school is you know sometimes four thousand dollars more that regional school\nOr district school has to end up making the difference\nI think we need to break apart how the funding is happening for all the different uh\nDivisions of schools here in Massachusetts in ...\nUnder Seventy to be more fair and equitable to cities like New Bedford\nAre being really great I mean I hate it I think it's great to follow up on anything I can you talk about the way it is the federal government and how many they're very like folks\nActually because we're looking at what the federal government should be I'm\nSure well I mean again this gets back to you know my bigger view of creating an efficient and transparent government something that I strive to do when I first ran for the state legislature um again the two thousand fourteen valid question on the gas tax was a lot about the fact that\nThe legislature was going to have a gas tax go up automatically without a vote you know you're supposed to have a representative vote and it was no accountability for the department that was receiving the money and then the uh uh two thousand Fifteen pushing back on the Olympics\nI just wanted to make sure the taxpayer money was getting spent where it was supposed to be spent and to me\nTransportation education helping our veterans um those are some of the key areas that we should be focusing on education specifically now down in the federal government I think the same thing can happen I think we need to be more efficient with where our dollars being spent federally so that we can redirect it back\nTo our states in a way that um they can use it in space was specifically where they needed in education um again part of this is also making sure that we have an economy it's finally starting to help the citizens of our country and Massachusetts\nBy having the uh the economy in a situation we're in out with a four point one percent GDP we're seeing 'em\nPayroll taxes now refueling Medicaid refill Medicare and making sure that people um you know have the the money for health care have the money for retirement\nAnd uh that's a good thing and then my opponent wants to undo tax reform ah she's voted to repeal it she has a whole different vision of for taxes she talked about individuals being taxed at a rate of fifty percent or more a look I think that when government is run efficiently\nIt's able to provide back to the states those monies needed to find what we need whether it's south coast grill or whether it's making sure our public schools actually have the dollars to give our teachers the raises they deserve\nThank you for the next question here is if God had gained control of the house and Senate um impeachment maybe on the table which is a part of\nKnow first of all my anticipation is that the Senate remains job of Republicans I think the house may or may not go to Democrats this is\nThe real problem with Washington is we're not talking about issues that help our country that move us forward we are talking about trying to basically prevent an administration from doing what they promised to do a\nGreat a secure border have a better economy help the veterans who served our country\nAnd look at what's happening internationally we're seeing countries that were threatening our our allies around the world North Korea finally actually meeting with South Korea thinking about actually hosting an Olympics although I don't recommend the cost in it um but we are seeing a you know regions like um\nIran and the sanctions actually having an effect because you don't see terrorism on the scale we were seeing it just a few years ago\nUh we're having a successful administration as far as international relations renegotiated trade deals like the European Union just came around now uh Mexico and Canada have read negotiating trade deals in favor of the United states these things are good things happening why we need to go backwards and try to\nMeyer ...
