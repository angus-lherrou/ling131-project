Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deal so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually help now you're helped pass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety three Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nIs that it could be improved sent me this is the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a we have a a a a a a new a free trade agreement it's now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries or it has modernized you give us Americans a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so very it got me out in that one that's not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of out of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan\nI show I'm going to agree with you on that one so\nOn par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers a for a candidate has imposed against us and lower ... and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just otherwise it's just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we've talked about this on your show the war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we use\nComputer software we patent sin copyrights and and the technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some in and certainly trying on and many other countries and Asian countries they just steal or an actual property and this new I'm now ... very strongly that this new\nUh I'll call it the U.S a CNA has much better protections for not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them\nEven more is my guest he served as a ton of economic advisor to President Trump between sixteen campaign Steven you recall President Obama famously saying these jobs aren't coming back what magic wand as the president have what do you think people who felt that way feel right now about this deal\nWell first of all you know what what Obama was referring to as you said you know he can't get us to four percent economic growth and they can't bring manufacturing jobs in construction stacked with his country and he kept bring coal jobs back and maybe\nMaybe not a truck that was that um I have a magic wand because we do\nWe do have are just since the election one million additional construction manufacturing and mining jobs and this happened Larry because of the things you talk about every night on your show we lower the burden of taxation we lower the burden of regulation\nWe allow companies to do their thing and got something off the back of our businesses and you know the twenty seven million small businessmen and women in this country\nRespond to that and they are hiring more people\nI don't know if you saw the news today that uh\nThat uh one of the major um\nAmazon I Believe it was the release their wages to Fifteen dollars an hour I I don't want the government to tell companies to do that but they're doing it because it's a tight labor market the economy is booming it's hard to get workers uh this is exactly what we tried to do when we put this plan together Larry Kudlow and I for Donald Trump two years ago\nStephen Morris my guess he's an economist even take the last minute and talk to us about about debt and about the economists programs even Obama said we're on automatic pilot or this president has done a lot of things we talked about the tax cuts the regulatory relief he's also spent money especially on defense into our debt has increased are you worried about that\nWell you shouldn't be but I'll tell you one statistic though you know because the economy is doing so well now I mean you know we've had two straight quarter is now ... percent growth I mean Obama never got us you know the last year he was present at one
