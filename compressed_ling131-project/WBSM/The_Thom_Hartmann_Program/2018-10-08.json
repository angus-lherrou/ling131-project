every time I hear you speak Larry nice though judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed and go ahead and continue the FBI investigation there's nothing to stop it\nBut it to the bottom of it I think that should start with a rating of the offices of all the lawyers involved too as well as the accused and take their\nPersonal cell phones and computers and everything else and as well I have five signs personal home and I'll take Aleppo object to that because they want to get to the bottom of this and to the truth and they were they were so we fall when President Trump's personal lawyer got raided

I'm honest I think Clinton's or a last resort that very heavy stick and much back to the company's engaging tall get some proactive policy and\nThe downsides of coaches authentic Mexican it's fall back to focus on construct to proactive stretched and instead I think they can be unintended consequences of protest because the problem is you select one particular population within the workplace\nAnd then that makes it that population they may not appreciate it but ... says everybody know connected\nThat can be a reaction which is quite negative so you get people have pointed interest efficient and the question is always did they get that because the quota or on their own merits and that's a bit of a button for anybody to do with\n... and so I've been working with the fact that you could think up to the law to Eighteen months and we're very excited to place and we think something needs to be done and I found when it falls on women's throughout organization street lights on we think that needs to be done in ... fitness is leading the issue as opposed to having it and put his home\nThe crisis coming from Europe [noise] but I think we're in a strange situation at the moment Web Brussels I deciding that they actually think I pull\nMove closer to where companies would be fined and sanctioned if they didn't have at least forty percent of that boards equipment and um it's a very strange place to be in because not all companies are the same and the oil companies are able to move to that situation\nAnytime soon and so I we need to have a great concern that we're talking about legislation rather than ... evolution two wars more gender violence on board is critical we do get gender violence over time but they're on the getting stuck incentives like seven companies might take a little longer to get that in certain areas\nThat are left women maybe so actually qualified to take on that role and sudden sectors but\nThat doesn't mean to say that we should stop that we should encourage people to get on with that but I don't think legislation is the way to go at this point in time I think it probably send the right signal a new order that we actually get precious that down the organization the only place because we can make a difference\nAt this point in time is out there very far and\nThen culturally that should actually help all the way down the organization of course the need to grow the base of a strong capable women who were actually able to work their way through organization quickly and unofficial efficiently and effectively but in all honesty we do need a pressure from the board done\nSo that we had bought them up on the top down approach I think that's going to be the most helpful way we can actually get that but we could maybe look at different tools that people so we don't look to the usual suspects to actually fill these positions and that should have put a more diverse pool so we find talented women no matter where they might be\nAnd the question of quotas I must say that um it's a controversial one because I've been out there trying to make progress and especially in the natural services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress\nLittle bit now more than most recently but that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quotas you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender representation and so as a result I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas but what I Do think\nWe need which is sort of what we're seeing here the pay is a notch\nBecause if there isn't some type of the pressure with the perception of their consequences on the back and\nYou know I think the excuse for inaction running so\nIt's really incumbent upon us too I think with a little bit of pressure keeping the spotlight on the issue is a type of thing that hopefully in that white light people feel that the need to move and then once you actually start to get a more balanced representation just a little bit you get to a tipping point and then it becomes organic and it's also selling so I Hope that that's\nIs that
