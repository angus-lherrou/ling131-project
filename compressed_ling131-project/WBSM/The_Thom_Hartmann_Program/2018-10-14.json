perfectly defensible but some idiot is now calling him a racist because of that we're going to talk about that later on now Mitch McConnell who's often beleaguered I've always liked Mitch McConnell I thought he was like he's a very crafty um navigator of legislation\nHe's the one who held up the Merrick Garland nomination er and he's been helping the president gets through more appellate court

or something I Know a good dog before they enter the ear and out of the way you either later\nDon't always sought after may ...\nSolution between the house and Senate and I\nExpect that we will get a

cooperation\nWe're past too overwhelming about by overwhelming margins to build just last week in the middle of the Kavanaugh a dispute on opioids a and a five year extension of FAA we've also don't appropriations better on a bipartisan basis and anytime ... so the notion that\nThe Senate if somehow broken over this was simply an awkward prime\nMinister later those things have happened but this is a different order and Democrats are pointing not only is the way this was handled by in the history of partisanship on the Supreme Court your decision to block Merrick Garland a is something they see is that as having kicked off a new stage in the partisanship associated with Supreme Court nominees\n'cause I don't know much history you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time a Senate controlled by a different party\nFrom the president confirmed a Supreme Court justice to a vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election\nThey also conveniently forgotten to Joe Biden said or Nineteen Ninety two when he was chairman of the judiciary committee's Democrats control the Senate Republican in the\nWhite House if a vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it also conveniently forgot that Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid Eighteen months before the end of Bush forty three set up a Supreme Court vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it\nWith either ... right but Mr later I don't think that's right and Nineteen fifty six Eisenhower nominated Brennan the data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the Biden Rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked and he said to not have the nomination come up before the election but that it could come up after\nThe election and so and Democrats saying when they hear you doing this as they say he's creating new rules to actually do what he wants to do and as you've written in your book the long game when you do that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly a thought at all what happened John you're you're completely misconstrue and what happened what I gave us the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot of time on this
