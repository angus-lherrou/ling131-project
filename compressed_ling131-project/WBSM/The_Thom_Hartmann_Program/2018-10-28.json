from night storm what a great story [noise] it's amazing I had a question I Believe we have the technology for financial institutions to prevent personal fund\nFrom being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras Guatemala\nAnd I'm Wondering if that doesn't make sense\nOf the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy to stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have a technology to do it the question is whether or not or it would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do or if he were to somehow try to stop remittances uh\nRemittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nBecause I Believe they're a second largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nUh if President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras Guatemala it'll simply make conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument of ... of Mexico his at Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances even if you could do it legally\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks for the idea of you know look into it tight is in San Antonio Texas tired during the Mariel to show\n[noise] Larry love your show man thank you so much thank you um so\nYeah that that testimony from that gentleman a fantastic when that as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the things I've understood\nIs that the Democratic party at quite an absolute stranglehold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of loophole is going to take the black community then I'm On my team to get out of their themselves and so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller ask you how many legal immigrants are accepted into this country um and I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation it so that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country and at this point in our\nHistory we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven no\nIf you if you estimate our population\nYou know you and do that math that comes up almost ... percent of our population legal immigration mhm\nSo you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know presidency for a Republican administration and and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has that when the policy for anybody who enters the country illegally ... my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a ... and the willingness to help you you said that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm just protecting them or whatever they're doing now is is that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\nI get back so I'm like I have the kind of keep on them no doubt [laughter]\n...
