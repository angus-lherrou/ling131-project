because they're not as effective outside as they are inside ravens are really tough defense I think they did okay slow you down Drew Brees to me the story of this game and really one of the stories of the season the ... hills so much it's really confusing\nFor looking for those who don't know tastes them hell is giving ... because he is a niche player\nYet so he's the former BYU quarterback who was ... I I think it was the third quarter back in New Orleans and they use him as sort of I don't know how you describe it like a Tim ... power back in a wild cat if its third and fourth they're more likely to bring it tastes in hell and say run over a couple of guys\nYeah he's built like a kind of like a full back with a good arm and he he can do anything he's got speed to they used my kickoff returns punt returns that use them in the ... he's you know they're calling the Swiss army knife but he's not Swiss in any way\nThere's a rumor that he could run for two that seems ridiculous because he would he would like to thirty five I don't think that's a human lead possible combination but this uh this is to say hold on big big wins I think the ravens are really good team\nBut the ravens a driving right now they could send it over time will keep it up on this one no surprise here fourth quarter and a lot of time to go they should just cancel this one ramps thirty eight forty niners ten the rams don't have\nHad no problem today Jared golf is making it look easy really doesn't have to do that much\n... has sixty three yards but it's because I haven't had to do that much everyone's involved in the office for the rams CJ by third is doing his best the backup quarterback who's now the starter for Jimmy ...
