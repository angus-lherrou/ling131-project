bill of like the engineers going to do\nThis I I don't know I all I Know is the ... the announcer today they announced today that they're sending several hundred more troops down to the border regular army and they and Texas has a has sent a we're talking about sending several thousand members of the Texas National Guard down to the border\nSee the problem is these caravans are a little less predictable than hurricanes you know you can't build out the cone and track the potential you know you can't track it coming up through Mexico and see where it's going to land and apparently\nThere's some infectious diseases believe it or not I how how shocking is this Central American immigrants or ah susceptible to infectious diseases I guess they they've been neglected to get their vaccinations before they went on the way\nSo that that's ... that's being ... somewhat or the numbers or be a ... whittled down just a little bit anyway by people getting sick and turning back around and I guess the Mexican\nGovernment Mexico's that you know Mexico I sell off and I\nMexico is is ah is going through the motions any way of offering asylum to try to preserve their way to preserve this new trade agreement that's going to succeed NAFTA\nSo they're they're going through the motions anyway and I guess a few people are taking them up on the author of asylum so I I don't know I think a bunch of them are going to get up to the border we're going to just have to see what happens I mean you can't\nYou can't let 'em in if you keep letting the men they're going to be more and more coming in you know you're right bill it's a it's a full scale invasion is what it is\nThanks for the call Mike your next with how we go ahead Mike\nHey listen to the vet for pumped up to get out and do totally our

highway cargo had went\nI I got up on that truck sticker on my car that puts a jet fuel stickers on my car and I'm driving or out what everything going on definitely notice and you know that that cities is definitely a rise in you know other people believe out stuff or not but you know it's definitely getting up there I I\nAte and this lady drop by me and she's waving their fist at me for him to stop by the window that I just start screaming at me you know like maybe in their sixties or so\nShe goes she goes she goes away Trump sticker she goes you stand up for yourself because you got to go I went down to that you know people are afraid you know it shows you what I said I\nWell it was not a background went there was a survey today that\nSaid that half of Trump supporters feel that they've been bullies in work that's amazing isn't it\nHow how 'bout that's like including red states like Indiana Missouri what am I to places like Massachusetts has got to be much more than half somehow we are [noise] have\nAnd running up a bill even though she has a pretty decent job since she got out of college in Texas\nAnd she moved to Washington DC and uh so now these charges are a showing up in Texas and in a in Virginia and he told me that she she also has has asked him in the past and said can you order me some books on Amazon and this is my friend\nIs is not very good on\nComputer stuff but you know Amazon is about as easy as\nKnow buying a hot dog it's Fenway Park it's that doesn't require a lot of ah expertise so my friend says to his daughter why are you asking me to buy your\nBooks on Amazon and of course the answer is obvious even though she has a good job she doesn't want to pay so now my friend\nHas had to change his credit card in order to stop his daughter from a from from using the card why couldn't to your friend just ask your daughter not to use the card\n\nSee only someone who doesn't have kids would ask a stupid question like that they\nThey as long as there's free money around which is what they think if they have to if they have your credit card they why would they use their own credit card\nSo finally my friend had to get a new credit card she had to cancel the old credit card and do you know what happens when you cancel the old credit card all the recurring payments\nSomehow stopping\nPay they don't get transferred to the new credit card so my friend gets a a a dining letter from the Massachusetts Turnpike authority and it's got you know it's an orange letter and it says it's got a strip across adult disregard this letter unless you don't want to renew your driver's license or your registration\nKnow that kinda stuff so I Want to know do you have problems like this with your kids what do you deal with your kids and your credit cards do you do you have a a\n... do you have a system where uh where you just stop the uh you know a change all your credit cards to prevent your ah your kid from\nUh using them it's it's really is a pain to what to deal with this aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two like but see Jae crew nordstroms Bloomingdale Bloomingdale that's nice Bloomingdales eighty three

... these are all this is is that what that was two hundred and twenty five bucks it revolves clothing\nThe net would appear to be high end women's fashion alley high in women's fashion why are those charges appearing on your friends credit card\n[laughter] [noise]\nYou know it's uh it's amazing my friend also told me that you know what he win his his daughter had the the credit card he used to get these deals from Amazon they would they would say like ah how how did you like those a high end ... we sent you\nA comfortable [laughter]\nAfter a while it becomes more amusing but I'm comfortable until you get the bill then it becomes\nExasperating it's beyond the uncomfortable so what do you do when you have this problem aid for four or five hundred a forty to forty two or six one seven just take the card away from her you're such a cheap bastard why would you even give her a car\nWait are they there was this mecca yeah they're making less daycare\nHey ... first of all I'm not a cheap faster and and second of all she doesn't have a\nCar that's where my friend says she doesn't have a card she has the numbers on the card and she said one day she she got it the the security coded case it's one of those deals\nWhat does she likes to see like the rain man she just like catches one glimpse of a card and yet where there's no doubt it she's got it that's why it must be a a a skill particular to young women\nSo so now so now you have to now he has to hide the credit card when she comes home he has to always keep it on his person you can't leave it around the can't leave the ... the the the phone around a lay your next with highway cargo Hadley\nLet me guess is your friend a weatherman\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOh oh come on let me give me a break\nHey I find it easier except
