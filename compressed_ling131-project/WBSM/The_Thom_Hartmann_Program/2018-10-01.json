need to investigate that yes I mean if it was considered to spend to testify before Congress that's illegal\n... and you know the and the question is I mean I don't want the investigation to go on the open ended like um like John Dickerson on CBS but uh you know what would be interesting to know how much ah how much coaching she got not just from her own lawyers which would be covered under attorney client privilege you couldn't ask about\nBut how much a coaching she get from some of the Democrats staffers to try to a paper overall the inconsistencies in in all of her testimony the
