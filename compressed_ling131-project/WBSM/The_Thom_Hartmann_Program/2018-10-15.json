up because he worked for the Senate select committee on intelligence which is one of the real big er swaps and the deep state quagmire ss CI it's called\nHe was the director of security James wolf they let him plead guilty to one count of making a false statement to special agents of the FBI during the course of the best\nYou should they this is this is some way to allow him to save his pension and not have to go to prison I'm sure they could they could have thrown the book at this guy he's like he's just he's just a a Democrat attack operative\nWho was trying to leak this information to embarrass Republicans and again what ... what is wrong with Jeff Sessions they let this guy get away with this they had this guy Kohl\nThe the ... application was eighty two pages long and they have he he text that eighty two pages to a this was a slutty reporter\nThe day before she posted is a big story about it on uh on on buzzfeed and they just let them walk basically today they let them plead guilty it's really bad eight for four\nOr five hundred forty to forty to ah see Joe your next with how we ... go ahead Joe\nHey how are you Joe from Yarmuth remember when the wall when are set to uh a\nLittle bit Lauren that are there'd be disturbing or Cape Wind would disturb the native honor burial grounds and and she didn't stick up for people just want to all this talk about tested waters it made me think about it but you know it shares the other thing that's really ironic you\nKnow at Stanford University nickname was prior to Nineteen Seventy two\nWas it wasn't the Indians\nTowards the end it and it's one of the over object or objections of Native Americans they changed the name and they came up with cardinal but they didn't do the cardinal the color because they didn't want to be called the crimson but one other thing we George Zimmerman well then he Peruvian and they said he was white\nYes I said that earlier he was a white Hispanic right around\nBut he only hiring conservative and he had a gun license so he had to become white just like if you're a you know like Aaron Hernandez you know he was Hispanic and then he murdered those people and he became a white Hispanic\nAnd now I guess that it's coming out that he's gay does he get to go back to being Hispanic again does he get to be somewhat less guilty of being white because he's gay\nWeight Zimmerman as day no Noel in Hernandez oh sorry Holly\nAnd don't forget he was he was proven not guilty because he he had full due process of law\n[laughter] face\nItself it's it's crazy\nI I Know well you know it's like if you if you\nKill yourself they dismiss all the charges against you liked this guy a Bryan Bryan multiple choice Joyce you know the senator from ... who moved to well Westport after he was a hundred and Thirteen count federal indictment\nAnd he just the pay he's dead at age fifty sixty apparently killed himself we don't I mean there's no official verdict yet but he is as soon as he killed himself or they are they ... they dropped the charges they dismissed all the charges against them so they won't be any ah asset forfeiture so I mean\nWhile they're trying they're trying to win project again down here I Wonder if I lose now is going to stick up for a whopping out by burial grounds that that that that are buried underwater or she just testing the political waters\nI don't think I don't think she she's a you know she's one of like the like so many politicians and Massachusetts if you if they ever named mistreat after Elizabeth Warren it's going to have to be one way\nOr six one seven says Cherokee Nation has spoken on Warren claim says white squash speak with for gun that's exactly what they say they're not buying this for an instant thanks for the call Joe Steve your next with highway car go ahead Steve\nHi Hi how are you doing yeah I think this whole thing's gonna backfire on Elizabeth Warren on a lot of times are Democrats remind me of Bugs Bunny because every time somebody points that gun it Bugs Bunny ... take turns the gun barrel and they wind up shooting themselves I'm In a ...\nAct fires it's amazing but I I was just curious you know California lower voter fraud thing yet and we have like potential for a similar thing like that in Massachusetts I Know we had problems with a legal skinny driver's licenses and all I guess in California there are not allowed to look into that database to see how many illegal it's got registered to vote\nWhile I think I think there's a problem in every state Steve with uh all all kinds of ah a motor voter are in the autumn ... you know some people some states are when you get a driver's license you're automatically registered to vote\nBut of course a lot of people are beginning her driver's license is now were illegal you know there's a lot of them around here are heroines dealers are from places like Lawrence\nWho will get a phony a Puerto Rican birth certificates and they go down and they get they get the driver's license and it's it's\nPart of it's the driver's license but the other thing is you're automatically a registered for food stamps and then once you're automatically registered for food stamps you're right you you can you can get everything else you can get mass health you can get section eight\nYou can get where you know all this uh you know I everything free in America no wonder that no one did there still coming over in caravans you know they they claim they're fleeing violence there maybe\nThere are also fleeing work you know they know once they get over here they claim to be refugees they never have to work a day in their lives\nHonduran caravan heads to us a mid policy discussion they look at it this way once they get across the board of they'll never have to work again that's the that's the reality of it eight four for\nFive hundred forty to forty two will be a [noise] we'll be right back with more of your calls somehow we are [noise]\nThey're back as regular as low as equally revenues but far more dangerous it's those aggravating politicians in their periodic ritual of informing us within incessant by duper rations of each other that when all the votes are cast\nEight and he was doing some good work too with a you know a ... re or reclaiming a wreckage from World war two in the Pacific he was spending a lot of do trying to get some of the uh uh recover some of the a sunken American vessels ... he was a decent person it's too bad\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two Paul your next with how we ... go ahead Paul\nEye to eye or

she's not she's not ... you know I mean a ... and as an alien chew it [laughter] I I think I Know what you're getting at I mean but again with the supposedly we all have ... blood in us or\nOr most of

with highway car go ahead Robert\nAt all so\nThey changed their laws or child\nOn came into office on the first thing they did but it still does all the universe law came in and then here or\nThe local address them to vote right as the law\nWas charging them out of state tuition so what what these kids can vote at home you know what they should be close to him at the dollar is oh\nWell that's what's that's what's happening in New Hampshire I mean Trump is always talking about that you know I mean we're Trump Trump Trump talks more about viruses coming in for Massachusetts but the bigger problem in New Hampshire as far as a Republican's losing these are close Senate races like Kelly Ayotte that the Maggie Hassan in twenty sixteen\nLost by a thousand votes and the Trump lost the state to Hillary by three thousand votes\nIs that you have all these college students in these uh these these college towns are doing the same thing you were just talking about they are they ready to in in Durham\nAnd hand over in uh in Keene in Plymouth they they register to vote and uh they they flip the are they flip the state because it's a very tightly a tightly contested state\nCan be challenging usually check all you have to do is look at the list\nWhile the cat yeah it it can but they're not and you know they they've they've arrested\nFor people now in Massachusetts for voting in Massachusetts and in New Hampshire you think that's all there are though there's a hell of a lot more than that I Wish they ah I Wish they would go to go to bat and really just go go after these people thanks for the call Robert\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two officer mark says Brian ... stealth or blame the President Trump for the Sears bankruptcy yet so\nOr if time officer mark they're too busy I don't I don't know what they're blaming him for that probably blaming for that shot lunar in Panama City\nSo people on Twitter We're kind of memorializing fears all day and they were tweeting out some of the strangest things that were ever purchased from the old catalog yeah did you do one point they were selling a brick and mortar school houses rally Sears, Roebuck catalog yes entire school houses\nWhile well I you know I I think a lot of people have mentioned this but it's rather ironic that the fears of course started out as a catalog which was kind of thing so they were kind of like the Amazon of of more than a century ago and like like Amazon\nIs now doing to a lesser degree I think than Sears did they started moving into a brick and mortar away from the the a catalog and the the catalog\nPut a lot of the uh main street the retailers out of business over the years so Sears has been destroyed at least in part by a by the same technological forces that it used to destroy all the mom and pops a century ago\nPlus they plus it's you know the the store just went totally down hill being and they and they bought a K. Mart and Kmart was at you know back in the seventies k-mart was the was the big thing k-mart was Walmart\nAnd then and then Walmart came along and the eight K. Marts launch and K. Mart was bought by Sears and they were like ah they were like two declining\nChains put together and it was just a disaster and I ... I was wondering about that guy uh uh Ed Ed lamprey he's the one who owns a Sears I mean he he made billions in in\nHedge funds or mutual funds whatever he was setting up it was an investor and uh what what\nMade him think that he could turn Sears around I mean how do you ever gone into his ears would be I mean [laughter]\nYou know most of us have been in a series and then there was a reason why we stopped going back\nYou know you ... you couldn't get anybody to wait on you you couldn't find anyone to to buy at the escalator was broken the uh the the the clothes were of a really ... really shot equality and whatever the reason\nA yeah nine seven eight says double barrel shot guns yeah I Know that's where a that's where Johnny ... used to buy some shot guns that he used that some of the hits the they they used to be a series\nOn a mass staff in in North Cambridge right there at the ah Puerto square\nAnd uh he he uh now it's now it's a a it's a college dorm or something and Emerson or something I forget what college is one of the colleges bought it\nAnd I remember taking one of my kids in there for a like a a a day when they were looking at the at the schools and they said hey we're Johnny's the by the shot guns to kill people and\nMy my daughter was looking at me like I was weird for saying they're just trying to give her a little historical perspective and background Jim your next with highway car go ahead Jim\nYeah good evening how he thanks for taking my call no you go on to some other things I don't want to be that that Tom tom but we've done a lot of um research on a church ancestry\nAnd I'm just caught messing up the extent of what that extra you quoted earlier as far as saying it somewhat disingenuous live you know all races Democrats used very vague and dilute lineage proclaimed that wasn't with one is right in the first place it's problematic\nBut the people were church ancestry and as much as a lot of European mixing and not just some colonial times\nThere was an evil is ... I'm\nA project is to try that may have crossed I'm lost it'll antics land bridge during the last ice age so there's like a strong coffee European ancestry and then add mixing with maybe west and translator which have to do is ask you ... you might have a central Europe or central Asian markets\nThat doesn't prove anything but that's because once you have like ... you have to look into ... records when you first steps to if it gets last will and testament and that will lead originally to connection to assure a you know right ancestry right the ultimate arbiter here's the turkey tribal councils and\nThe other ones that have the ... the ultimate say they're already but claims she's lost so many people one one thousand Columbian but she's definitely not sure either just lost their\nRight but ... that's what the Cherokee Nation said I thought that they put they put out a pretty good statement you know this ... you know DNA has nothing to do with it you have to have a ... you you have to have a family that has a history with the tribe and she doesn't have any of that she just decided I let you know I live in Oklahoma\nSo therefore I'm uh Cherokee right I mean you know Johnny Bench I think was one eight or ... you know the former ah great the hall of famer catcher\nFor the uh Cincinnati Reds I don't think he ever claimed to be an Indian you know he was from Oklahoma just because you're from Oklahoma doesn't make it would indeed God just ... and the audacity that she I mean and and you know she's going to get a you know she's going to get away with it with the or the moon bat constituents who the who still\nDon't know that the globe has a has a correct that their original bogus story saying but she's one thirty second Cherokee which is it's total nonsense and and and you know you kinda wonder did they know that was total nonsense but they just decided to put it up there until a so everyone can post it up there to protect their\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two eight six so says ... elaborate destroyed Sears he made his money selling off the real estate and the brand names like crafts but no intention to run a retail business the mob calls it a bus stop\nHe ... he's lost eleven billion dollars in the last six years I mean that's I I don't think ah\nI don't think Jimmy ... Burke and Paul very I'll rent too many bus stops where they lost a ... billion dollars I I just think he got in way over his head and we're just trying to sell themselves out of the mess and it didn't work eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two I'm how are\nYou Karl Rove reserve that commercial ...\nHave you noticed your parents are becoming hard of hearing and saying what did you say voter hearing help dot com and use ... to get at the a registered hearing aids for Seventy five dollars down and ... dollars a month or the hearing how common use from local how we\nYou", "show_name": "The Thom Hartmann Program", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "15"}
