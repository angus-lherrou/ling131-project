a Willis prohibition against the against running a basically adds without a disclaimer well this also apply to unions are just a or just to to a private entities\nI Believe it to a belief that applies to anyone who isn't a party or a political committee or you know one of these or an entity that does exist to to affect the outcomes of elections\nSo that yes or no for unions are unions affected\nI Believe they are up in my head guy I 'cause I'm just wondering you know 'cause sometimes I you know the or the left tries to a\nA exempt unions from the same uh the the same laws that they would apply to corporations as you as you well know so I was I was just wondering about that so when this this bill was signed into law would assume by a Deval Patrick is that correct\nYeah it goes it goes back a few years we're\nGoing to have you have a habit as anyone tried to repeal this\nBill\nI have no idea um I think quite often the problem with these bills that no one no one necessarily take some serious terribly seriously until you get into court you know it's enough to say this'll this'll make things more transparent or you know this is a pro disclosure bill\nAnd then people sort of stop thinking about the actual practical impacts of it and how burdensome really isn't practice right until uh until you're in front of a judge and the judge starts asking hard questions\nRight the judge says this law on the books and you say yes and then you why you you know the the judge dismissed as your complain because he says this is the job of me if you want to change the law you're going to go to the legislature and whatnot to a judge\nRight I mean that's what that's what they're going to that's what they're going to say I mean he has a has has anyone ever thought about filing filing a bill to repeal this I mean I I Know we why no we're dealing here with a a\nYou know a one party state and all that but uh it it seems like that would be one way to go right at least try that you could show that the lead to the to the judge\nWho hears the case of the ... the judges and in and tell them that you you try to while you try to work your way through the legislative system\nAll I mean there's no requirement when there's a law that violates the first amendment that you you go try to get it repealed\nIn court no I understand but I'm just saying it you know it might look good to say you know we tried to do this but uh you know the the the uh you know the unions are ... you know stop this at a at the state house level I'm just wondering\nLet's you know with with the election just a few weeks out on this this law in place right now I think the thinking as you know we've we've got a we've we've we've got to get a judge looking at this now so that the speech can happen uh as opposed to you know wading through the legislative process I'm pretty sure the Massachusetts legislature isn't even obsession right now\nNo well are are you ... so you are you trying to get like a a a ... junction or temporary restraining order to stop this a ... a lot about that today that is what you okay so that's what you're asking for who I did is it has a a judgment assigned to hear the case yeah\nYes who who was who isn't you know\nUh you know what I should note off the top of my head I'm trying to remember a very senior judge has been a bit on the court since the seventies a quarter appointing\nWell that's good I was going to say that it's it's better it's better that you get somebody like that even a even the Democrats are appointed by Carter than a Democrat appointed by Obama because I was\nFound just experience judges are far more likely to act quickly and and take these sort of cases seriously in my experience\nRight that's that's good so uh what's your what should people do if they\nAre ... ... I guess it is yeah okay he's running around them they've been around around what he she but there are two who says two yeah the ... the husband is it was a state judge and the the woman is a a is a is a federal judge has white\nOkay so why so what should people do what they want to why at least the you know express some support for ah defending the first amendment here on this legislation on this lawsuit excuse me\nWell I mean we're we're always happy to have people uh you know come to the hearing and watch the arguments to watch their their government at work in the form of a federal lawsuit and\nI yeah I suspect we're asking for relief before the election but that realistically and this is probably going to go on um for some time it's probably going to end up in the courts of appeals that's how these things usually work so you know people are affected by this uh we'd love to hear from them\nYeah and again this is the you're just arguing a straight on First Amendment grounds you know at a ...\nThat's right Congress violation of federal constitutional\nRight yes the government she'll make no laws are yeah restricting freedom of speech that's what it is it's ... it sounds like a cut and dried case a Allen Dickerson from the Institute for free speech ah you're doing a great job any anybody who's for free speech I'm I'm for them\nAnd I hope you ah overturned this this this is
