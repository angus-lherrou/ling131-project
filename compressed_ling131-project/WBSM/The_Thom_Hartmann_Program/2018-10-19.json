I'm\nI'm Glad she's busted and here's one more from Jennifer ... who went to Harvard law school when all this uh when she first got the job and she's talking about how her uh her maybe she says maybe a Elizabeth Warren's or parents for her uh\nThey didn't tell her that she was a that she was part Indian but Jennifer ...\nSays but such tales belong in the realm of family lore not in the realm of racial preferences the reason we're talking about Elizabeth Warren's ancestry today more than six years after the story originally broke\nHis because she used this family story to boost her chances of obtaining teaching jobs is a time when the elite law schools were desperate to hire racial and ethnic minorities\nHarvard law was no exception so this woman Jennifer ... was going to Harvard law school in the early nineties when when Elizabeth Warren was hired and she says it was a hotbed of left wing agitation\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety two scores of demonstrators protested outside dean Robert Clark's office there specific demand that the administration hire a faculty member who was a\nQuote unquote woman of color woman of color\nDeemed Clark filed disciplinary charges against the disruptive students but the administrative hearings to determine the fate of the great wall mine I guess there's office was ... was in ... as they came to call themselves turned into a circus Jesse Jackson issue of\nJesse Jackson how how how did how was it a surprise is not a surprise that Jesse Jackson is somehow involved in the hiring of this fraud another fraud Jesse Jackson\nJesse Jackson entered pleas for leniency in hundreds of spectators filled the hearing room to watch students turn the table on on tables on dean Clark and effectively put Harvard on trial for discrimination\nIt was against this backdrop of race and gender activism that Elizabeth Warren arrived in Cambridge again this is Jennifer ... writing this a graduate of Harvard\nLaw that time a than a law\nProfessor at the University of Pennsylvania she came to Harvard as a visiting professor that is on a trial basis during this time worn was characterizing herself as Native American and was deemed a minority in a professional directory used by law schools for recruiting purposes Warren\nSays she classified herself this way to meet other Native Americans that may be true that wasn't Jennifer ... knows that it's not [laughter]\nJennifer ... says hey you know she has to get invited to the parties yeah you know like everybody else has to give her the benefit of the doubt even though there's no doubt\nThat may be true it must have also had the effect of catching the attention of hiring committees at prestigious law schools the fact is she said I wanted to get invited to parties so\nSix years ago various reporters went to all these groups that you know that we're American indian Native American clubs or organizations on the Harvard campus and none of 'em ever heard at ever seen this woman anywhere\nThe Boston Globe reports that warrants claimed to Native American heritage never came up and faculty deliberations of course and didn't have to at this point her ... her her purported ethnicity as a matter of record\nAnd again it's the Boston Globe I Love the fact they called it a deeply reported story you know in a deeply reported story it was it as deeply reported as the math when they were trying to figure out how much Native American jihad according to her purported DNA\nPast the may hey fake now it's really hard I Know it's harder than fake news I said that I might call\nIs unusual that this is an understatement of the year it is unusual for Harvard to make offers of tenure professors who attended and began their acts\nCareers at Rutgers\nTo be sure Warren had worked their way up to attend your position at Penn and other Ivy League school and there was no question that she was a much beloved teacher but in that highly charged political climate of Cambridge in the night early Nineteen nineties being Native American could only of helped\nOne thing is certain once Warren joined the faculty Harvard touted her minority status\nIn order to burnish its diversity credentials listing Warren is a minority and internal documents and in compliance reports that's what the federal government and telling the Harvard Crimson but the law school had a Native American female on the faculty\nThe larger question why are we doing this being counting at all these questions are not theoretical they impact university hiring an admissions decisions every day\nIn fact the same day that war and claimed victory prematurely in the dispute over her heritage Harvard University was in federal court in Boston defending it's race conscious admissions policy against claims that discriminates against\nAsian Americans\nAnd that is why senator warns heritage is not simply a personal matter it's a matter of public concern\nThose are those are both really good really good columns and I and I would also recommend that you read the column I read yesterday by got an eagle ice field\nYeah we treated that way now yeah July and I was a that was on Fox News dot com that was also an excellent column\nThese these are these are people who were who were studied the case very thoughtfully\nUnlike say men Donald Trump [laughter]\nWe've we've ... we've this I Know I'll take that back we've we've tell you a pioneer in this case Sally [noise]\nYeah I Googled a recipe I Googled the recipes from a pouch\nThat book I should tell you how we've been getting a lot of calls this week and and I always um fitting in with what you're talking the at the moment that a lot of people just called up and said I Want to thank Keli because he's stuck with that and he never stopped\nTalking about it and sharing now I think the president had to take that bite yes it does get play a lot more but\nYou know the original thought behind this and that gets that that gets forgotten\nWell I I'm I'm Glad to I'm Glad to take a bow on this and I'm happy I'm happy she's busted and I hope it pays off for Jeff deal 'cause I'd I'd really like to be not represented by Elizabeth Warren and the U.S in the U.S Senate such great you know that how he's very determined when he's in the pursuit of a scalp [laughter]\nNine seven eight says would she have made a three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a one class if she wasn't one one thousand\nTwenty fourth or the you know that's a that's a very good point to a ditch you start at the bottom of the totem pole up [laughter] and I here's another one five one three hours talking bowl any different from Rachel Dole is all\nI really that's that's an excellent question and I'm going to I'm going to answer that question I never thought of it in white those terms before but she's not different\nShe knows how to not you know how she's different she benefited a lot more from her fraud than Rachel ... has benefited from her fraud I mean Rachel Dole is all just a national laughing stock until at least Monday\nWoman was considered a serious contender for ah the Democratic nomination for president of the United states All right we're going to take a break and there would be back with one final a final segment here I think you know what I think maybe we should talk about the mass millions one more time since it's five hundred and forty million what are you going to do with the money\nAlthough it doesn't matter 'cause I'm going to wed I'm going to when I got one in three hundred and two million chance how\nThat you're going to say I think and they get one more coffee I was going to be like no\nNo I'm not going to get one more coffee I'm I'm I'm not beat out I'm wired wired to but I don't need the math tonight I got a I got a\nTriple double triple X. espressos a mile away car\nTalk radio [noise]\nGar\nWhen it comes to meat quality matters that's why I made the switch to butcher box you
