at this wonder creation was living in our city\nUm my wife lost it so she called over to ... a local wrapped in the inside scoop as if they're going to move this judge so a lot of the legislators up on the north shore Essex County area they're gonna\nThey're gonna take 'em they're going to move somewhere they already signed off on that so\nWill buy it I mean that's just that's just going to create a problem for somebody else you know\nExactly so some Middlesex county or north folk or whoever suffix ... it probably fit in Suffolk County but they're they're they're going to end up with this guy is a problem now\nYou know what there was a debate last night between the two candidates for attorney general the income but Mara hold that Healy and a J McMahon who's the Republican\nAnd

[laughter]\nYeah I I missed that one last night but this one has been so yeah it's in our backyard it's just it's it's it's been a focus point of ours and it really is disgusting I mean you know instead of doing the right thing and getting this guy out of out of it out of the courts all they do is cut all I'm Around you know taking the playbook right out of the church\nI Know but you know do you try it and it's almost it really is almost impossible to get rid of these people you know it'd be it's ... they have they have to you know impeach him in the house and then half the trial in the Senate it's like uh the what the president of the United states only on it on the state level\nAnd uh it's yeah it's just almost impossible to be done and he has judicial discretion and\nSome of the uh you know so a lot of the legislators a you know they're they're liberals like him they think illegal aliens should be treated with kid gloves and they got no problem with a you know releasing a\nYou know accused the you know sick sexual predators pedophiles on uh on one thousand dollars bail it's ridiculous but that's that's the reality of Massachusetts unfortunately yeah thanks for that\nSo he's out of our our back yard and then someone else\nThat's great that's great so that yeah send them down to uh\nSend them down to Natick knocked they'll send them the NATO just kidding not even getting just saying no place that we have the kind of a or an ... ah with the uh with the protesters and we don't have that we do yet though okay what bleeping out during the break people want to see it went away\nHe uh Orrin Hatch just had a run in with these people they say they're going to arrest three hundred people in the uh in the hearts in an office building ... three hundred moon back so if they risk three hundred people and they have to spend the night in jail how many of them do you think well ... getting to work in the morning\nFive six seven\nNo more than ten or Fifteen no doubt about that aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two a day but your next with highway car go ahead David\nHey how are we thank you for taking my call I'm curious to know what you think you'd think that Democrats will have a concert Jesus moment where they you know where they defected they said well what we did even to flake actually I should call it a in thinking of what we did was\nWrong you don't want any will any one of them you don't lose that these over the\nBats are really good question day but I thought if I you know I think that might be a good poll question do the Democrats are really think that Brett Kavanaugh is a a as a child a is a child molester right\nYou don't kill all of them are I mean we don't hear from all of them at any one of them because I think that a Republican or a flake or what it would be a factor in it come out and say boy what we've done is wrong and I can't you know and I can't sleep at night I mean you know I think it's gotta happen one of them have to think well\nNow I Know I don't think so I don't think that ... threatening to punish any of 'em cut off all their campaign funds from the Democratic national Senatorial Committee if they if they ... back and uh you know I got Heitkamp today a you\nKnow she's got a losing in North Dakota she's going to lose her seat but um she's still going to vote no even though the there is a thirty points morality of in North Dakota and to what Kavanaugh's confirmed\nAnd we'll be right back somehow we are\n\nHey Toby we're here in case on where\nBut you know she may have been she may even been more noxious or at the Democrat press conference today than a Chuck Schumer we played the play the cut up ... fucking about blocking now remember\nThis is the woman who got the letter six weeks before she released it to ah from Christine Blasey Ford so she's blocking access\nA of of the Republicans in the investigators are on these among the sun staffers to actually getting to the bottom of this but today she comes out and she excuses the White House to quote unquote blocking listen\nThe White House certainly blocked access to millions of documents from judge Kavanaugh's record I Know is that [noise]\nAnd ensuring that Ninety percent of his emails and memos weren't available for the Senate for the public in the hearing it now appears that they also lost the FBI from doing its job\nMan can you imagine a Republican try getting away with ... saying something that the that ridiculous gene\nAfter blocking after blocking the release of the uh the the so called the ... act accusatory letter against a a judge Kavanaugh ... that would never happen he'd be the ... just\nExcoriated any Republican senator who tried to pull back but you know no ... no one's going to mention it on CNN or MSNBC maybe on Fox no mention it but probably not thanks for the call Jane Steve your next with how we ... go ahead Steve\nHey how are you good after hearing that or an actor I have to ask I I I thought that this one quality not\n\nI I don't know I don't know what these women what Steve I mean you know it's an old joke that men don't know what women want but I mean what what exactly do they want they keep saying you have to believe believe the survivors not the bleeping liar ... that's what they that's what they were chanting earlier today\nHow do they know this guy's a liar I mean he he he uh ...\nOr the the the the accusers the woman accusers have no cooperating witnesses they scour you\nHave literally is reality\nThey literally scoured the country looking for people who can back up any of these stories and they can't find a single person\nOh I\nI I called to put in for a minute senatorial arrow and a guy oil two weeks ago and that was it was\nA I think he turned it around I I think so not solely but most responsible yeah the changes that are in the last week of course he'd he'd been airing everything I\nI I Wonder if he found his voice after his running mate passed away there's maybe he was afraid of saying things\nBy speculation on that on that account that he'd never wanna he never would've behave this way of McCain could have like pulled him aside and said why are you you know we know Lindsey what you're really doing is helping Donald Trump but we don't like Donald Trump but now now McCain is gone so he can be as his own man so to speak\nYou know if I could ask you one more question yes\nWell what can you stick to the possibility of ancient quaking out a win and then changing parties afterwards and the reason I set out is shown it if you want to vote for him yeah\nHe's got to get cut off by the money and everything I\n... you know I mean Schumer Schumer has to protect themselves 'cause he's the you know they the or the moon bats the all the left\nHas a doubts about him they've they've ah\nPicking at his house in ah in Brooklyn you know 'cause they said he wasn't tough enough on Trump so he's got to maintain this uh this stern attitude towards that the factors on the uh the evil judge Kavanaugh a confirmation\nBut ... my feeling is Steve if a mentioned was going to switch parties you could have done it already yeah there's the governor is all the the the governor who was elected as a Democrat switch like a year ago that would that would have been the smart thing to do switch a year ago\nAnd I think that you know he if he wins now you're not up for reelection for another six years so I think people will be over Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court by the time his reelection bid rolls around right right I get the primary challenges you can just run as an independent\nYeah I don't think he I don't think he's going to going to switch switch parties and so I mean it's an interesting question but I I think the time the time has come and gone for him to switch like the governor the governor made the right decision\nYou know the the thing about the earlier caller saying you know or or do any of the Democrats know that he's a he's he's a good guy and he's not a child\nMolester I think a lot of them know that but unlike prior Democrats they will never cross\nThe party orthodoxy and I go back to this uh to to the vote of on Clarence Thomas back in Nineteen Ninety One eleven Democrats ended up voting for Clarence Thomas and I've been meaning to ah to to look up the list of the eleven Democrats\nBut then I then you know it's always whenever I think about doing it it I always know what's really depressed me because it's I mean\nYou know these ... these guys are all they're all gone now you know I mean they they still may be alive but like Zell Miller I mean there's there are no more says Allen Miller's in the Democratic party\nOr a about a ... I don't know if ... was still in the Senate at that time he would have voted for Clarence Thomas he was from Alabama eleven Democrats think about that from eleven Democrats too at the most one mansion\nAnd is is a judge Kavanaugh anymore reprehensible quote unquote reprehensible than not Clarence Thomas no it's just that the Democratic party is just so so monolithic\nJust like the Supreme Court justices that their presidents nominate they'd they'd never break ranks that it's like a it's like Venezuela\nThanks for the call Steve lay your next with highway car go ahead lay\nOut a little update the report and we get the vote and when the Republicans going to stop so to say so to speak turning the other cheek or are they trying to achieve\nNo I don't think they're I don't know I don't think they're turning the other cheek Lee I mean they uh you know Lindsey Graham by you know you don't put it right back in their record to you know last week\nAnd a ... and McConnell and the Orrin Hatch have been talking about how this honest the Democrats have been and how cynical I I've ... I've seen more spine and backbone out of the Republicans in the last week than I've seen in ever actually\n\nYeah no I think it's going I think it's doing okay I think they're doing okay on this one thanks thanks for the call a\n... you know I think the thing is I think a lot of them have come to the same realization that uh\nThat Lindsey Graham dead and he he may mentioned this in a you mentioned at one time on the floor when he was ... none of the floor and the committee\nHearing with a cabinet last week and then he mentioned that again in a couple of TV interviews he said\nYou know I voted for your candidates I voted for Sotomayor and the Kagan ... they were very liberal and I took a lot of heat back in South Carolina for voting for him but you know are under the constitution I had no reason not to vote for him\nAnd he said and this is the this is the reward that the other Republicans get for being reasonable about a voting for Democrats\nNominees for the Supreme Court they just get it thrown back in their face and uh they they're uh you know people like Brett Kavanaugh I'll just get slime for no reason it's it's really uh it it it it's true\nOfficer mark says these protesters look like the uh came out of central casting they did they did it another another tax there says that crazy cat lady cussed out or Senator Hatch but says how dare you say that to a woman when hatched sells for ... [laughter]\nYeah you're right [laughter] oh dear you say that to a woman and then she swears like a sailor Adam aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two that's ... that's when that's central casting that's what you get when you call central casting I'm highway car\nWe would change the state [noise]\nYou know\nLet's be honest here last is not one of life's more enjoyable experience is it makes you self conscious you rode your confidence in causes you to wait ... years of your life trying to hide camouflage and generally obsess over the condition insurance it pretty much socks\nUntil you called based upon O'Hare respiration and they completely\nTurn your wife around with a high G T procedure whether you were looking to fill in your hairline reverse years of here last factor Chris sinus and his team at these defined O'Hare respiration will create a result there will be a transformative\nExperience the result of my I G the procedure was quite remarkable I now have polar thicker here so I can even aware it a bit longer with the these the final difference\nBalding hair loss are now optional no matter where you are in New England they used to find O'Hare restoration is just\nA short drive away call now and get a free hygiene the consultation plus financing is available with payments as low as one hundred Nineteen dollars a month just call one eight hundred eight\nFive eight hair to learn more that's one eight hundred eight five eight hair or just visit here man dot com", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Thom Hartmann Program", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "04"}
