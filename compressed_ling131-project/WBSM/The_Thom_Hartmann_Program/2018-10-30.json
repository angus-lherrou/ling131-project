Persian Bronx who's going to travel the whole world disguised as a couple of Japanese and why why these with the great girl\nWho's taken care of the puppies\nWell there you have it okay but not about sum it up\nI wanted to mention one other guy who ah who paid a price for going after white I mean ... all the the the victims that we've mentioned in the past and there's so many of them\nBut the Chris lied and he was the uh anchor on the uh the ten o'clock news on channel two I talked to him today I'm going to be on his radio show on a Thursday night worst one of the public stations now\nAnd uh he he used to go after ... and uh and they ... his his\nTV station channel to need a liquor licence every year and you have to get a liquor licence approved by the legislature\nGuess what happened they said you could have to cancel that new show if you want to get the liquor licence this year they canceled his show\nBut he had a great he one time he got a a an interview with Kevin White the mayor of Boston right after the Seventy nine election and Kevin White was telling them I was afraid Whitey what's going to kill them during the Seventy five mayoral race was going to pick them off with a rifle you said in his wife which crazy enough even then\nAnd so uh and and so uh Chris Leyden total deadpan says to Kevin White the mayor of Boston says what's the source of a belly Bulger's power at the state house the Senate president Kevin White looks out of ... look at you like when you asked a stupid question\nI think he goes with the shores of his power my brother threatened to kill you Chris you shouldn't be nothing might nice that me\nAnd that was that yes the yes Bob Crane one time the same question the state treasurer Bob Crane was a friend I I wouldn't tell the story except cranes that cause crane like to be friendly with Billy Bolger\nCraig it she said what's the source of his power in ... and I and Bob Crane look that Chris lied and said what's the source of his power the cases I takes his hand and puts his finger to his head and then with his middle finger pulls the trigger just that's the source of this power what do you think the source of his power is\nAnd this is a this is this is what's this was the end\nOf an era I mean the theory and that in many ways you know when he went on the lam and then when he was when it was picked up in Santa Monica and two thousand eleven when he was convicted in two thousand Thirteen but this is really the uh this is really the end of an\nEra and um you know what I again I I I'm not I'm not going to pretend that uh you know that are\nNot for whom the bell tolls tolls for all of us you know I I'm happy about this I'm Glad he's dead\nHe he wanted to kill me he wanted to why he wanted and in various ways he wanted to kill trooper Johnson he wanted to kill Chris lied they wanted to kill step all ranks did kill Depp Davis he did kill a that policy he killed ...\nHe ... he killed a Brian Halloran Michael Donahue he killed uh the uh the the Apollo, Apollo brothers he killed all these people and kill the O'Brien's\nPeople like Rob banks with he he was just he was a he was just the the worst human being he ruin so many lives with a cocaine\nFor a etc okay I Am leaving right now you can see me tonight and about in a little over an hour with Martha my column on Fox News channel read my column tomorrow Steven grace are going to take over thanks VIPs for coming in from our cars\n\nI don't find it intrinsically motivational the amount of work logically isn't that much fill out a form mail it go to a specific place on the specific day with those kinds of tasks can be hard for me to do if I'm not enthusiastic about it that's kind of a problem with social attitudes around you know it's your civic duty to vote\nI once told a co worker I didn't vote and she said that's really irresponsible in this judgmental voice you can't build policy around calling people irresponsible you need to make people enthusiastic and engaged\nI mean you can tell he has ADHD definitely not lied about that you just jumped around in his explanation judgmental co workers are going to make them vote and he goes on the motivation is about the actual value my vote has it's more like a theoretical signaling value\nIf that's the case I Would rather signal that Democrats should have more progressive candidates rather than assuming that everyone in the left will automatically vote for the candidates they run\nSo this guy a racist sending a message to the Democrat Party that they need to be more progressive by a not voting for Democrats\nGood let me let me know how that turns out race [noise]\nAll right this is another good one this is Megan age twenty\nAnd from San Francisco a last voted in two thousand fourteen [noise]\nUh I rent and move around quite a bit and when I tried to get absentee ballots they need me to print out a form and mail it to them no more than thirty days before the election but also no less than seven days before the election\nTypically I check way before that time then forget the check yet again or just say bleep it 'cause I don't own a printer stamps anyway it's incredibly difficult for hourly workers are young people who are in rotational programs or travel frequently\nFor their careers to vote I Wish every state's rules are the same so that there was not as much confusion and it was easy straightforward to find the information\nThat was my up talking there grace Allen line that's mega selling [laughter] she says bleep it because he doesn't own a printer or stamps\nOr you know making me think that voting is far too you\nKnow it's way too easy it's way too easy you know and then we got the common theme through all these millennials talking with the New Yorker again and we should we should treat other diseases support so people can read it 'cause it is really funny but the common theme is that it's just way too hard to vote but I agree with you ... we should make it harder to vote like\nIt if you can't figure out how to buy a stamp you know there's I I think I drive past like to post offices on my way to work there's also a website called stamps dot com [laughter] that that might be pretty it it might be easier than you think Megan twenty nine from San Francisco California to figure out how to get steps\nRight uh this ... this next one this next the luminaries of uh I hate to say at a grace in my generation uh drew age Twenty one from Berkeley, California us voted in twenty sixteen\nI feel like the Democratic party doesn't really stand for the things I Believe in any more why should I vote for a party that doesn't really do anything for me as a voter millennials don't vote because a lot of politicians are appealing to older voters we deserve politicians that are willing to do stuff for our future instead of catering to old people who will not be here for our future\nI'm a ... major so talking about politics is a daily thing for me [laughter] that's another ... ... they're all political science majors who say that they're not going to vote it's like\nSomehow I feel like your heart's really not in the subject you're studying if you're a political science major and you're like maybe not going to vote because like politics is like focusing on like the old people I mean what what did you want to do a you know abolish Social Security and invested in like a a publicly funded marijuana program\n[laughter] All right this this is what this is Laura age Twenty one from Orlando, Florida Twenty one years old has never voted\nIn high school I didn't even know or vice president's name was Joe Biden\nSo starting out right there like I'm stoked you're not voting lady this is a dining out on [laughter] uh so uh she starts talking politics apparently somewhere classmates were all Republicans she says and then I Googled Republican versus Democrat and I like kind of both kind of not\nThat's why I'm an independent and it wasn't until the Trump versus Hillary election that I realized how important it is to like vote maybe has to do with like society you know everyone else following was like go out to vote I was in college in Massachusetts\nI decided that I wasn't going to go through that long process rent out of state student to register to vote either hectic schedule I just didn't have the time and energy also I don't know how my parents would feel about the whole thing because my brother doesn't vote either yes\nI'm sure your parents are very very proud that you're not voting but definitely don't want you to vote\nBut you know it as a student here in Massachusetts I'm I'm pleased that you didn't vote uh she uh Laura age Twenty one finishes\nI realized that I should have voted afterward even sense that election I started to a turning on not just CNN but also Fox News on the iPhone news that I plan to vote in twenty twenty I have set a goal to know a lot more about politics [laughter]\nThe other team through here is like becoming informed about politics is just the ... task like you know just like reading the wall Street Journal a little bit just paying attention to the news is is somehow dishes like ... like it's like a chore\nIt's like you you you it's on your list of things do on the weekend just like you know figure out where I stand on you know the constitution ferret where I stand on my basic rights figure out where I stand on a trade the economy markets abortion gun rights you know I feel like these are just part of being a human being it shouldn't be some like huge task like I don't know\nThe common theme that I see with people our age is that they're very mad at me for being politically interested\nOh you get a ton of hate you you you got a bunch of moon best friends in Utah you tweet out something with like a mega hash tag and all your friends jump up in your face about it\nAnd it's not but the other thing is that if we were actually to sit down and have a conversation about it which I I Would be willing to do\nAll of their arguments are really based on on emotion and feeling they hate ... he's racist he's bad but if you ask them to go any further than that it really did they get more angry 'cause like how dare you either there or what a day\nYou know what the thing is I don't know if you've seen is a great but there's a funny name going around I think it was started on my fortune or one of these blog Web sites and PC mean\nThe non player character means so for some of the older people\nIt it it comes out of video games and in video games you know you're playing your character as you go around and there are other uh you know I guess characters within the game that you're a player interacts with and they're completely program by the computer they have a limited number of responses they don't think they're not creative they are just completely pre programmed as to what they do\nSo a bunch of these are older people and you know a bunch of these ah I guess people on the Internet have started describing liberals in social justice where's as PCs non player characters because they only have this one scripted set of responses and that's exactly what you're talking about like all they can say is well Trump is a racist\nAnd then you say well what what has he done that would provide evidence for your claim well I mean these racist\nNon player characters are also for everyone listening this thing that you click acts and a million times and you can get them because you don't want to listen to everything\nThat could be a very good at the gas and and the\nThe moon bats are freaking out about this they all will that somehow this end PC remind me and this has to be racist to know it's just really funny because it describes like you were very limited set of responses to any political debate to anything about like serious questions\nTo any of these beliefs that you hold most dearly whenever they're question do you just have these you know three or four responses and you just can't deviate outside of that box some people\nAre saying is that your talking voice is anything that's needed to be more classically which is also that what that means that in yeah my uncle and like you're dying lifetime\nAll right I'm going to I'm going to leave the vocal friday ... and you know I've got a minute I'm going to cast you coming up uh after the break as Jocelyn age twenty seven of Arlington, Massachusetts\nAnd this was a good one I think I say the best one for you ... so we'll have that when we come back and again this is a uh twelve millennials talking to New York magazine about why they're probably not going to vote I say hallelujah hallelujah I and I think we should make it a lot harder to vote because of the common complaint through some of these is that you don't really buy stamps\nHow do you buy stamps so you can vote absentee I Will have will have graces Jocelyn of Arlington, Massachusetts after
