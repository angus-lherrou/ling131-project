accused him of attacking them isn't that odd\nBut where of human ... I I haven't heard that anywhere and I wish I'd hear 'em who's been reporting\nI mean it's just a sort of a throwaway line on social media I mean a lot of people have noticed that again like you said the these people all have a fairly radical backgrounds or at least the ultra liberal backgrounds I should say you know they\nHave been able to recover any their social media pages like their pictures
