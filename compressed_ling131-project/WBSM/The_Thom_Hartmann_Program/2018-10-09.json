nothing will change that tell somebody anybody goes to jail\nAgree we were talking about that during the break I mean the somebody\nBut he has got to go to jail for this whole Russian collusion thing and if that guy ... on to something that this was a set up job on a tried to frame Kavanaugh someone's going to go to jail for that too and it's not just because he's a Trump guy you you you there should be consequences for for trying to what destroy someone's life or put them in jail\nFor a ... you know for nothing\nYou know that that was one of the problems with the whole FBI investigation here in Boston when they frame those were guys for murder you know Lois Lerner I think she settled up that that case about the you know persecuting and violating the civil rights of the the Tea Party groups for about three million bucks\nThat case in a involving those poor guys at the FBI framed back in the sixties they spend thirty five years in prison\nThat cost a hundred and seven million dollars and that was not a frivolous case I mean that's they deserve that mean how'd you like to lose it do you think you would you give up thirty five years of your life for twenty seven million bucks I wouldn't\nNo way no way freedom is worth more than money any ... any amount of money you can't get you can always get more money you can't get more time\nAnd I hit and ... and nobody went to prison for ... that really I mean some people went to prison for you know some of the FBI agents went to prison for other organized crime\nA offenses that they committed but not for that\nTwenty seven

saying that this the gym that guy Jim was saying that you know when he came back but even then law schools were kinda hotbeds of subversion but I don't think it was anything like what it is now though you know I\n'cause I I when I went to UNC I a hung out a lot of with uh some of the law school guys I work with a one of them in at the colony hotel once I got to be close to his group and they were older than me and I think it's been that much time with them but there was nothing radical I mean it was it was more or less of a vocational type school you know they were going to learn a trade to be lawyers I mean\nThat's that's the way it was you know want to and you know in in around here you had you had all these cops go on at night you know they they they weren't making huge amounts of money on details are fake details like the state police\nYou know a few you had to retire early so you went to law school and the lawyers were a pretty conservative bunch around here in in most places actually now it's just that it's just crazy you know that uh what's what's been going on I mean you got that like the the um the the American Bar association they gave 'em\nGive Kavanaugh this a great
