[laughter] hey\nMoon bats brace yourself and find a safe space ... shows coming to mix three sixty in molten on Saturday November looks at this time the cameras joined by bussing friends hosts Brian kill me and\nThat we want to keep them out and through Hungary we don't we don't want them to\nThat's the thing about suspending habeas corpus I mean that way you can keep the these these gang of immigration advocates lawyers\nYou know from my ... you know ... you're the one to adjust ... says the or the process is an old the appeals process isn't over until the alien wins and it's so true\nI mean we've got to keep them on the other side we gotta keep 'em on the other side of the border you know the prevent them from getting inside 'cause once they're inside I mean they're going to be our responsibility for the next I God only knows how many generations will be paying for everything\nFor the rest of their lives in ours no question about it once once people get and it's game over I'm just and the problem is is this is what happened with the caravan in the spring is that most of them got in\nAnd I'm surprised it took so long for another one to form a so that's why we need really from and forceful measures now and we can explain it to the New York times later\nWhy don't you tell us how many what percentage of the illegal aliens from Central America up on welfare\nAccording to the Obama administration's own statistics which I've seen and Breitbart\nAnd you know I don't I don't know that ... of the top of my head but we do know from our research that about half of all immigrant headed households are accessing well at welfare programs and that's legal and illegal\nSo you know and while illegal aliens don't always have direct access to welfare programs if they have a child here who is a U.S citizen through birthright citizenship then that child becomes eligible for a lot of benefits and the parents benefits through that\nAnd of course if you're having a a a child here that's covered as a form of emergency health care\nThat we pick up the tab for so long you know are not mentioned bowling and and other things I mean\nI visited a a family detention center a today in Pennsylvania and saw um that the places where the family unit to have been coming for the last few years are kept until they're released and it's something like seven hundred and fifty dollars a day\nFor each person who's in one of these centers\nThat they're getting a health care schooling recreation they go on a field trip every week food clothing shelter and then you know a relief to go work wherever they want live wherever they want never to be seen again most\nSo until I get ... once you get a once you get across the border it's like you're on a you've got a lifetime vacation you you've won the lottery I mean all of us were standing in line trying to to win the lottery and these people all they've got to do is get across the\nBrandon but they've won the lottery and they never work again\nRight and that's that's why they're coming it's our policies that are bringing them here and we have to change the policies or nothing is going to check\nAnd the only thing is that do you say you know you say Jessica that traditionally illegal aliens unless they could drop the anchor baby or figure out some other scam they're not going to get the on welfare immediately\nBut now they're learning the scam of claiming to be a ... a seeking asylum are seeking refugee status in once they get to walk through explain to people because not everybody ... everybody doesn't know\nHow the scam works with refugee or asylum status tell us how that works\nWell they they sure no in Guatemala I'll tell you that because they had radio programs broadcasting it and um you know and say they see it on TV all you have to do if you can bring a child with you yours or somebody else is one that you've rented or one that the smuggling organization provides\nA you show up at the border and if you're crossing illegally you flag down the border patrol or you can walk up to a legal port of entry\nAnd say that you know sorry I\nDon't have a visa but I have a fear of return and there's a whole a kind of menu of options that a lot of them are using um as the basis for that asylum claim like if it's a woman they say that a gang members threatened them that if they don't sleep with them\nYou know they're going to kill them and so or they're going to do something to their kids and they need to\nPay you know like protection money or they say you know somebody in their family has been threatened by a gang or they say that they've been beaten by their spouse\nOr if you're on your ... your gay you're gay that will get you right in right\nBut that that does that does in fact work um in some situations or they can say that you know they their kids were being constructed ... scripted into the gang\nOr that they were you know in ... from Honduras they blame it on the president there that he's oppressing political party so you claim to be a member of that party none of this can be verified\nUm so it's just but these are the words network and so you get\nIn and you were held you know once you your kids get their vaccinations and new clothing and kind of things settle down for a while you're in one of these detention Centers for a little while sometimes they're just taking 'em all much right to the bus station in Arizona that's what's going on\nThey give you a bag with your lunch for three days and water and some new clothes and they ask you where you're going and if they say east Boston they say okay when he got there go to the Boston ice office in check in right and then we'll tell you when you're hearing it yeah\nAnd then they go to your most Thirteen office instead in Chelsea and check it\nCan make it issued their machete under some funneled to sell\nYou know [laughter] right\nRight where there were no legal or illegal speaking over the into across from the northern border\nThey are they're they're always have been some usually it was a you know people from Asia but you know a contact of mine a he's a government with government they're up on the northern border said the new thing is uh the Roma coming from Romania they\nDon't you know there's Asia from Romania to travel to Canada so the ah groups of Roma are coming to Canada and crossing illegally enter the United states and asking for asylum and we're treating them exactly the same way\n... you know usually more than it was an M. S. Thirteen from the south and and also within and apparently there are middle Easterners that are trying to sneak it on the southern border\nIt's in the early ... a newspaper or the president of Guatemala said they just that rounded up a hundred Syrians the we're a purely trying to you or you know they use a Guatemala's a staging area to seek it sneak into the United states\nSo we could not only be letting in MS Thirteen people who just want to sell us heroin a chopper hands off with machetes we could also be letting in the ISIS terrorists in this a caravan\nAbsolutely because the border agencies are overwhelmed they cannot bring everyone and it matter of fact they don't have a routine\nScreening process for\nPeople you know even from um ... trunk country necessarily I mean that is a weak area or in our controls right now we don't yet there are certain smugglers you specialize in what are called special interests aliens in other words\nPeople from certain countries in the middle east like Syria Lebanon wherever and in some of the prosecution is one of my colleague\nHas analyzed all the documents and found that sometimes the smugglers knows that the person they're bringing in um with Hamas or Hezbollah al Shabaab or whatever they can bring in Eric how can they they bring in whoever pays\nYeah but they're not going to be they're not going to be in the in the mall that gets blown up or the skyscraper or the airline that gets hijacked they'd at what a what do they care you know they're down south of the border down ... away you know Jessica ... a Center for Immigration Studies where can people go to learn more about your organization\nEverything we do is at the I.
