[noise]\nYou know today America's economy is flying higher and faster than any major nation history with President Trump has achieved has been amazing what what happens\nIn the November midterm elections could quickly slam on the brakes sending the financial markets into a tailspin\nThe emergence of a socialist Democratic Party could have a huge consequences believe me how will the mid term elections affect your investment portfolio find out now\nI'll stop right there\nAnd I'll let you read for yourself or the book mass hysteria this is one example of what I'm trying to do before it might be too late if it's not too late already and I don't think it's ever too late by the way\nSo Columbus Day is no longer a holiday for the namesake Ohio capital why is Christopher Columbus been turned into the most evil person to have ever lived was he that evil person and by the way\nWhat is life like for most of the indigenous peoples\nIn the areas that he landed on what what were they like to each other where they kind and loving\nWhere there's some kind of ... angels as you would have the as they would have you believe all of these uh lecturers of ethnic studies whatever you believe that the Native American was living in peace and harmony with each other and with nature nothing could be further from the truth\nI have studied this issue since Nineteen Seventy in the Nineteen seventies if you look at how tribes live with each other here in North America think of the crypts and the bloods because that's how the tribes live with each other before the Europeans arrived they will work constant war with each other fighting over things as simple as salt\nOr hunting grounds\nIf they captured a warrior from another try they would sometimes scanned them alive and throw them into the snow without skin\nDo have to mention the rapes well you see history is a very important subject and it was lost in this country a long time ago is even last today with the common core curriculum\nIs not even being taken down by the Trump Administration I don't know if you notice but we thought that we'd be getting rid of the common core curriculum\nBut we haven't Betsy DeVos has not done that she's the education secretary who was castigated by the left and yet she's not ... done much to eliminate the common core curriculum anyway you could see all of this ... all of these ideas and to connect with each other\nSo before I go on to some other subjects here on the Savage Nation and I have some really great soundbites I'd like to take some calls Pam I'm WABC line six go ahead please\nHow much and I like that I can lift his\nEighties now that you've taught me how much are you listening\nTo me on the radio or on the stream\nOr on the radio are\nWelcome January you're

be able to catch the show only on a podcast but what's your main show a point\nI find that line\nAbout the only shock that you know her off on me how to count and call it a shot ignorant about why\nDo you not ignore it that's that's an example of what the left does when they take over a society they tear down the monuments of that society and replace them with their own I'm surprised that our caller Carl Marx day because that's coming next\nI mean if you think that this was a joke you're mistaken\nThe radical left has no infiltrated every avenue of this country and their long march to take over this country and converted into a communist dictatorship that's what your witness with capital which what ... what you saw with the tactics of the communist in the Soviet era where that condemned demand to death without a trial that is what you just saw\nI only five and learning how\nMaybe I'm the most dangerous ... maybe I'm the most dangerous man in America\nMaybe the Democrat committee missed their target by focusing on cabinet or the or focus on me or you may maybe knowledge is the most dangerous thing to Dianne Feinstein and she ought to really make every effort she can to make sure that knowledge is not permitted in America only propaganda\nDemocratic Party well I Hope you go out to the bookstores tomorrow in a van yourself of my great political history book stop mass
