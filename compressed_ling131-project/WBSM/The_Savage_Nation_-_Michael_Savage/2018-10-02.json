that's really starting to eat at me they may actually want it\nThey may actually want the chaos of a civil war I was reading another book a history book not mine called the fall of Rome and the end of civilization by Brian Ward Perkins which I briefly referenced over the years on my show\nAnd there's a line and jumps out to me about the euro barbarian what happened to the invasion of Rome and how it collapsed as a result and now the civilized Roman world collapsed because of the barbarians\nAnd he quotes a a French scholar name Andre ... who wrote about the ah flourishing Christian empire cold

them\nHow come they didn't read thou shalt not bear false witness\nHow can they didn't read it to why they're the same people that tore down the ten commandments across America they work with real the

anywhere in America tear him down and then tear down Columbus along with it tell all of America down and rebuilding the name of the municipal skirt\nThat's why because once you tear it down you can

punishing them with all sorts of things on their body dressing them up in the most frightening costumes that you would see in a horror show all for the children to see\n... San Francisco now that's family values as practice by a Feinstein it below sea here in San Francisco they themselves don't practice it I mean they're all limit you wouldn't expect an eighty five year old to get dressed up as a bear a dog or cat would you know but you could approve of such things\nIt's wholesome it's wholesome and it's it's just choice\nIt's just freedom of choice of expression the beat someone up in the street like that and it doesn't lead to anything worse I mean it's consensual I mean you get a psychological damage individual you're telling me is a dog or lower than a dog and then you abused that person but that's wholesome in San Francisco\nThat's not abuse abuses capital having one too many beers in high school that now that said it was\n... years and never forget what

of great things and evil things and that should be an obvious thing to anyone but apparently the way the narratives being played out but the Democrats are all women to be believed and they were innocent and pure and all manner of evil so you have to destroy the patriarchy\nWhile again let's go back in history in ancient Rome did you know that they're women gladiators with justice bloodthirsty as male gladiators did you know that you didn't know that you know any of that there were ...\nThey get into a justice bloodthirsty as a male gladiators they love blood they loved the blood sport and so that we see the gladiators in modern times sitting on a committee\nLike an ancient Rome destroying a man cutting them two ribbons in front of the public in the public sits like dummies and doesn't see the blood thirsty ness of these women are they more like Venus the goddess of love and beauty or like a Vulcan the God of fire\nNow who was Venus Venus you know that the first five planets in our solar system are named after Roman gods because Romans could see them without a telescope that you know that first five planets named after Roman gods to show the influence of ancient Rome\nSo Venus was the goddess of love and beauty she was the daughter of a Jupiter and the on an ocean side them and Venus was desired as a wife by many of the gods\nAnd she was promised by Jupiter to her brother Vulcan and guess what happened unsatisfied with her marriage to the ugly God\nVenus took many lovers including our own half brother Mars the God of war with whom she got several children well okay that's nothing to do with what we're going through today but sometimes I have to look at history or science so poetry or art\nOr music to get away from the insanity of our times and

going on in America today you have a choice the Democrats or in this case\nThere into crucified people just take a look at the one who's representing all of these fake accusers one of the lowest scum to have ever received a law degree and the areas on every television channel over and over and over again while distinguished\nScholars and broadcasters myself included are completely block from the Soviet networks why is this happening why\nBecause as I just said to you there is a plan this is not happening by accident as included in the ... the beginning of chapter five\nThe essential question a nation that's been forced to ask over and over is who is pulling the strings and why why are why is this happening well let's look at a real war against women\nAnd you'll have to look at the real war against women that as being conducted by those who claimed to be protecting women\nSo we go back to the Salem witch trials and the hysteria against which isn't the Salem region was fermented environment of economic uh socio political turmoil does it sound familiar\nWell it'll be familiar to you after you investigate this a little a little bit more so what was what were the Salem witch trials what happened\nWell the minister of Salem Village was the strict pious Reverend Samuel Paris and he had a son Thomas and two daughters ages eleven at night in January of sixteen Ninety to the girls began having tantrums or fits as they were called at the time\nOf the girls through objects scream made strange noises and twisted themselves into bizarre positions as with John good wins children in Connecticut a doctor was cold and once again unable to cure the girls the physician pronounce the element to be demonic in nature\nLocal girl eleven year old and putting them began having in a similar fashion a pair of magistrates are demanded that the young lady's name the source of there'll be which meant\nOn February ... under pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty Sarah Good a pregnant beg a woman and the Paracels Caribbean slave to the tuba\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did not want in their town\nGood an Osborn profess their innocence to no avail and so did the tuba at first\nThose slaves were rare in the region she had been with Reverend Paris for fourteen years and she loved the Paris children for whom she was largely responsible but Paris whipped er into confessing\nPromising to secure her release if she did so the poor woman admitted to the magistrates that quote the devil came to me and been me serve him an added that she was not the only local which wanting to harm the Puritans she also inform them that she had in fact bake they which cake\nFrom Ryan urine with what she gave the family dog just in case the pet was a familiar or help or of a local which what happened next [noise]\nThe three women wore in prison the next day\nDespite his promise Paris vow to political expediency and allow the slave to remain behind bars we late spring before the governor finally convened the special court order and Terminator as soon as the women were in prison the Salem authorities other took a program we know all too well the auto distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants and farmers if there were challenges to the local theocracy then leaders must create a diversion Diane an event that would dominate what passed for a new cycle of sixteen Ninety two and that was which is right in their midst to Juba had said there were others the word spread that they had to be found\nUsing the tactics of Dianne Feinstein and the committee\nTactics or mass hysteria and paranoia Europe had purged itself of tens of thousands of undesirable that way Salem and it's on ... had to do the same\nAs with so many things one can hold the media partly responsible for this hysteria and I give you some examples of how the media was used in that time through books and publications\nAnd so the hysteria gathered force throughout the early spring and the numbers of those accused continue to grow by the end of may more than sixty people were jailed awaiting trial for witchcraft\nThat was when the governor was finally forced to establish a special court of all your and terminal and what happened then on June tenth that institution Dianne Feinstein hangups first victim Bridget Bishop\nA brash see what it was late husband had run and then she was apparently accused of no crime in particular other than that she was a soft target\nThe woman who was known for playing shuffle board and wearing red clothing which was considered to signify sexual yearning and prowess well it went on and on and on and what happened\nWell caught and mayor put his agenda ahead of justice he crafted the equivalent of fake news and contributed his own call to arms that the court right in the following\nWe cannot but humbling recommend onto the government the speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as we have rented themselves obnoxious according to the direction given in laws have gone and the wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of which crafts\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing or immune from accusation and they went on and they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so now we speed forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years the\nStop mass hysteria I Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern if\nFor example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts that would not have been hysteria and twenty Eighteen this is something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is already get from the media today you would learn that the following that for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia\nAs the mainstream media would have you believe it is fact it is history and I urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I give you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nNot in the media will reference nine eleven is proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at
