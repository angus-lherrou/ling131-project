of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they cheered the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shirts and some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts well what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up\nAnd opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows was it the right wing did you what I said and so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong of course the left would likely to think he settlers the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we\nHave a charismatic leader he had some solutions\nBut his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass\nThose liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point that my show tonight\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut his solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left would say any of us illusions of extreme to the left said the capital was drunk which he wasn't a is a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't and he drank too much of what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what uh Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat do you do he drank vanish habits drank too much about a ... ... what do you what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an operation\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around in cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left and it's super liberalism\nIs a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong you're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that see this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout in in the west\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nAnd things will happen to you can't believe are happening in what happens so fast you'll say it's not happening and liberalism will be there was the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here and the economic downturn that as being predicted\nEconomist is a is inevitable it's gonna happen that I'm afraid if it happens it'll be worse than ever because we're the heightened now of stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money and under the Democrats when we criticize deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have dummy up they shut their mouths you broke your any one of the radio talking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the uh the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's gotta say stop printing the money this is crazy\nBecause someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened and why mark Germany at the end just before all of this\nThat it takes a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how value list the money had become now several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company\nHas not remove the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America some of them posted by enemies and Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teaches us anything there are cycles too at kind of me there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I ride on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the once great United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we'll sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria because Americans by than traditional Americans hardworking roll up your sleeves Americans\nWill be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed sound familiar will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed to dispirited to fight back page three oh three\nStop mass hysteria be right back\nDuring the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five five four
