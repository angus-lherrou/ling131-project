it's going to ... it's going to ramp up\nIts going to ramp up again the hysteria is being whipped up by Bernie Sanders a and others but it's not the first time in American history that this has happened as I point out and stop mass hysteria which is a very important book of politics and history combined [noise]\nBecause you should remember that John Adams himself one of the founding fathers had to overcome the hysteria of his time\nAnd to help see British soldiers acquitted murder was John Adams has stepped in to interfere with that a condemnation you understand what I'm saying to you\nNow the first form of social media gossip in a village you understand that we say Twitter and Facebook and all of that\nThat social media but gossip in a village was the first form of mass

she have to use the the ah the the word a group of use were asked to leave the bowling alley because they were being rowdy and breaking things so they wouldn't beat up the guy behind the thing hitting them in the head with a bowling ball beating them almost to death huge group of use\nSo the country we're living in is not the country that you want to live and and the answer of course is law and order and the cops and not the problem they are the solution okay it's that simple the left has brought us to an on civil rights movement\nThat's right they've initiated an under civil rights movement whether it's what our Dianne Feinstein\nHiding a letter about Dr fraud until the last minute in order to shaft Kavanaugh\nOr Maxine the man woman ... uh what's his name Maxine patterns Manhattan as water is\nA screaming at people telling them to go chase you out of a gas station or out of a restaurant and she's a lawmaker not a law breaker she's a law giver yet she's telling people to break the law why she not thrown out of Congress why because there is no Congress\nThere's no Congress anymore\nOld Jewish man beat up in the streets of Brooklyn by a Muslim man beat some beats beats them beat some sixty eight year old Jewish men on the way to synagogue thirty seven year old Muslim delivery driver that get into some yelling match over across walk the Muslim gets out and beats the guy up in

going on and socialist\nNew York ... but you don't want to talk about that\nA sitting here watching the world go round you know Savage warns stopped the Mavs on nation will fall Savage one stop the Mavs or nation will fall we're living in extremely dangerous times that is the truth and now you have to understand what's going on\nOur entire way of life is being threatened by front groups of individuals who have been out to destroy America for a very long time they think their time has come we're going to show them a that time has gone\nNow you have to understand that the vermin who are doing this or listening to the show right now many of the leaders of listening to the show to hear what you're saying to alter their tactics\nI Know how the game works what they do is attack you you defend yourself and they scream for the police that's how cowards work they start to scream he hit me hit me standard operating procedure cowards\nAre they set your car on fire and then they say that you set your car and fire they're doing this on purpose\nAiming at Republicans conservatives in order to have you react\nSo that they can then point the finger at you as the bad guys and then they can provoke a civil war as well remember what their Amos civil war they literally remember the sixties H wraparound burned baby burn burn baby burnt as what they want they want a whole city to go up in smoke\nThey don't just want to attack a white man in a car in Oregon they want a city to go up and smoke and somebody very carefully don't get caught up in this if you can avoid avoid them at all costs\nI've had an attorney on that Horowitz at another attorney on who's defended a soldier ex military was sitting in a restaurant in Reno nevada if you missed it with his wife and children went three punks of the type that you know the university slime\nCame up and started harassing the whole family and made a children cry and this man said I'm wanting you to get away from the table and they wouldn't and he broke place on their head or whatever you how to do\nOne of them wind up being thrown through [laughter] sorry Ken Offit laughing one went through a plate glass window the others I guess Scott Reed off to a session on how to provoke Republicans and they then he got arrested\nBecause the prosecutors another low life piece of crap up there obviously he arrested the soul to have the cells were arrested\nThey came into court the firemen in body braces making believe there was so violent and the judge threw the case out the window so now they're charging him with other crimes and his lawyers trying to count the charge them with kidnapping which is what I saw immediately\nAnd it's going to get worse before it gets better but someone's asking this doesn't wearing a mask make crime worse when did it become illegal to wear masks in the street uh you don't know how that works the liberals said wearing a full face cover\nMeaning a burqa or whatever they call it while getting
