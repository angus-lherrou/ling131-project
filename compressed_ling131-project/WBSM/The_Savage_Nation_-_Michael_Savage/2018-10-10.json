Democrats week I'm not so sure of that I in fact the Senate maybe\nSee more conservative especially with the way Cabot was treated I think that the secret voter\nThe silent majority of the I got after the find that they got the white male in some cases the white woman has had enough of this they have sons ... that sounds bad uncles brothers and they know that the man and the male is been targeted in this country unfairly and they worry for their children\nSo I'm not sure so sure it's a galaxy sweeping the left\nBut I Want to talk with many of our before we go about racism and bigotry because\nIn my book under a this topic in mass hysteria I said that racism and bigotry you have to defining parts immorality and their legality\nProblem for progressive is is that the first is subjective and off didn't clashes with the ladder for example the bakery that refuses to make a cake for gay couple\nWhen any entrenched group feels threatened by a newly formed identity be marry gays free blacks or transplant that Hispanics who don't necessarily speak the language\nHysteria on the local and national level is invariably that result how that is manifest whether by the formation of the Ku Klux Klan or massive deportations depends entirely on the wisdom and broad based compassion of our leaders but you'll notice in that paragraph\nThat's not really exactly a right wing position is\nNo no and some of the other things and and that's what I Love about you by the way is that you don't do what the mass hysteria by the way sometimes on both sides do and that is his group think enough of that already we look at each issue independently it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican and it's so refreshing that that you do that\nWell first of all I'm an older American male number two on the phone a social worker\nI'm the son of an immigrant actually to immigrants so I grew up with one foot in the old world one foot in the new so I tend to see things in a multiplicity of ways or through a tally of ways and I want to I Want to close with one line actually at the book closes with a line that I Hope\nWill be some benefit to America I kinda doubt it but I like this I said I'm One of his many school supplies I words Benjamin cyclists set of Americans just before he respects the signature on the declaration of independence we must indeed all hang together or most surely will show hang separately does not apply today\nAnd applies exactly to what has been happening not just with Kavanaugh in this case but with all of these New Years against\n'em you against other people in the media and it can absolutely go if if for example the me too movement can also be used against Democrats of people are going to sit there and use it as a\nPolitical weapon and so it looks like the pendulum swing way too far and you're pointing out that this mass hysteria and the guillotine at the end of the day comes for everybody if that's what if that had a revolution\nThat's right that they're pushing you seen as a thirsty blade\nIt has no political affiliation and when the left starts dropping it on the right and then the women start dropping out of the men they don't understand what will happen that study the revolution whether it be a lot of mouths China Soviet revolution Bolshevik rather\nOr um Castro's Cuba after they got to killing their enemies they started killing each other struggling for power\nAnd so you know Alan when the left has removed all the statues of Columbus as they want to do in New York\nAll the Confederate flags all the monuments ... founding fathers when books like mine I've been burned removed from libraries when we have allowed hysterical cries to terminate or terrorize rational discourse\nAs I write we will all I've become a cop can lay there and our son is ... and those are the wreck the test that much to their own infamy with the bones of others I Would I mean by that is where all potential victims of hysteria\nDoesn't matter what side you're on and what I'm suggesting to people to listen to this broadcast and read stop mass hysteria take a deep breath before you vilify your enemy biggest tomorrow and maybe you\n... and learn what is happening in society today and the way that you can do that is is by the book stop mass hysteria America is insanity from the sand them which trials to the Trump witch hunts available at Amazon bookstores on Tuesday Michael Savage thank you so much for being here on air incline investigative radio and Breitbart\nLooked like you would apply Sharon [noise]\nLike that [noise]\nWell that was my interview I did it over the weekend where they are inclined to want to thank Aaron and I want to thank Breitbart one in the last\nBright spots of the conservative media out there they were not afraid to publish a review of the book or interview me as was Chris Ruddy of Newsmax stood by me stood by the movements that by the message\nBut I Want to say to you that you cannot be consistently vigilant if you're hysterical mass hysteria permits you to go along with the unlawful incarceration of people sometimes as was done with the law the unlawful incarceration of Japanese by FDR\nWhich is why it has to be done quickly you see hysteria subsides and passions as the enemy vanishes if the government had allowed its citizens to become rabbit about Germans instead of Nazis\nOr an ... instead of a Japanese we would have turned on ... on Dutch or Hungarians or polls\nIn much the same way that Sikhs were targeted as Muslims after nine eleven because hysterics confused at turbans\nWith the Muslim head dress and that's from page to hundreds of a stop mass hysteria that's for those of you who are skeptical of me and don't really know who you're dealing with

believe we've seen that before and perhaps we have with the red scare and in a few other times uh the war the world's by Austin wells hysteria\nBut what we're seeing now where you have the pillow sees and the finds things using the propaganda tactics of Joseph ... to whip up the masses against that targeted demographic meaning the heterosexual Christian white male this is something new in

something\nI Want to ask you a sincere question have you heard about my book on the other ... conservative shows\nHave you ever heard an audience about Michael Savage on Fox News or any of the other so called conservative stars no you haven't so I'm Alone you're alone but the message is really most important today because unless we stop the mass hysteria\nYou will see a disaster in this nation unlike any we I've seen in modern history there gunning for us\nI saw an article yesterday in Oregon and I put it on Michael Savage dot com it's a fourth down I Believe\nAnd the shocking it's a video of sauce funded anti thoughts hugs who took over the streets of Portland, Oregon\nDirecting traffic blocking cars threatening people didn't obey calling anyone white\nA Ku Klux Klan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you had anti whites in the streets directing cars and the way that gets worse a Portland policemen on a motorcycle sat there and did nothing\nAnd I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the ... that is raining in San Francisco and in Portland and in Seattle and an other Denisovans of extreme left us that is spreading like a cancer\nBecause of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes they're communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been fuel for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi who at UC Berkeley that's University of California at Berkeley thank you are in a commencement speech three years ago said we are all the structures she encouraged\nPeople to go in the streets in cause chaos\nTo block traffic what does she think would happen or by Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist fanatics like those in out they fought to beat up Republicans harassed Republicans I'll drive them out of restaurants I refuse to live in fear and I will not cower myself I'm a public figure\nI perhaps the most prominent member of the opposition in the San Francisco area I Will not\nCower to these people I Will protect myself at all times\nI'm an old boy scout I remember the boy scout motto I Will protect myself at all times and if I feel threatened I Will react accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city of my own home and I hope you feel the same way what began with Trump witch hunt has now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there is no tied to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there is no hysteria and the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria there was a witch hunt against Kavanaugh he wasn't a pa not up for all white\nMale heterosexual Christians why she of course he was well that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very hysterical times and very dangerously hysterical times\nAnd the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new ...\nHave a new car and too many houses no what I'm trying to do here is save America before it's too late and so I'm asking you to Savage army\nTo help me and that means have you gone to your local bookstore to look for the book was the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be in Walmart and Sam's it's in bestsellers and I heard this there\nAt the books and millions on making news table I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchase to be on the new released table between the night of October which is today and the twenty second of October which is not today and I've gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on a new release table or buried underneath other books on a new release table so it's up to you to go there and demand that the book the put where the publisher\nOf paid for the foot because probably the most the for both of our time in fact I Would say can you tell me about ... or more important book [noise] tell me which is more important right now is I don't know if one [noise]\nAnd so what happened when you went into the schools and what are you going to do with it for many of you are buying the book for yourself and friends to try to have a dialogue with them [noise] and that's the main thing\nDid you buy one for your liberal neighbor to read will they even read a book [noise]\nAre you taking my Akron\nAgainst Syria well it was Mr ... himself\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration is that the ... plant in the national security advisor ship\nPosition and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war in the worst way they would bloodthirsty and they wanted war but for some reason the non global is around from\nWar the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria and from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well as a result Haley's resigning that's my opinion maybe disagree with me and I don't know on what basis you would disagree with me\nAnd now we're talking about my book stop mass hysteria what you found in the book stores or on a more intelligent level\nIf you've gotten the book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the best things and\nSo here we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the blacklisting of Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon the you and for me for that matter\nGovernor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those people in uh the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed him and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee\nAnd his show has one of the most loyal and phenomenally larger audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News if not more so in its own time slot\nWherever it is seen now last year\nGovernor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on his show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God faith and reason in the book took off\nLike a rocket after that and I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited the governor onto the show\nTo be with us today and I just got an email it can't joined me because he's prepping U.S House for the hurricane he's in the panhandle of Florida\nBut he's going to join us tomorrow granted his phones are not out from the storm and try to reach us either on a landline or on a cell phone again we want to thank Governor Huckabee for standing with the American people in these dark times especially in these times of media blackout and remember he's been\nHe is himself has been a ... a blacklisted by many many in the media and written off\nAnd he rose from the ashes like a Phoenix as I Hope we will do as well on the Savage Nation\nThere's no hysteria out there and none whatsoever the Washington Post says it's not hysterical or Marlboro not at all judicious timing I Would say well I Would say so many of my loyal listeners understand uh the timing of mass hysteria is perfect right now and we're talking about that\nBut we're talking about the news in the day so Haley resigns and immediately later in the afternoon and right now we hear the Trump is floating the idea of a Goldman Sachs banker unnamed Dina Powell to be the new UN ambassador\nYou say well what's wrong with that\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to clean the swamp\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to not be a global is to not appoint global is so high places I seem to recall that was his campaign slogan right\nNationalism America First can you explain to me how Goldman Sachs and a woman who works for Goldman Sachs representing us in the UN is America First can I explain that to me do you think that threatening war with Syria or Russia\nPuts America First I don't think so and as I said to you and the reason in my opinion that Haley suddenly resigned is because she failed to ignite a war with Russia my bombing Syria about four or five weeks ago when she was beating the war drums I don't know if you remember her speeches one bellicose speech after another\nAnd threatening one day after the other\nSo here we are now they're saying oh well maybe we'll put Goldman Sachs is Dina Powell and they have to replace Haley to me it confirms everything I've been saying now she worked for this government she was working in the administration and she left\nAnd it says Dina has done a great job for the minister action has been a valued member of the Israeli Palestinian peace team well here's your problem\nHere is your problem\nAnd at the risk of igniting a write\nIn directions I Do not want to ignite the right I Will leave out my belief as to who is pulling the switches on this particular situation in the United nations you can't really blame them\nI mean if you're with a tail and you continue to wag the dog for so many years and suddenly the dog said look enough is enough we don't want the tail wagging us you'd be an angry tail wouldn't you or am I speaking an allegory is that are too complex for the average Fox News view or\nWhat do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned because she failed to ignite war with Russia She was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military and to attack Syria and Russia\nLook it's a very complicated game the middle east and you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit here and salute and say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out is because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would have dragged us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that not at all\nI mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist happens is um twelve years old\nAnd a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east it's time to use that instead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that is why Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars not bring us into them\nBut I guess you all forgot that\nAnd on a personal note we know that Trump is surrounded by several factions as are all presidents\nOne of the factions are global lists like Nikki Haley like moustache Leo\nAnd then there are other factions who are nationalist and they vie with each other for the president's attention and then he makes the decisions obviously that's why he's the chief executive well he didn't listen to the global is who wanted him to launch Tomahawk strike against Syria\nFour weeks ago Haley was literally rolling rolling she was on the verge of success our greatest success ever of igniting a war and it made no sense to me\nNone whatsoever\nISIS had been beaten back into one city ... whatever it is and\nRussia and thank God for Russia and Syria and our own warplanes ISIS was beaten back into this one city and in order to make sure that the Syrians and Russians didn't go in to clean out the remaining elements of ISIS in that city\nThere were talks that Saddam was going to unleash chemical weapons on his own people which made no sense whatsoever none\nI mean you're winning a war the whole world is watching everyone as an iPhone you can unleash poison gas on your own women and children who went to that point believe a story like that other than idiots who would buy a story like that and I kept saying this weeks and weeks ago don't do it they'll do it they'll do it\nI sent a message after a message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know they received them\nAnd they know one thing about the Savage Nation so long as I'm Still here as long as I still have a loyal audience which I Do you are the base that elected Donald Trump not the Johnny come lightly none of them elected Donald Trump you did\nAnd now that I've said that I'm going to say something else so it's not lost to history I Will rest knowing and my family knows and they're pretty bright people\nThat it was I who helped push Donald Trump into the public eye and pushed him over the finish line he even said the same thing to me put his arm around me and said without this man I wouldn't be president I Am proud to tell you that I have saved the western world\nFrom the total insanity that they wore and still are engaged in that is how I see it and then as how that is how my Britain family sees it and I don't need the approval of anyone else in the media I Know what's right I Know what's true\nDuring the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five four hundred seven to eight to

something\nI got to tell you what I went through yesterday I had one of the lowest days of my contemporary life I take my show and my publishing Korea very seriously so may I share this with you\nI tried to bicycle every morning before the show like an hour or two before the show\nI bicycle neither bay now we're about to tell you I'm telling you because I didn't do what I felt like but I thought came through my mind\nI'm a former voter I spent a lot of time on the water I looked out across the bay I felt like stopping the bicycle and walking into the bank drowning myself and that was a fleeting moment and I know I shouldn't admitted to you\nBut I Am an artist I Am a performer and if you think this is an act you are mistaken\nEverything that I Do on the show I Do from the heart\nAnd I felt as though I had failed I'd failed my listeners I had failed America I failed the movement I failed my publisher I read years ago that there was a flurry of maybe Twenty years ago Thirty years ago of Japanese exchange students who if they failed to achieve\nThe top of the clash when they came over here to go to college there was a a rash of suicides because they felt ashamed that they have failed their family and their answer strict we thought that that was crazy I made of the same exact cloth the differences\nThinking things are doing things I told your years ago that I learned this many years ago and is a very important piece of information on knowledge rather wisdom\nA crazy person is not defined by what he or she thinks crazy as what you do not what'd you think do you understand what I just set the you crazy is what you do not what'd you think many people would like to go out and ride it in the streets but they don't do it\nThey're not crazy the vermin on the left who go out and riot are crazy and violent and belong in prison that's not free speech to beat people up in the streets\nBut that's a separate topic for another day so now I just get the news that without any help in the media I had a few shows here a few shows their band and blocked by many others that's the way it is they have no obligation to have me on their show\nThe book is number three first day of sales which seven books coming out yesterday some of them buying entire websites number three why because it's\nMy audience did it not me I didn't go out to the bookstores you did and so all I can say is please keep up the momentum give that book away to a policeman but I Am a cup of coffee at the same time we're policewoman [noise]\nThey're all we have that thin blue line that's all we have between us and total social breakdown now I gotta tell you them that this is this is what's been going on Obama and Eric Holder weaken the police for eight straight years\nThey soften them up as in a war as you know in a war you soften up the enemy with an artillery barrage and then you send in the infantry Obama and holder soften up the police around America with one lie after another with one attack after another with\nOne talk I'm Amy ... left wing ... lawyer from NYU after another set out to every police department in America to monitor the apartments to make sure that police doctors frightening is Vernon that's what they did\nYou think the cops aren't capable of breaking the scholars are those who attack you as they did in my day that would uh busted scholars wide open there wouldn't have been innocent America\nA number of years ago nobody would tolerate this are the same society ... years that Obama that rat and his friend rat holder weaken the police right strict as a made up lies with their friends or the media that Jake Tapper still Wolf Blitzer is made up stories and they were targeting a certain race\nAnd as a result the police were terminated now they're sending a shock troops the left wing environment from the colleges so votes will attack you and the police stand down so we have a war going on in America now enter the next the next one Hillary Clinton comes up now gives a speech\nShe doesn't want civil society so again what's the signal to the ... attack anyone you want wherever you want\nAnd that's why I dedicated this book and I promise

restaurant felt the stuffing themself what a restaurant has to do well\nIn the restaurants are are trapped in the old days you're imagining you rented Italian Restaurant to little Italy and the owner was a Chinese guy would have thrown them in the gunner you would have pulled a club out some behind the counter smash their head and throwing them in the gutter they never would have allowed that in a restaurant but those days are long over\nWhere the bikers came in and Goodfellas and they lock the doors and beat him up with a Bronx Tale either one it how it used to be but it doesn't it doesn't operate like that anymore and operate\nSo okay so we're now powerless to the ... so what are we supposed to do\nWell you could hire an attorney after the fact that sue the restaurant\nNo no no I'm Talking about at the time the sub bond that you would there screaming and yelling can you sprayed them in the face with pepper spray if you're threatened\nIf you are if they are in imminent danger and you feel that you are immediate apprehending harm of your life or immediate uh counterpart yes you can your cat bond\nWhat if you're a middle class white couple I'm gonna make it very personal in your sixties and a group of rabble come up and scream at you call you names racial epithets like white this Whitey as they did in Portland is that none of salt that's a form of assault isn't it\nThat is that is a form of assault and the individual assaulting people will be held liable if they're caught by that\nBut at the mouth and I caught I caught\nWell the cops stood there on his motorcycle I haven't seen him get fired yet by the mayor Ted Wheeler I think it is uh Portland, Oregon I mean the ... the cop was on a motorcycle and the same street they were doing this to people the black lives matter people calling them every name under the sun and re directing traffic\nOr you can blame the cop on not blame the copy blame the mayor is the issue here\nBut what's the good of blaming anybody if they attacked the man who was in a car is Seventy years old and started banging on his car with sticks what what could he do\nThat he got out for some reason I Know you're you're talking about oh man and elected he jumped out and look at it and he actually did the right thing after word got back in the car and left because they like standing there he would have done more damage your mad at her but he did the right thing by leaving\nBut no one has been arrested by the mayor of the city of Portland, Oregon and out of control how long will a garbage can he used to be one of the most beautiful cities on the west coast it has become a filthy garbage can\nLike San Francisco under the liberal totalitarian fascist to run this city Seattle Portland [noise] uh San Francisco\nI can name five other cities that have deteriorated as a result of ultra tolerance under the guise of liberalism\nAnd so what is the average law abiding citizen supposed to do hide\nUnder under federal law frame and the federal court brain a local municipality and do the math\nThat there are possibilities for individuals agree there are federal alternative however that goes to show that those states and cities are operating like a neo Confederate the not abiding by the laws that you're not going\nWhile I like that and the confederacy so in other words they've already declared a a break away from the union and they're running under their own advocate slack\nFor years unfortunately for years unfortunately and now All right\nWell thanks lawyer lawyer or a Chris thanks for your sage record but what I hear from you is don't do anything basically\nA until you're attacked now I'm not so sure that's the right approach\nTheir arm intermediary steps such as taking out your ... your iPhone and photographing them the way they like to do the way they were rationing police now for Twenty years immediately get out your iPhone started photographing them the minute they knock your iPhone to the ground and grab it they've committed a felony is that correct\nKind of thing you know if they're trying to take it from you in terms of criminal law once they use physical forced to take an item from someone that becomes robbery is well that's all right\nI'll ... who's going to help you with that point the restaurants going to send out the ... the Marines is going to help you know yeah I ... it was going to help you nobody\nNine one one you're right you're right I mean we're at a point of no return it the police are bigger than I think you're perfectly for dedicating your vote to the police law enforcement\nWill let me send you a copy of stop mass hysteria which more lawyers like you understood\nWho the police really are and the left wing vermin lawyers and go after the police are actually the or the equivalent of the retroviruses that attack our own immune system and prevent diseases that are nations or under the surface to proliferate\nA I'm a student of epidemiology and I do know how it works and went our own defense sells the white cells\nAre attacked by a white cells that have been infected by a certain virus\nAnd then attacked the white cells themselves and start killing our immune system\nNow you understand who left wing lawyers are and what they do to our police who are our first line of defense against invaders by infecting the defense cells themselves including many police departments have been invaded by them Obama carefully made certain both our military and our police\nHad been I'm ah in my shoes the correct word he had been infected\nWith these retroviruses called ultra liberals in law enforcement it's almost a misnomer how can you be an ultra liberal and be a law enforcement what does that mean you're gonna selectively not enforce the law if you like the politics of those breaking the law is that what it means yes that's what it means to Eric Holder\nSo now we are seeing the world when that was unleashed upon us by the Obama holder team up to ... we got a two for out of them okay so now we have a new president what can they actually do about this [noise] I'll tell you what he's going to Martha Martha de down\nI told you that I Lived through the Vietnam War protests I saw the organizations and how they worked I saw the Chicago Seven trials\nI Know the whole story of the Abbey Hoffman's on the other room and I saw them operate I saw what they did to this country and now we have Bernie Sanders and others trying to recreate the very same thing Bernie Sanders the communist\nBernie Sanders the a ... of the devil and Carl Marx himself in my opinion trying to stir up a massive communist revolution in this country with millions upon millions of losers and drug addict the children who do not know history not even knowing what they are
