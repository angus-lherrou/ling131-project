problem is the government in the media are going to call them and not seeing a fascist and I would suggest that um all of the wonderful good liberals out there take one of these people in their own how home\nTake him in because you don't have secret yet you may as well get some or as we discussed yesterday if you like one of the polio like symptoms or you can just bring it right into your household\nBut you don't want it in your own backyard you don't want it in your living room you want others to take them in and then of course the liberal argument as well with all that money spent on the military we can be spending the money on the immigrants and on the poor and on the homeless I've heard it before\nI heard it for Thirty years\n[noise] and so this is a big story there's a question about sending the military to close the southern border long overdue as I said yesterday the solution is simple there in Mexico\nYeah they're moving through Guatemala into Mexico we have a new deal with the Mexican people based on NAFTA\nThere are new friends great friends we heard it's the greatest deal on the planet a beautiful deal a wonderful deal it's a beautiful deal it's a great deal it's a wonderful deal we've all heard over and over again it's a beautiful beautiful deal a wonderful deal a beautiful deal a wonderful deal a beautiful deal with Mexico\nWell now's the time to ask a Mexican friends to keep them in the holding places that they're in they have 'em down they look at the pictures\nSo they're down there and um don't let him into this country's a thousand percent right to put troops on the border excuse me what are our troops for\nAren't they they have to defend the protect America water troops for what the living for the pension asserted that missile over white they can't even pick up a gun\nThey belong on disability support the ones that are able to carry a gun on the border and say you're not coming in and that's the ultimate let Mexico take care of them and send them back where they came from after the given the care that they need what is wrong with you people how many people can we take into this country cowards on the run I saw this this\nI got so angry I was livid moment developing her turns on cowardly hunters after they gunned down a bull elephants\nIf you'll listen to that the sound of those elephants after one of their ... elephants are shocked by these too fat pieces of garbage so there's a herd of beautiful noble creatures a family of elephants a herd of elephants which are more nobility the most human beings\nAnd these two fat disgusting so called hunters both for the St ... and they used to shoot in between the eyes this was in the ...\nSo these two fat gunman aim at the beach from a distance as once as the other hand it between the eyes or both\nOf the fat ugly hunters hit one of the bowls and stumbles and then the ... men too fat white man in shorts\nTurn and run screaming as the the hurt turns on them [noise]\nYou'll hear you trumpet erupting from one of the elephants as the hunters become the hustle [noise]\nNow I got to tell you something I Believe in self defense not hunting defenseless write that one though [noise] I Believe in self defense not hunting defenseless [noise]\n[noise] so\nAre you putting your retirement savings and a four O. one K. IRA or investment accounts\nTwo main points to make a I'm a college admissions consultant who serves primarily Asian Americans but also a white Americans\nOn my first point is that basically white students actually set the standard for admissions at all the schools from Harvard to Berkeley\nAh there's actually an admissions formula where a point source signed for your grades your test scores and your accomplishments or what happens is that a Asian Americans when they can keep those that are score to for admissions are penalized during the process actually at points attracted from their overall score\nFor being for being too smart correct\nA civil service or it's a reverse IQ in other words ... using the reverse IQ to admit people the dumber you are the better off you are\nWhat you have to understand is that true purpose of affirmative action and these quotas the purpose is to make sure that a white liberal maintain that at least the plurality but ideally a majority on campus because if they don't have the numbers\nThat will reached a tipping point where white people no longer want to go to schools like Harvard and the wound up like Cal Tech in Berkeley were basically there are dominated by age not because Asians um\nHave necessarily a the ... everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're in the majority and\nSo what do you actually saying there is there there isn't discrimination against Asians\nDiscrimination against their agents for is that what I tried to say is that agents actually have the highest benchmark highest standard of all the races followed by white there the standard basically the benchmark and blacks Hispanics Native Americans active points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during the the the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian American suit Harvard and found out that they are being top loaded against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nHigher and higher than any of the ... that's a that's the main point and the purpose behind that again is not for diversity but to make sure that white liberal do not fall into the minority because then they would reached that tipping point like just like we have white flight in the cities and yes white flight here in northern California\nWhite people no longer want to live in neighborhoods are what ...\nSaying with the colleges to Harvard and Yale\nYou're white people don't want to live in Asia neighborhoods does that affect\nEver have you ever seen neighborhoods in Fremont Cupertino San Francisco where all the white people go we're going to public school\nHow wait wait a minute how come Nancy Pelosi has and fled yet\nBecause first of all she's a grandmother and second of all her kids if they go to school for grandkids I should say we'll go to private ... high schools they\nWon't ... ... in other words it doesn't apply to her\nCorrect\nSo what what do you think needs to be done to make things fair for everyone\nWill obviously the missions formula has to be a sun apply equally all races you can't have a penalty for being Asian and a a a points just for being black or Hispanic Native American the way it has done today and we have to let the\nUrine admissions consulting so let's look at Harvard for example a gala printed in the same thing applies to all of the schools\nHave subjects that are extremely difficult that you can't say whether it be astrophysics organic chemistry or things like that are you telling me that the kids who admitted with these rigs scores are able to compete in those classes\nNail head they don't major and physics or electrical engineering oh\nSo what do the kids who admitted under these weeks than as what did they major in\nMajor in anything with the words study that they're with Africa man [laughter] that's funny\nBut many of the studies the examples of what they major in\nEither ... or even environmental science which is a bogus science\nYes of course it's environmental studies which means whatever you want to make it into this not a science social studies going through a metal knows if you want to if you want to go look at bums in the street that social studies\nDon't go into a math department at Harvard or the electrons Hartman at MIT and where do you see it's all Asia but white people don't want to go there anymore\n... wait a minute it's all Asians because whites can't get in because they're not smart enough or they don't even apply\nApply their intimidate they get\nWhat are they in what what are they intimidated by\nYou know exactly what I'm Talking about they're committed by seeing so many hardworking Asians and they sit there and they think oh my God I'm not going to be able to fly through college I'm going to go and major in something easier and usually the cop\nOut and you're actually saying the white kids are afraid to go to Harvard now\nA yes they are for certain majors I of course they're never going to have any trouble majoring in history right as long as they all of the party line\nI don't know where you're coming from actually you're starting to be willing to me now I don't quite know what you're saying on one hand you're saying that the admissions are rigged against whites and Asians and then you're saying that whites are cowardly and don't even want to apply\nWhat I'm saying like it was that there are academic get academic ghettos for Asians or guess what the STEM fields the fields where they got it right the the lesser students go away towards away from them because those are you you're\nNot implying that there are no you're not implying that they are white students can't make it an electrical engineering or are you\nNot at all not at all I'm I'm implying that there are many fewer or because they are many of them are intimidated by\nSo where where is a white kid a straight eight apply if he wants to go into electrical electrical engineering where do you apply\nFor break it apply to MIT they can apply to Cal Tech or even vote right but\nAnd they and they don't have the same skewed admissions policies\nWell they can get in based on a formula but they're not to live with their race\nOh you mean Thomas is actually the one of the worst examples\nOf course they are they they set the standard for everyone I say they\nSay they set the standard for racism now Harvard that's the new ... new distinction\nCorrect they they uh they penalize Asians and everyone else followed them because again they didn't want to reach that tipping point where the student body because majority age when that happens all the white liberals are going to leave and where do they go from there I\nI have a PHD from UC Berkeley and I remember what was going on with so many Asians because they're good students they study hard they come from families that push them very hard\nThe whole tiger mother thing their background has won a scholarship and learning or else you're a loser it's that simple so I admire them and I would see the number of agents growing growing going you know what I said if people I don't care if it's a hundred percent Asian and wouldn't matter to me if they all get in based on brains it wouldn't matter to me at all\nAnd so said Reagan when he was governor of California [noise] but basically go to Berkeley saying what you see you see hardly any white students correct\nI haven't been there in twenty I won't even go over the bridge\nOkay\nYeah I Know I ... I basically never go to the East Bay I have nothing drawing you that's kinda sad I used to love Berkley I won't go there it's heartbreaking to go there the last night I went there and looked like a male strum insanity of all they do is ride on the campus I mean there was no reason for me to go there\nSo you're saying that the world has shifted so dramatically but isn't this um lawsuit going to straighten things out a little bit\nWell it depends you and I both know that it's probably going to why the court system for many years and of course Harvard and all the uh didn't leave a paper trail and they were they were given carte blanche to do this\nThe decision ... Seventy eight where you could use race as a factor law have explicit quota but didn't they didn't write causes them they just put it in their head and say okay every time we get an Asian students practically every time we have a black Hispanic Native American\nIn your opinion has society benefit benefited from affirmative action\nNot at all because when you look at for example at the top two universities the the under represented minorities have a much lower graduation rate than whites and Asians and they do and\nWhat about the lawsuits against the university I as anyone calculated what percentage come from which race\n[noise] yes of course it's been calculated for that obey except this race by race so the except this race race a race by race a white people with the exact same standard as an Asian have tripled acceptance rate of and an Asian student\nLife at all and uh a Spanish student conversely have tripled the acceptance rate of uh what students with the exact same statistic [noise]\nIt's a terrible situation when you're a young person who's working hard to be knocked out because of the way you you look in your race it's horrible and I see and it's the opposite of what our U.S Constitution and bill of rights permits\nMore specifically it violates proposition two oh nine which state law but of course in a lawless state propositions don't mean anything unless they advance the Marxist agenda\nUniversity of California did to the to get around it as they hired more black Hispanic admissions officers readers for during the ... and those admissions officers were obviously more sympathetic towards black Hispanic students\nAre you yourself Asian or Caucasian or what\nI Am an agent who attended uh Berkeley and Ivy League schools as well wow so\nYou know what hard workers weren't you driven by your parents to succeed\nYes I was in so where are all of my family as well\nAs I was I I mean ... either we made it all you can say outcasts and in my world I mean I just the God we were pushed that's how that's how it kid makes you can't tell them that if he can't study yeah as\nAfter twenty five months of pre production filming began on August twenty
