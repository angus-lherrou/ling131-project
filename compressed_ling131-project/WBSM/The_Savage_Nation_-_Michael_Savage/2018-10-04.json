the ... the the I don't even know where right where the respect as the wrong word their opinion the average person's opinion of Congress is at an all time low the average person's opinion of the media is lower than that of Iraq dropping in a New York's sewer\nPeople hate the media and last night we hit a new low a new low in America below that it actually is worse than anything I've ever seen about the ... republic which was so degenerate that the average German who was not an extremist by the way you have to understand something about the rise of Hitler the average German hated Hitler\nWas only

center left instead of center right that's what's gonna happen across the media landscape center left instead of center right and they're making a disastrous era\nOr on many many levels so now we see what happens when you stand up to the establishment and when the establishment becomes degenerate and sick\nAnd you say nothing about it you are allowed to function in this society but if you speak out against that you yourself become the victim the truth dies and along with it the truth teller\n\nLast night Trump gave a speech in front of a crowd\nAnd while he is right about what he said about Dr fraud the optics are awful he went off the rails now mind you I'll repeat what I said he's a hundred percent right in what he said about Dr fraud he does everything right from the heart\nAnd since this whole Ford Kavanaugh thing began he's been very measured in his comments he really didn't take sides always the front of the cabinet and always giving credence to Dr fraud\nAnd he doesn't even acquiesced to Democrats in waiting another week so the FBI could investigate these claims again I Want to repeat Trump is right about what he just said last night but the optics are awfully went off the rails you see in front of an adoring crowd in Mississippi he mocked Dr frauds testimony\nTo the tremendous applause we heard it\nAnd what happened every news Cast Lead with this all of the ... media outlets all a twisted sister's in the news business\nWe're having panel discussions on Trump's horrible treatment of sexual abuse survivor he gave them the father they were looking for\nNow this doesn't affect solely the media or the Democrats but demon cat voters who are already looking to take out Republicans and the demon cat fringe activists\nWho are lovely confronting Republicans everywhere they can run into them\nOr it also feeds reasons for guys like Jeff Flake stir\nAnd Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to not support cabin or in a vote on the floor I think it was a terrible miscalculation on the president's part and I have to ask why does he do this\nWhy is it that when President Trump is in the White House setting he controls himself but when it gets in front of a crowd\nHe makes you believe or he sounds as though he's speaking on a telephone to a television personality of calls from all the time and I think that's the problem\nI think what happens he goes off the phone from this TV personality goes on a stage after getting pumped up by him I think she's on television when he's not he has to think about the consequences of what he is saying\nAnd so as I say to you this is a very difficult time to be in the media is especially when I'm Michael Savage and the Switzerland of talk radio right that one down I declare myself the the Switzerland of talk radio\nWhy do I say on the Switzerland of talk radio well for one I'm not a registered Republican I never have been in fact uh I don't go to Republican events I generally don't like Republicans\nHowever in the times that we are in there's no clear a choice than ever as to the safe for party for most Americans and that is certainly not the lying filthy degenerate Democrats the ...

because they are part of the cartel which is a shame\nNot all conservatives are a member of that cartel they also are blocked from fellow news which by the way is going through a big change now that lack when Murdoch took it over you're gonna see heads rolling out of that studio he's a super liberal from London\nHe does not want some of the people who are on Fox News to remain and they've known the actual is going to fall one they wait until you see what happens in the next few months\nI don't know what they're going to do once they get off the phone news I don't know where they're going to go watch CNN MSNBC I don't know where they're going to find a job I guess they could always get to Dixie cups and the string in a video camera and podcast themselves\nAnd then they'll find out what it
