destroy the healthcare system once and for all joined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred seven eight five four hundred and seven to eight to [noise]\nI'm taking biography tired of paying fifty dollars per capita\nHuh All right we can get your calls if you want would rather hear me talk about it well let's begin in the segment by playing some rational sound here is representative Louie Gohmert on the migrant invasion and clip number one on the Savage Nation\nThe president made no bones about it and uh uh actually he can take is the lead from the Democrats a Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but and I think six to enact a bunch of ... gangs came across\nThe border and New Mexico and build a bunch of people are not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border\nBut uh he sends you know pushing into Mexico now President Trump's I'm going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear ... miss basically is an invasion and it needs to be stopped\nNow we hear the president himself talking about who's funding this clip to on the Savage Nation\nAnd now we're starting to find out and I won't say a hundred percent I put a little tiny question mark at the end but a lot of money spent passing to people\nTo come up and try and get order by election day\nBecause they think that's a negative for us number one they're being stopped and number two\nRegardless that's our issue\nPoking their being stopped well how President Trump were behind you on this make no mistake about it we back you on this end by the way most Democrats back you want us to get the leadership they don't back anything except anything that's stabbed us in the back\nHow you're going to stop them well this is from an earlier speech a week ago but listen to number three and see what he said last week\nAs you know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border if that's because the illegal immigration onslaught\nBrought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or change the laws they like it they also here everybody coming is going to vote Democrat hey [noise] they're not so stupid when you think about it\nThe in the crazy Democrat refused to support any form\nOf voters legislation defects our absolutely horrible fashion low poll written immigration laws\nOkay good that's good talk but now we need action\nHe's a man of action he's built buildings all over the world he's not just a man of talk he's a man of action that's why we loved him and we want action we we love the talk now we need the walk and so what's the walking to be you're not with advisor to the president you the restaurant owner\nYou the Baker of wedding cakes you the mechanic use a retired housewife\nYou the officer of the law who sees every day what these people go to this country knew the people running poverty programs who know that there's limited amounts of money you the nurses you the doctors tell me what you would do if you were on President Trump's advisory board\nAnd he listened to us that are listening to newsmen rather commentators of Fox News almost exclusive to everyone else how is that possible how can you run a government listening only the people on Fox News let's say they're nice people liquid people they're smart people are they the best people in the smartest people on the planet\nThey know more than everyone on the planet because they're on Fox News with a camera and they're All right\n'cause they're not upon make them and make a tie and read a script\nI don't think that the smartest people on the planet I didn't say that the stupidest do the worst but I Would say a amongst many there are some there may be others with better ideas\nAnd so what are your ideas you know have a chance on the Savage Nation to call the show and be heard by a lot of people I don't know the number that doesn't really matter and remember your your comment is like a pebble in a quiet pond\nAnd it will spread like ripples throughout the landscape what would you advise to stop this human ah assault well there are no better ideas and the ones I've given but maybe you think you have a better idea what ... what is your idea though\nJames I cast a vote you say it's a negative to put the military why\nWell I'm retired police as Dr Savage I'm really concerned about ... [noise]\nBecause [noise] are they going to arm the military which they should be and and really think that with the national Institute of I mean for it and um\nAlthough you're a thousand percent right because the the Hondurans Guatemalans ... Salvadorans will provoke an incident to get shot they won gunfire into the crowd\nThey should\nHire more border patrol and physically place him on the order is set of you know driving around and stuff [noise] but I really think that\nI think that it's I think once they get to the border it's over the game is game over\nThey need to be stopped in Mexico so the pressure has to be applied in the Mexican government to use their military their police there federal ice or whatever they have to use to build a barricade that they cannot cross when that barricade his armored cars\nPolice cars it doesn't matter what the barricade consists of they must create a temporary barricade that cannot be crushed by anyone\nAnd they must funneled is this human wave into a narrow area that can be contained\n[noise] if the United states somehow ...\nGovernment control it [noise] I think that's a thought but I really don't think we should put\nWell you're right in the first of all the military's not designed really for a non combat situations unfortunately has been turned into a they miss\nWe are well you're right the first\nOf all the military is not designed really for a non combat situations unfortunately has been turned into a they've been turned into police in too many actions but they are trained to take on enemies and kill them not trained really to stand there\nI mean let let's look at the training of military how do we how we wouldn't battles in Iraq for example Afghanistan well right now in Syria wherever the battles going on here you have met or aggressive who go into battle to charge the enemy and and destroy them that's what the military is trained to do not to act as international not not to act like the un\nOh let's call out the UN the useless you get when\nWhere is the un now that we need them those bombs sucking us dry those ... those bums\nA mutt that that's an in joke sorry about that\nNow where are the books and the bumps in the UN why don't they send the UN to I voted to protect us you and You're Joking you know what those initials stand for don't you start a family show okay let's take some more calls KB why our radio kale line nine or ... what's your solution\nFor among vote for him on cargo ships or something I feel videos of them I mean they're strengthening demanding aggressive graph history\nFor they look like very weak downtrodden and people who are in need of help would they look like strapping young men\nThey got close on fresh American ...\nYeah where they get the new sneakers or new shirts and the clean clothing ... who is doing laundry for them\nAnd maybe the Catholic social services oh\nMy goodness we finally had bingo\nWe had we had gold yeah the good friend of Michael march the pope\nIs the Catholic Church that lives off this this is one of the number one cash cows for the Catholic Church is illegal immigration did you do know that right\nYeah and then you then you look at all the pieces that are sitting empty in America with those nice beautiful ... buildings the American stopped going they're not buying that movie anymore so what better way to fill up the pews them with people from the third world who still believe in the act\nAnd so what you do as you get you know they're very smart you got to hand it to the Vatican they get billions of dollars from the U.S government to destroy the U.S government it's incredibly smart you know you really have to be close to God to forgive something like that out must take a break\nDuring those Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred

the man we elected because he said he would do this now it's true we have a little time but you know there's going to take a lot of time to build at a barrier in Mexico\nWe're not talking about a structure we're talking about the Mexican government putting a patrol cars tanks whatever they need to do and build a natural barrier and follow the people into that natural ... and not let them go forward that's what has to happen\nBut Mexico doesn't want to do it for two reasons they don't want them there [noise] they have their own internal problems\nThey can't afford to take care of them nor can wait so what do you deal with the human tidal wave\nThat is about to engulf you and you're not even wearing a life jacket [noise]\nWell we should have built that wall [noise]\nSan Francisco we

immigrants\nWell the answer to that is what would the vermin and the media do what would the fake news men do with the New York times in the Washington Post it was screaming we're not fake news\nTell me what all the anti Americans were in high places this tiny percentage there's maybe one percent of the American population if that in the media who hate this country especially its sovereignty tell me what that less than one percent of anti American farmers will ... will say tell me\nI'm trying not to get excited but we're being controlled by a very small tiny minority of people in this country have way too much power over the survival of the nation\nIs all about optics it's all about optics you're telling me that these mobs wouldn't make a young woman and baby in a baby carriage be the first into that barbed wire for you know\nI use the mobs would push the shot that the women and children into the barbed wire and make sure that the the CNN people there make sure that they are ... of the world a cost the American conscience with their fake news\nI think I'm gonna start using the words fake news more now because they don't like it when they were all complaining that it might cause violence they've already cause violence now they're screaming let's stop it before someone gets hurt a dummies isn't plenty of people's hard on our side\nSo you want to tamp down the rhetoric you want to stop hating Trump for a little while why don't you try that Mr sucker of CNN\nMr Zarqa should stop the hatred for a while but let's go back to your uh your point is that the only solution as a barbed wire barrier\nWhat that's what I thought that was my theory but in the same token I can understand where you're coming from\nAnd it's got a grant for all the ... or how about\nThe which is on MSNBC what are the which is that I missed him is he going to do with it the anti American anti family anti got anti Christian women on MSNBC what are they going to do with it or that felt good boy it felt good saying that I'm ... years whether all the ... on MSNBC the anti American\nAnti family anti God which is on MSN NBC men and women what are they going to do with this with with such a fence I don't know I'm gonna send you a copy of stop mass hysteria maybe you can convert one person to reality in New York if you're calling from New York I don't even know\n[noise] well I'm open for business here I promised other stuff we're only talking about the Caribbean what if you won the Powerball mega million sixty one point six billion dollars how much would you actually pay\nWell mostly if you don't know that we will make more than a certain amount of pay thirty seven percent of our income to the feds and then if we live in New York\nOr California we pay him a lot more New York has the highest state tax in the country and then California is running a close second about twelve to fourteen Fifteen Percent in the state on top of federal tax which used to be the duck the bow from federal income tax\nBut when Trump's tax plan in place we can no longer the duct our state income tax payments from a federal income and so therefore we're actually paying more taxes in California did you know that no no this is this is a terrible reality\nSo that's the top income tax rate for individuals is thirty seven percent\nAnd that rate applies to adjusted gross income uh five hundred thousand or more so if you hit the jackpot you'll pay at least thirty seven percent and then state taxes depending upon the state you live in [noise] after all the gangs have to take their cut to you\nKnow the gangs that are run the states need to take their cut how else can they buy their new brownies suits and they're five hundred dollar ties how can you buy a breed only Sunni unless you're taking the money from the the ...\nSo how we going to stop this this is a math these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you but you want a little tiny a string about when Rome was broken into by the vandals in the ... when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like the little little history\nNow do you find that offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men barbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right to snow killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical so let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people\nOf the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly controllable I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you're in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have the deranged walking the streets but I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I'd I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nA barrier broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which were called their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know like the whole story now go get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr or something that's a little you know ... somebody\nAnd so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire in the in the east and west whale also describing stop mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was lifted a very important for you to hit us\nThe empire in the third century it was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't a gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating Miley and then they face the barbarians on the borders\nAnd get us just what happened next\nWell all along the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and then you enemies will now pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the Rhine\nIn North Hungary where the vandals in what was once that's a year and is now we're mainly\nThe
