war on cash part to call a hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six now\n[noise]\n[noise]\n...\nRealize that that's a west side story on now you understand this couldn't be produced today because of the communist fascist who are running the media\nAnd all of the others who would say is racist even make a play about white people are coming in what do you think that coming you for if it's a racist nation that coming for what the racism that coming after everything's free in America what do you people stupid\nYou know I'm going to refer to migrate book mass hysteria because no one else will and if I don't who will you America's anchor hammer is going to try to go buy it wall Bangor\nIs going to tell you to look at the greatest book of our time I don't think America's anchor hand will acknowledge Michael Savage\nNor the others the Oprah shoot I was going to mention it on Fox News so I'm going to tell you that this is the most important book for you to have in your hands right now and I read you one paragraph if you disagree with me tell me why\nToday's Republicans joined with Democrats to demand an end to separation of families as the illegals cross the border we see the warning I put forth coming to fruition\nCongressional Republicans as well as high profile conservatives have caved to the emotional outcry championed by the leftist media oddly enough they're concerned for these children has only come about under the Trump Administration as this practice was largely ignored in the Bush Obama era\nNot only as Congress rejected efforts throwing mediate these practices but there's also failed to replace the largest immigration family detention center ... who do entail a Texas\nYet again we witnessed the media the Democrats and even Republicans being persuaded by madness\nPublic figures are attempting to influence the masses with outrageous statements and exaggerations\nMost irresponsible came from former CIA director Michael Hayden as he compared this policy to Nazi Germany on Twitter the former CIA director wrote other governments have separated mothers and children along with a black and white photo of the work it out concentration camp and death capital polling\nAs one commentator pointed out there's this page thirty three of mass hysteria\nThere were no cafeterias on teachers in video games in the country in training camps of Germany the kids that are amnesty detection facilities have all of this and more there this is nothing but left is try to avoid the real issue of a need for the Democrats the sign on the legislation that will address our immigration laws\nAnd other found are any in their pockets and wrote this\nThe national socialist German Workers Party AKA Nazi Party murdered six plus million innocent shows that committed the crimes\nThe national socialist American non worker AKA Democratic Party has slowed at sixty million innocent babies chopped them up their types chopped up their tiny bodies and solve the parts with the same as zeal shown by their ancestors and the ss who pulled gold out of the teeth of their victims\nFor me the moral outrage from the common useful idiot on the left rings just a bit hollow\nAnd so now we're being dragged into it an emotional hysteria and my friends again I asked you to please pass a copy of mass hysteria out and the few days the remains\nSo you will see who is actually pulling the strings on this invasion\nAnd if you think that there are no politicians on the Republican side who are making and we'll make fortunes off\nThe surge of immigrants and have been making fortunes\nI can give you a shopping list of their names it's all found and stop mass hysteria the most important for you will by this year [noise] joined the Savage Nation coal no he's five five four of us seven eight five four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nI'm sure he's up at night wondering what can I actually do every scenario imaginable runs through a person's mind doesn't that run through your mind when you're facing a problem\nWhether it's a child who's in trouble or a bad marriage you've probably neutralizes everything you think that you're going to do you think I'll do this than something than your mind says no you can't because of that so if you weigh him you say okay we'll put troops on the board and I can't do that because I\nWas a hundred of reasons why he should but he can't so what county do tell me what he actually can to\nBuild a wall well that should've been done a long time ago that's what he was elected for that was his signature campaign issue I Can't blame them entirely Congress has stood in the way every step of the way the obstructionist Charles Schumer has held up the money\nA pillow she washed the feats of the illegals et cetera so they never wanted a wall they live off illegal aliens\nThe governor of the state of California the governor of the state of New York I Will put my career on the line and say if there had been voter id\nIn the state's going back Fifteen Years they would not be politicians in power right now they'd be the obscure people on the ice sheets of history that they should have been but because of the millions of illegal aliens who've been flooded over the borders\nInto California Texas border states\nYou have a Democrat socialist machine that is almost unstoppable and you may say oh good great well if you like Venezuela and eating giraffes for dinner\nWelcome to the organization of the American states would you like a nice giraffe without drink with your shot and they you think it's a joke they're eating zoo animals\nIn a nation that socialist nation that will be re duplicated here in America if these people are not stopped so again what would your advice be\nIf you were advised thing the president as part of his radio cabinet we call it a kitchen cabinet of the type that Ronald Reagan had I won't call it a buffet cabinet of the type that Donald Trump once had\nHe's now being advised by people and I have no faith in ... in many of them I'll be honest with you once this guy Bolton was made national security adviser the the access shifted in the Trump Administration everything went wrong the whole administration went off kilter\nIt was good it was doing really good ones both in ... was put in there by\nBy very powerful international forces who headed by now Bolton was trying to scare Russia You're Joking you the Russians are going to be scared of this guy you know it's ironic about voting in Russia just for a minute this was plaguing me over the weekend both and had a screaming match last week allegedly with a General Kelly\nNow General Kelly is a certified war hero he's a four star marine general you know what that means no most people don't even have any idea how significant that is\nGeneral Kelly is the real American their General Kelly is actually a dove\nSo warmonger is the draft Dodger Fulton think about the irony of that\nA man has probably never fired a gun wants war with Russia wants to bring missiles into Ukraine\nA man is actually seen them die in his arms and seen them bleed out in front of his arms or mantle gave his son to this nation 'cause when I met General Kelly I went in his office and we were talking about heroes and he said do you really like heroes I said yes he said let me show you a hero\nAnd General Kelly\nAsked me down through his office in the White House and then he closed the door behind them and he showed me a picture on his mantle and the flag and he said that's a hero it was\nAnd he gave his son to this country he gave his son's life to this country and he's a dove\nHe doesn't want war because he knows what war is is that you have a craven maniac\nAround the president was never fired a gun running around trying to ignite fires all over the globe because he's in the old con warmonger no doubt\nWas put there by the military industrial complex that's a complicated paragraph but rather easy to follow got many many different levels in it but it's quite easy to follow the where the military industrial complex\nSo Donald Trump came in as a man of peace as a non interventionist that all of a sudden we wake up and all over the girl we have problems all of a sudden how many nations can Donald Trump have antagonism with it wants let's see now count them there is Russia China\nLet's see you know Iran that's three North Korea that's for Mexico that's five Canada vets six what's next what is this all going to explode\nYou know the um the ... are getting larger the fault lines of getting larger there's a slight rumbling of earthquakes all over the planet Jordan says us pulling out of an agreement with Israel that they've had in place for a long period of time Jordan wants them land back that they leased to Israel Israel's now farming it\nJordan says we want those contested lands back the Fort lines of cracking all over the globe\nI feel it I can feel the masses starring in this country and around the world and when you see the hordes of the world's poorest try to break in to this land of milk and honey\nAnd we have tens of millions of poor in this country are not being taken care of we have a drug crisis that's overwhelmed so much of this country where's the money supposed to come from Detroit the drug addicts the rehab\nThe care facilities all the seniors where's the money supposed to come from is now you want another twenty thousand pouring in over the border uh where are they going to go you're going to go where Los Angeles Dallas Houston where are they supposed to go\nYou get a welcome to your apartment on the Upper East side of Manhattan I don't think so I don't know one liberal the wants them here by the way they all lie about it\nAnd when I run into them and I go once in a while and many of them listen to my show is actually agree with you on a few things I should really what mainly on immigration I said we can't have any more them here we agree with you on immigration we we're we're agree with you on the homeless thing they all agree with me but they say we can't say anything because we're afraid will lose business\nYou know yesterday afternoon just a side note wanting me I mean the thing I went to the museum here in San Francisco is too great once one is the palaces legion of honor up on the hill overlooking San Francisco bay and the Golden Gate bridge area\nAnd has one of the greatest collections of world than sculptures in the world\nIt's a world class collection and it's usually quiet this not got the children running around screaming\nNo music in it and I go there once in awhile to just see myself in in great European civilization great European art you know I don't know anywhere else I can go within an inch of a painting by Monet worth a million dollars and I can see the\nOf oil paint you notice like the stand in front of a master painting without a glass on that painting an eighty million dollar painting but just to put it in Dallas themselves and be within a few centimeters actually of the oil I like to put my eyes right next to the pain\nAnd to being near that greatness as a vibration that comes back at you [noise] so that that combined it by going out to one of my favorite Chinese restaurant\nI was leaving with the with the Chinese restaurants that\nTake care of yourself Michael we need your voice I was stunned
