going in after we saw the ... coming in on the southern border now you say what's the connection if you can't see the connection I can help you if you want to sit here skating around the truth is that I've been trying to warn you about I Can't help you\nI told you on friday I ... after the input and bomber was caught\nDo you remember what my words were on friday do you remember how I tried to warn you that there are likely tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of heavily armed trained people in this country who are at the breaking point and if you keep spending on them calling them white trash\nTalking about them like their garbage in non humans dismissing them as though they don't matter\nYour going to see things happen in this country that are going to make that input and bomber that steroid not look like what he was a clown and I wake up Saturday morning and I said oh my God\nOh my God look what just happened and who triggered this guy now don't confuse my analysis of this cowardly madman for any sort of justification or apologies for him because I'm not offering that at all\nBut of course the vermin in the Twitter world will immediately tried to make that happen I've got one of them now from Miami, Florida who the FBI is tracking because their rhetoric is escalating you'll have no idea what it's like to be in the\nPublic eye today unless you're in it it's very easy to send your house and listen to me or listen to someone else and have your own opinion and God Bless you for listening to the show\nBut when you're on the front lines in the nation right now [noise] you don't know what hatred is out there\nLike I Do and the deranged mentality of these liberal progressive Z is something\nJoy the Savage Nation coal no heat by five four hundred seven eight five or four hundred seven to eight to [noise]\nShould this one snapped anyone crazy got this I don't even know why you chose them I still don't know I hear something about the Hebrew aid society as a group but this I don't know where they pick the synagogue in particular or this was by a just like one synagogue and Pittsburgh that he picked I don't know I don't know the reason he picked on these poor people could have been anyone\nBut there's this group of people so the first thing I thought was going back to Nineteen eighty one I used to tell people in Jewish centers you should have an armed guard the mentioned learn how to use weapons and the answers I Would get would make my stomach turn\nAnd they have no sense of survival none none none no sense of self preservation of survival you have no idea what it's like talking to people that were so foolish\nAnd the Israelis know 'em right\nMany many people I've known them right with the churches in America many churches and not protected by armed guards but to a progressive the idea of using a policeman an off duty policeman or an armed guard is such anathema\nThey would rather see people defenseless than protected because they don't want to be seen as politically on the side of those of us who understand the power of protection of guns of Florida so none other than the lunatic of lunatics to blast CEO in New York\nHas the nerve\nTo say no guns in the EU to listen to clip six and you'll hear the mind of a madman you only have\nNever allow the normalization of hate that's not what we will stand for [noise]\nAnd in that vein we have to say what was said yesterday I was also unacceptable no houses of worship do not have to have armed guards to be able\nTo practice their religion that's not America you know you are really stupid I'm coming to understand that there's actually no logical reason in the mind of a liberal waters normalization of have to have to do with protecting yourself in a synagogue or a church there's no connection between the two\nAnd I will say again there's only one solution to this protect yourself at all times because no one else will be that protects you\nKnow we can ... because I'm not ready to move up there yet I got too many hours to go he had to move up to it but at the end of this terrible tragedy where this this ah Nazis psychotic\nKilled on on defense was Jews who had no way to defend themselves it was the the police with guns Mr ... who went in and stop them it wasn't you with your foul mouth\nIt was cops with guns some of whom got shot shame on you the Blasio shame on you for the basing the police for doing this incredible job\nThey were the ones who tracked him to a little room where he was hiding they were the ones who got this cowardly psychotic to throw as weapons now he's in a hospital somewhere being cared for don't you just love that\nLike the terrorists we've seen the American after they kill people they're treated better than the people they shot what a wonderful country we live in\nBut nevertheless I'm just a talk show host you're observing\nAnd trying to help you get through this day I Know many of you were waiting for my opinion I understand that I have a very loyal audience\nWho appreciates my view of things and so far I've given you several views of these things in one way or another but I'm not yet gotten to inside the mind of a psychopath\nI've also challenged you by saying do you believe that I'm correct that we need armed guards in houses of worship I mean it's such an obvious answer to the question was the Blasio talking about what do you mean\nWho's normalizing hate was saying protect the people\nPut a policeman in engine that what we do with schools now remember what happened in Florida with that cowardly cop who hid behind those pillars remember him he was actually in the school to protect the children when that guy came in with the gun where was he hiding behind the pillows he's collected got pension out\nThe cops should be a president who ran away these cops should be invited to the White House which they will be\nOne of them are still in the hospital because he took bullet wounds in the hands thank God none of them were killed but some of them was severely injured because unlike the blasts or they knew they knew that one thing guns save lives guns save lives guns save lives\nA great group called juice for the protection of firearms ownership they know all about this\nAnd so I Want to play for you the sound at this moment of the scanner audio at the end of this

[noise] [noise] oh here we have a call now\nWell that's the police scanner as they went in to take down the Nazi or after he killed all those innocent people but as you could see they went in with guns drawn\nNot with the white flag they weren't waving the French flag when they went in these are heavily armed ... highly trained extremely brave men who went in there it wasn't a bunch of liberals going in waving Mr Roger's neighborhood in book form\nAnd asking him to please join them for a a a a snack they were ready to shoot and they got shot some of them guns can save lives\nAnd in New York by the way or the NYPD was sent to protect mosques I don't know if you know that the same ... Hussein guns and never the answer\nWe don't have to have armed guards to practice their religion why did he sent the armed guards to mosques anyone have an answer to that because he's a liar hypocrite period he's a ... he's a bombings a mutt\nJoy both Savage Nation coal no eight by by four hundred seven eight bucks voted for about seven to eight to\nSome of the Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future recall eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com here's the truth about most home security companies well they're like dealing with another bad you know old fashioned cable company\nYou're going to spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then when that you're a breaking point you remember I'm locked in a three year contract with these people now look if you're looking to protect your home go would simply safe home security why\nSimply safe as real comprehensive protection beautifully designed looks good on your home using it makes your home is actually much safer\nSimply save has backed up some place to keep you safe protecting your home even if you lose power or Internet or some of the tax system basketball you get twenty four seven monitoring with police and fire dispatch for just Fifteen dollars a month\nAnd unlike other home security companies simply save has no long term contract it's the best around the clock protection you could find it the best price get free shipping and free returns at simply safe Savage dot com now go to simply safe Savage dot com\nDebate was so tempting\nFree trip gifts then you've got hooked by the sales pitch bought the timeshare and you've regretted it ever since and maintenance\nThey've kept increasing and we just didn't want to deal with it anymore it was not anything like what they showed us when we bought their timeshare\nTime shares are in a day at the lake there all cats you know really unless you talked to resort release we can release you from that time share legally and permanently a plus rated by the BBC a one hundred percent money back guarantee that our clients five star reviews tells the story\nIs imported and told her and there was never anything hidden", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "29"}
