in our anger and hatred for one minute you have some questions these a straight out facts about today has anyone seen the packages in the media yes you have you can all see them or any of those stamps canceled no\nIs there sufficient postage on those packages in terms of the amount on the stamps to have got them even moving in the system no\nNumber three if it was a pipe bomb in an envelope the postal service would have marked a machine would've caught it right away that wouldn't have been sent so we can rule out the fact that it went through the U. S. P. S.\nThey were hand delivered and know post marks as I said so handler to four or five locations Cuomo made up that he got one of the liars right through the teeth\nSo if they were hand delivered and some of the most powerful people on earth to receive them\nAnd we see no surveillance footage of the incident meaning of the the device being put in the mail box or this or why should we believe awarded this you don't have to be a cynic like I Am you don't have to be skeptical of authority like I Am to even follow the logic\nSo what I'm saying it's all suspicious it doesn't make sense to me the whole thing is I don't like it\nI don't like it at all that's simple that's Maro they're going to blame it on Trump somehow that will be suckers next move\nWill say that they were analyzed by people in the FBI they can trust to work for Obama and they found small tiny little fingerprints on the bombs and they were traces of dyed orange hair on some of them and therefore they're pretty sure the president had done it that's tomorrow\nWithin twenty minutes we'll split so one of the worst propaganda is in the history of the media was blaming the president so look I'm using my\nNative

seem to work it's only been less than two weeks also the sunspot remover is actually working pretty well on my face now listen for this week only\nA hash tag thing they're going to have already the only people who are real losers here are the Instagram slots\nLike those Justin Bieber in bikini types who every day they have to show us them ... and it became like we never saw a woman before so tomorrow they'll have to appear and say oh my God how do I stay an Instagram I have to show I received one too\nBut we all know that we don't want this to be real we're all glad that if this is a a ploy\nBut if you missed the opening to the show you're not going to miss one about the tide you again because I think I Hope I'm wrong\nI'm rarely wrong the left is going to find out that this failed as well the left is going to find out that even the left are skeptical of this little game that the right is even more cynical of them middle ground says I had enough of the left wing with their scare tactics\nAnd what's going to happen as they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they're liable actual send wants to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine were killed that's I'm afraid of\nAnd who they are going to blame it on then will say well we don't know who did it we don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare monger and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it doesn't me\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately\nI have been trying to tell America for a long time now that there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics and I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace they only know hatred of war\nI saw pictures of the illegals coming over with a new group from Mexico joining them and they're all strapping young men of military age in the in clean new clothing that sort of a headline was give us your tired your poor your gangbangers\nThat so what do you want me to say what can I as a citizen with a radio show say give me your tired your poor your gangbangers so what can he do so we have an a gigantic problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump\nAnd so far with thanking God that it wasn't Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is surging toward the border\nThis is his Alamo and if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you left referred to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was and as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon\nIn order for Trump to stop this massive army of invaders and to make sure this is not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were finagle into signing the NAFTA deal with them because that that horses out of the bond as they say and American parlance show how we're going to stop these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you but do you want a little tiny history about when Rome was broken into by the vandals and the ... when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like the little little history\nNow do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men barbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealer\nThe snow killers know gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical\nSo let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races\nSo why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly control of all I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you were in the media and you read about these things then you have to arrange walking the streets\nBut I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which were called their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know I get the whole story now go get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr or something that's a little you know small soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire in the in the east and west whale also describing stop mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was lifted a very important for you to hear the ...\nThe empire and the third century it was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't a gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating Miley and then they face the barbarians on the borders\nAnd again is just what happened next\nWell all along the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and then you enemies will now pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes had come up to the ...\nIn North Hungary where the vandals in what was once that Syria and is now we're mania\nThe visit Godzilla west Scott's behind those in South Russia where the Scots or ... and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands and then with the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nLet's go to graduate school together in thought for a minute\nWho do you blame how about both parties you want to talk about both parties or cashing in on the on the illegal aliens for the last twenty five to Thirty years you'll have to spell it out for you why do you think that the Congress is doing nothing\nWhy do you think Trump won the election because we want something done and he said he would do it that's far he hasn't\nSo you can blame anybody you want\nTo me it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami of the early eighties and we're asking that Honduras Guatemala El Salvador empty the prisons and then not houses because if you look at the pictures that are so plain and the picture is worth ten thousand words\nThey're young strapping young men by and large with a few you know in the front women with carriages thrown in for a fact so that Jake Tapper can yank your guilt chain and Wolf Blitzer can chime in and say yeah yeah yeah that's racist\nAnd what this is it's an invasion ...\n... it's an existential problem what are we going to do about it I'm not just saying it because the current or it I mean I read existential isn't my soccer\nAnd as a a girlfriend so I Know ... as if it's a wonderful phrase is an existential threat was originally used here in politics by Netanyahu with regard to Israel\nA number of years ago when he said it's an existential threat to the survival of Israel and then everyone picked up on it but this is a true a truly an existential threat to our bought his language and culture so the question is why is nothing being done I don't see anything done nothing onto the next subject already\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five
