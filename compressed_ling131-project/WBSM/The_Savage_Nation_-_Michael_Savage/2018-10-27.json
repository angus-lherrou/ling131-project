like you are everyone's watching and listening stuff you know we want to glean the last little speck of information about the bomber the van so I noticed the van it's it's like brand new it was like a shiny use van\nAll the bumper stickers and stop the slogans or old not faded from the Florida sun which is pretty amazing I like to find out which company makes those kind of stickers adult faith in the sun and I also knows that there's a large ... uh what did they call those those blue things like a use them for furniture on them when it rains you know they\nIt was ready to go is made exactly for the man I understand it's an option now on used vans and it comes attached to the to the left side of the car so that you can use it as an opening and wet weather or after you're bombing mission is through and you arrested by the FBI you\nCould flip it right over there to protect the paint while it's in custody of being examined that's going to be a new option on used car lot\nIs that little blue blue a blue wanting that comes with the car I've never trust the people who drive answer like that in California I avoid them on the highway I always look crazy to me with or without the bumper stickers and one of the van like that I Know it was a ... something's wrong in their idol can buy a friend that probably Ninety percent of my own\n[laughter]\nBut you know look you've got to laugh a little bit at the whole thing we're all we can we take a breath of relaxed today that they got an not no one got hurt he made a bomb out of something that looks like a ... only with the wiring o'clock\nEveryone says it doesn't even look like a bomb to them and they looked like a ... like a heart and can only go sat in the sun too long with like a wire attached to the door baby clock\nWhat was the actual the substance inside those things does anyone know people will say it looked like white powder didn't look like a C for nobody really knows no one knows why there's no surveillance footage of whoever put the devices in the mail boxes whether it's in Seoul roses or a state you know\nWe all do one thing in this case thank God nobody got hurt and number two as I said many times this guy as crazy as he may look was provoked\nBy the rhetoric of the very people he hated\nYou know you could say well you justifying what he did how do you do that no I'm telling you how he thinks\nIf you're a guy on the bottom and you're poor\nAnd you have very scarce opportunity in this country and you see a party of Democrats who have written you off and said you don't exist they call you names they ridiculed you they call you every name under the sun and they give you an opportunity\nAnd you see people bought into this country given every possible opportunity and benefits\nAnd they step ahead of you on line you know what makes you crazy\nDo you understand that I'm a long way from being a on the bottom of society but I Know how they think because I Know what it's like to be stepped on I also know what it's like to be stepped on stepped on it pushed out\nI Know what it's like to work hard and get nothing for it now take a guy fifty six shows achieves nothing in his life and he's ridiculed by Hillary Clinton who calls him a deplorable he is laughed at by George Soros thinks he's a Nazi\nHe is mocked by Debbie Wasserman Schultz and all of the others so the hatred bills in his head so I'm saying to you maybe this is a learning experience for everyone and maybe you people on the so called left could just cool it for a while\nAnd stop the meaning and putting down everyone who loves America and wants our borders language and culture to maintain [noise]\n\nAnd such how did how did they get there and why is knows I'm going to keep repeating this why is there no surveillance footage of any of the mailbox is when the devices were put there they have round the clock\nSecurity Hillary Clinton as a bill I don't know who was in the house of the time they have Secret Service on the premises cameras up the trees cameras in the sky high in the sky\nThe other say has cameras today with such resolution they could see the hair on your nostril than you could see a natural hair if they want to focus on it and we still don't have one frame of any individual putting these devices in mailboxes so I remain skeptical incidentally\nThe only question is will that hurt the Republican Party in the midterms that's all and he was really going to ask themselves there's nothing else now is there any other news out there that we should be talking about is that not really this is everyone's signed with relief today we got the van\nAnd again before you turn the show a friday so you heard it all take one message home please\nTake this home the guy has a van he has a classic molester van that we all know to avoid we see a band like this coming up to a school bus stop we call the police\nSo the man as a classical or less the van and instead of the windows just being blacked out that covered with Trump ... Trump's stickers including the rear end side we're windows which are illegal illegal\nIn Washington County where where he lives in Canada in like that in Washington County without the police pulling you over the wash them and police would have pulled him over in one second\nSo how can you believe how can you take his like whole how can you swallow this whole if something is not wrong with the picture yes these are not yes she was involved but\nWas he did he did do it all alone and how can you have a van like this this make that the ... part of it throws me off\nOkay okay and they found this fingerprints on the on the on the uh the input and devices good I'm Glad fingerprint DNA lead to Florida man's arrest of bumps at the Trump clinics All right so they got the guy who put his fingers on 'em that's good\nOkay what about the possibility of further arrests\nWe don't know they arrest a sigh acting plantation Florida they all the way as well less the van plastered with pro Trump stickers and the slogan CNN sucks she and I love that\nAnd images of democratic figures with Red Cross has over their faces this is this the central casting men in van if Hollywood would have done this couldn't have done a better job if you weren't doing a great movie and you wanted to you know do something that's not even plausible you get this job\nAnd you'd get creative and like this and that would be like a great movie at night like something you'd see on on Netflix\nRight classic white supremacist the ... there's one part missing now to the whole picture is not a white supremacist that's the parts that throws me off you know either he is ... is a Native American or is the Philippine Filipino urges I we don't know yet but that he's not a crack a like a McVeigh\nAnd this is the part that throws me off no blonde blue eyed guy they couldn't find\nHow they get this guy and he just above the throws me off there's almost something and it's everyone here you know he's not white and he's not blond he's not blue eyes something something is missing in the picture maybe they couldn't find the passing to fit that who was willing to take the the pay out\nYou know maybe they couldn't find anyone willing to take the fall for I come on I'm just pulling your leg you how do we know who else was involved here\nQuoting the records you registered Republican lengthy criminal past uh so you you left now can celebrate tonight you could break out your antidepressant pills and share them over dinner tonight\nAlong with your uh with your other medications you can side with relief that everyone who doesn't look like you in New York is definitely a um a Nazi\nAnd yet here's another question Steve is asking the feds got him within a few days yet no resolution on Vegas huh how do you like that\nVegas we solar wind that man was shooting like that from the window right no resolution there's a couple of other unsolved mysteries that we we don't know why the FBI isn't found them yet\nSo uh we can move on but there's no other news no one wants to talk about anything else you want to talk about the economy the market what's going on in the in the in the economy it's a big story\nIs he let me give me one minute on it because money is everything I found this the other day very important\nI got this from Craig Smith of Swiss America yes she's an advertiser yes he sells gold yes he's a friend of mine of support of the show for sixteen years\nBut he said to me Michael's chapter seven of your book stop mass hysteria will be the playbook on the largest financial crisis ever not just our lifetime you point out the dozens of financial missteps in our history\nFrankly sharing things I didn't know or forgot people need your book if they want to save their country of life savings there are so many cracks in the system you will see a crisis any day now you're right I can feel it you can feel that we sense that everyone is holding their breath the cracks of getting longer and the prevailing\nAnd they said that to me on Monday October twenty second after my show\nAnd unfortunately the market's been following this week up moves down down up one day and now down again and the the scare is starting to the gym or the markets by the way\nAnd people are asking have we reached that point finally of of the collapse if people are panicked right now\nSo now it's a big question is political will the Dems take the house will take the Senate\nAnd other Republicans through you know this this is all at anyone's asking themselves I myself I'm not going to change my vote because of alone a lone wolf not with the top and the van you know still a job I'm not changing my vote because it or not I don't feel guilty that I did something wrong here in fact I\nI think the opposite is true I feel bad for the guy if you want to know the truth a man this last man this poor man this week a man is vulnerable right what do you think he feels when he's called deplorable what do you think he feels as he sees an army marching in on the southern border\nAnd that they will receive every benefit to society has to offer and then some while he is ejected uncalled every name under the sun tell me what you would do if you're a man like him\nAnd that's what I'm trying to tell you there as justification for this kind of insanity in the minds of those who are weak minded\nAnd so therefore you better ... you better rethink your social welfare policies their level a trigger a lot more than just the sky of things really collapse\nWe have the lowest level since July in doubt if this economy ever tanks and the economy dries up the Trump created\nGuys like this are going to come out of the woodwork and then some and then you really see some bad things you know we cannot take any more people into the lifeboat the American life is full of poor people\nUntreated people in hospitals VA hospitals no we can't take an army of twenty thousand illegal aliens from Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador no we cannot and so the open borders policies of the left\nContinue to be an change it I don't think they're going to change their tune before the election and I don't think that any left us are going to vote on the right and I don't think many people in the conservative side to get a vote on the left but I Do still think that independents unfortunately are going to flee\nFrom the Republican ticket in November\n...

the whole Democratic Party which is still ruled by the way by white people even though they make believe that they represent others it's really sickening they're very racist\nSo they keep demonizing white white male white male white male not even though the man is either Philippine or a seminal origin he identifies\nAs a white male I don't know if you understand that\nAnd in in in insights his anger and his rage so if he actually did this\nIt makes them crazier and crazier and crazier again if you keep putting a person down they become angrier and more and more and more a psychotic as it were\nShow if you want to keep up the rhetoric if you want ... not to be controlled go ahead keep it up keep it up keep demonizing everyone supports Trump now having said that I got to tell you who's ever managing the Trump campaign should be fired\nFor him to go forward with a rally tonight in Charlottesville North Carolina is about the most ignorant thing I've ever seen in all the years I've supported Donald Trump can you imagine can you imagine anything more flat footed than this\nHe's holding a rally in just a short period of time at the very site where the there was a riot last year or two years ago and a girl was run over by a car has been held up like a a whole thing now for years by the by the radical left the Communist Party usa whatever you want to call them\nReally I Want to go to a city which makes him an even easier target for soccer and company you're telling me they're not going to show a confetti\nTonight and ... watch your ready they got the bureau running\nThey got to be ready for tonight there's the bureau I'd get out the bureau tonight when he's speaking run the be all behind them of Confederate flags All right oh I get to all of the of the Ku Klux Klan they're burning something or I get to the role of the car and the crowd alright\nAlright there's Jeff Zucker sweating in the background like the ... All right run the be all on the sea well now every time he speaks\nYou don't understand how cynical an evil least people really are do you you have no idea that they would bring the country to the ground for ratings point do you think that is just a political orientation you're mistaken so you'll watch and see to that one of the most\nUh idiotic things I've ever seen was going to court tonight to even ... I Would have cancelled the rally if I were managing Trump and I'm not\nI Would say no listen to me there's just too incendiary at time castle the rally tonight and say it's an author of the people who were so rudely a let's say frightened or attacked\nBy this man in the number of them will get a bypass the rallies that I that would have not given Jeff Zucker and all the ... and the left media any field to their fire but tonight watch\nWatch and see if I'm wrong again Confederate flags on the role the girl being what over on the payroll\nKlux Klan a little thrown in from the Nineteen thirties\nWatch all behind Trump run by the most evil people in the history of the nation\nYou're talking about a hysteria this provoking law by the way I Want to go back to that for many of your poor downtrodden person in this country and you saw an army of twenty thousand people coming into the southern border egged on by the entire democratic ...\nYou could go insane saying the country's being invaded near behind the invasion they're going to take away the the few precious resources that I get from this country is a guy a loser living with his mother fifty six years old never got anywhere in life\nHe takes that all of his he all of his identity is in his muscles and ah the identity with the nation in some way you know like a crypto national is I'm not a real nationalism\nHe is almost an actor on stage of nationalism you doesn't truly understand the strength of the nation he's she's only the images of the strength of the nation and so you take the twenty thousand marching toward our border and he's afraid\nWhatever few resources he gets from the country the nation are going to diminish will be taken away from altogether state this is triggering and then you see who's supporting the my the migrant hordes who watched them here the entire Democrat machine so he he takes his heels and it becomes even crazier\nAnd so you have to understand how these things working what years are in play in the minds of these people and you're lucky that you have made to explain that to you\nBecause I understand all sides of an argument I always have been able to see things in a multi dimensional fashion\nNow that's not a spectrum thing if coal intelligence and I didn't say oh that's a spectrum thing that's that's an inside joke for those are you on the spectrum it's not really a spectrum thing it's called a a an intelligence they could see many aspects of a thing you know\nSo if you want to comment on what's going on you can on any side but my big question is how is this going to affect the midterms will it affect the election\nIf you are an independent will you stay away from the polls because of this fear that you're going to be associated with Donald Trump and what the Republicans or the other hand is it making you think your heels in more saying it has nothing to do with me huh I answer the question if you don't mind is listening example of one guy bringing down the party\nEven though it was input then violence that was a threatened violence\nAnd again going back to what I said earlier in the week trust me I Know what I said I said there was a high probability of a false flag event I did not say was certain but even having said that there are elements of the story that don't add up such as the van and the stickers on the windows I don't know how that is even possible\nEveryone I Know said the same thing young guys who worked for him easily picked up on the stickers on them and they said OK runs through your head you're smart leftist okay run the streets had just for a minute don't even call to show how come the stickers looked like their brand new the Trump stickers and whatnot wouldn't they fade into Florida sun\n... they were being faded curled yellow direct no they're like brand new printed somewhere and the stuck on the windows something few elements you ... not right just that right\nRight so that's it I mean I Want to comment on open here I'm Alive and national not live in local on live a national right now everything's like live and local I don't know about you but I kind of like a national show so I'm live a national and the Savage Nation\nAnd the ... suspects in custody everyone can side with relief now so I can go back to plotting the overthrow of America the New York and go back to imitating a guy who hates Trump and come up with new words other than ... um\nMutt Maxine Waters can say that uh chasing men like him out of a gas station chase them down with a tiring whenever she's going to come up with Hillary Hillary has been very polite and quiet now even though she knows she called men like this deplorable and and triggered him\nSo who do you blame blame who you want\nLane who you want Carlos on K s a phone line eight what's your what's your subject\nSavage I agree with you that um\nThe um the laughter really factoring disenfranchised man and a safe first generation American my parents were political refugees from Havana, Cuba or you know the thing about it is is what this particular incident about this ah alleged bomber is that\nI agree with you or in concert to what you were saying about Bush I mean a a top not showing up in in in in in in North Carolina\nOh my God is is that an arrow wait till you see what they do they'll make hay out of that tonight\nBut here's the problem with that terror is that I agree with that and if I were if I worked from ... to play this thing with this all it really really quietly and I would also prior to your heart and say look we're going to offer more protection for all of these\nPolitical you know a democratic for hours and things like that because I think about it is is that if he keeps on the tweeting\nAnd the longer that this airplane on a select what we're trying to discover you're about to select farmer\nWe keep the media doesn't work your way their coverage on the discovery of this farmer\nIt could actually end up helping Trump as long as he keeps his nose clean because my concern is terrible and\nWe're going to have a crescendo right now and it's kind of climax just hours before the election and they're going to show all of the national guard and they're going to turn it on trial\nAnd the whole thing is just going to create this medium man that's what the narrative is look at this guy trough look what he's doing look at the on humanitarian effort that you say\nWell that's why they have to be stopped by the Mexican military in Mexico and and not be allowed within hundreds of miles to the border they cannot be permitted to get near the border they need to be stopped in Mexico because if they get near the border the people behind this march and make no mistake about it there's a description and very clear detail of people who have organized this\nWill run women and children in baby carriages against the troops they'll run them first\nAnd the strapping young men in in New outfits and clean sneakers will not be in the front of that line it'll be women and children which will be a disaster for this nation and a disaster for those of us who believe in in the integrity of the nation may I send you a copy of stop mass hysteria very intelligent manner I certainly do you you love reading this\nThere's a lot of a thank you very much there's a lot of elements to this that remain unanswered and I don't think we're ever going to get the answers frankly\nIt seems to be a bit of a constructed farce in some ways\nThe fall guy I'm sure he has a background like this okay let's run in another way let's put our heads together\nUm if you had to find a villain for this who sent these bombs have been I don't know if if you can bombs what they are they looked like ... with wires and the clock I don't know what they are harden can always that were left out in the sidewalk\nWho knows if there were bombs are not right let's pray that with nothing but the guy did send them let's how do you send the answer the question for me how they arrive in all these locations\nAlmost simultaneously with the exception of those out of state how how'd they get there since the male didn't accept them tell me how and the stamps when I post markets recovered on the show for two three days now so that's number the number two\n... ah posters and stickers on the back of the van and the side when those uh obliterate ... view violating Florida law how was he not stopped explain it to me please it doesn't look right it just looks too convenient it looks like central casting one oh one for a ... a third rate movie\nIf you were making a movie about some nut who was going to attack some innocent Democrat politicians just before an election would you do could you do better than writing the ... or the storyline of a guy with the molester van with stickers like this all over it\nI couldn't so I go to some of the stuff doesn't add up\nBut who actually wins from this\nDoes America really when from this terrible thing we've been through since the beginning of the week does anyone feel stronger as a result of this does anyone feel happier is that he was thrilled other than Jeff Zucker at CNN who's ratings went up\nIs anyone other than the people in the in the television media who've been showing non stop the ... with the with the wires and those who is actually happy about this I'm certainly not happier\nI'm not happy you're um it's it makes you sad to think that we fall into this level that you have a party on the left that would not only destroy this country on a daily basis but then demonize anyone who doesn't want the nation destroy calling us Nazis fascists Ku Klux Klan\nAnd you know people who are strong liked me take it\nAnd we take it with a grain of salt and we'd go on we keep doing what we do but the people on the bottom like this guy ... whatever his name is these are ... junior they don't go on that way they don't they don't adjust that way they they marinate in the hatred\nThat you're in ... on them to get ... that you inflict upon them the threats that yo inflict upon them Hillary calls them deplorable what do you think this does to the people on the bottom who loves Donald Trump\nAnd make no mistake about their millions and millions of people are still of Donald Trump in his message what do you think\nYour hating them does to them\nIt makes them crazier and more dangerous\nDuring the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to salvage Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss
