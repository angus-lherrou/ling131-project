actively invites them to apply\nLook I exist in this business because of one reason a I'm offering you something that you're buying less for the few that way you don't you think about it\nWhen you really think about what us talk radio ... which talk radio shows are successful which aren't what's your long lasting and which aren't it's no longer related to um whether you survive in this business or not is no longer related to ratings for example or New York uh WABC I had the highest ratings for years I had any for three straight\nBut they want to go in another direction you only hear me into your come January unless you eat a streaming or offer another station or you'll listen to my podcast my readings were great that wasn't the reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it\nThere's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership of stations do you understand that I'd do it on the stations they could run Mickey Mouse playing it for you if they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse or they can do\nWell in that you can say well you are but you don't have any control over it it doesn't matter if the show loses money doesn't matter at all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when they get the gearing up ready for the presidential election\nSo the only reason you listen to me at all is why well you figure this guy's a little different sometimes it comes down on the side of a of a subject sometimes that and it seems like he doesn't based on reason not just on on a a desire to please us and he doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I did not Trump that I'm angry at it's the talk shows to thinks that that's all you want to hear that's the part that bothers me\nWhat would you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours it's diluted out great Obama was Obama was this ... by any one show about ... how could you listen to that did you listen to it no\nNo the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio one out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the you don't do any of this oh yeah it's a well known fact in the business people destroyed their networks\nFor propaganda and now running other media now that you know that even in radio well one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false I wouldn't say it to you so how do you survive at all in this business if you're a truth teller\nThe people will find you one way or the other it's that simple find your online or they'll find you on a podcast or they'll streaming from somewhere that's that's how it is so is that that's the way it is now ... what are we gonna talk about let's go I didn't take a call I got this one of these days I don't know why it's so good\nI Know why I feel good extra extra clear it's like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not a psychologist find that one guy was in it early on back in Queens he went into it one of the nuts and the crowd he was like one of the biggest the already made a fortune became a top guy and sign of I was surprised he went so high up in the thing\nBut he wasn't like kids Eighteen everyone was trying to find themselves so he became a Scientology I'm Talking while ... like in the sixties\nAnd I'll wake up twenties ladies like one of the chief ... in the Scientology movement\nBut I remember the guy to a certain things you said that were really good like about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid and he tried to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me or really helped my migraines and self cured was reading Georgia salads and macro buyout accent I went on to the ten stage diet\nOf elimination I was Eighteen years old and I my own I found out which which food types triggered by migraines and I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast\nAnd if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out with its in my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn too fast and brought up that seat this great feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signaling you on the Senate\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you're actually could could lead yourself to states have health that you could never even believe were were possible\nBut and here's the but\nMost of us have lost contact with the signals we don't want to hear them we we've eliminated them we put your butts in whatever what he would do is I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message\n[laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink that draft shut up leave me alone you know I don't ... don't drink that's rockets not good for you tonight whatever but I I listen all very close relationship and\nSo I took them back about diet denomination of sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer and heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want\nPeople do crazy things today based on on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio was I was able to use my my learning\nMy dissertation going back to Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study\nStudies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today\nAnd the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he died of Alice I figured it'll be interesting but do I know if you really let's say well maybe you listen to have it already I don't know you're going to turn off the list that habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration are great it is around the clock hey are bad\nWhat's that part down the middle of his hair you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy and become not so good looking and you're middle aged man wow I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy I was in the like and not notice handsome I was okay\nI had my share of fun but what I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing underneath no education and no one no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and look like um\nFellow in order to to cover up the defending hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young and you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the the whole mask manhood thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean that was a terrible thing to do with the president I'm Talking about people in the media now called the tiny that's nothing to do with anything where there were ... brains in what does everything have to be everything some people I went out mentally somewhere in doubt physically someone that would vote someone dealt with nothing that's the human condition what are you gonna do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving they start with your good looks you're good guy looks and you had asked us to stay in your face stuck to look like Jerry Lewis after it tell us on a in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it I don't know what that's like that's a that's a form of torture and its own way\nAnd then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupted you know I I I think guys on his own way has a little way of play with people who think that they're bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about learning out there knows what I'm even talking about I Wonder sometimes I think there'll be like if I run into people strangely and what's increasingly happening to me is that people have different cultural backgrounds of stopping me in the street like a\nYesterday I had the day off writes I'd go to a dentist or something just a nice lady said hello to me like she knew me somewhat of a cello she's from Cambodia and she sent me very quietly she said\nI Lived through those camps that poll pot created my relatives were killed in them and live through them and I was stunned here's a living woman who have you looked during the street would say she's a ball she's a liberal send the Democrats are always think that if someone's from Asia they were liberal or someone's\nAfrican American there were a liberal or someone's ... you'll have no idea\nWhat a person's politics are really you can't tell by looking at people you you just can't you know that\nYeah well okay like some cops for example a diehard communist left us you wouldn't know that there are many in the military who you think would be normally conservative Republican they left wing comedies you wouldn't know that either so you can never judge a book by its cover I'll be back in a minute\n...

at the number eleven on the New York times list and I'm moving into a cycle of seven Elevens what does this numerology mean\nAnd we have Gary the numbers guy hope he's right this time Gary on W. N. T. W. in Virginia Line to what does this mean seven eleven\nYou hope on break this time last time I was a program I told you got on from your come next for the United states so let's start with that but let's go into your eleventh thing\nNumber one there's two ways to look at number eleven number one that way that we use a number two the way it pops up now let's go to the first\nNine eleven happened eleven first plane hit the world trade Centers for the Web and nine eleven happened two hundred and fifty four days a year or two five four equals eleven the twin towers looked like an ... number eleven ... standing side by side they both have a hundred and ten stories Oklahoma City happened for Nineteen Nineteen Ninety five\nFor one nine one nine Ninety five at the thirty eight three Nate Apatow loving first bomb went off at nine oh two you know the math that got eleven and they executed Timothy McVeigh for on the a weapon\nSo basically what is going on here because obviously that's not a coincidence\n[laughter] yeah I can understand that numbers have five ... energy that people who are in power are very we're very aware of this now if you think I'm lying ask yourself why World War one ended at eleven eleven at exactly eleven o'clock they didn't stop by and shot to spend fifty five they waited till eleven\nOr hold on what to seven cycles of eleven plus two of my last book shedding number Lebanon the New York times list your mind mean for me\nIt's not what it means to my mind is what it is and basically what it is is that you were having an emotional impact on people's lives\nThat's what it basically breaks down to\nYou have to understand that when average you see the number eleven whether it be a weather Charlottesville when they made sure it is that happening on the eleventh or they have to face to face years\nOr ... it doesn't matter where you go with this number eleven is going to touch people emotionally I'll give you an example of how this works um about lying\nLet me interject for a minute my friend ... who was a promise\nSaid this he said Dr Savage the number eleven is considered a master number is the most powerful neurological vibration remember you said vibration\nHe said simply state of the double one is the number of awakening\nWhen it shows up at the notes that the catalytic the message is being relayed which will serve to inspire eliminate motivate additionally seven is the number of wisdom knowledge in in a reflection therefore seven cycles of eleven only magnifies that concept of awareness which sets in motion a change of or a breakthrough for you my best Vern what do you think about that\nWell I I Would agree with the life that and the way you can show again the way you verify this as you look at the way the we do not want average everyday people do what they do there's a store called seven eleven all around the world that is that it's so obviously those two numbers go very well together\nIs that right now but that's generic that's a generic stagnant what does it mean with regard to my my numbers eleven coming up all the time\nAnd actually there 'cause all because the only way to verify this stuff actually works if you look at the people at the top of the gang and see how they're actually doing things\nSo yes they're doing things under eleven energy but the what's your friend told you was only the positive side there's negative factors number eleven to that's why al ... was form on August eleventh that's why it hit New York on nine eleven that's why the hit Madrid, Spain I'm for eleven that's why it had moved from India after eleven so there's two sides of the coin Savage\nHanging energy so what are you saying\nWhat I'm saying is this you are touching people's alive with your words you have a gift for writing and that's exactly why your books are reaching number eleven it's not like New York times and manipulating the number of coming out because you're having the most emotional ...\nIf the book before Trump's before it got the reason was number one on the New York times list\nThat's another one oh one than Lebanon eleven\nSo white Vernon says Savage first of all I predict

opportunity\nTo get with the disadvantaged I came from a disadvantaged background and no one reached out of gave me anything I just got to work harder to get where I Am surprised that this advantage community there are plenty of kids that come out of ghettos\nI used to the top because to have drive in that brain stop it that garbage about disadvantaged that's that's another watch war to liberate left disadvantaged what does that actually mean what does it mean disadvantage tell me what does it mean\nIt ... it means that they don't have as many of the first step parents are not as educate\nAlso in other words a kid who comes from a family with the parents killed themselves to be educated and to keep the kid in school they should be punished now\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhere you are you're saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from a household where let's say there's no father which by the way it's not even a racial thing anymore let's say there's no father at home with a single parent\nAnd let's say a day he's poor and he lives in a terrible neighborhood how you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty\nAnd yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nNo I I I ... the for profit for its I realize that\nThe you know that there was a time at Harvard that Jews were not permitted into Harvard or you know that\nFor something\nThat's not let let me just explain it I've studied this in great detail that was a time the Jews were prohibited from entering Harvard that you know that\nI flew into that yet\nAnd yet some kids will let them because they were so brilliant their scores were so high and it was such geniuses they finally let him in okay now we've turned it around where you're still putting you on the higher your chances of getting in that\nYou know my friends stop with the words like homelessness to me to me homelessness has no meaning that's a left wing phrased it make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged what do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you believe in white privilege\nNo that's why that's why this would help poor white kids ... and ... you know in other words if you're thinking you're consuming the way that your kids for their relative let's see if we were in school with they grew up you're making\nA good point but how fair is that\nI think it's fair\nThough that's like saying being a big fish in a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pond\nExactly right so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond and then when that kid who thinks he's great from Appalachia because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or poor performing kids winds up an elite college so called they're on those ... such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest as all trash\nUnless you're a hard science is no such thing as an institution that's better than the other all of the other is mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take that kid who was number one in the Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old how is he gonna do\nHell hell hole improve themselves at a young age rather than trying to get social justice what his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nYou're assuming you will is you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI've seen the opposite I think that people will give an unfair advantage to become worse because then they expected their whole life and then he gets out of a Princeton and Harvard or whatever and then when he goes for a job and then he goes into the corporate world and then what does he demand you hire me or else what else do you\nKnow no one has\nAnd you ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of the schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will kill you at the drop of a hat everybody knows this the thing is people listening who is saying how does he there even say it I Know\nWhat goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\nWell we disagree on this one\nI say no don't get any won a special advantage either it's equal to everyone or it's not equal it all is that simple you know this\nThere's no such thing as reverse racism those words don't have any meaning either it's racism murders and racism so

podcast meeting this morning of a team of sixteen people so it's going to be amazing here is that what's going to work the show is going to be live this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because the ratings are an eye abnormal ratings but because we're going to be going into the cycle of the election and liberals are running some of these stations that taking me off the yeah that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening\nOkay but the rest of your ... will hear the radio show for an hour and then anybody can hear the podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time and I expected it will be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that it will become one of the most important part Kass on the planet\nAnd if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's going to happen so one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or in the radio business is that simple they can try all they want they can destroy any station in the world and get away with it but you know what if you have the truth the
