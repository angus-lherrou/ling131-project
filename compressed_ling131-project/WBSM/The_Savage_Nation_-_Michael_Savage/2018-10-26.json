mental services to him so much for me if you\n\nWhat we learn from the ancient Greeks free remember we learned about the shadows on the wall remember that the average citizen even in ancient Greece never really knew what was going on all they show the shadows on the wall and then that's Greek logic one on one Greek philosophy Greek or politics one on one\nNothing's really changed all of a thing of the shadows on the wall we're looking at the illusions that the media wants us to see and we the people who've been trained in classic uh thinking\nSuch as myself are asking logical questions you don't even need a higher degree to think logically you could have no degree to think logically in fact if you didn't go to college and you actually work for a living it probably will actually those went to college\nDays but I didn't go to college these days I went to college in the time and we have to think logically over got thrown out of the university would it would just failed are cautious\nAnd our entire degree and I published my dissertation in fact my PHD which I'll repeat again and again and again was published as a book which is one of the highest on as you can get in fact my master's degree was so brilliant that it was published in its entirety as a book by a journal at Harvard University\nYou can check it all out it's all a fact\nSo I was trained to think logically and none of this makes sense to me\nSo all I'm doing is asking questions and I guess we've reached appointed America where you're not allowed to ask questions without offending does want us to not think at all but you know I'm here and I'm asking questions and I haven't gotten the answers yet then I'm asking where the answers to these questions\nWABC Mike apparently you could still think what's your question or comment\nYeah Michael ... these are these are scary non for good or facility or if you go after radio editor for over ... the fact that you\nAre like are you so if you look like they got all these ... for forever stance classical all of it it looked like they were ... strictly for your birthday\nWhat let's start with the first quote bomb that went off delivered the George sources a house up in tone up we're told that does is take a founded and detonated in the in the field so there's no evidence there\nAre certain\nThat's number one number two how do they get into the city in a newsroom why is looking not reporting on how we got in there where's the breach security where's the picture number three uh the ... house Secret Service protection for the Clintons where would they when this was done exactly\nRight so you know so what else are you going to say that with the I mean I'm not sure to be rude or abrupt but we've got to move on e oh what's the question left there's no question is left\nI'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria because if ever there was an example of one side or the other and we don't know yet trying to provoke mass hysteria to distract us from what's really going on I'd like to know what book or statement is more on target than this there is none\nNo good answers you none whatsoever WABC again New York we're going to miss you in January Matt because apparently\nI'm not good enough for New York radio but go ahead please\nMy copy let's say the on the podcast that's not a problem\nI mean I Know the world will hear me any way on the stream on podcasts but I'm not good enough uh WABC even though my readings with the highest I'm not good enough for the station Matt what's on your mind\nI just wanted to say that more than likely work the liver fight third party couriers writes anything any surveillance footage they would have what is the conclusive and I think more than likely will never find out where they came from what you're talking\nThey'll hang it in the air right to the election and the narrative will be hold those evil right when you were so vote for Trump to even planted bombs in all of the sacred characters of the left\nAll of a wonderful American patriots like a black Hussein Obama George Soros all these wonderful Americans were victimized by the evil right wing that's the narrative as an\nExact All right hey you go well doesn't fool me not for a second while we're almost all we are a lot\nJoined ...\nHere's the truth about most home security companies well they're like dealing with another bad you know old fashioned cable company\nHe how many housekeeper skinny have\nHow many gardeners couldn't even Beverly Hills white is buried Dylan make believe he wants armies of illegal aliens coming into America does he think he's fooling he's a brilliant man he's a successful man he's a billionaire he's got everything in the world and his building by the way on the west side is one of the most beautiful buildings in Manhattan\nI remember when we were tied up at that dock couple of years ago and they got the big yacht I saw this most beautiful glass building and it was his I said boy this guy is really smart\nJeeze that's smart why does he continue to pound the drum for open borders along with his good buddy Iraq Obama Bill Clinton George Soros and Jeff Zucker\nI Wonder if they actually meet somewhere at some kind of dark restaurant\nAnd have some kind of meeting I mean in my if I'm One of his the dark corners of the of the media and the right wing or as they say that I should think that there's a secret meeting of a cabal of Obama Clinton or a dealer and all of the left that they meet somewhere I don't believe they actually meet somewhere\nTrump supporters chat lock her up the same day Hillary Clinton was sent the python okay Newsweek conservative commentators Michael ... New York magazine was ignored me for twenty five years even though I'm Wondering you often they are you\nKnow most of the people who write for New York magazine aren't even from New York that's the irony I actually was born in how many people are right for New York magazine actually born in New York I don't know they're probably from somewhere else I Would think\nSo now New York magazine a ... you know they weren't that bears his prominent conservatives think the bomb scares are liberal hoax so that's almost neutral and in the way they did it\nThen the Newsweek says Michael Savage the conservative house at least that at least a polite about it and reasonably calling me the conservative house thank you of the radio show Savage Nation which has an audience of millions every which is all true\nBut at least they were dignified in their attacks Newsweek I got to give it to them New York Mac prominent conservatives think the bomb scares her liberal oaks somewhat that's a little ...\nProminent conservatives we've got that right but please call me Dr Savage when you refer to me because if you called that fraud Dr Ford doctor every minute with such a\nSuch sacred tells Dr Ford this doctor for that\nThat you think she was bigger than Dr Freud Dr Ford Dr Ford said this Dr Ford said that since a PHD that's real which I have from a great university greater than hers by the way and my publications great out\nJust great out distance anything that Dr Ford published please refer to me is Dr Savage now since you know recognize that ph these ah have value\nAnd it also adds a certain or of respectability to me\nTo call me whatever you want make sure you're coming Dr Savage do whatever you do to be fair now since you believe so much in the doctor business\nBut the main thing is you don't even have to call me that just trying to analyze what I'm saying for the sake of the nation do you actually think it's unreasonable to be skeptical about these things in your heart of hearts are you not skeptical yourself\nAll you people are right for New York magazine the Daily Beast come on when you're alone by yourself in the toilet\nAnd the darkest moments of your of alone is at night when you see you have no friends because of your main meanness and your horrible politics after all the paid volunteers have gone home when you're alone and you wonder where you went wrong in life you have no wives husbands no children\nAnd you ask yourself all that sex and no children where did I go wrong\nThat's the one line I Love that's my favorite line by the way to the deviant suit to try to attack me they think they can get to me I look at them and I sing all that section of children they don't have an answer for that one\nBecause that's the way of life that's the normal way of life and it has been from the beginning of time and it will be until the end of time which is children children it's all about the children and and what I Love is all those are talking about the children most\nDon't even have any they generally have no children\nThey all look like Donna Shalala I don't understand that the ones who are most interested in children have none [laughter] how does that work why are they qualified even talking about children if they never raised one what do they know about raising a child they stayed up night with a child with the flu and lost sleep\nHave they ever gone to school with a child who couldn't do math or because they were so distracted and put aside their own self interests\nHave they ever gone to plays they didn't want to sit through for the children have they set on soccer fields in the cold to cheer on their son no but they're all experts on raising children isn't that interesting and those of us who actually raise children are sneaker that his readers\nBy these wonderful people who have taken over our society you see what I'm saying\nAt least that's how I see it\nAnd I just don't buy this right now this little particular\nCharade I I don't doubt that tomorrow the next day they'll dig somewhat up I have a trailer park\nAnd then there'll be a Jack Ruby right afterwards first they'll get the Lee Harvey Oswald\nIn the Ku Klux Klan outfit or the n._r._a. outfit whenever the shopping not an an array outfit like I Would say camouflage jacket with a Trump a sticker on a Trump flag or something a Trump pat the ultimate the villain here would be somebody with a magnet hat\nAnd enter a sticker on a camouflage jacket with a Confederate flag or shown on it right holding a copy of stop mass hysteria saying he's a member of the ...\nThe perfect the perfect villain marched out and then they'll have a script in his hand and get something out of prison the Tallahassee or Georgia I don't know and the offer 'em like let's say you have free healthcare for his family for three generations of you'll take the fall and\nAnd maybe a you know some money thrown in with a one way trip to the Virgin Islands unnecessarily and fishing boat\nAnd then they'll say it'll declared yes I got all my ideas from talk radio I listen to talk radio and I know that all these people are evil trying to destroy America their new world orders and that's why I did it that could happen\nAnd if it happens civil liberties it that's all what am I going to do I don't know what tomorrow will bring\nAll I can do is take it

still will be heard across America\nOr on some stations for an hour or two and also on on whatever they call it podcasting which will be an original podcast so you know there's a funny thing today they can only control so much for so long and and now that they've lost control of the narrative itself I think they're trying to take control of a new narrative\nIn my opinion that's what they're

thing had been set up as a false flag to gang sympathy for the Democrats number one and number two to get our minds off the voyage of illegal aliens approaching our southern border close quote media matters report it now you have to understand media matters is a wholly owned subsidiary of George show us his operation he funds to them\nSo they are as PR team media matters for Twenty years is attacked me\nSo it's like George Soros reported when challenged by a caller who said savages comments were so far off the edge of it is they're responsible Savage replied because you you say it's a

as a false flag to gain sympathy for the Democrats and to get our minds off the hordes of illegal aliens approach\nI wake up today and I see that Andy blooper perhaps the most vacuous person in the history of the media they gave him a pair of clear eyeglasses to make it look like an intellect\nAndy blooper on CNN says he's no longer going to show pictures of the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border to invade this nation for the free things he said no we're not going to do that anymore because they're not a threat to the nation Andy why don't you take a few into

number one and if you're going to tell me as a person of the Jewish faith\nIs not allowed to criticize another person to the Jewish faith without being quote an anti Semite I Will say to you go to hell how's that\nGeorge Soros is the most disruptive individual in the history of the American political system nobody has ever spent more money to disrupt more events than this man he has funded\nTeeth off you know the good folks have been beating people up at attacking police George Soros funds them black lives matter don't tell me they're not a domestic terrorist group because I disagree with you that's my opinion what because as the word black and I can't say that they are violence is something I should ignore [noise]\nSorry I see him and I call them as I see them

me see the messenger that's number two the number three why did see an open the package if it was a suspicious without calling a Yorkshire the bomb squad wise like you get it on the evening news\nSo now we've got to play some sound here's Maxine Waters one of the worst haters in America today claiming she's not scared let's see our standing up now out of uh the new show the new show wished the newest show and tell us your oh to\n... to the poor who all the ... here we go off course all of that I thought it was a little white castle that horse Lance I Can't stomach\nGr she incited violence in this country I Want you to play a clip for so this is never forgotten what this woman actually has done to this country listen to the fore\nAnd that's nice yeah we\nOh we're not welcome in my own country you think I'm going to run away from some leftist who's going to scare me get mistaken most of us are ready to pretend to defend ourselves Maxine so all you're doing is provoking civil war you a loud mouth phony you do stand up there like you were a lady of peace and you're not scared yeah\nThe one who started this whole damn thing by telling people do attack us now you're making believe you didn't do it unfortunately feel Maxine Waters the south exists then you have the media government complex you got the the evacuation Andy Cooper and the bloopers I affectionately call him\nSaying he's no longer showing any video of the army of invaders coming from Honduras so they've already gotten from central a casting what to do they're not showing you any more than the marching army listened to Ofeibea is Andy blooper this isn't about the merits\nInvest or that immigration policy only about making arguments based on facts not\nShot up which is also why against and I were not showing wall to wall video of that caravan excel whoa you're whatever I think about the people in it no evidence they are and the minister ... adjusting some kind of invading army infiltrated potentially by terrorists looming on the U.S border\nHow does a man of such\nI Would say low IQ get so far on CNN\nI mean this man obviously was not that bright you could see that he's not smart you know I don't want to go into the light bulb analogy we know Don lemons or let's say utility bolt as I've said before because that's a good analogy that's something anyone can understand if you go to a store to buy light bulbs you can get different want adjusts\nNormally would get a ... what do what you normally use a Seventy a hundred in the house of sixty I don't know what we use today they changed the water's edge when I was a kid there was like a certain amount it's all different I Can't follow it I remember my house we had lamps of fifty a hundred a hundred and fifty like a three way but the general like Bob was sixty water\nRight now if you look in a light bulb section of a like a Home Depot\nRight you've got a variety of watch so then there's always the utility ... that's the small bubbles very them\nSo I Would say Andy Cooper is one rung above Don Lemon if if there's a light bulb a little hot little ... little brighter than the unlimited the lowest end of the ... of the spectrum it would be anti coup but then they give them an I ... a skinny suit\nAnd a pair of glasses that are not even prescription they're clear last just to make them look smarter that that's anti Cooper sums up to believe he's not running and pictures of the of the thing because the guy who runs the and I'm told them not to run it anymore\n\nAnd you know I Know why you listen to the show it was like I'm cynical number one but I'm also able to look look for things you know express what you wish you could say work but as we were more frightened to speak in this country than they were in the Soviet Union\nI've told you that people are terrified to speak out so I you know you live you know I speak for all of you I Know I Do I really do I know people say without you wouldn't know what to do you'd almost like the last of the Mohicans out there\nThe other skate around the topic to talk about a topic where you actually say what we think\nWell that's right so I keep saying keep trying to say it like it is and most Democrats behind the scenes think the same way either by the way incidentally they don't want their country overall on they don't want to pay higher taxes they don't like the bums in the streets anymore than anyone else does but they won't say it\nSo I'm like the uncle in the family that they'd like to go and visit once in a while there was no uncle left anymore

a set of wheels I mean could you do better than this if you're writing a movie called many of us screenwriters or listen to me and you couldn't do better they made a central casting nut case the only thing wrong with the picture for the left wing haters of this country is that he's not a white male that's the one thing that throws it off\nClaims he's a seminal and yet some say some postings claim each from the Philippines and that his grandfather developed his own style of martial arts to a fight communists we don't know really much about that some a site saves a registered Democrat change to

who developed his own style of fighting\n... collie shock says that that was used to fight the Communist Party the Philippines there's a detailed website about this fighting style on that linked in profile Mr ... calls himself a promoter\nBooking agent and choreographer of a male stripping show as well as the less shows in the Miami area [laughter] sorry okay so you know look there's a lot here you can laugh at chocolate some of it you can breathe a sigh of relief that he's\nNot a true a truly dangerous man the bombs looked fake to everyone who studied them yesterday they look like they couldn't go off they looked like they were made by child for Halloween but nevertheless they were frightening\nAnd the biggest question that frightened everyone yesterday was how could they get into all of these high end people's mailboxes and such without any video footage I mean where is the surveillance footage\nOn cirrhosis property where's the footage of the tropical our property of the Clintons these should show us if it was him who delivered this stuff All right let's take some callers because I'm opening it up to you again I conclude\nOne line the man in the van looked like they were created by Hollywood to me and I hope that there's no Jack Ruby coming next in the cast of characters that's all I can say All right and at least we now know that Trump did not colluded with the Russians it was with the seminal try that's the main thing we should know\nIf you want to be serious about it you can be serious you could lighten it up a bit and say let's read this\nA sigh of relief and by the way whereas the invasion today\nFar if they'd gotten in Mexico how close are they to our border\nAnd whatever the answer to that one I Do I'll be back with that news more right here on the Savage Nation\nI invite you to call it a five five four to seven to eight to [noise]\nJoined us Savage Nation coal no five four hundred seven eight bucks for four hundred seven to eight to [noise]\nWell is this him is he a Patsy is this another repeat of another Patsy job because the man in the van look awfully constructed to old Mike\n... not for sure and probably as fingerprints are on it you know now it turns out he threatened celebrities on Twitter I just got that now from variety just came out sent oh Mike by a friend of mine Jim Carrey Ron Howard amongst\nIs threatened on Twitter by mail bomb flash effect so how do you can compute this Jim Carrey and Ron Howard that run Jeremy they point oh Ron Howard I'm Sorry I I see the word Ron I Jim Carrey and Ron Howard among celebrities threatened on Twitter by mail bomb suspect\nThat she was a male going she's out on so I Am a ... a psych apparently use these accounts to directly threatened a number of actors and politicians including Jim Carrey Ron Howard Robb Reiner George Soros in our lives have been Warren ... Gillibrand and others\nSo now they're all on the list they can all side with relief they made they made the cut they can now be invited to a high end cocktail party at the at the um\nOr wherever they're raising money for the left wing Fox News green room and run and okay so we're going to see 'em what emerges over the next few days and the suspect um did attacked George Soros is home\nI don't understand how the garden and got the alleged bomber set it off in the in the field and there's no remnant of it not yeah I'm Still going to ask for the end of this whole charade where's the surveillance footage of the individual planted these will put these devices these impotent devices\nInto the mailboxes I Want to see one ... one picture of it let's take one call okay this is a hot day everyone's very excited\nThe minute we saw this this morning I said\nPersonally just going to be one of the toughest shows I ever did because I Know my enemies of gloating today saying you are wrong you said there was a false flag well if you if you look at the narrative of what I said I said there's a high likelihood or high probability that could be a false flag and to this day I'm not so sure it isn't\nBecause there's too many things about his van and about him that there were a little too convenient that this particular time\nI mean you know not to be committed in the political arena I'm telling you I'm not a hundred percent sure this is the whole story that was saying\nI remain skeptical I question authority that's how I have been since I'm a little boy and I have found no reason in my adult life to stop questioning authority whether that authority be on one side of the Iowa or the other I certainly question those in the media including those\nOn my side of the ILO I question even more than CNN because I Know a lot about them that you don't know\nI mean we do we get attacked CNN MSNBC they're easy but you know if you ever knew what I knew that I can say about people on my side of pretend to be great patriots and wonderful kind Americans if I can never tell you what I what gets me crazy every day when I hear them talk\nYou don't understand how nonpartisan I actually am W SPA Mike line and go ahead please\nYes Savage or a modern day or ... or you forget you know all these things to fight and your thoughts\nOn the enemy within a ... it's amazing I mean I was around for say about the ACLU lawyers a most large fish age for founding arrests and it's going all out of Iraq was looked like\nAnd all you're going back to a book I wrote in two thousand and six the enemy within what I hear on the cover in a raincoat that picture\nYes Hi answer\nThat's funny that you should still referenced that book while it looked\nInto I haven't dusted it off in a long time but I Do know that there is a a a reference in the beginning that's been widely picked up which is the dedication and then it goes to tell 'em Cicero\nA nation have survivors fools and even the ambitious but cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries is better\nBut the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys hurting the very halls of government itself\nYour seafood trader appears not a traitor he speaks an accent from India to his victims and he wears their face in their arguments the appeals to the base this that lives deep in the hearts of all men\nHe watched the soul of the nation he worked secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist a murder is less the fear I mean I can give you five names that come to mind are right now who comes to mind when I read that to you\nWhile I'll tell you what I'm just like at first off from right now so I oh there are enough names to fill this in a whole new book\nWhile\nThere are enough names to fill the entire book there are enough enemies within this nation to fill an entire book\nHow we've gone from Plymouth Rock the Plymouth Rock in one generation I mean there's a pretty good stuff in there and the book includes with enemies within the newsroom [laughter] so this is nothing new to me I've watched this for a long time\nAnd this very sad to see that the left wing has not yet stop their their of riling up these marginal characters let's assume for a minute that the guy is the guy who mailed these impotent little devices right and he did it on his own and he's not a pass the of the deep state let's for a minute assume that\nWho is that are triggered him into the state of fear and paranoia the very people that he sent them to\nYou have to say I'm justifying it which I Am not doing you could say anything you want you can categorize me in a way that I that I Would be very very angry but I Know you're doing it anyway those of you are the enemies of truth if you were a marginal guy in the bottom living on the edge with almost no money\nAnd you had a fear of communists which has family apparently has had since a couple of generations if the Philippine ancestry turns out to be true and you heard the speeches of Hillary Clinton if you saw who George Soros has been funding\nIf you saw an army advancing on the southern border and who was encouraging this invasion\nAnd you saw the costs the salt upon your Christian values\nYour family values you also might snapping become crazy so I'm telling you on the left to cool it because if you think this guy is bad you're mistaken bad is not him you know there's an old saying in the radio business and I get I learned from my first program director Casey says now working there again\nI used to get death threats in the mail when I first started the radio and they very ups deeply upset me because I never had that happened to me simply for expressing my views I was getting death threats and my program director at case of a set to me remember\nA flash or never kills\nIt's the ones you don't see who would a dangerous ones\nThis guy is like a flasher you hear what I'm saying to you this guy is like a slasher\nOkay he's he's not the rapist the real killers are out there and if you keep provoking them what you've seen in the last few days we'll be seen for what it really is a Halloween show\nSo I'm warning you left us to calm down your rhetoric and stop hating trumpet stop hating America and stop putting us down ... right wing but films because you're going to wind up in real trouble with them and it's not me I'm only a talk show host\nBut I
