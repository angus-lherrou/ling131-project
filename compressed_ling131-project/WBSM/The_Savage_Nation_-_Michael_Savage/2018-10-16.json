F. in in the oval office\nHe used the F word he called a Seventy year old president broke the rapper had no respect for the oval office he wore no tie he wore a stupid baseball hat on throughout\nIs this the kind of behavior you want in the oval office\nUh-huh would you ever expected me when I went to start when I went in there to start dropping F bombs the president\nWhy is it no conservatives has said that this is unacceptable by that low life rapper I Am the only voice has had the nerve to point out that behavior like there should not be accepted in the oval office that is a sacred office even Obama didn't permit that kind of behavior to be shown publicly\nWhy are we turning this nation over to whatever pop culture demands the needs to be the core and brought back to our nation's capital remember where it starts it starts there\nNot only in the White House but in the Capitol building to there was no stability left in our leadership\nDuring the Capitol building with a gaggle of reporters on the ground with thirty clothing I'd make the best suits and ties\nAnd I'd limited to a few of the press full sitting there on the the hearing said the clicking and the lights it's a disgrace the whole thing is a mess we in this country are so diluted into thinking that every one of our complaints and cranks and this and that\nIs something important it's stupid\nIt's stupid it's an embarrassment to the human condition and was so soft I don't know how this country because of how much longer we have become so soft\nI don't know how the nation can go on [noise]\nSo [noise]\nIf you were a loved one struggles with like a foot craft or you've got to try Sarah works really it's a non greasy phone proven to relieve muscle cramps fast\nUncovering an enemy that has already defeated and those words resonate with me all weekend conquering an enemy is already defeated so Obama flooded America with illegal aliens for eight straight years ...\nHe flooded us with Iranians many of whom are operatives of the enemy ... has ... has operatives in America ...\nOne third of our military age men are too fat to even fight ...\nThe rest of the drug addicts or addicted to something else on the Internet and wouldn't know how to fire a gun without shooting themselves in the foot ... so you read some sue and you realize that the ... been working around the clock to destroy us and with little help from their friends in the media\nI Wonder if we could still win a war means conquering an enemy that is already defeated\nHence the skillful fight it puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for the feeding the enemy when when that moment come\nWe can have all of the most powerful hydrogen bombs on earth\nBut if we lack the leadership necessary to use our weapons because we've been intimidated by the Elizabeth Warren's of the world than all those weapons mean nothing you understand how that works\nSo over the weekend a Muslim liver Dr jumped out of his car you're thirty seven years old and mercilessly beat a religious Jewish man in the street a sixty seven year old religious man was beaten to the ground\nIt was a ritually charges a hate crime and then the ... jumped in and drop the hate crime charges or the last I checked is there anyone from the religious Jewish community in Brooklyn New York with this occurred who could update the audience right now as to whether or not\nThat delivery driver was charged with a hate crime because to me first of all the guy had a prior rest you know that I Know that's not supposed to ... but it does count eight prior arrests heats up an old Jewish guy in the street make it look like World War two black and white some of Nazi era Munich\nAnd I'm supposed to sit here make believe is just a random occurrence it wasn't the random occurrence if you're bringing in people who have a certain ethnic group that is already he uh what do you think it's going to happen in this country is going to bring the hatred with them that's what I mean by defeating an enemy before you fire shot\nSo this is what's going on in the country but I'm not getting any religious Jews calling I don't listen to the show\nThey don't believe in ... like this not smart enough and they said they stick their nose in the tower and the ... day and night and they wonder why they're there shoveled into oblivion every few generations I'm Sorry I'm an old school kind of guy I Believe\nI Believe that religious study is the most wonderful thing on earth but it has to be combined with survival study\nAnd the one thing I admired the most are the stories of the old Chinese monks thousands of years ago who are being attacked by bandits and as a result these peace loving Buddhist monks learn martial arts they actually develop martial arts they're all developed by\nMonks who are trying to lead peaceful lives but they were being a sets so they learn how to use what was it hand they learn how to use a rake\nOr a whole and that led to a stick fighting\nSo they combine there are religious leanings with survival this sadly missing in the western Jewish community is very sadly missing it's not good enough that just study religious tracts\nNo you have to combine it with survival or else you're gonna repeat history again in the most negative way I've been trying to say this for forty years but no one listens to make it falls on deaf ears you know years ago I was a very very interested in in ... in in the Jewish when the the hubbub movement the Jewish people and I\nHang around with them because I felt they had their finger on on the ancient teachings\nAnd then I saw they were eating garbage poison just garbage fat salt sugar the worst food ever saw in my life and most of them was sickly out of shape this and that so I wrote a a an article\nIs kosher junk food ... I don't know if you're Jewish you have to be Jewish to understand that it was widely ignored article is kosher junk food ... meaning it it's kind of ironic when I said\nMeaning you're eating food because they step a kosher symbol on it it it's good for you because of the stamp while you're eating garbage full of sugar and you don't know why you have diabetes you sit on your behind all day and ... and you wonder why you're you're getting sick I Try to light and people that went nowhere\nYeah and you know a a lot of people you know don't want wisdom it doesn't matter whether it's the presidents of the United states or religious organization they only want to hear what they want to hear from people they want to hear from\nAnd so what does an independence scholar like myself do what I Do is I keep on trucking along as they used to say I keep on going along that's all keep on doing my thing until the clock runs out when the alarm clock goes off or it'll be good by that so I'm not going to change my ways I Can't this is what it is\nYou know is kosher junk food ... great article you don't even know what I'm Talking about and number two Trump should have set that Leslie stall Vostok ice core samples she would have been stumped that would have been the end of the argument\nBut a three hundred and twenty five thousand years ago global temperatures and C. O. two levels were higher than they are today period understory lesson which though\nThose are the Vostok ice core samples\nTrump could have stumped with that one line but he didn't because I'm banned from the Trump Administration by the new administration's communications director who came from Fox News he blocked me at Fox News and now he's block at me from the White House to the deficit not mine\nI'll go on and they'll go on and I wish him the best and I'll support them all meaning that this administration\nBut I'm going to tell you right now they're not doing themselves a favor by emitting the education that I have\nFrom their discussions that simple and now let's move on to other topics too fingernails on here really grow after death member I said that it's an optical illusion would I mean by that\nBecause as after we die\nFlush shrinks as it becomes the hydrated I Know it's a disgusting topic and so the skin retract and the nails and hair appear longer but they're not actually growing\nSo it's a it's a matter of understanding the optical illusion of death to understand why ... hair and nails looked like the growing as the same with global warming or climate change which is a new name for the same thing\nOr is it ... or ... well I'm Sorry to tell you what's actually not warm and does that mean I like pollution absolutely not\nI think it's great to eliminate as many pollutants as we can I'm super sensitive to any\nAirborne particles I won't be in a room with someone with cologne on your put me in the room was a Middle Eastern car salesmen I have to go almost to an emergency room if they shake my hand I have to almost have my hand\nRemoved from my body I Can't get the sent off my palm for like weeks after that\nNo I don't like I like pollution of any kind but mostly I hate stupidity is the worst kind of pollution there is okay be here be nowhere\n...

everybody's whatever they feel and when people like me on TALK radio or laughing only joked\nAbout well you know before you know a Women's Sports are going to be over because men are going to do this and we were kidding around I mean because a no man's really going to do that is just the Joe this is just to show how absurd it is to think that you could just claim or something else\nAnd now it's happening we seen that happen in high school track meets now we've seen it in a world cycling competition and the far left can't say anything about it because they have to admit that what they really are saying is crazy\nLet me get a Chuck and Chuck you on the Savage Nation my name's Greg now filling in go right ahead\nYeah are you know the term chickens coming home to roost really became popular usage country when a church or all the phony American Indiana University of Colorado row to pay for about a nine eleven occurred because he did\nHe did use that expression I remember\nSaid yes he did use that expression I became a you know growing up in the south that was a fairly common expression before Churchill was here and Malcolm X used to\nThe uh famously in his autobiography but go right ahead\nYou know the story for church ... oh yeah he\nWell he I think of a sudden when they first nationally the emails between the ministry straight string theorists you called lotto\nAnd faculty one he had to fly for jobs and email said well we have we have to a gentleman immediately we're going to lose weight to some other schools we need someone with his background if his\nCredentials as writing ability as a whole full totally fleet for he has about the same\nUh Indian background and the Indian charged with theft hires got he's not one\nI remember that where the tribes said they they said that no they don't they're not claiming him and ... again it goes to this whole thing of identity politics this idea that because of your DNA or who your great great great grandmother was changes\nWho you are and how valuable you are just doesn't make sense that's not how we do it in America so it'd be like saying hey your dad was a serial murderer therefore you are or herbal person we don't do that right um but we do in front of the things\nLet's say that you were a great great great great grandfather was a slave owner\nThat's your fault\nBut let's say your great great great great grandfather freed the slaves is that your fault or is that something that you should uh I didn't mean to say fault of the opposite right as something you should get credit for\nYou know you get credit for you do in the United states of America it's supposed to be a merit based society supposed to be content of character and what you do when we create and what your actions are\nAnd yet we're turning it into this idea we're going backwards what used to be a very liberal idea I'm going to treat everyone the same\nI'm not gonna care what color you are I'm not gonna care whether you're a man or woman I'm not gonna care what religion you believe in I'm not going to care where you came from I'm going to treat everyone I come in contact with the same they used to be a very liberal idea\nNow\nIt's a very conservative idea the liberals say is a way to oppress people\nUsed to be a very liberal idea to say that the way to not\nDiscriminate on the color is to treat everyone the same now they're saying if you have one of the same that's discriminatory\nThat's how crazy this world is going its upside down it's inside out it's bizarre world and I was also telling you about that now live with one is not the only problem story for the Democrats\nCabinet we go to this this is from ABC News and or ... no I'm Sorry yeah it is yeah sorry Washington Post ABC poll\nGeneric ballot in battleground districts the ones that really count the battleground districts where it's kind of you know we don't know who's going to win look we all know in the house everybody in the house is up for election every two years right\nThen we all know there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Republican and there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Democrat I mean it doesn't matter you know the are going to win this district the ... going to win this district and it's done doesn't really matter who the names are\nAnd then we get to the ones that are battleground
