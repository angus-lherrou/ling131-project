running out of steam a lot of the people are just going home for a number of reasons and it's ... mainly because we have a president\nTo his credit who is willing to stand up and say enough is enough was sending the military to the border we sent the national guard to the border and that's it you're not coming and forget about it you just not getting any here that's what he was elected to do\nFor that reason alone\nDonald Trump is doing a great job I mean let's be clear here again it's easy to say he's not doing everything right but given the the opposition here it's lucky still in the in the position that he sent\n\nThat staff so apparently they're not going to get through this country so he's into this country so easily and the rodeo that was expected around our polling places may not be conducted as the left wants so they're slowing down\nAnd apparently they're being turned back some of going back on their own that's the good news\nAnd uh let's see what else is going on\nUh Pittsburgh thing is not over with the president is arriving in Pittsburgh shortly and the left wing anti American creeps had the nerve\nTo make believe that those Jews these left wing fanatics of this uh bend the arc group funded by Alexander ... speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's sickening because it only stirs up anti Semitism\nBecause when you start to make believe that your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be defined\nYou anti Americans on the left\nYou make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't there are many many conservative Jewish people were never heard from by the government in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people when you don't make you believe you do is you starve anti Semitism\nAnd yet they want you to believe that all of Pittsburgh is Jewish community doesn't want Trump to the exact opposite is true\nAnd he's on the way there and I pray to God these left wing fanatics funded by Alexander Soros just cooler today and don't make a\nOf yourselves and pretend that you speak for the Jews in Pittsburgh when you get there saying you're not welcome I pray to God that you just for a few minutes have respect for the dead and don't use their dead bodies\nAs fuel for your horrendous agenda against the president then against most Americans by the way\nJust given a break for a day can you do that survivors huddle huddled in closet during synagogue attack terrible story I guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense self defense\nChristians Jews must learn how to use weapons they must learn to defend themselves I Know it's a shocking thing to say in a liberal democracy like ours over we're not a ton of notion while\nYou would like not to be that kind of nation but we are\nYou need to learn to defend yourself the Israelis learn to they can't just be done with love\nThey learn to have a tolerate in one hand and it was the in the other that's why they develop the regime some machine gun\nThey learn they needed a gun in one hand so the chief rabbi by the way of Israel was a paratrooper at the time remember that store he would parachute out of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in a in the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant\nAnd so when we're going to learn I don't know when the average liberal in America comes to understand that someone else is not going to defend you you have to defend yourself\nMaybe they wouldn't have to huddling a closet maybe they could learn that they have to defend themselves as terrible as that may sound and if they don't want to do it then they have to hire armed guards I'm trying to warn people about this since Nineteen eighty to eighty one\nIt's only a matter of time I said you're just throwing the dice sitting there like just waiting for a maniac to come in\nAnd it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and started them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but because it was in India you know it came in when this one hit home because there was a white man who did it a craze Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda they've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews that didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean is there is the uh the the the slaughter and the gay nightclub they didn't focus on it\nThe other slaughters they just always looked the other way because it doesn't fit the bill left wing agenda and it's not clear if you're looking at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open eyes open heart with all these news stories and you take it and you do it for a living is very difficult I had a tough time over the weekend after this happened it hit me very close and very hard\nAnd I brought everything that I could to the table yesterday but today we're talking about something that's entirely different\nWhich is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the in the in the women and children in them and caravan of which we know there are several everyone knows that I mean if you were a if you're a gangster how would you come into the country you hide\nWhat would you walk in Santa gangster and I want to deal drugs in America\nYou get in line with the thousands of them with the women and children you're having to push the carriages in front of you and you get the sympathy in the American people and say oh they're all just wanting to come and they're all poor that's how you would do it\nSo it's slowing down on its own momentum as was slowing down the momentum and that's because the president is speaking for most American people you may not know this\nForget the liars in the media who do this to incite hatred\nEvery poll one after the other no matter what the state shows that the largest majority of Americans even liberals do not want open borders they do not this is a\nA small percentage of radical fanatics funded largely by the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not allowed to mention his name anymore suddenly the victim all of a sudden if the victimizing America for all these years with all of us money suddenly he's the victim\nHe funds let's see on the FAA he's funded black lives matter he's fun to occupy groups\nTo me that's not American by the way that's a quite something else and he was thrown out of Hungary\nHe's not welcome in many European countries all George Soros because he tried to destroy their sovereignty as well they can all be Nazis what every Hungarian our loves their own country as a Nazi according to George Soros they throw them out of out of Hungary for what he tried to do to that country\nThat closes universities in some countries because of the Haiti was preaching against nationalities against the nation and nationalism\nAnd then there's another thing I said yesterday that should not be lost in the ether of the airwaves it's about so called white nationalists that's the new bogeyman white nationalist just say why didn't nationalist together and immediately you have a boogie man you can hate right\nIf you live in a liberal community has since I was white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist togethers feels good when you say it doesn't it\nWhat is a white nationalist is not too broad a statement white nationalist\nSo if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty what you're a Nazi now so look at every cross in every war memorial cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war\nShe a lot of them were white most of them were white and the cemeteries as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just population was and is and the military was comprised largely of white people and what let's go back to World War two just for a minute\nSo most of the man who wore enlisted to fight many of them are fighting these he loved America not all but many war and so they fought why well they will nationalist they loved America and they didn't want to speak German\n... simple so what they're white nationalist too so you know defined your terms a little clearer\nWhat I mean white nationalist what is it actually mean not every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet to the left wing in America they've conflated the terms into having you so you can believe that anyone who is proud of the flag\nProud of the nation's history proud of the culture proud of the language is somehow a bad person\nThing very carefully before you smear whites with that label or else you'll fall down to the level of Jeff Zucker on CNN\nDuring the Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred Savage

[noise]\nTo be prime you'll gated on major media like CNN make no mistake about it this is what triggers whites at the bottom to become psychotic killers is this kind of words these kind of words remember what power will remember I have a radio show where I can attack this guy for what he's doing\nAnd it gets to that in my system but many of you are listening to the show you have no outlet whatsoever maybe you are I'm poor maybe you have a bad job maybe your wife has cancer maybe you yourself are sick\nWhat do you think those of you will not like that this is doing to them when they hear a man like this saying that men like them should be banned from America\nThe biggest terror threat in this country has white men or we have to start doing something about them what does he mean by doing something about them round up white males put white males in jail throw white males out of the country what does he mean so now if you're a guy in the bottom\nAnd you're sitting there listening to this you say I'm not going to take this anymore and and something bad happens and that's why a TNT has a responsibility a social responsibility to the United states of America to give peace a chance it's that simple\n\nNow if you want to comment on this go at case about Jennifer line they go ahead you're on the Savage Nation\nHi Dr Savage thank you for getting my husband a platform he's not here to talk to you personally but here's a white male half Hispanic half white and he was a police officer for Thirty years and his ready to\nFit for all of this going on he's protected people he has friends of every nationality creed and he has no thank goodness in his phone's all he wants to do with people that work\nAnd do what they need to do but he is he's almost ten breaking point\nSo you're way I Want to hear I think I understand what you're saying you're saying you're agreeing with me that in this case has your husband is or the breaking point from the hatred towards white people\nYes yes and he doesn't understand that it's like why do you want to rush to be a white person and again you can say he's five racial he's half Hispanic and half white but he doesn't understand that's all he wanted people to do what they're supposed to do\nAnd when you can't tell me on the air what your husband's says but I think you're implying he's reaching a point of exploding isn't that what you're saying\nYes he is and he's he's in his retirement years he teaches firearms training and people are becoming are getting to the point where they're feeling that there there has to be defended just to go I Want to go onto the street anymore he's feeling that he's becoming a target when he is\nWell I I understand that very well and here\nI understand I Lived like that for twenty five years is a talk show host was received death threats for the day I started on chaos I vote you think it's easy now what you're saying now which is now gotten so generic it's against all white males now\nAbsolutely and and thank goodness there's apply yourself a platform for people to a release their their anger and and again you get the point what are you going to do about it I mean what what can we do I appreciate you telling us walking away\nAnd their brother were trying to vote\nNo no that doesn't work they wouldn't do anything unless it's targeted at a conservative these um these companies will not do a thing they only target conservatives I agree uh I I've seen this my entire career but um\nCan you tell us some of the things your husband says without incriminating him\nYes absolutely um he he doesn't go anywhere without carrying a firearm with cheese he's able to do legally that our our house we live in a very rural area he um he he ...\nHimself and it has kind of harm to the teeth and he [noise] he just doesn't understand he doesn't understand why why people are taking the view that white white men are prejudice white men are only out for themselves [noise] he um he's just have a lot for this and he he doesn't feel\n... as he said to you in the privacy of your home that you can share with us\nThat you feel is is a violence ... violence prone\nWell and and like like with with my husband have basically everybody he knows he wants them to be proficient firearms he just feels he fell from going to get into a war or not a race war but we're going to get into a liberal versus conservative war\nSo he fears a political civil war yes yeah\nYeah but it's it's breaking down on racial lines because of CNN\nYet it absolutely is that again that in in the broad picture my my husband my husband that's that's the bad thing about it my husband has and myself we have friends of all nationalities\nSo it's it's almost to that point are conservative friends that are black Hispanic Asian they feel the same way he does so he feels I'm officer\nThey feel powerless when they let a raping maniac racist like this on CNN stoke the flames of hatred\nYes yes and there's there's no way to stop them how do we shut them up\nWe'll wait for ... let me tell you this I Am the most often the most frequently um ignored person in the media that's a funny statement I'm the most published in the least discussed person in the media but you can bet on one thing\nI listened to by everyone in the media\nAnd what we are talking about today will resonate to the highest levels of the society something is going to happen at that company but this guy's not going to be there for much longer I can almost feel it in my bones that as we're talking this guy's out the door something is going to happen because there's only so much pressure a company can take\nI'm going to send you something for your husband's stop mass hysteria maybe him looking through the book will help them calmed down a bit what do you think\nThank you Dr Savage and hit tempted to order your book on Amazon its back ordered\nA while you'll get an extra one for Christmas because for those of you who think that I'm a bad guy the book ends with this one line I quote Benjamin Franklin Franklin said just before he signed the declaration of independence just one line indulge me\nWe must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately I Am trying desperately to unify this country before it is to like\nAnd I'm sending you stop mass hysteria maybe it'll ... down when he realizes that there are people who are good in this country forceful but decent or try to make things better not worse\nThank you for the call stay on the line Jim take the young ladies a phone number\nIs time for another caller WABC marrow line to go ahead please you're on the Savage Nation\n[noise]\nI'm listening to you for a while\nAnd I are very much so because you know there's been found in critical of service and you know the liberal party\nAnd I liked that found however question that you asked for garner freight is what should be done to\n[noise] the type of [noise] and my question to you is [noise] why not why not have a punishment [noise] where you know if these [noise] these acts\nWere done by a person of color the Islamic beard\nUh uh uh\nAfrican descent or Latino dissent they immediately deported why not because\nWhy wait why not what why not what why not deport them at home ... ... you're\nYou're getting confused I realized that you're a guy who was trying to you know put things together and and learn but marrow\nYou're lumping things together if a Muslim commits an act of terror and he is not a citizen he has deported after ... being found guilty\nIf he is a Muslim of American origin he cannot be deported is protected by the U.S constitution as the same with the span of give you an American Hispanic and they were deported if on the other hand you are an illegal alien and you're not belong in the country of course you're deported if you're found to have committed a felony so\nYou're mixing apples and oranges marrow by you know somebody I really do appreciate all levels of society listening to the show\nSo I'm going to send you stop mass hysteria I think you'll enjoy that book it will come to you on a plane brown rapper so that your friends in
