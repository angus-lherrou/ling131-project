that is not diplomacy at all that's outright frightening\nFor president to say a thing like that what you're talking about the nuclear treaty with Russia being ripped up and by the way it was a treaty that was signed by Ronald Reagan\nSo\nWell I guess you could just put your ... your hat on and ... ...\nOr if you're a commentator like me who lives and dies by his word which is what I Do never make a mistake about it we live and die in this business by our word because there's something you've got to know you remember everything we say somewhere along the the line everything everyone in radio says is remembered by someone in the vast audience just listen to\nOf us and uh you people remember things I said Twenty years ago so I don't take back anything I just said\nThis is not diplomacy can be screaming from a helicopter where you can't even hear half the words that things slipping and no one's discussing it to me if you want to rip up a treaty that was signed by president what you do is you convene Congress and you talk about the treaty\nAnd you'll give evidence that Russia has violated the agreement where where's the evidence have you seen any evidence that Russia has violated the agreement that anyone tell me where is the truth I'm I'm open\nI'm open to do to reason show me the proof Russia has violated this agreement\nAnd the justification for increased Ellicott City between the nation's show me where that is\nThis is the opposite of the Trump that I voted for just the opposite the Trump who appeared on the show there's the opposite of the Trump was non interventionist and a man of peace something's going on inside that administration that's very worrisome and I will say this we heard about an argument or a fight between\nThe great General Kelly and who was the other one I don't even remember who was it over the last time there was a screaming match between them and one of the ... oh the the moustache\nAnd then we hear that there was a fight between Kelly and Corey Corey Lewandowski\nOver something\nSomething's wrong inside the picture because General Kelly is a four star marine general um ... it was only a state trooper\n... don't confuse a state trooper with a force dumber and general number one and then the other one never fired a gun so far as I Know I don't think that both to never fired a daisy Bebe gun so far as I Know John ... line three what's on your mind\n[noise] Hi I'm like\nYes go ahead quickly have only about a minute and such\nOkay I'm not part of the kind of trying to clear up some of the issues regarding the nuclear agreement with Russia being thrown up on the air force veteran and uh I Believe what Trump is doing that is because he's aware that\nThey stockpile of nuclear weapons that we have particularly with the air force or familiar with um are are all in dire need of replacements for example the Christmas ... is a quite a few of those were converted to a conventional a warhead or the rest of 'em that\nAre so he wants to rebuild our nuclear arsenal so in order to do so yes the threatened war with Russia [noise]\nNow I think it's necessarily a war with Russia they want to try to try to at least be equal with them or maybe if you have a slight advantage or is\nThere any evidence that we outside as I can see which show that Russia has violated that Reagan Era agreement I don't know where that might might be [noise]\nThat I don't hold on the line\nI'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria so we might stop mass hysteria joy those Savage Nation coal no ... for hundreds [noise]\nFor many years I've been wanting to Savage Nation about a secret war on cash by big government and big tech to steal both your money and your privacy well recent reports confirm that this war is expanding like wildfire\nI don't believe I'm In the inner circle at all I think I'm On the house right now because I don't believe this administration likes any criticism at all and I think that if I stepped out of line here I did so for the sake of the nation not for the sake of the party or the sake of the presidency I care about the nation I put the nation above men do you know that\nYou know\nWhy we have a\n... I see what you're saying but you're thinking that I should go you think I should be a little lighter during this period of time okay you know what you make a very good point and I suppose my family would say the same thing but they know they can't control the anyway so but I'm going to send you a stop mass hysteria for being so intelligent\nNow before we we move on got again if I had a park is I go for an hour right now I started something earlier in the show when I talked about the army's invaders that are sitting on the border all these strapping young men and then I reference\nWhen the barbarians broke the Roman empire in the east and west and I talked about why that happened in the third century and the reason they were able to break the Roman empire and the third century is because the Roman empire at that time\nHad been decaying socially and disintegrating mowing and then the barbarians of ... appeared on their borders now what's shocking and what I said to you\nIs that no one listening to the show could disagree with me that this nation is not decaying socially and that's not disintegrated morally or you got to do is look is look at the people in the media and you'll understand what I'm Talking about what you got to do is walk in San Francisco or New York where you see a man urinating on a subway track\nOr a bum dropping his pants and deprecating on a street that's where I mean by decaying socially then after that the drug epidemic in the nation\nThen add to that the the model disintegration of the nation and you'll understand why were collapsing as a nation\nAnd so who saved the Roman empire almost saved the Roman empire\nAnd that was cops and seeing the great he was a model of great devotion and great intelligence by the way\nIn in some ways I Know you're not going to like to hear this Trump was like our Constantine the great I've made comparisons of Trump to pass to start figures and they've fallen on deaf ears because the little ...\nThere are a folk in the media don't want to hear anything good about Trump but I'm sure as you get people out the understand what I'm saying when I say ... he was constantly in the great ... of great intelligence who did some great things\nAnd what happened was ... Constantine originally beat back a raid of the gods the guys you know about ... you know I mean the dots with black makeup and San Francisco he beat Baca right of the gods\nWho are trying to come in the Balkans but he didn't have the will or the power of the government behind him to protect the frontier across the Daniel why he was too busy\nHe was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation of a week and empire from within and invasion from without you following this\nIt's a very big story to take me a couple of hours to go into but I'll summarize it for you in a in a thumbnail sketch\nBecause what happened was caught some team did the best they could but then he died trying to reorganize Rome and what happened right after he passed was the borders of Rome working ruptured and the visit God's invaded almost the Constantinople\nThey defeated the emperor of el ends at ... poll they built the settlement in Bulgaria ... three seven nine to three Ninety five there came the emperor you do see us the great and he was a ... a formidable and ... and ...\nAnd over the army's ... presided still ... he was of angel\nAnd he presided over the ... and the Balkan Peninsula outlaw a God and I could go on and on and I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to bore your history has to bore me as a kid but the more I study these things I realize that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways\nWhich is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay as was ancient Rome and the nation being pressed on his borders by armies from without as we are seeing in black and white and every color imaginable on our borders\nWere being crushed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after outlaw marched into Italy and after a short sheets took Roman eighty four ten Rome fell apart and what happened after wrong collapsed did life go on for the average Roman listened carefully\nThe opening half of the ... century this was remember hundreds of years later\nYou saw the entire Roman Empire and Europe become prey to Robert armies of barbarians does that sound like gangs\nWas the one I just said this is not an eerie as outrageous some history as the Roman emperor empire and Europe collapses in the fifth century rubber armies of barbarians what preying on the Romans citizen\nThink about that\nThink about what you're saying in America today where we as middle class citizens\nWe lock our doors we lock her cars we have alarm systems we carry guns many of us\nThink about this why you know you walk around a suburban neighborhood and look at every house they have an alarm system I'm not going into an ad every house has an alarm system every house is fortified like a little for\nBecause people realized that at night somebody could break in a while they're away at work paying the taxes for the illegal aliens to enjoy their lives someone could break in\nSo they protect themselves because right now we have the\nA bit of rubber armies going around the country I Know it sounds rather hysterical but it is and it's out of the ... is rather accurate if you actually read the crime there was as I Do and look at the data as opposed to the fake data put out by the fake media by those in the fake news business so\nI could tell you what went on in the life of the countryside half the room was invaded and what happened to the nation their roads and forests became infested with robbers\nThe barbarians went into the forest so stop right there you're in California the barbarians have almost destroyed our entire ecosystem\nThe barbarians who've been raising marijuana in the ... national forest these pristine beautiful ancient farce have almost been destroyed by drug drug cartels or raising marijuana\nNot only drug cartels we haven't digital criminals who have been destroying our ecosystem what's ironic to me is all these green left us who care so much about the environment\nHave said nothing as are sacred and pristine streams and waterways had been destroyed with toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers in our very national forest not one more from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the man of spends all this time conniving to hate Trump conniving to bring in more illegal aliens\nSays nothing about the army's that have destroyed our ecosystems and on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these plants and the waste is going into the streams and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has repeated itself history is repeating itself\nAs I Try to alarm America yes I Would use the word ringing the alarm bell and stop mass hysteria I'm trying to explain to you about America's and Saturday from the Salem witch trials

Nation 'cause I had a call yesterday\nWho's an undercover de ... who told me what's going on on the border by the way if you hear my poor dog coughing in the background that is the mascot the Savage Nation little chatty he just came back he's Fifteen Years old been with us from the beginning if you remember he was on stage with me at the chronicle pavilion when he was a little black\nPoodle and uh he has his issues what he's doing fine just came from the vet and she did an X ray and he has no fluent on his lungs and no sign of anything she just getting older like you\nAnd that's it so that's one of his life goes on so America's getting older and the older people in America are losing their will to live\nAnd they don't know what to do that came out to the polls and the last election with one last hope that one last candidate who was not a politician would save the country\nAnd thus far they're not sure what's going on they love the rallies they love the speeches they like many of the policies they thank God the truck that Trump is there and she is not there but they don't know why not do anything more visual for them with regard to the border\nThey don't know why is one thing to give a speech with Ted Cruz and inspire people that's very important but I think the next\nThe follow it up with some action biggest each day that we lose is it that we can't replace\nIf you'll see it on me coming what is general do let's just put it in military terms with or without weapons you see it on the marching towards your frontier\nLeft as a general ... what are you taught military academy you sit there and give speeches or you'll line up your troops you built fortifications you build barricade what do you do when you see it on me coming to you see a border\nYou catch us when it gets through your way through this the whole world is watching\nAnd the entire nation and our future is on the line I Know you've heard this before but this is so clear to me now I've tried to visualize this for many of you and some of you got it that's why I'm Still successfully after twenty five years in radio while you're still make my books best sellers\nAnd thank you for doing that would stop mass hysteria without any promotion whatsoever except on this program and very very little else\nDo you see of the most prominent conservative writer in America right on me but you don't see me because I don't have a TV shows you got to understand the people do listen to this program and we're very important and the government than in the world and my ideas on that last they'll listen to but they're not being acted upon flights out\nThe split enough that I helped elect Donald Trump now we need to help Donald Trump protect us from the invasion the new Mariel boat invasion weather is or not I don't know what would you do to stop this mass of humanity coming to our borders [noise]\n\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and bingo surprise you hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's what that's why I recommend the extent of the vehicle protection from car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty\nOf reasons really the idea is not yet been talked about but it will be I help my students producers listening apple yeah I Know she does every day to give a the bow tie a little info for tonight maybe the boats I could rip it off\nAnd like all out so it doesn't really matter at this stage in my career who represent often at the end of the day as long as my ideas a thought about I'm really happy so they ripped off the word hysteria but try to create hysteria but I put together three watch stop mass hysteria\nAnd then for a while you heard the words hysteria being used and they realize they might be helping me so they stopped so everyone's trying to come up with the new world for hysteria they don't know what to do with that so now there's a new idea that I've come up with I had an idea Smith and should Trump threatened withdraw from the new NAFTA Mexico failed to stop and he makes it makes sense to me it's a good strategy\nIf I were in Donald Trump's kitchen cabinet\nHaving a Diet Coke and an ice cream with him\nI Would suggest the same thing I Would say he's such an intuitively intelligent man and a man of action they say you know the good idea let's do it that's how he would work\nHe would work like see if I was with that but I'm not invited\nI'm not invited because I'm not part of the Fox news gang and it seems to me right now only Fox News people are being listened to\nParticularly that educated genius or who speaks twice a day and advisors and everything probably advise on things we can't even imagine given his lack of education they probably are considered even smarter than people who actually study these things\nGiven his lack of international knowledge he's probably considered a better diplomats and train diplomats given his lack of the use of even the English language properly probably consider Tibet a linguist a then linguists\nSo I I wouldn't doubt that um it would be received with\nWith a very ... very keen interest by the president he actually heard it\nBut ever since they put ... market and they are I don't know since ... went in there I don't know that anything I say is being heard that was the last straw I mean once they put ... in there it was all over how can you take people from one network and use them and you were administration exclusively did Obama ever do anything like that\nYou know I'm a raising a very sensitive issue right now in the middle of all of this is not even personal it's worrisome to me what if Obama had hired the former director of I don't see in that let's say let's take CNN roughly woke up and said oh she Obama's talking to a Wolf Blitzer every night twice tonight on telephone\nAnd Wolf Blitzer is the only one advise them if this went on for years that's a whole year no or then the the guy who was fired from CNN ... imaginary uh guys fired from CNN has no job the next thing you know he's communications director for Obama tell me what tongues would be wagging on the conservative side like all\nSo how could you see what I'm saying you can't be blind to what the other side is seeing if you are then you're going to lose and this is what's worrisome to me is I think that not only with the way the corps base of this whole thing\nWe the people the core base of the whole thing I think we become blind to the other side we may think we know what they think but I don't think we do and then if were blind to what they're saying about us them were really in trouble\nThat's why I have to be the independent I Am and that's why I sometimes a great many of you people who wear the hats forwards and backwards and upside down even on Sundays\nBecause you don't understand what it means to be an independent commentator in this country because so few of us exist there are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean that means I have to be critical times even of the man that I admire so much and who I back it's that simple\nIf you have a family member who you think is making a mistake\nSocially or economically or in business and you say wait a minute that's not a good idea Johnny you can't do that because here's what's gonna happen that's family isn't it family don't families disagree with each other whereas there's blind loyalty this idea of blind loyalty coming from\nThat's not the world I grow up and I grew up in a world of free thinking and vigorous debate\nIt's actually a very American idea [laughter] free thinking and vigorous debate goes all the way back to the founding fathers it goes back to the constitution of the bill of rights\nFree thinking and vigorous debate but seems to have gone out the window right now people have circle the wagons it's like wait a minute don't you dare talk to the Indians\nYou know what I'm saying that's what has come down to stay here stay here in the inner circle in the ... the wagons I used to call them Calistoga wagons but the ... circle then all of us wearing the hats have to stand in the middle and we have to wait for the flaming arrows flying over the tops of the wagons\nI don't see the world that way I don't quite see it in those terms\nAnd I still think it's good to have a dialogue with your opponents otherwise\nYou get increasing tension anger and rage hatred hostility leading to a total breakdown in a society which is the last thing we need bravo Michael thank you very much I just pulled it for myself and my own head because that's what we need to hear more about we did to him are people saying what I just said\nLike give peace a chance you know what I'm saying like let's play a little beetles music together give peace a chance let's\nCertainly listen to the other side not the ones who were pushing and shoving hit them back hotter as my position\nShe I say if we go low and they kick us kick them even harder kick them into the gutter and it's that simple we go low they kick us in the gutter kick them how to take them into the gutter that's number one but if there are people that wanna rationally discussion discuss things that's what I'm saying we should do\nAnd I would hope that the other side still has some rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something missed the liberal from San Francisco are you telling me you really want another twenty thousand or so mainly young men strapping strong young men\nFrom the Central America that come into this country right now do you think they would actually say yes\nYou think that the city of San Francisco so liberal you'll be mistaken if you actually spoke to many of the middle class working people I mean professionals they may have money\nThey may have property new cars families you think they really don't know what's being done in the city you think they like stepping over human trash you think that they like seeing the windows broken into and their cars when they go to a restaurant\nYou think they like seeing the mismanaged the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption in the construction industry here or that Venice avenue is so broken up due to contract corruption that stores going out of business do you think they don't say this\nThey don't see if they do see it\nAnd they said to me with a few times I run into and talk to them is I Can't say anything because most of my customers are liberals and they wouldn't patronize they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nAnd no none of them want the illegals here\nNone of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country on screen on vetted some of whom are very dangerous some of whom may be diseased\nAnd certainly the social service systems which are already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good old San Francisco want more then that would be complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you so I'm going to open up to one\nBalls here on the Savage Nation remember my solution I didn't say force to stop the world's\nBiggest ah I have a bit of the Confucius I've a bit of Confucius is gene pool let me which is why I eat a lot of Chinese food is to feed the Confucius within and the Confucius within said we can stop this invasion from Central America without firing a shot\nWithout even launching a troop I Want you to think I Want you to think about this it's loud sure alive he would have me as an advisor\nDonald Trump should absolutely understand he needs to reach out from behind his TV circle of advisors he needs to reach beyond that little world of people talking to each other every day with the same stories in the same mindset and the same pack phrases\nHe needs to reach out to the western regions of this great empire of his and he needs to speak\nTo the leading intellectual on the west coast who is a supporter of his eye has always been and will be and understand that I just said Trump can stop this invasion without lifting a finger at firing a shot always got to do is lift the phone I'll be right back\n...

fundamental values are under attack\nFreedom of religion freedom of the press rule of law\nAnd this is really important it's also lacking in a time when our healthcare rights and protections are being taken away from us\nCutting the guarantees for pre existing conditions for opioid treatments for prescription coverage and even going back in the days when women are being charge more than men for the same health care\nAnd there's a healthcare effect that stay with the tax bill as well to point three million dollars on Sunday how's that going to be a store and Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan both agree\nBy cutting Medicare Medicaid and Social Security so this is the most important election in my lifetime yeah\nI'm asking you to support me to be our hopefully of the new majority that will send checks and balances to administration and Congress that's gone off the tracks I'll find common ground where it's there but I Will never be silent\nWhen our rights and protections are being taken away\nLike right now we're going to move on to the question art or the hair and my understanding that are here and you're going to go first so okay so the federal government is currently in an effort in ... they regulate it relates to protect\nIts highest sailing in Alaska and grass is related to climate change I like it was the issue for cost on line that's track so the federal government is subsidizing insurance areas and and what can the federal government it from a climate\nSo this is this is obviously a very important question for our country is particularly relevant to this district\nOr I'm looking to represent a district were nearly ... percent of the towns are coastal\nAnd we've seen the detrimental effect the rising sea levels have had on our communities I live in a town of Marshfield where last winter we were devastated 'em by floods that came in during lunar high tides are we going to see well bridges so it's it's real and it's getting worse\nUm we need to do more to uh promote green\nEnergy renewable energy we see opportunities that only the right thing to do a ecologically is the right thing to do for for a job perspective as well um we can be part of the green economy I think that is very important and the federal government plays a big role in them and one of the things we find is people in our area ... pay some of the highest\nFlood insurance and the country\nIt's it's ... it's just proportionate compared to other folks and similar areas we need to do more I support them the Montgomery plan um which helps him as one of the ways there's a lot of people would cost of living is a reasonable for a flood insurance\nBut I think the federal government needs to be involved I think the federal government needs to promote a greener energy is well I think one of mistakes we made and then one of the things you're gonna find a balmy as we talk about the need for bipartisan collaboration the willingness to stand up your own party\nUm here's an example where I disagree with my own party\nI don't believe we should have flown the higher the Paris climate accord\nUm we should stay in it and try to make it better\nAnd taking the fees and science and paying for that implementation paying for their monitoring paying for the things that fishermen are paying seven hundred eight hundred dollars a time they bring anything forward in that regard\nI Will continue to work together on the monument issue I must tell you this I worked on that I worked with senator Markey on that we work together that was reduced is an area we still weren't happy we wanted a meeting in Bedford we'd gone\nBut that's an executive action and when you're talking about standing up against your own party remember this I stood up against the Obama administration on this issue and fought it so I'll stand up against my own party when it's necessary to defend the interest in my district\nGet we're going to have it ... education I'm On the question that are on the federal government aircraft hitting our first question on education secretary that could have lost touch with regarding title nine regulations that protect planet and favoring charter schools\nAnd secretary device that she's trying to protect your process on a charter school on how to urban education\nWhere do you ... and the secretary and approach and they're all federal government application\nOr China line is very important uh it's something that we worked on a ... and some of the issues that the secretary has been involved with a troubling to me as well she's pushing back to on issues there were there were standards for tech\nOr people on sexual assault issues I was a district Detroit I had colleges in schools in my district we were involved in this were involved in preventing these things from happening\nIt's so critical in that setting or the people are protected and what she's done pulling back on that I think it's a big mistake a charter schools or I've got a they have them some of them work I'm not a big fan of charter schools because it's pulling money away from the public school area\nNew Bedford in Fall River are pulling away public money\nOr is critical in fact I've been fighting the house leadership when they were taking money out of head start preschool most important money that we can put in and the most cost effective moneys that we can put in a and making sure they're here\nIt's critical if you're going to have an economy that tries here in these areas if you're going to have\nGood jobs that pay well and you're going to have to deal with a education is one of the primary issues so I'll continue\nTo fight for these issues or continue to make sure because cities like this can never try the way they could drive a without having a fundamental education in place and it's one of the most important issues we have a we can do more as a matter of fact\nIn terms of vocational education and other areas because uh\nWe need this is a foundation the average person getting out of high school is going to change jobs sixteen times in their lifetime and if they don't have a basic education to do that then they won't be able to the effect\nThat's why we're pushing money and I supported money here so the transition from high school or into college in that regard making sure that people don't fall within the cracks as they advance or education\nI Can't see at the question that with that title nine regulate and charter schools um and whether or not you agree with it secretary approached\nSo any anything that uh opens the door makes sexual assault he's run they obviously I'm against that or any type of discrimination that's involved in the process um that's just not who we are um that cannot be allowed um when it comes to education and charter schools what I Want to do is I Want to make sure that we're able to afford our children the best education possible\nIt's the future of our country they are the future of the country and my wife and I wish I was saying when it comes to how we treat our children how we educate our children\nYou pay me now or pay me later it seems to me we need to do a better job paying up front and making short because we're ... read a future them read a future for our country um when it comes to things like ... training and education\nI'm all for it I think it's a great a great idea of you have one of the best vocational technical schools the area right here and um you know look for a lot of folks down as a better option than going to college and getting a college or having a college loan hanging over your head when you come out\nWhen we go around we talk businesses throughout the district\nOne of the things we hear over and over again is\nI Do not have enough people that are technically qualified\nSo the fact of the matter is technology is going to be able to replace a lot of things moving forward\nTruckers and other things but folks as can be a long time before technology is going to replace a plumber electrician or a carpenter we need those types of help we need that often we needed desperately um you figure that out here we need to take that model and expanded further elsewhere um\nSo when it comes to higher education and things like that um I applaud the governor's Akron seized on some great things one of the things he's actually done is loud high school students to start earning college credits while they're in high school\nSo we'll have to take less and get less college credits pay less money when they go for the secondary education in college those type of things we need to think differently I think smarter about this with the goal of making sure that we provide the best educated workforce possible that everybody has an opportunity to realize the full potential\nHey thank you so we're gonna come back around higher education later but I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with the\nOrder ... responded and we're going to look at manufacturing acts and ... and the person that's right I mean American ... Iran developing house or many decades um what approach it take to rebuilding manufacturing and city like Fall River and the bad part\nSo when you look at places like new bedroom\nA river there already have would be called bones\nAnd all the makings obviously they had an industrial rent renaissance here that took place you have a lot of infrastructure you've got a lot of the buildings in place and what we need to do is consent businesses to come into work here you've got an eager workforce and we take a look at things like um ... real for example\nA lot of people look at south coast real is a way to get people in this or an opportunity to get\nWork elsewhere um I Do a little bit differently although that's certainly one of the things that we would look for um I really think I look at some of things that people like ... when his team are doing in this city um I see this is a place where south coast real could be a way for people to come into work here and we've got\nThe foundation we need we've got a lot of infrastructure I visited a lot of the older buildings that have been repurposed um it was the type of things and a lot of places don't have\nYou have 'em here in abundance based when you're proud past um we need to make sure that we leverage them so that you could have even products which are moving forward and I'm confident we can do that I think there are things you're looking at like tax subsidies and things like that to encourage people to come here\nBut certainly you also need to have affordable housing which we have here in abundance of you also have a lot of other good things going on to make sure you've got strong neighborhoods you've got a neighborhood task force or the mayor put together and basically it's going around to make sure the people to cheer their properties\nLandlords are doing their part I'm all those things are important 'cause people should be proud of where they live and uh I'm very encouraged by what actually taking place here in New Bedford\nI kind of manufacturing and hey if I ever had and at that time\nYou know I have a great example I've been to the New England shirt a company and saw a river a scene where they've hit a niche in terms of manufacturing in terms of shirts and other dealt with that I also hard it is and I'll tell you what's making it so much harder right now and that's the imposition of terrorists in retaliatory tariffs that are coming back\nA lot of our manufacturing in our region that is a niche type of manufacturing where they've had a a little hole that they they they really made themselves a more competitive than China because the quality of the modifications they could do\nWell guess what's happening to those companies right now we're getting calls in our office right now where they were afraid they're going to go out of business they're getting affected by the tariffs that a day or a looming on the steel tariffs the other tasks that are coming\nAnd that's gonna hurt manufacturing type businesses the modern ones in our area\nI'm working so hard to avoid it as the ranking member dealing with training foreign affairs in fact I Want to go the other way for free trade and I've been working with everyone at the table to make sure that stop and it should stop it's losers game trade wars are so uh\nWe have to look to the new manufacturing this there you know we just had a meeting with one point two million dollar grant or something I was intimately involved with a with a huge ... who used to work with us in a UMass all the academic institutions that are here uh throughout the whole sub south coast as well as corporations like lucky or hike or like that\nThat are in the manufacturing of new technology the next Gen blue wave\nCompanies like water bottles these are areas where we have to ... actually gear in our interest in our resources\nIs a three step process and we were in the first step already a next step will be actually begin to have a plan and implement in on the third year we can become the silicone valley for marine science and technology\nIn the whole United States if not the world the foundation is here the educational institutions here\nAre the companies that here so this is something be excited about and that's the type of manufacturing where the jobs that pay twice what the average jobs are ... and have a real growth potential in the future\n... discussion after a certain today one minute ...\nBut while how a lot about the issue of terrorists um and manufacturing or possession that tear us\nSome relative to terrorists that have been ... which I I think that does sometimes tariffs unnecessary there should be a short duration which should allow the other folks and how long they're going to be but there should also be targeted with the desired result\nWhat is it you're trying to accomplish when you accomplishment you remove those terrorists um but the fact that matters when it comes to terrorists are often unforeseen consequences in the case of the most recent terms we seen a perfect example\nThat way they'll be able to go on and that money won't be wasted now I'm the original I'm One of the original cosponsors on uh the legislation that would allow us people with student loans to negotiate down we were getting over six percent in interest the government was getting that uh well interest rates are were one or two percent\nOr that should've been done I I was a sponsor when that was first introduced it to Congress is going to continue to support that ah I also think it's a couple of great examples right here in our own state and our own region I think we should do more to encourage incentivize a ... a relief of student loans like work\nUh in terms of public service work for instance where someone because of the U. mass program that allows that it was able to get relief from their tuition laws by working with us in public service and we had a great employee or it worked well or\nOtherwise he wouldn't have been attracted perhaps of this public service job it was a win win situation and finally\nWe have the toothless to program right here in Massachusetts and in this area uh where you can go in our state system for two years community college two years for\nLet's get a four year degree and you know what the combined tuition for that for instance is at UMass thirty thousand dollars not thirty thousand a semester thirty thousand for the four years we're showing here in Massachusetts that those are opportunities are there for people that is something we should have coverage throughout the entire country\n\nAnd can tell our next question or a ... a Democrats gain controlling the house impeachment and I'd be on the table which is a part in it that\nI've talked in caucus or when the issues come up 'cause you've heard there's some members that are talking about not taking a stand up and talking up telling my colleagues and I'm taking a leadership role in this look I was a district attorney\nYou know I understand how are these things work and I also understand in our country right now in teaching it can't be something that's bandied about administration to administration you can't if you lose an election you can turn around and say oh we're gonna start impeachment if you're in the other side we have to be very careful about that it's a high standard\nAnd I argued to my colleagues as I say now a follow the evidence if there's evidence therefore fine let's see what happens with a motor investigation for instance we don't know if it would rise to that level but we shouldn't be talking about this right now\nA ... it's making a political not dealing with the important issue it is and the rare opportunities where that should even be exercise that's the way we should view this\nUh and and I hope many of my colleagues would listen to me\nAh I think people will come to me after I've spoken with a lot of them and said you really changed my mind on this I think\nWe've got to look at this very carefully so I'm using my influence uh among colleagues or to share my experience a from a law enforcement stand point just what they should be and uh hopefully a was helpful to my colleagues and expressing what I truly believe we have to be very sensitive to\nThat sort of asking\nA plug congressman kittens pragmatism I think that's the right approach um I have not seen anything that would lead believe that impeachment so where are we should be going um I also do support the mother investigation because I think at the end of the day we really want to do was restore confidence in our system\nOf people want to make sure they want to know that their vote counts\nAnd they want to feel that there is no meddling\nUm but there's nothing that I've seen a to me at this point uh there were a lead me to believe that we should be looking at an impeachment um I Do believe it's a political football it gets tossed around it gets people on both sides of the aisle worked up I'm gonna really distracts us from looking at the real important issues that we have today um but even when\nI'm something came up and there was impeachable I'm no one's above the law that's just the way it is a but right now I think it's irresponsible to be talking about it\nAnd just kind of a ... going to hear it to make sure yes or no answer here for about a lot better than the answer and I got the answer for about ... not for impeachment correct right and then the question I'd like to follow up on a yes or no on that point the continuation of the investigation ...\nAbsolutely uh you know work very hard on this I've been involved in a resolutions and ah been involved in a legislation to try and make sure that they're I think it would be a smart thing for Congress to clear the air about this a rule of law is being attacked\nA ... and that's one of the things I mentioned with my opening remarks that hurts a democracy that that's a core beliefs rule of law I Would like to see legislation clear the air\nAnd say uh that it shouldn't be a firing of lower in that regard that would I think brings some stability would send them ... message to countries like Russia\nThey have tried to metal and make our democracy look like it's not as stable as strong as it is would send a strong message to them as well\nTo Alaska and\nSupport them all her ... and I I think I'm looking at the end of the day we need to restore confidence in our system\nWe need to learn from this uh we need to get a better understanding of I think uh most of us would agree we feel that the Russians did a a medal in our election to what extent remains to be seen\nWe need to learn what they did and more importantly we need to understand what they may be trying to do in the future to make sure that we could prevent it from happening so that we can feel good about our electoral system that is at the heart of our Republic of democracy\nOkay how are ... that infrastructure and especially this question first coast here what is your philosophy and structure including ... irrational finance um is there a role for the federal government here and now like the state responsibility or do you have privatization of structure to go\nSo I think there's I think this is three ways you can actually look at it I'm certainly there are rules and opportunities for the federal government to be involved in infrastructure\nInfrastructure many many different things let's take the case of sea walls for example which are very important to this area um that's the Army Corps of engineers or we need to be working with them\nAnd the federal government needs to be involved to make sure that we are our seawalls or up to snuff and we can't just wait till after there's been a catastrophic event um we need to be proactive about it when it comes to things like let's say replacing the Cape cod bridges\nAnd those are over eighty years old by the way many of you probably have taken those bridges and you know this is a lot of question out there is two when's end of life\nUm if I'm elected by the end of my first term you'll have a plan no two things one how much longer we can expect to see if we use those bridges how much is going to cost to maintain them during that time and be what's the plan look like for replacing them when\nI'm so but in the case of something like that I'm certainly federal government can help with funding some people would say state or we can look at things like um public private relationships like they have they've done some are down south where they've done bridge or projects that have been a it's a public private partnership\nOr something like the Cape cod bridges talks about tolls if we're going to consider something like tools to help pay for the bridges um I think we need to make sure that it does not affect residents that residents were not averse to be affected by just folks are coming from ... things like that but um\nSo I think anything on the table but the fact that matters we need to keep and maintain um are safer constructor\nCongressman kidding\nI shutter running the bridges agree forthcoming and there's no doubt my mind it will be placements necessary\nOr we work hard on that area I worked with the Army Corps of engineers in state government and the chambers of commerce affected by those bridges are on a on a daily basis you know

from what the cities and towns themselves say they want very important thing that's been cut and then about fought hard for\nA also in terms of trying to deal with uh having the jobs just for that infrastructure or we started a an avionics a pilot program so that we have the jobs on the private side to go forward and deal with the industries that are going to provide that kind of infrastructure
