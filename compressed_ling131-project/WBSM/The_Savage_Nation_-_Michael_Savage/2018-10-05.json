P. M. C. P. or you have a masters in tax I'm a registered investment advisor [noise] so really all I Do is talk about money all day long and I've been talking to my clients about this for at least for years and the thing that I Would talk to them about what's going on with the federal government [noise]\nOne of the largest line items on the federal government is the interest\nAnd there's the interest rates have been very very very low um it still had six seven eight hundred billion dollars of deficits which I had to explain to my clients [noise]\nThe government was not bringing in enough money in taxes to pay the bill which included the interest which meant they had to borrow money to pay the interest\nWhere you're talking about our government now under Donald Trump\nThis is just this is federal only yes this is\nFirst of all the way I Want to get this really just saying our government right now is is printing money to such an extent that they have to borrow money to pay the interest\nYup every time there's a news article where there's a deficit the deficit means they are not bringing in enough revenue to pay the bill and why\nSo in other words weight would let me just summarize for the people who are listening\nWe complained bitterly under Obama and the liberals when they taxed and spent we said oh the Democrats stand for tax and spend well now we have an administration that stands for spending spent today on one hand cut taxes and they spend more than Obama did and you're saying that the the this location is so great that what's gonna happen is what I Want to know\nWell I Will tell you so when I was talking to my clients and they would say so what does that mean I Would say if you want to see what it's going to work like look at Greece does anybody know with Greece looks like as an economic powerhouse\nTell us what what was it more like how about all of our own hemisphere how bout of Venezuela could we go as bad as that\nYeah the same I mean huge economic inequities when you're just not paying your bills and you're borrowing and you're wondering and you're borrowing eventually and has a real economic consequences\nSo why don't the wise men around Donald Trump tell him about this like Mr cone why don't they tell them that\nWell I understand the real world of politics and I understand that the politicians first job is just to get reelected and like do not understand is don't these politicians have children don't they understand the world that they are creating for their children that's\nWhat I thought what is the what is the world that's being created right now what will it look like give us give us if there's an economic of severe economic downturn what does it look like\nWell I don't want to go as a as a volatiles riot but you know eventually reach a point where people have had enough and\nEngland there had been bread riots in history in our own country we had riots over food when we had the great depression there were riots people starving in this country\nWhere I can tell you what's gonna happen properly and then in the short term is people don't understand how Social Security works\nThere's no real savings account and Social Security or money just goes into the general account and then when the benefits are paid a comes down to the general accounting right when Social Security was first started you went to ... people paying the benefits\nFor the one beneficiary now you have about two and a half people working to pay the benefits of the beneficiaries and one of the ...\nWhat ... what about all the people faking disability on on the disability racket in America what about all the drug addicts about what about all the oxycontin addicts don't work who's paying for all of this we are the taxpayer\nTotally if you take a look at the statistics who's actually paying taxes for the very interesting statistic about them the ... the tax money where the the left is talking that\nThey want the rich people to pay more taxes but if you look at the statistics the rich the top five percent\nAre paying more as a percentage of the federal tax revenue for paying more now than they did Twenty years ago\nThat's right and the top one percent of the Web and the top one percent which is everybody in the media\nAnd make no mistake about it all these wild left us there in the top zero one percent are paying most of the tax the country that's if they're paying legitimately and I can't speak for anyone else I Will tell you right now I'm paying more taxes on the Trump's tax plan that I did before you know that living in California\nWell let me tell you my\nTaxes went up in other words or the Donald Trump's so called tax plan as a Californian it doesn't matter that I'm a conservative or a libertarian whatever you wanted to find me as go try to find me I I Wish you good luck\nI'm paying more on the Donald Trump's tax plan that I did under Obama's did you know that yeah what was really it gives the biggest and so is every one in New York even if they're ... like Lincoln some because you cannot deduct state taxes from federal anymore\nNo license Fifteen Percent of the population doesn't even work\nAnd another large percentage of illegal aliens or pay no taxes and people don't even care\nThe underground economy is so big right now people don't even know anything about these things but the so called tax plan that was supposed to be a great salvation for me as a Californian a is such that I'm paying more taxes than I did before did you know that does anyone who really you're not allowed to say anything about it oh hush hush don't say that\nAnyone in New York that what I'm Talking about any ... any of those have you're listening to the show or a fiscal conservatives who uh\nPaying more than you did under Obama because I Know you are you can no longer the duck your New York state\nTaxes your state taxes from your federal taxes that you know that whereas we could in the past oh I I I see the same thing that handwriting is on the wall it's not a very very pretty picture and I tried to tell you this with a history not an allegory I talked about the ah rhyme our republic\nWhere the model corruption offended most Germany's Germans but they couldn't do anything about it and the long came a after the people were ... Hungary and the violence of the left got too great for them\nAs we now have with down the FAA and the occupied people with the masks who are beating up Republicans chasing senators chasing right wing as they say calling anyone who they disagree with a fascist there will be there will be the equivalent of what happened in Germany in this country sure as I'm sitting here\nYou may not think it's going to happen I Believe the underground is already bubbling up to the surface and it will happen and when the political assassinations start from the left which they posted about two weeks ago\nDo you remember what they said on the ... they published a statement saying we want you to go out during the day and make believe you for the country for each other and for the common good but at night put on your masks and kill\nThose political opponents kill them they said go out and kill they said that's the left wing in this country that's the kiss that's the far left they say go out and kill\nWell do you think this is going to just go on and on its own you think people are going to sit there like ten pins waiting to be shot and executed I don't think so\nThese are very volatile times they're being whipped up by the Democratic politicians and to me the apex of all of it was the capital hearings they came along just at a time where the American people finally saw how vicious how vicious and malicious\nThese people are and I started my show by asking a loaded question\nWho benefited more from the destruction of capital Dems Republicans I Will tell you from my point of view and I believe that I have as good a stethoscope to America as hard as anyone in this country after a quarter of a century of listening to the heartbeat of America I Will tell you that Toronto source hacks\nAnd the other distinguish Terminator is on the Democratic party\nDid themselves no favor\n...

do\nThe math split up for himself they said he he looks angry to look right I couldn't believe that [noise]\nSo what let's not to be so sure it's gonna work for us [noise]\nSo [noise]\nDo you have sun spots in age spots well listen to Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sun spots director\nOr outside that's because the blue angels I'm big on their their practice in their warm ups\nWhat else appeared in Germany during that into war period homosexual lesbian bar suddenly popped up in German cities I Know I'm not supposed to make a point of it but they did but mainly in Berlin remember this phrase high going to keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Berlin\nWell look at all the green haired girls at UC Berkeley er at Columbia they all basically farm farm girls would come to the big city and suddenly they're wild and free\nMost Germans were shocked by this\nBut then the leaders were not in the past Germany had glorified motherhood and fatherhood at a glorified mothers' duty to the father land\nBut said why my years glorified wrapping sexuality free expression hedonism the accent of women\nAnd so the liberal why our government was so akin to what we're having in America today\nThe people felt good about it prostitution was the criminalized drugs what ramping laws against venereal disease were dropped\nJustice in America would dropping laws against using heroin now first they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this\nWhat else happened in a while I'm a republic that is akin to what's happening in America today weekend police authority rapid lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing the criminals subtly proliferated\nWhat else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about the backlash to this liberalism\nArose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany\nAnd uh you have groups like on the far the Berman cowards you put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street attacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with a communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards\nNow don't don't trust what I'm saying Sam glorifying the brown shirts I Am simply giving you a piece of history lessons from history remember when I said you many times those do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing what do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really so I'll go on so just like on the fought today and the Occupy movements of today which are lawless and violent the analysis of today and gone by Nancy Pelosi says world is raptors same thing there so the communist weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they were attacking Republicans now senators no one stops them\nIt's as though we're powerless to ... to protect ourselves from these ... so the Germans said enough is enough for what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that was still in Germany they had secrets cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany and they formed units coal brown shirts and they started beating of communist in the streets\nThat's what happened I didn't say it should happen here don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you're gonna be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story biggest as this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they cheered the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shorts some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts well what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up\nAnd opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so gross was it the right wing did you and I said and so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong of course the left with like you to think he's at least the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass\nThose liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point that my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic medical leader\nBut his solutions are not yet that extreme\nLeft with say any of us illusions are extreme to the left said the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a is a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much beyond what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what uh Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat do you do he drank ... drank too much about a ... ... what do you what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy I went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an aberration\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left and it's super liberalism\nIs a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong you're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that see this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout in in the west a a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal centrists\nAnd things will happen to you can't believe are happening and what happens so fast she'll say it's not happening and liberalism will be there was the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here and the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\nEconomists is a is inevitable it's going to happen and I'm afraid of\nBe worse than ever because we're\nIn a heightened now of stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now in a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money and under the Democrats when we criticize deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have dummy up they shut their mouths you broke your anyone in the radio talking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nWhat someone's gotta say stop printing the money this is crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened in why mark Germany at the ... just before all of this that it takes a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that South value list the money had become\nNow several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company has not remove the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America some of them posted by enemies and Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers us anything there are cycles too at kind of me there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I ride on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the once great United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we will sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria because Americans by than traditional Americans hardworking roll up your sleeves Americans\n\n\n\n\n\n...

nevertheless they go hysterical and they make you think that the guys in what he is they've done it to anyone who stands up to the left wing juggernaut because there were hundreds and hundreds of
