against Syria was four or five weeks ago\nIf you recall she was backing the war drums again banging banging banging saying there about the gas ... their citizens again we all know that was another false flag\nI went ballistic on the radio I backed the president's whoever was listening through for him please don't let them do it loses based because the base of the Trump in ... we don't want foreign wars we voted for him because he was a nationalist he said he would end far to tangle mixed so\nHere we have Nikki Haley the global list try to gin up a war in my opinion to get Trump to um fire Tomahawk offer or far Kerry whatever we have out there destroyers and B ... bombers\nWhite to provoke Russia why to engage in yet another war why and I know the ... and I don't want to go to the next step Laura\nMy opinion is she failed to start that war\nAnd because she felt our controllers pulled her off the stage I've seen as a thousand times in politics I've seen that with Obama\nWhen they're no longer a useful they got rid of them and I think that whoever it is behind a pulled her off that's my take on it she tried to start a war and failed\nThey claim that that she told him almost six months ago that she was going to leave at the end of the year they have the timing of this was curious why why not do it after the election why do it and write out a victory\nCome on the

your wife in a restaurant in New York somewhere queens wherever you are and are somehow they know you're an ex cop and they want to harass you and they come screaming you calling you names and you say good within five feet do what you want but now they get close to the table and start shouting at you and your wife and your wife gets scared what do you do\nThat for immediate fear of life\nAt that point I Do what I have to do and that's and that's what anybody anybody once you have the fear of life ... can protect yourself and this is sending all books you can protect yourself and do what you have to do to protect life\nWell my my attorney will be on shortly and I have in my hands the California criminal jury instructions he gave me the jury instructions on the right to self defense of defensive another none homicidal it's amazing how broad our rights really are to defend ourselves against these left wing thugs\nReally amazing we have tremendous ability to defend ourselves and what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy that most people are intimidated to defend themselves\nUnfortunately it's called Obama hypnotize the nation for eight years\nYes and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said this is the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug here was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down purchased in Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because we're going to kick you\nRight there he's already telling somebody to go and commit a crime or kicking somebody believe it or not Michael is aggravated harassment\nThat has a misdemeanor he's already tell NPR I look I Know what's going on and I want to\nThe bad this before it gets worse I Want to stop the mass hysteria I'm sending you a copy of the book\nGod Bless you for being a surviving all those years in New York on the streets but you know something my friend none of us are immune to what's coming Hillary holder at all want violence in this country we should avoid it at all costs but if it comes to your doorstep what do you do when I returned\nJoy those Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred seven eight by voting for Hubbard seven to eight to\n... are you taking biography and tired of paying fifty dollars per tablet\nMolly jog has generic thank God for just ten dollars per tablet\nTen dollars for generic they had ... is a ... ... dollars per dose call now and get free shipping on ten topics or more of generic my address Molly drivers in North Carolina pharmacy licensed in all fifty states for information go to Molly generics dot com or call us at eight hundred four or five seven one six eight one eight hundred four\nWell he can use greater force the the older you get them the angrier that person is the more um cohorts are around\nMe oh great so old white guys now have the ability to defend themselves great\nOh yeah yeah I mean yeah yes\nNow what if you're in a car trying to retreat from the mob and they chase you out of the restaurant you're getting your car they surround you and start beating on your car with sticks as they did in Oregon what can you do then\nI Believe that that's very close to a threat of deadly force [noise] because\nIf they get you out of the car the same weapons that they use the same gang mentality that they use their going to lead to either death or serious injury I think you can use lethal force in that situation\nAnd you know there'll be no if I told you the NGOs motorcycle people you know we're angry at a car pulled the car over banging on the windows and the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody would go good you got the gang bangers you know you got the motorcycle gang here we have a ... a double standard because they're quote protesters\nCell are there any cases that you tried in in this arena I mean that I that would be a illustrative of our question\nI had a case where a guy was being rude to somebody's wife so the man knock knock guide on his butt\nAnd my client was and put on trial for knocking the the the bully on his butt and the jury acquitted him and later on one of them went up to me and said you know he was technically guilty but we didn't care the guy got what [laughter] the only one I've done\nSo I Know are you saying that a person can defend themselves yeah for it if there is a\nSelf that you have to be calm when you do what you have to be professional you can't be acting at your own anger you know that's it's it's it's got to be in the realm of what any normal person would do which is what\nIf the guy as I say is over six the and the mob is people in their twenties and thirties ... there's no equal forced to that\nNo I think that people whose cars were seriously but take away the scene where the cars being pushed the guy is leaning against is trying to stop it in their swarming the car on that one and the one where the guy got out of the car in both those instances I think deadly force um was on the table\nOr we're not recommending at least for us on this radio show and I ... I Would caution everyone listening to the following I'm a very smart woman said to me once do you want to know that person for the rest of your life you know there was do you want to be righted you want to be smart you can be right and wind up in court for ten years\nOr you can be smart and and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it\nWell I [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're trained martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you are right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand down and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria\nAnd you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks and the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism\nYou know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person sided at the beginning of the book or these groups on the streets masked mimicking terror groups or ... ... of the past what what's going to happen at some point people have to stand up\nThat's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nNow they just don't keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics as you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw a police officer sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing why do you think that was\nA I think he to me he looked angry I bet his superiors instructed him to stand down unless something actually erupted and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks because the problem with that approach is that these attackers these rioters cut it anytime\nLose it and attack somebody or somebody getting out of their car or in their car could lose their temper or be scared and then the violence has already\nAnd and then the officers respond it's too late preemption is the key to preventing violence we know that\n... for Dan what's the bottom line urine let's note Dan Horowitz you're in a restaurant\nAnd you're actually a guy who's very fair minded in politically I think just somewhat liberal by the way which is your business law it's okay you know you don't have to disguise yourself in any way I Know where you are in some ways I also know that I Know that you come from a family of of heroes that I Know for a fact\nThat can I say anything about that or not\nYou can you can talk about I thought about that today how would my\nBoss so proud of his father who was in his nineties who fought his way from the beaches in Normandy to to uh to um I think Berlin in World War two you also lost your uncle did new\nI yes he took himself out of a hospital bed to fight in the battle of the boats and died\nSo damn comes from fighters Dan does night not like to retreat when people threatened him I've seen him in action and the courts\nSo Dan I'm going to ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I have my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some waiter sees us doing it and he checked his friends to come and harass us they come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant we were at where we worried about something like that happening I Would pick up a knife and disguise and in my hand [laughter] end up because I'm not going to get hit sitting down\nAnd I would politely ask for him to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people in in the restaurant to join in and protect us including\nThey won't do no nobody will do that they'll look the other way I Know that for a fact\nProbably but if need be that nice kind of go where it needs to go to protect me I'm not going to take any physical violence from somebody who was attacking me ...\nFall now you know why Denis my attorney\nYet\nHe's an actor and he brings in napkins when I fight ... then brings in that into a knife fight\n[laughter]\nAll day and all I'm going to take a couple of calls because this is not a joke in question I have a number of people calling on this issue by the way including defense attorneys\nAre on this stuff actually can I grab this call right now while Dan is on the line is there a way to do that if you pulled up from a gym can you pull applying for out of ... and Reno go ahead pull up line for\n\nYes line for please go ahead quickly\nForget [noise]\nWhat's going on here well we'll have amateur hour here I'll take a quick break while they figure out how to work the phones\nDuring those Savage Nation coal no eight by four hundred seven eight bucks for number seven to eight to\nSome of the Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust
