acts like how dare you\nAre that Donald Trump finally calling out on a minor scale Blumenthal liar\nA which is a good start but they he's got to get much much more aggressive so I've asked you if you have any allegations that you feel are found that in some way and reality about any of the other a Soviet era accusers on the committee\nEight five five to seven to eight to as a place for you to go let the American the American people decide whether these allegations are true or false you say well you're engaging in what what am I an gauging anything different than what they're doing to the cabinet oh no I just got this email from someone whose name I Will not read\nAnd he writes and he lives in San Francisco knows Feinstein he said the speculation that judge Kavanaugh did something inappropriate in high school when he was a minor\nPlease have your listeners recall at Feinstein fully supported a president who as an adult lied under oath had his law license revoked and oral sex with the young intern in the oval office and was accused of rape or sexual misconduct by at least for women\nFind spent also supported a U.S senator who has an adult drowned the young lady and the drunken stupor and then failed to report the incident for ten hours this is the holier than thou fines thing the crucial fire and then he throws a real bombshell out there which I didn't know anything about\nFinally and miss finds things ability to forgive or give a second chance please remember that her son in law Rick Mariano the father of her only grandchild was a heroin addict as an adult I'm told that her daughter Catherine met him when he wasn't a Deland C Street program now I Can't confirm any of these statements\nI Can't deny any of these statements but I Believe that America is now looking very carefully at the accusers of Kavanaugh and saying hey wait a minute now you're bringing up women who are making stuff up\nAs we can see this is just a a scandalous hit piece on this man\nAnd so therefore let's see if any of this stuff is real I don't know I have no way to confirm or deny any of these things but we're going to keep going until eventually we're off the air\nOkay it's that simple\nAnd will be off the believe me I Will be off the you know many of you are listening to me up some youth stations you'll not hear me in January you don't know why it's all political you'll hear other reasons but it's not no other reasons or political and I'll tell you more about that come January but right now will continue with what we're doing on the Savage Nation let's not get ahead of ourselves\nWhat else do you have on who now I don't know if we should even run some of these because I don't know whether they're here or there but let's go to Yvonne ... von what's your point\nIf my ... and I know last\nSaturday and the fact that he was the head and thought supervisor in San Francisco and the half shell game ... making the head of the house and it's already\nAnd so he was able to give it its members are houses and then have them to vote for a fifth vote for\nAnd then he also um [noise]\nWhat's happening now wife he left San Francisco guy on the half of\nThem down the welfare checks from farther members that was when I was with him\nWhen she helped make sure the welfare checks went to the honor where he moved to people in the Jim Jones cult\nYes all of that said they always get in effect over that and\nThat's interesting and all for the patronage and the support well is there any more to this because I'm coming back to this lady from Oakland in a minute on the Savage Nation joined the Savage Nation coal know eat bugs for hundreds of feet by ... four hundred seven to eight to [noise]\nYou realize you could be detectives you realize the power you actually have without leaving the comfort of your own home which you can find a on these people by doing a little digging you are the true power of America you don't need someone to lead you you can lead yourself and we could lead lead ourselves\nWe can make the red sea part we can parts of the red sea and leave these ... these these terrible human beings behind we could leave them behind you have the power when I see a decent man and his family destroyed all this\nI realized that anybody can be destroyed in this country by the Feinstein gang this gang of commerce ours are doing to Kavanaugh what was done in the Soviet Union what was done in Hitler's Germany\nAnd denouncing someone you destroyed that person there was no trial there was no trial necessary all you did was denounced the person and they were ruined\nThese are the tactics of the Nazis in Germany and the Soviets in Russia\nI used to think we're a nation of laws and that with defamation of libel laws you couldn't get away with this but then I woke up and found out that the senators are above the law movies have been done about them\nBooks have been written about this kind of corruption remember I wrote a novel called abusive power set in San Francisco it was a New York times best seller you wouldn't know it would you call it abuse of power jak Hatfill was my character\nSo this is an old story kind of information and smear campaign\nAnd what's ironic here is that the left which was belly aching for forty years about McCarthyism and McCarthy on now actually worse than senator McCarthy ever was at its height because as I point out and stop mass hysteria McCarthy was actually right\nWhen he accused all of those members of Hollywood and the media\nAnd of academia of working with the Soviet Union he was denounced as a crackpot even though he had been a war hero they made a mockery of show you how smart the left is they took senator McCarthy who had been a tail gunner in World War two one of the most dangerous of all positions\nThink of it a glass bubble in the back of a bummer with machine guns facing enemy fighters he survived all of that came out a war hero became a U.S senator the vermin on the left called him tail gunner Joe as if that was something to mock rather than salute but that was just the beginning\nThey said he was a drunk they said he made it all up well they destroyed the man he died a hopelessly broken man\nWhat they did to McCarthy is what they're doing to Capitol and then you want to get in a way of the left wing failing ... that has destroyed America over the last fifty years now we had an election\nAnd we put Donald Trump in power we stopped there juggernaut and they're fighting to turn it around with every one of his major appointments make no mistake about it\nThis is really a mandate on you I've said this you'll be four by smearing cabinet or their smearing you you could be a black transsexual woman in Berkeley and you're being smeared if you voted for Trump do you understand that you understand how this works do you understand this marrying you by smearing him\nAnd it's just the beginning and so the only thing we can do is fight back and again I say with the keyboard and a little native intelligence you could probably uncover things about the senators that might just have them running back under the rocks that they crawled out of the sewers that they live in\nBecause the Internet as a very powerful tool there's a lot of lives on it but somewhere in the midst of the law is they may be some nuggets of gold and I invite you the listeners to become the detectives to turn on the\nCommittee members who have done this to a decent man I have never in my life seen anything like this never but again getting back to what McCarthy and the McCarthyism that the left you still want us about just for a moment\n... years later there was a publication and titled even own a papers V E N O and I wrote about it and one of my previous books\nAnd even though the papers were written by former KGB agents and they disclose that in fact all of the people named in the committees and the hearings in the fifties by McCarthy Warren fact Soviet operatives or Soviet fellow travelers every last one of them was guilty\nAnd so here we are now watching the equivalent of the quote McCarthyism were warned about taking place right in front of our eyes\nAnd hardly one journalist in the United states of America makes the connection\nIt's a very very sad day but the truth show went out and I do ask you on Tuesday to vote with your credit card\nAnd please get a copy of stop mass hysteria but not just get the book to enrich me because I'm not going to buy a new car\nI'm asking you to carry it home and put it on your coffee table because I guarantee you there's someone in your family who doesn't believe a word that you say someone who was ignorant as a door post who knows nothing about history\nWho knows nothing about how the witch trials of Salem are identical to the witch trials of Kavanaugh but they are it's based on on the same methods of mass hypnosis and mass hysteria that's just one example there are numerous numerous others and I invite you to take home this calling you a ... of information\nIt's not just a polemic it's a history book\nEight five five four hundred seven to eight to let's see some of the cause if I can they're run them a I'm a little afraid of this one ... WABC what's your statement Rick\nMy own feeling it was so outraged unsophisticated allegations thirty six years ago yes yes no no no\nOh yes they do to curb the killing of outrage over unsubstantiated allegations from thirty six years ago yeah she has no knowledge about her father working for the next train here involving sex trafficking\nMovement will will with ... where are you getting this allegation and her father worked in a sex cult\nOut of New York newspapers without a\nWhile but you're saying these ... only rumors about senator Gillibrand's father\nAh that was pretty much documented and several other source [noise] really she claimed ignorant than I didn't know that that's what they weren't\n... I don't know anything about it but I'm sure she forgave her father for that but she wants to give a cabin or for having too many beers in high school how does that work\nYeah maybe we should ever father to an FBI investigation and see what I\nThink so I think that maybe there's some FBI investigation that should be done of every senator on the committee was become a new a new a new which hunter I wasn't invited an FBI investigation of Blumenthal not just about his Vietnam record\nBut about his finances why should we look into why should we not look into a senator whose fortunes have grown ten or Fifteen fold since they came into office why is that not fair play\nFair game rather for investigation I think it's long overdue for an FBI investigations of every senator on that committee whose falsely accused cabinet and see if we can find out how their fortunes have grown so greatly er during the tenure in office how did that happen\n[noise] absolutely if the only only the

this to you to show you that what we're going through right now while not related to ancient Rome is related to history in many ways what\nCamel Harris Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker\nShy name all of them and the others on the committee doing today is actually nothing new under the sun\nIt went on in the Soviet Union were all you have to do was denounced someone and their life was ruined it went on in Hitler's Germany or you had to do was renounced someone and their life was ruined and they were imprisoned if not execute it showed the new left are actually the new right\nThe new left or the new fascist as many have said\nBut what we are witnessing and the average person certainly see through it\nIs unfounded accusations are not American it all in fact they're very on American which leads me to the house of on American activities committee of the Nineteen fifties\nHow many years where you left this lectured to about a senator McCarthy being a very bad man because she accused in some cases falsely\nPeople in America mainly in the government in media and an academic of being communist or communist sympathizers right and we're told that was a false thing if it gets to ruin lives and McCarthy was set to be a bad man now let's put aside the fact that\nMost of the people that McCarthy out of this communist turned out to be communist as we learn in the Nineteen eighties\nThe papers were released you'll have to research that the known it papers it confirmed it almost all of the people accused by senator McCarthy war in fact fellow travelers in communist but putting that aside how many times have you been lectured by leftist professors that McCarthy was a bad man\nThat McCarthyism which became synonymous with false accusations was an evil thing we wake up and we see the Feinstein is now McCarthy\nOnly just no troops were allegations we see that every one of them on the committee or the new Soviet ... and I am only hoping that the fairness of the American people will shine through all of this mark\nAnd that Kavanaugh will be voted upon and approved however I Am not optimistic that will happen because I did some research on who Senator Flake is\nAnd you'll be shocked to find out that Senator Flake well appearing to be somewhat middle of the road is anything but I think the flight will vote against him no matter what the FBI says that remembered this before we go on\nKavanaugh had at least three FBI investigations along the way to becoming a federal judge\nIraq Obama had none in fact I said it when Obama became president he could not have passed an FBI background check and be an been even ordinary FBI agent Obama could not have become an ordinary FBI\nAgent because there was associations with very dangerous leftist including ... layers and others but\nHe never Bassem Feinstein to pass a background check I really wonder why we don't have an FBI Jack of all of the new so this is Michael Savage on syrup stuff mass hysteria [noise]\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing were immune from accusation and they went on and they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so that we speak forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years to come stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern if\nFor example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts that would not have been hysteria and twenty eight team this is something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is already get from the media today you would learn that the following\nThat for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media what have you believe it is fact it is history and urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I gave you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nNot in the media will reference nine eleven is proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at war because they've been at war with the west for fourteen hundred years and that is why I tell you history as a great great teacher were going through a form of mass and easier which is not a myth\nMass and easier is not a myth\nIs a conspiracy of sorts a vaguely defined plan to undermine the nation mass from the Asia it's perpetrators know than a malleable populace as a necessary tool to achieve an agenda\nAnd his ... Bernie Sanders discovered with this pie in the sky promises during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nIf you cannot seduce them with promises of free things and mass hysteria about the other guys you have to take another tack you have to do their wits but tell them that that means is okay it's harmless it's fine\nAnd what I'm Talking about today is marijuana remember for many many years of marijuana was seen as the evil drugs the most evil drug of all and we were subjected to a form of mass\nBrainwashing about the dangers of marijuana\nBut today the exact opposite is being promulgated which is that marijuana is the miracle cure for everything from Boulder salads houses cancer falling arches arthritis ... runny noses run a year's runny eyes depression it's insanity a form of mass hysteria\nThat is used to drug the youth in order to manipulate them into following the orders of the left [noise]\nSo we're living through the new Soviet era in America being promulgated by the Feinstein committee I call it that because she is the senior she keeps saying she's the senior member of the committee well she knows the libel and slander law is in America she knows\nThat there's a difference between libel and slander she knows a defamation can destroy a person forever and yet they're engaging in a form of defamation I have not seen in my entire lifetime in America as an American citizen\nAnd more particularly in the twenty five years I've been in the radio business and there's an author I have never seen such unmitigated a defamation as I'm seeing against cabin or right now\nNow I spent a little time talking about the Salem witch trials from my forthcoming book stop mass hysteria which will be out across America opening big opening wide think of it as a movie that's opening in every theater in America that's the one thing you've got to understand although you won't sitting on Fox News for the reasons that express many times\nIt doesn't mean that the film is that opening wide it's opening wide\nWalmart and Sam's it will be a best seller tables\nBooks and million making news table Barnes and noble every Barnes and noble in America will have it on the new release table from the ninth of October through the twenty seconds of October and will be on the holiday table from the thirtieth of October through the wealth of November\nThat's a big deal\nOf course on Amazon it say sponsored placement of headliner and suggested purchase\nSo the publishers doing an amazing job in getting around the boycott of Michael Savage by paying for placement that every book store in America with the exception of the small communist bookstores throughout America where they use a form of censorship or that they're entitled to do to their own detriment\nNow what we're about to do on the show is very risky and very dangerous and I want to caution every one calling that there are libel and slander laws in America they can get me in hot water and get you and hot water\nBut having set up that ... I'm asking anyone in America who lives in the districts of these new Soviets\nOr who have been falsely accusing cabin or with the most of astonishing claims I've ever seen in my lifetime first it was remember the rape charges\nBrought up by the psychopath at NBC aired last night by the ... lawyer remember that and then she said she didn't really mean it if you live in a district of any of these senators who are quick to destroy a man\nAnd you have something that you feel is a valid piece of their background that it's not getting proper attention\nI'm inviting you to air it on the Savage Nation with a copy it again I'd like you to confirm way you're getting the information from [noise]\nAnd there have been cases of mass hysteria in our own time or that have destroyed people that almost destroyed companies I'll give you one example of a corporate example the contaminated Coca Cola scare of Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd that began in Ninety nine when more than a hundred students in Belgium reportedly fell ill after drinking the beverage well the subsequent investigation coupled with some inept PR handling costs Coca Cola a cool two hundred million dollars and several they ban in other European countries\nAnd while examination of the tainted batches did show contamination of bad carbon dioxide in the you know\nTo Belgian scientists speculated that the tainted products yoga too small amount that cause real damage and for them the incident was mostly a case of mass hysteria fueled in part by a prior scare of mad cow disease and dioxins tainted animal products\nA separate investigation by Belgium is high hygiene council in March of two thousand corroborated those claims and said that most of the victims experience they mass psycho Jenike illness just as we're experiencing today in America a form of mass hysteria\nWith these trials of cabin on okay there are many cases of mass hysteria in our past\nNever in my lifetime been prime you'll get hit by a panel

Palin said that she as international experience being from Alaska because she could actually see Russia from the Aleutian Islands that was a real right great choices vice president that was brilliant just a brilliant choice in her\nI Know many of your life there because of her looks but okay I get it she's still here of uh that's good I never was a Sarah Palin guy to please don't let me and I'm the I'm I'm the Switzerland of talk radio right now\n[laughter] and believe me the insanity will living through I'm trying to think in my lifetime my adult lifetime I've never seen it never\nSeen anything like this mass hysteria never never never never you can destroy a man in public and then when he speaks out even mildly you call them unfit for office because he spoke out and Cory Booker sitting US Senator says cabin or as guilty whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter she'd be withdrawn because he doesn't have the temperament\nThe sea Cory Booker on closed circuit TV on a hidden camera when no one's looking at him I Wonder if he has a temper I Wonder what that Dianne Feinstein is like on a closed circuit a secret camera wonder if she ever raised our voice in any way I Wonder if any of them ever got mad I don't think so they're all they're all so above human emotion\nSo here are the law give us can you imagine these are the law givers of America people who say a man's guilt or innocence doesn't matter get rid of him these are the law gave her as of America and you wonder why\nBoth the media is hated and the Congress says hey did you do do that don't you I'm not making it up the media is the most hated institution in America next to Congress did you know that we talk about the average person out there without a definition of what their politics are they actually hate the media\nSo when you see a guy like Jimmy Kimmel a psychotic in my estimation of belongs and create more state hospital that you'd be reopened just for him with the special Kim Jimmy Kimmel war\nThe man had a tray of mushrooms on TV last night and asked the dirty degenerate lowdown stripper which one most approximate in the private parts of the president the United states\nAnd then the laugh track was run by another ... who would who makes the why are they are making the why my republic\nLook like something pure compared to what this country has become this is the most degenerate sick country in the history of the world there was no sicker nation on earth in this country that a network television show could do a thing like this and no ... no reaction is just a funny stunt\nYou know I've been watching a lot of movies from on Netflix and most of them I pick to watch are not made in America and wondering I've become fat couple I've been fascinated with our in Arabic one was a Turkish drama I became hooked on in Turkish\nAnd now I'm watching one I'll high but I think and it's set in Lebanon and the border of Lebanon and Syria with the mafia family that's been there for hundreds of years that control an entire district and the you know they run the the drugs that run the guns through the district and what I came to understand something\nUh watching these Arabic dramas first of all I Love the language I Love to watch it I like to see the subtitles\nThe none of these films have any sexuality in them and yet they're captivating none of the films TV shows made in Muslim countries show any sex and yet they're captivating\nThe women are stunningly beautiful\nThe men are very robust Shirley handsome and and testosterone driven filled with rage the way most real men are and yet there is no sex shown there's just a subtle sexuality and all of it through the appearance of the people but again no overt sexuality\nSuch as a side note of watching this drama of this a\nLebanese mafia family in the hills of Lebanon on the border with Syria that I got was almost all of the American mafia movies the ... the over the overly caught the nature of the way the gangster speaking in American Gangster movies are used to up until recently\nA is all directly related to the structure of these Arabic a family's incidentally in other words when you see the Sicilian mafia type speaking in a court Lee manner\nWhich we came to think is highly theatrical\nAnd that is derived from the structure of the language and of the families a that was laid down by the Arabic invaders of Sicily is a long time ago I'm I'm trying to explain something to you that even watching TV drama you could put the pieces together\nAnd see the connections that doesn't have anything to do with the cabin or hearing I'm just giving you an observation the only observation as any relevance to this time today in what I'm discussing and in watching this drama in Arabic\nIs again there is no section it there's no filth in it there's no dirty language and that there is no apps nothing no rubbing of the body parts no ... no jewels in the teeth none none of that none of the filth in garbage of the American media today is in it\nAnd yet as captivating to watch\nNow we switch phones to America last night hits a new low in the new ... America\nAnd a man on television who I think it's basically talent lists and psychotic I Would say that Jimmy Kimmel by my estimation as a mentally ill person seriously mentally ill\nFor him to take out to trade with mushrooms on it and ask a degenerate filthy poll dancing over the hill horse faced loser which one most approximate the president's private parts and that network let this run\nNetwork didn't censor it network didn't cancel a show and wait it gets even worse the sponsors didn't cancel the show the same sponsors that will not broadcast will not advertised on TALK radio I don't know how you buy those products I don't understand it\nAre you telling me progressive by those cars now if you buy those cars\nThis is the irony of the whole thing you the audience of conservative media if you want to call it that\nAre actually the money earners of America the taxpayers of America it's not the millennials they don't own anything all they vie or apple only buys a phone a phone and on the shirt\nAnd made me condoms what are they by actually millennials what do they buy what do they what is it real running after them what do they have nothing they're living in their mother's basement or sixteen to a room on ... street like a Democrat great grandfather did when he came off the boat\n... from wherever it came from and yet the media runs after the millennia like they're the future of the world they don't know anything we know everything we know everything we built this world we built this great world that these interlopers living playing and our soil and\nI think I better take a break before I say something I regret\nJoining the Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nSavage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future coal eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss in America dot com\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and bingo surprise you hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's what that's why I recommend extended vehicle protection from car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles\nCar shield can save you from paying for high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands\nBut when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite mechanical dealership fix your car it's your choice\nCar shield also provides twenty four seven roadside assistance at a rental car while yours is being fixed for free get covered by the ultimate an extended vehicle production get car she oh how cool eight hundred car sixty one hundred eight hundred cars sixty one hundred\nEight hundred car sixty one hundred mentioned called Savage or visit car show got communist coach Savage to save a Big Ten percent that's car she'll dot com or eight hundred car sixty one hundred coats average to save ten percent and the doctor will may apply\nAre you prepared to navigate today's bond markets for your clients\nWith decades of experience\nAnd not fast has helped advisors uncover fixed\nYou think you know Saturday Night live movies so far there have been eleven blues brothers Wayne's World cone heads when Israel to its that Stewart says his family whose brothers two thousand and that is the rocks very superstar the ladies' man Emma Gruber\nOn average SNL movie score forty percent of rotten tomatoes blues brothers has the highest scoring SNL movie with a certified fresh rating of eighty seven percent and it's ... has a rotten rating has zero percent [noise]\nThat's right and she represents ethanol movies have earned over three hundred million dollars from the U.S box office when Israel has the highest box office have with a hundred and Twenty one million dollars one hundred and three cars were wrecked during the production of the blues brothers turning in a world record as she could lose brothers two thousand one hundred and four cars", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "03"}
