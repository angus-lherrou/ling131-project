if your cars attacked by a mob you don't have to sit there and wine and call the police\nSo now I treated this morning Savage won't stop the mobs donation will fall and I gave some of my solutions one one of the solutions to stopping left wing Democrat mob violence one one\nPoll the nonprofit status of the ACLU and also us funded groups that's number one truck passed that authority to authorize the

um\nWell why are you surprised you know that they're that they want as many illegal aliens here as they can get an order to a\nRegular system you understand that most American taxpayers don't want any more illegal aliens here it's I don't know who don't watch them here other than those who benefit from the who wants to them here and I so I I wouldn't be so surprised by that\nYou shocked at the Democratic party is the party of the illegal aliens you actually believe that Dianne Feinstein and and that's the place you could stay in office if\nIf if there were voter IDs required\nYou're telling me that they're not in power because of the millions of illegal aliens who have been registered over the years who vote automatically vote Democrat please I I Would disagree with you on that cast a vote Tony go ahead please topic what's on your mind\nTo what I\nShould try out a lot like hanging on the flight per se or\nDon't don't you don't you think of the bases everything to Trump allegedly stands for like American values where where the American values in a rap rapper in in the oval office\nThanks to watch what China\nHas what I had hoped the president would elevate our cultural standing rather than integrate our cultural standing and to me bringing a rap star in any rap star denigrate some American culture doesn't raise it up Lois it down\nI Would run out\nI'm not speaking of jealousy I've been there at the same desk\nI I've been I've been at the same desk the endeavor desk the highest point in my in my career\nSo I'm not speaking to the point of view of jealousy I'm speaking to the point of view of something else something's wrong with this picture who is it vice president to bring in a rap star who makes a disgrace of the oval office this is a sacred office\nThat is owned by the people Trump does not own that office he's merely an occupant of it\nHe has no right to bring the level of that office down to the guts are\nIn my humble opinion now of course you'll disagree with me just to disagree with me but this is part of the cultural degradation that I have been trying to talk about for twenty five years on the radio and if you think I'm Talking about it for the point of view of jealousy or mistaken again I'm a best selling author I'm an extremely successful broadcaster\nMike ... book is doing extremely well thank you audience very much you want to thank you for making it happened ah I Hope you get onto a policeman for free as a gift\nBut I've been in the oval office it was a big moment for me do you think I Would jump up and hug the president\nDo you think I Would think it was not a violation of\nCommon sense decency\nA secret service rules to jump up and give the president the side hug like he's the guy who owns a body shop somewhere on the Jersey what what are you thinking\nI'm surprised by the way that the secret service is so bad that this could ... by the way they should not have been shouldn't happen number one but I Would wish that there was a secret service agent who would have prevented the rapper\nFrom grabbing the president of the ... look at the president\nFace in the picture he's extremely shocked he's horrified by the way that the guy got so close to empty understand how dangerous this is what a per say oh I'm wrong look at the picture\nI grab the screen shut up without having to put a areas wrap it violates Secret Service protocols that's on Michael Savage dot com and if you think I'm going to look at the president's face he shocked\nHe shot the demand got him in a hub where he's got his left on over the president's ah left shoulder he's got his right arm holding the president's right hand the president really backwards from him\nAnd they're cutting us making the big ass of himself again smirking to the cameras using that President as a marketing tool you understand that\nWell if you don't understand them and help you try to understand that this was a public relations disaster and wasn't going to get ... votes from it you know on Monday I'm going to have a diamond in silk on the show again because then the movie is coming out\nI'd be very curious what they think about this\nBecause this goes way beyond the optics of the picture\nThis goes to a breakdown in our society and almost every level nobody seems to have any value is left no one seems to know what's right or wrong no one seems north knows the difference between north and south no one has any dignity wherever you turn it everything's breaking down for the top to the bottom that's that's that's my opinion\nThat's my opinion rosy rose on line three you disagree with all had please you're on the air [noise]\nWell I was calling every car here comment that I have left can offend them feel that the the the unity he fired at the end I I don't I don't think we're so as a way to show it was a garbage man the not\nSo what's the word garbage man has a right to be in the oval office\nIf the president if I have\nA lot of the what if the president invited a pornographer in there who had a big a big following that pornography pornographic websites are amongst the biggest Web sites in the country would it be right for the president to invite the head of a pornography website in no I'm Talking west it's nothing but a pornographer with an instrument\nFriendly and make a ... a five hour thanks\nFor agreeing with me I've been waiting for that are all my life none of ... you don't understand this was pushed down a by someone else in there who got it all wrong and I don't think the president's going to gain any votes from it I think he's gonna he's not going to lose any votes but he's going to have a lot of people walk away feeling sick\nBecause if we're defending him and defending American values aboard his language and culture well you could argue that rap music is part of American culture you'd be right in saying that but I Would say it's in the wrong direction it's taking America and the wrong direction of culture\nAh and I don't care about race at all I Want to make it racial go ahead and make it whatever you want because that's all that's on your mind I Would say this if it was a a person of any any any race and if he wanted to have some one of the arts in there with a large following there are other choices besides a rapper whose lyrics are disgusting\nDisgusting do you think that I'm Alone in my opinion may be on the first and the only wants to say it today but I can guarantee you that I won't be the last look at the lyrics of this rapper\nI Can't even read them on the air I Need you I Want you come to me ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy that's just the ecstasy ecstasy she pushes drugs he pushes group sex he pushes ah everything you can imagine\nThat we don't stand for that's the message you think belongs in the oval office I ...\nIf you want but I'm not going to do it on the air they're all disgusting lyrics\nAnd this is an example of the the the collapse of American civilization\nAnd by the way I felt the same way when his darling wife was in the last few months ago another one a zero nobody an uneducated piece of a waste of human DNA human DNA was bought into human DNA a waste of human DNA excuse me\nNothing but surgery a a surgical textbook in high heels was brought in and I'm supposed to say like a mall on and say how wonderful they brought in the wife of the rap and now he brings in the rapper whose that's why I got a pornographer bringing a pornographer after all as some of these sites are doing their enormous\nWhy does he get sick the guy out from the desert who has a uh all of the ... the um how's the prostitution that doesn't that guy dentist whatever his name is after all he's running as a Republican one and have him in there and give them a hug aside hug\nWhat's that guy's name in with the with the uh the Brussels out there in the desert of Nevada said that he represents American culture to you could have him in you know why not\nHave a boss alone or have a pornographer and they may bring in six votes each you never know but I Would think that having had a guy who runs like one of the major porn sites would be very smart politically think of all the people addicted to pornography vote for Trump after that\nLess the same thinking as having this guy in there at least

beautiful review because you actually think and you could actually right very well it was Thomas would write a book\nAnd the way it's a great review and I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story

T. in Las Vegas I Love a call like this I don't know what's on your mind Brady\nYes Dr Savage thank you for taking my call I wanted to bring up you were talking about exit central is the man different universes and where we are today and different things the things I Know you're a very spiritual guy\nA growing up in Minnesota my family have been living in a haunted house and the thought several votes I Want to ask your opinion what do you feel about goals in the afterlife and angels also because you're very spiritual fight\nIt's a good question since my dog is kind of very old right now and it's forcing me to a face the inevitable you know we all think about it than we pushed out of our mind were young we don't think about dying at all then we get older we try to push it out of our mind but we see people dropping aside for our own bodies you know the theory writing and we realized that we are like all other people that have lived before us\nAnd if you go to a museum and you see statues of the great Roman emperor is they're all dead right as a certain point it dawns on you that you're not immortal takes a long time for some people are most people outgrow that sense of immortality by the time they're twenty Twenty one\nBut for some people they're eighty and they still think they're immortal they had transplants they buy a boat load of ... they date twenty year old girls from Latvia\nOr things like that and they pretend that they're Eighteen years old so you're asking me what I think about what ghosts\nBelieving golf in the afterlife I never saw ghost actually\nOr twice once every member of the fun house in Coney Island when I was like ten and like some like threads hanging down hit me in the head maybe for that minute I thought it was a ghost but it wasn't they hung threats from the ceiling as you went by in the in the car I don't know ghost\nNo I don't believe in ghosts now angels or another story I have to believe that there are a guardian angels that's strange part a part of me is still very childlike I actually do believe that they're at the angels out there that that I don't know guide us protect us\nIn some way and I think that if you tune into the bad part of your nature and the bad part of the universe you don't get angels you get the devils and they go\nThe worst behavior and I think that that's true whether it's a psychological phenomenon or a spiritual phenomenon I I certainly don't know\nBut I have found in my own life without sounding making stuff up I think angels have saved my life at least three or four times one step in one direction or one step at another and I would have been a governor you know what I'm saying so I mean what's the next question since we're doing friday spiritual quests or what's the next one\nFor the next thing I wanted to say I think after seeing a ghost it actually brought me closer to God because it made me see a different existence in real life is something that's an alternate universe and I think it makes you more spiritual after you've seen something like that fire\nAnts so so for you what you believe now in what ghosts or know goes\nI Believe in God thank God all at the same time\nAll right well thanks for sharing I I don't know where that's coming from but I don't even want to talk about it I I just it's friday you know it's open Mike to make sure you want to talk about ghosts stop mass hysteria and things like that what you saw in the book stores had the hiding the book and getting reports around the country\nThat the nice people with green hair and a brings hanging from their lips who go into the book business in al putting the book underneath you know rags and toilet paper rolls and things like that when it's supposed to be a in the front what am I supposed to do about\nConservatives cheer Turkey's release of us pastor Brunson it's not a big deal to me I'm Glad he's released from turkey I Wish him well but I don't even know who he is and I'm Glad they got him out of turkey that's so\nMeal you got the devastation and the and we went on in Florida My God she goes to shut a hundred and fifty stores now that's a story to me\nSears Holdings Corp is planning to close up to a hundred and fifty years department stores\nWell you could thank Jeff Bezos for another victory now another change is one out of business how many things can that man on and so everyone's out of business and everyone's working for him\nDo you have any idea the devastation that that company is doing to the world and I realize this is almost suicidal because my book a soul and Amazon owned by the very same Jeff Bezos but this is a talk show I have I Can't ... I Can't ... I I Can't separate it all it is what it is\n[noise] there was a great article the other day in the New York post I think by Moreno Callahan on white um Amazon must be broken up and I'm not going to paraphrase it looked for the article yourself it's so well written many of us saying the same thing there is an antitrust division of the U.S Justice Department that basically does nothing\nIt is in its in business to stop companies like this from destroying everything around them\nAnd I'm In great examples given them for two years before I was talking about a story about standard oil broken up talking about Vanderbilt in the railroads became a monopoly broken up so we have ... that have grown and they didn't need to be broken up but I'm not a politician I'm not the president I'm not the attorney general\nYou know I don't know what that attorney general does by the way I have no idea what he doesn't there\nOnce this thing with the Saudi prince and the cutting summing up with a bonus or he criticized them crazy story that is that young you know the Saudi a got a critic coming in and get a marriage license in an embassy next thing you know with the ... were running a cut them into ...\n... what do you expect in Saudi Arabia thought that they were modern aesthetic because they said they were\nThey live in the ninth century I don't care of them do you think of the Saudis and that there are friends now I get it they're wonderful we all loved and now we love Saudi Arabia they cut to pieces and we're supposed to love him and the guy who did it by the way it's a good friend of the uh you know I Can't even say that look look here's where I'm at\nJust by saying I disagree with Kanye West being in their ... their when let's say any chance of getting even a turkey\nUh at the mar a Lago turkey buffet\nI wouldn't even get a turkey leg meaning near the ... in close to the president remember when I was there last year I was on the table him in a few other people and all the people from the media from Fox were circling the table they couldn't get within the coordinate the secret service and I was like making fun of them and then moustache was in the outer rooms he couldn't even get into the room\nThe next thing I wake up must ashes in the inner circle\nThe guy who ran Fox News into the ground is now running the president's communications and I'm now banished to the outer ring I I mean if I go to mar a Lago for for Thanksgiving I may be the biggest\nOn I'm nuts before it's a week before Thanksgiving gonna be a day but higher which is freedom thing\nThe renaissance weekend restoration weekend I'm speaking there that Saturday I thought I go to mar a Lago in that Sunday but if I'm going to be like walking around the outside circling the the outside there\nAnd if the president sees me out when you got to it's like like Caesar if he sees you and gives you a thumbs up it invites you and your your your your heart leaps but what if he looks at you'll put your thumb a thumbs down you're not even allowed anywhere near him\nSo I don't know if I'm ever going to go near it I I really want to go and get a rejection 'cause right now it's all Fox News all the time everything Fox News around the clock\nSince the higher the guy from five to everybody's got to be on Fox News if you were on Fox News and you have a morning show in a city no one listens to with three people the president calls you all because of Fox News just the way the cookie crumbles I'll be back\n...
