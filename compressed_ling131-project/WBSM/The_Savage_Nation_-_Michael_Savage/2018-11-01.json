N. D. W. in Virginia Line nine you're on the Savage Nation what's your topic\nAh topic is first of all let me say I'm a longtime fan because he's still the indisputable truth and I want to share\nWhat is your station carrying me come January emptied W O vision you have to check so we have the list yet\nFor any difference or\nWell hopes of that you're gonna you're gonna follow me on um on podcasting right\nYes sir I'll find out find wherever you are but I watch what's going to happen anyway right\nBy one of my favorite ... it was a white Europeans are Christians straight male and make matters worse he was half American that was when Churchill\nOh great man one of the great and he said he's reviled by the cycle degenerates on college campuses today\nBut he says ally gets halfway around the world for the truth in this song [laughter] the exact tactic democratic propaganda machine known as the lady [noise] I'm\nRunning instead of watching the truth that the media is Ninety nine percent left wing and uh there are very few um um you know beacons of anything else in this country\nAnd they get the line before the truth can respond [noise]\nYou know what do you think what do you think today about a guy like Don lemonade he's obviously stupid very low IQ see obviously got where he is not for his brains but for other reasons so we can only imagine when I was the biggest terror threat in this country is white men we have to do something about them what do you think should be done to Don lemonade\nShould be fired I mean any conservative and made a safe and like it was\nWhat if I look at their statement here [noise] I Want to actually say fine\nOkay I'm going to take a statement in and start something else we have to stop demonizing people realize the biggest terror threat in this country has blank men friday we have to start doing something about them there was no show there was no ban on you know they had the Muslim ... there was no blank guy band\nSo now I filled in the word blank with any other race would I be on the radio the next second [noise]\nNo my career would be over now I Know that why does ... thanks for calling I Want to play some sound though that I didn't get to you on the show\nWhere our number three it's one thing is to nails Halloween Wednesday Wednesday what a week it's it's going fast thank God so far no how are you at this week we're still recording from what went on last week member of the steroid not either he was an American Indian or a a Filipino we don't know what he was the\nWater center fake bombs thank God I wasn't real bombs that anybody would follow it up remember all the top dams got it in a and we didn't even know if they were real if there was cream cheese and they are locks\nLooked like why are sticking out of a like a ... only the heart and in the sun with a wire and that that guy was you know the steroid guy the stripper All right we laughed at it than we said thank God no one got hurt and then Saturday this horrible\nHorrible thing happens I warned you I tried to warn you on friday what happens when you keep demonizing people on the bottom and you don't have to like them to understand\nThat you can provoke people into doing things by saying certain things about them\nAnd if you think I'm justify what he did then you're crazy I never justified what he did I'm explaining the mind of these people and that's part of my job is to going inside the mind of these people\nTrying to stop this violence that started so now we go to Pittsburgh and here is a Jewish doctor who treated this evil man in clipped number two I'll listen to what the Jewish doctor said\nOh yesterday I went up to meet him [noise] but I was just curious as to\nThan quite honestly he's just a guy\nHe's [noise]\nPeople say he's evil he's this some other son [noise] and how did he get from\nThat to where he is today that's going to be or state that we have to wrestle with as a society\nAnd you see now that's intelligence that's intelligence as a Jewish doctor\nWho went up thinking he'd see a monster and he said just someone sun and how did he get to that from where he is today that's going to be a large debate that we have to wrestle with as a society that's what we mean by intelligence\nThat's an educated man with compassion who cares about people and the country now is the number Thirteen from the same show which Dr\nPhil he was severely injured and he got great care here\nFor many people tend to be more joy [laughter] you know they're heroes they they they didn't like the cops they did their job they when they they confronted the problem when they were true to their core beliefs and I'm very proud of him he's like a lot of people are coming here that\nThey're scared fused don't quite understand it wants to get my job is to judge other people give a that's a pretty awesome responsibility when jobs take care of him\nHe said my job is not to judge during the war not what's left out but he's not like the cops I mean I loved doctors in emergency settings I think the heroes but they're not like the cops because their lives were in the rest of the cops went in knowing their lives were at risk so it's not exactly true but nevertheless alright the point is that\nThis Jewish doctor treats this anti Semitic Nazi and he says he thought he would see a monster but quite honestly just the guy and people said he's evil but he's just some of the sun and how to get from that to where he is today that's going to be a large debate that we have to wrestle with as a society\nThat's what you should be hearing in the media not the ... stuff that Jeff Zucker puts out on the airwaves every day as a stock in trade that so that's my whole point the today show basically\nNow let's turn to another element of the same kind of ... and Saturday an evil Nancy Pelosi\nShe's asking why she doesn't tell them down or hateful rhetoric and the whole Democratic Party listen to what she says a number for\nThat unifying I can see all the time to him hey when we when you see evidence of a fast they lead you free ... has a history of the new\nCongress was honored his house if I found the plane in some many wind\nAnd that's it that's the whole thing so in other words once you have power again then you'll stop the hatred Nancy is that right Kenya Democrats find anyone else but these old rich white women and these old rich white men\nToo who insight incite hatred in this country Kenya Democrats do better than that now that's a dialogue we need to have in this country you claim you want diversity\nYou claim you want fairness and yet you pick people worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to represent your party and you're supposed to believe that people down on the bottom I supposed to vote for you because of that is crazy\nOK what can I say I mean I live in the city I see their Parker see every day I Want to turn the clock back to Nineteen Ninety three with you on the Savage Nation
