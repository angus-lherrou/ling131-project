go want to go along with that or she goes along with it and she feels no cut activity what the man she does adjusts to please them and to have a little sex but it's not what she wants she wants to love\nAnd as a result the marriage starts to unravel\nThis is all traceable to the filthy dirty sick pornographers or so called adult film stars like the one who accused Donald Trump of uh of various things she suddenly an icon of America adult film star I Love the adult film I Love to me that's not an adult film\nWhere the adult film type people up in a rubber mass that's an adult film meeting somebody up that's an adult film humiliating selling beating somebody up that's an adult film\nOkay well there are cycles to everything and as I Try to explain to you last week for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction and you haven't seen the reaction yet oh no you have not if you think that the Kavanaugh hearings\nFor the end of that fight no that was the beginning of the war that we are in\nIt was the most it was after the getting of it it was the best example in our time for the world to see of how low the left will go\nTo destroy a person who does not advanced the

makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nI've not seen such mass hysteria in this country in recent times you can go back in history of fiber during the McCarthy period\nWe heard about McCarthyism in how evil he was and he picked on the poor the poor innocent Hollywood writers how many times you've heard that story with a famous movie with zero must della throwing himself out a window\nThere was actual communism back then it was real\nWell we know that from the event known of papers that were released I Believe in the nineties vice Soviet intelligence after the war came down\nWhich confirmed that every one of the individuals I think without exception that had been named by the house of American activities committee ... McCarthy turned out to eat in the rec fellow travel\nOr a an operative of the Soviet Union in Hollywood in government and the media now\nHas that ever entered the history books\nAnd all the opposite ... those people now entered government under Obama I mean you had for example the Institute for policy studies which was a Marxist group where communist agents were literally hanging out in the lobby and then\nThey were helping rock bottom alright plans to defund the military and they were helping the Obama administration and the center for American Progress\nA which helped Obama come up with all of this ... legislation so it's sort of a vicious circle but have you seen anything though on a lake the mass hysteria right now\nUnder Trump why all of the sudden has mass hysteria been put on steroids under this specific administration and you write in your book you have is three ... mega examples including\nA Maxine Waters basically calling for violence against Trump cabinet members calling for them for ... quote unquote pushback against them if they're seen in public I mean this is this is insane so why mass hysteria on steroids under Trump\nThey had the country almost on the locked down\nBefore Trump one they were pretty short Hillary was a show in right oh yeah\nOkay so once they got a girl in office that would have been the end of America as we know it they had the Supreme Court they knew she began they knew that they were going to be a point to use it would've been over for a hundred years fifty years at least all of a sudden out of nowhere\nA a businessman a showman and here we are and they went insane they've tried everything that you know once we haven't heard much about the Russia\nStory since the cabinet ... which is another mass hysteria piece of insanity what did you notice that they shifted from Russia collusion to cabin on the ... the rape is\nThere for shifting shapes shift ... that they are so now they know\nWhat are they going to lose now as a moderate Republican Supreme Court said of another assured they call it a swing voter that's nonsense she was not a swing voter you always voted with the liberals by and large so what they're what they're what are they facing here why capital why now what they're afraid of with the fact that will have a conservative majority\nThis is an end to it at the large extent the people who opposed him the most I really I dug into this in great detail\nWho want to people who've accused him the most of this right well we'll start with Dr for and\nI studied the research that she has gotten to she put a name on his wipers on what she has her name I was forced to do it given that I Know research and lo and behold ... guess what I found she published papers on the use of the morning after drug for abortion\nTo treat women for depression that means she's owned in my analysis by the abortion and district and the abortion drug industry\nThis is a billions of dollars a year our and if you want to just make this crew the financial the abortion racket tears and that includes all those senators will viciously slander Kavanaugh every one of them probably receives tons of money\nDirectly or indirectly from abortion rack of tears from one group for the other drug companies\nPlanned Parenthood you name it so let's look at the financials they stand to lose a ton of money here now it's let's not forget that she published papers pushing the use of the morning after pill to treat depression\nOkay the great doctor for it I Love that doctor did you notice how how many times they refer to her doctor ... doctor for a doctor for that I liked that part of it because I've been called a a shock jock and every now and his son while you're a doctor well as I sit on my radio show I have a real PHD from a great university\nAnd you're going to have to call me Dr Savage from now on [laughter] shock jock Savage or anything else that I won't let them call me anything but I'll stop them and that tracks with the liberals who want to play games with Dr they're stuck to that but putting aside the rhetoric we're living in very dangerous time they get the ... has been motivated to become violent\nAnd they're being paid to be violence and I made it a comparison on my radio show there but they are and I don't know if you've heard it on the Republican today\nThe parallels are really like ... other than the fact that we have a great economy and we did not lose World War one and have to pay reparations\nBe social upheaval going on in America today is almost identical to that which went on and the answer what period in Germany after World War one before Hitler came to power and I were on the the people who listen to my show\nThat the exact opposite of what the communist bloc thinks is going to happen by shaking up society by attacking the middle class by harassing everyone they disagree with the exact opposite is going to happen they're not\nGoing to gain power they're going to see a complete right wing reaction in this country because Trump is not a complete like when we actually as you well know he's actually a moderate centrist than most in most ways you know that in some ways yeah absolutely but the fact is we haven't really seen the right wing revolution that they all say were happening\nAnd I believe that if they keep the up more and more people on the independent

Dustin Hoffman plays writes us well Dreyfuss was a French military officer of Jewish descent\nWho was accused of being a spy when he wasn't a spy or the officers that conspired to make stuff up about him\nAs a result he was found guilty of trees and then sent a devil's island and the comparisons a of the Dreyfus affair ... capital are pretty strong because they haven't stopped\nThe blood libel against Kavanaugh justice the blood libel was kept up in France against Dreyfuss for very long time by the anti Semitic officers so too are the anti Americans in America continuing the blood libel against cabinet as they have against Donald Trump as they have a guest every conservative\nYou know it's a rotating moving field of targets\nAnd counting on my Savage army tomorrow or to go out and really clean out the book stores you know what you're going to hit you know with opposition you're going to get as you well know band on Fox News because they're not fair and balanced there a cartel\nAnd only their authors and the friends of their officers get on that network I said they're not obligated to put me on so I've had best sellers without them and whether or not I have one this time is very important for America and not that important for me I got to make that very clear turn the music off this is so important\nLet's say this book sold millions of copies what would it say it would send a message to the left that not only their books and their followers and their people ... but that we count\nAnd here's the part that urge the one thing you've got to hand the left as they all stick together that's the one thing is out of hand them and they support each other you take a hack like that guy who\nThe Watergate guy the guy writes a book and they say it's sold a million copies the first day\nThat means a million of the people who hate America hey Trump went out and bought a book [noise] why is that why did they support each other\nAnd why do you sit home and not do it I don't understand that it [noise] so [noise]\nDo you have sun spots in age spots well listen to Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sun spots correct her\nShe says I Love the gender cell sunspots director is might go to product everyday watcher sunspots eight spots and even read inflamed patches vanish right before you very eyes\nI also was on Newsmax TV this morning many of you saw this and we're going to get some of your calling on that which is interesting\nSo we saw the left wing in action last week in a way that was so naked than it would take a real dummy not to see how evil and they actually are not how they became\nThey reversed all the rules of law and ethics of decency and the only question is will this reflect in November ah at the ballot box and I don't know I think it I think it will because women\nIn particular who are deciding factor in many elections who are the reason Trump is president never forget that it was a late surge of white\nMiddle class suburban women\nThat swung over to Trump at the end of the election last time that that put them over the finish line and the question is will they come over again and large enough numbers to save America from the communist jogging or all will we start the same thing fascism racism equality\nUh let's see what are the other watch words of the uh hashtags is hashtags that patriarchy racism white privilege or Trump Mueller oh abortion\nMale a male supremacy a you know you know to watch words or the radical left they have they have all of their little characterizations ready to go out Trump has the power to save America and I don't know whether he'll pull a trigger on it but remember Obama that\nObama had his IRS poll the tax exempt status of conservative organizations he didn't like remember that scandal\nDo you know how many of those women in the street with their spontaneously no one does you know how many organizations were funded by George Soros most every one of the organizations that bust women to attack senators in the hallways to disrupt the hearings every one of them\nWas brought in because they're working for these nonprofits remember it's a job for them that's their job is political agitation\nAnd so the non profit organizations is supposed to be nonpartisan the IRS could pull the status of their organizations literally overnight with a letter\nAnd their funding would dry up and it has to be done it's a simple as that there are ways that a non violent where you could face these violent people without violence\nAnd I'm afraid that if we don't we're gonna have another Kent State probably in this country I sent it to someone over the weekend I don't know if any of your old enough to remember Nineteen Seventy I saved a newspaper from that time because um\nIt was a significant for many many ways I'll never forget what happened at Kent State university and the killings accounts they change the course of American politics you see the radicals were agitated\nIt's an intergenerational group of agitator incidentally the old hippies of that time are still alive and they've cultivated an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call them that\nAnd the old hippies got the mobs in the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of the state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off against the rabble the long haired rabbit was threatened to take down take down the whole campus all the riders didn't stop no one had ever stop them before\nUnfortunately the rest of this historically factual and that is somebody amongst the national guard open fire on them and then others did the little form of mass hysteria by the way and the number of students was shot dead on that campus\nOne of the results of it in addition to the tragedy\nStudents being shot was that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt\nSuddenly they cut their heroin home to mommy and took a job in McDonalds they would no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard\nAnd I'm afraid that this is going to happen if they keep taunting the police if they keep taunting senators if they keep harassing people in restaurants how long is it going to be until a senator who is armed and license to carry\nFeels threatened enough to pull a gun on one of them you think it can happen I told you I was in Washington last April a to visit the precedent while I was invited by my good friend congressman Columbus in from Texas and he he gave me a personal tour of Congress\nAnd he showed me a group of marble stairs aback staircase into into the house of representatives is still has blood on the steps and he told me that there was actually a shootout in Congress between a journalist and a congressman\nBecause the journalist hat smeared the congressmen over and over and over again\nTaught to them over and over and over again you think this new today there's in the Eighteen eighties\nWell it turns out that the journalists came to a Congress with a gun in his hand I don't remember his name and shot the congressman dead on the steps and the blood is still there in the steps\nNow I'll give you another example you may not know this but it's it's history this oil and mass hysteria again those you know the history those who do not know the history of condemned to repeat it I Hope you learn the history of you're not condemned to repeat it\nDo you know that in the early Nineteen fifties\nA group of Puerto Rican nationalist broke into the gallery in the U.S Congress and opened fire on congressman below and killed a number of them did you know that\nAnd so when you see the pain cats or the women screaming and yelling it's not amusing to me\nIt's a form of violence that must be stopped and the only way to stop them is by passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already we're not living in the in the early days of the founding here where we're now infiltrated\nWere infiltrated they're everywhere they're running the television shows they've been portrayed of the universities they've infiltrated the ... the peaceful front groups\nAnd it's only a matter of time into one of these lunatics shoots a senator or congressman and I think that we need to take preemptive action to prevent another massacre in Congress as occurred in the early fifties when a group of Puerto Rican national ... open fire from the galleries on the Congress below now what am I the only person in America remembers that story yes\nAm I the only author in America who knows that story I Can't be am I the only broadcaster who knows that story probably and here I Am with stop mass hysteria having to tell you about it because I'm telling you are right now that unless we know our history

again saluting her how great she is my opinion is a little different than that of the establishment\nI Believe Haley resigned because she a failed to ignite war with Russia\nFailed to bomb Syria which she threatened to do for weeks ago\nAnd she push Trump to bomb Syria over and over again and I amongst maybe some others said no you won't you lose the entire conservative base\nYou're not as stupid as they think you are you actually know what's going on America does not want to know the war in the middle east and I said so and I think I was heard and I think she failed her controllers whoever they may be an average suspicion who she really your reports to what it is and the president the United states so my opinion is\nHaley's resignation as first of all the good thing unless they pick someone even more reluctant than her she was a militant hawk in a terrible situation for America we didn't need a militant walk in the UN\nWe use skilled diplomat in the year when she was not a skill diplomat and as I said she couldn't ignite a war with Russia by bombing Syria and so her controllers pulled off the stage it's been done before that's how politics works welcome to the Savage

ratings there are other people to pose as quote conservatives but they're not a threat to the establishment\nThey very safe conservative it's easy to call yourself conservative and not be a threat to the establishment it's another thing to be an independent who was a threat to the establishment both left and right there is no room in America for the independent minded individual let me tell you that right now almost no room whatsoever none whatsoever\nYou got to play the game according to the rules and the rules say you're joined one party or the other is it an interesting that so many people who put Trump down for a year straight\nBack to other candidates ridiculed you are now making believe that did the greatest supporter of Donald Trump well he's not fooled by it\nAnd I'm not fooled by it so you know I'm not going to read read from the book I'm not in the mood to read from the book I don't even want to read from the book you can read it yourself and maybe we'll talk about it tomorrow or it's the most important political book of our time I'll leave it at that\nBut I Want to do is take some of your calls and I would like to reference an article written by Cindy gross in the times of Israel I'm going to read you a few paragraphs\nAnd I'll Try to stay away from the obvious she says\nSavage is the host of one of the most countries most streamlined radio shows but Michael Savage also\nFortune teller bringing want that who else of Michael Savage would release a book on October ninth the first day of work for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left is not just take President Trump they hate this nation is nothing new but it's at its worst\nAnd then she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to prove it from Christopher Columbus the Salem witch trials and then he or she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by centers the politicians with ulterior motives\nSavage provides vital contacts for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks a mass hysteria their causes they're short and long term effects and the tactics of the puppet masters who theloop gullible masses interfering threats both real and imagine\nShe then went into the issue of Jews because she writes for the times they're Israel she's very Jewish and she asked me a key question which was funny which was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Capitol at that time and Savage said quote\nWhen Jews are good they're great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out adding quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models this platform from the power madness of the Bolshevik Revolution he is energizing this frenzy among the young ...\nOf course we discussed the capitalist area\nAnd he said the check off to smear Kavanaugh was challenged in last male white heterosexual married in Christian the involvement of a Feinstein who was not Jewish ... Blumenthal or Schumer affects Jews long term\nWe compared how Jews were treated during the Alfred Dreyfuss ... Frank cases\nSavage also related how Jewish lost an ethics are the exact opposite of what took place during the process of confirming capital I thought that was the most salient points of our interview Savage related how the Jewish law as an ethics are the exact opposite of what took place\nDuring the process of governing Kavanaugh and what was sad about it was that they were Jewish people\nViolating the ethics of their fathers Blumenthal amongst them Blumenthal in others amongst them using the exact opposite of the teaching of the Jewish people\nSavage a Trump supporter agrees that while he doesn't agree with Trump one hundred percent he thanks got every day the Hillary isn't in the White House to any critics Savage says nobody agrees with a spouse or friend one hundred percent\nAnd then he went on with other stuff Savage encourages opposition to read the book and debate him\nAnd of course my discussion with Savage including where to get some good food the Catskill Mountains in his involvement with about\nSo there was a very good interview and I ... and it's worth reading by people who are interested in the deeper ramifications of what happened and how the effects of going to be seen for years and years to come but let's get back to the news of the day\nAnd my opinion on it I don't know whether you agree or disagree with me I said that Haley resign suddenly because she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed to get Trump to bomb Syria\nNow on what do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning\nShe was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ambassador is supposed to be an ambassador is supposed to make peace not war Haley went in there with one mission which was to cause dissension with Russia\nThrough Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag\nOf a chemical attack which I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag they're about to release gas and say that the ... did it I pointed out over and over again Assad would be an insane individualized would put in to do this when they're\nWhen they got I suspect in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it and somehow\nPeople within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the verge four weeks ago I don't know if you remember and who was beating the drum for the launch of Tomahawk against Syria\nWell it was Mr ... himself\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration is that the ... plant\nUh in the national security advisor ship position and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war in the worst way they would bloodthirsty and they wanted war but for some reason the none global is around from\nWhere the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria and from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well as a result Haley's resigning that's my opinion maybe disagree with me and I don't know on what basis you would disagree with me\nAnd that we're talking about my book stop mass hysteria what you found in the book stores or on a more intelligent level\nIf you've gotten the book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the
