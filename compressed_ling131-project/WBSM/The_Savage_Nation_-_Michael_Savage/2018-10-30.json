traditional Marxist causes from my readings everything they touch is against the nation's identity there one world order new world order people those to him and his son so don't confuse the two and here's the problem missed the shift\nBy merging they're radical politics with the legit religious affiliation\nWhat you're doing is smearing the religion itself and making the the larger population come to believe that all Jews are radical leftists which is where the problem begins that I Want to go into that\nBecause as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly not speak to the French bull development developmentally disabled brothers or this or their seventies and eighties some Ninety this was a cowardly act there was no heroism here\nI was thinking about this how did he know\nThat of all places how did he shows this reformed temple in Pittsburgh as his target he said they had something to do with encouraging the flood of immigrants coming into this country\nIf you went to analyze what triggered this guy you know you could sell is just crazy it's crazy he's also a cowardly the killer\nBut there's always a reason inside a crazy person's head I don't know if you understand that if you study FBI profiling they will always show you that even a crazy person in their own mind has a reason\nFor what they do I don't know if you understand that you have to undo maybe you've seen enough movies to even understand that that fundamental thought that even I mad person would that committed an act of violence senseless violence in their own mind they have a justification for what they're doing\nSo this lunatic said I'm going in after we saw the ... coming in\nOn the southern border now you say what's the connection if you can't see the connection I Can't help you if you want us to sit here skating around the truth is that I've been trying to warn you about I Can't help you and I will say again there's only one solution to this\nProtect yourself at all times because no one else will be that protects you but at the end of this terrible tragedy where this this ah Nazis psychotic killed on on\nDefense was Jews what no one to defend themselves\nIt was that the police they were the ones who tracked him through a little room where he was hiding they were the ones who got this cowardly psychotic to throw as weapons though it wasn't a bunch of liberals going in waving a Mr Roger's neighborhood in book form and asking him to police joined them for a a a a a smack\nThey were ready to shoot and they got shot some of them guns can save lives and in New York by the way ah [noise] the NYPD was sent to protect mosques\nSo [noise]\nI was shot in a black church in Charleston South Carolina June seventeenth twenty Fifteen I never forgot it church members shot as they took part a Bible study\nMainly older black people nice people\nBothered nobody slaughtered by this maniac Dylann Roof when and they were killed them shot them same with these Jewish people were shot so what is it in the minds of these cowardly psychotic so that they pick on the softest weakest targets\nTo make their the rain statements that are going after ... people on the other side are they know they're always picking week defenseless people to attack\nThe same way the Islamic murderers target defenseless people on a Sunday afternoon or the whether it's on a bike path in New York or a nightclub in Florida people having a good time\nAlways defenseless people sue the logical conclusion is armed guards\nIf the people on on themselves then okay most people are afraid of guns by and large most people fear guns I've seen this my whole life\nI've heard people say I don't want a gun in my house and the answer is why well they're afraid they'll use it on themselves or they'll use it against the spouse in a moment of rage\nAnd then there are those of us who understand the difference between fear and reality and we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you have to have a policeman in uh in every home\nSo we come back to the questions of the day what you should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings were common sense would dictate that of course most schools have\nArmed guards around them but not to the progressive the regrets of mine is so blind to reality that no matter what the question is they always come up with the wrong answer\nWe're talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus we're talking about the fact that the media is the host organism that is spreading the virus we're talking about the fact that without hatred these media entities wouldn't survive a week\nThey wouldn't survive a week if they were told that they had to stop it\nIf you took Jeff Zucker in a room\nAnd you said you stop you a merry and that's on CNN from spreading this hatred against white people against white nationalists because you're just starting them up I'll tell you right now Jeff Zucker wouldn't change one word coming out of a Andy bloopers mouth or any of the other characters that worked for him in the chorus line\nThere's no common sense left is no decency left in the media so today I told you I'm not going to write the whole ship of state but I Am talking about\nWhy it happened in the minds of the Mad Men without justifying explaining to different things are so rose backed group of regrets ... in Pittsburgh have the nerve to say the Trump don't come to Pittsburgh you're not wanted here\nSixteen thousand communists in a group called bend the arc Jewish Action funded by Alexander Soros\nTens of thousands of quote regressive Jews\nAnd now they're rising up and solidarity against Donald Trump\nAnd the board of directors goes along with this do you have any idea what kind of anti Semitism the stars up in the country when the average person out there and they had to land says oh it's those Jews in Pittsburgh or don't want Trump there do you have any idea what damage progressive doing so this nation\nThey should know that after the killing to stop it but they can't stop it\nBecause of liberalism is a serious mental disorder\nThe rabbi wants Trump there the rabbi wants Trump they make no mistake about it it's this group of mentally bent individuals funded by saw his son in this group bend the ... which is quite ironic bend the arc you hear bend the arc\nI Wonder how long it's been since any of them actually walk with an ark with a toe or from the arc and felt the power of those letters and the power of the books and Moses in those letters there's a magic in it by the way a power that you can imagine unless you actually have done it\n\nWhen you're standing in front of those Hebrew letters even if you don't read them and you stare at them and you realize that for thousands of years these words of a God have instructed mankind\nYou feel something that you can explain in other words there's no way to to explain that you see\nWell again I don't think we should lose the focus of today's program on the Savage Nation it began with a new ... many of your calling in this hour missed the opening to our number one which is a shame but I understand most people listen for seven minutes or so to any talk radio show\nI opened with a holy cow dish the prayer for the dead\nAnd I was trying to set the tone not only of civility but sanctity it was in the memory of those slaughtered in the\nSynagogue and Pittsburgh instead I get callers who are so regressive\nThat they bring up George Soros like he has nothing to do with the hatred right now that he's innocent land when he's been funding these radical leftist groups who in fact are terrifying disease nationalists by the way of getting their backs up so if you want me to make the connections\nBetween the bogeyman of America today the one that you're allowed to voice contempt for the white nationalist\nI Will do so I'll be glad to do it for you\nBecause there have always been white nationalist in this country many of them died in World War two\nOh yes I mean a lot of white nationalist in America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries Oh yes they've been a lot of white nationalist in ... in America\nLook at all of the um military cemeteries around America you'll see an awful lot of white nationalist went to die ... fight and die for their country\nBut all of a sudden the word white a national spin linked together by the radical left into one phrase that signifies something other than being Caucasian hula ... a Caucasian loves his nation suddenly it means something akin to Nazi as him\nAnd this is a trick of the radical left in America they've tripped many people that don't even know what they're talking about the thing that if you are of a Caucasian background and you're a nationalist you're a Nazi\nNecessarily so [noise] so therefore we have to look into the minds of the white nationalist especially the one who did this horrible thing this killing on Saturday and I haven't gotten to it yet I tried to take you as a profile of into the mind of that psychopath\nBut I'm not getting their yet what would make a man do a thing like this what would take a psychopath and triggered him like this and I we close to Germany in the Nineteen thirties\nJoy

exceeds the entire population of Los Angeles\nCalifornia and is roughly half the population of the New York city that's because of family chain migration\nFamily chain migration and that was greatly escalated with the use of a pen and the phone by bureaucracy and Obama who would not let any Europeans and biologic didn't want any people from Europe he wanted as many people from Africa and the middle east as he could get into this country\nIt's a sad fact of reality but if you look at it from the point of view of a rather how liberals are looking at Trump right now if you look at what Obama did could you say he didn't do it for any reason other than the obvious\nSo Trump wants to end birthright citizenship\nAnd um of course it's going to go to the Supreme Court but the good news is our Supreme Court now and I'm taking a phrase that was used by liberal comedian when Obama was president and he looked up at the sky at the White House with all the other or slippers from Hollywood\nAs there was a fly over by the U.S air force and one of the comedians looked up and said it's our air force now because these are anti military left these from Hollywood always hated the military so I

wrote it's our Supreme Court now and then here's what I Want you to just listen to kind of stuff that comes up is fun sometimes it's like playing checkers\nWhen I no longer want to play mental chess and I need to slow down I go on Twitter what I Want to remember what it was like to be a young person seven or eight years old I treat\nWhen I Want to feel that I'm back in the sixth grade I treat\nSomeone writes them Michael usually are better at hiding the authoritarian thug tennis\nThese good for you owning the complete lack of respect for the constitution so I wrote well your criminal

same level as those who still go to Hollywood movies\nNow there's another element to this anchor baby a situation which is birth tourism ooh that's a big one and you know which nationality is specializing in birth tourism that's right your friends from out said some land Chinese flock to USA to give birth to us citizens\nBusiness was booming here for companies that coach pregnant women on how to Deceive Us immigration authorities so they can enter the United states for the sole purpose of giving birth to American citizens at least five hundred companies offered birth tourism services

the tactics renting the u._s._a. or not\n[noise] the women are coached to lie about the purpose of their visit by lifting tourism which makes it easier to get a visa they also told to hide their
