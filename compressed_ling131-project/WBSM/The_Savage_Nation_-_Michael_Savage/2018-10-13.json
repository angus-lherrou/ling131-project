severed [laughter]\nFalling to you know I Know that she can handle the just the nastiness of the classroom or frankly when people say in my work and she walks in there I'm worried for them because the gym a causes of the world and the ... of the world are no match for her she smarter than they are are\nAnd so that doesn't worry me but I Do worry about my tree grandchildren with her and her hung I worry about the fact that you have crazy people like Maxine Waters you've gotten older I mean it's the very thing that you're talking about in your book about stopping mass hysteria\nThere are crazy people that are formed mobs\nAnd heck dawn by elected officials not just to disagree with people that write or find on the rise right doesn't in public places and Michael that's never happened before in a man\nNever happened never happened before and when you hear idiots on CNN like Don lemonade saying you can't hold them a mob and there's nothing wrong with this kind of action we have now moved into a new world in America when the left\nLike as you start with Eric Holder former chief law enforcement officer in America saying when they go low we kick them I've never heard anything like this\nYou don't even hear that from radicals I mean this is really bizarre and for him to say that and to incite that kind of violence against people\nUm you know we've had stage Phillies took a bullet had Rand Paul who was attacked from behind than a cowardly or attack on his back while leaders mowing his own lawn you have the the kind of things that my daughter and his experience Pam Bondi in Florida has experience if Ted Cruz and his wife\nHad happened a curse and Nielsen that the H a secretary and Mitch McConnell has had I mean this is getting out of control this is no longer an isolated incident and this turnout but people who are so lunatics that they try to scratch through a ... ton barn store at the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way\nThis is Petra launched a\nBut Governor Huckabee it's coming from the top there actually telling them it's okay\nHey to become unhinged and violent you got Hillary Clinton saying\nWe don't need civility until we are in power again and we take the power away from them so it's not coming out of a vacuum it's coming from the top down and I think someone needs to say to them cool it because you know what I Know one mass hysteria gets out of control it doesn't limited self to one side of the aisle\nWell and and I do worry and I hope that the people on the conservative side will maintain a sense of decorum we can be passionate we can be a very strong spoken\nBut we should never take A People's freedom and liberty from them and that's what you do when you go to a place where they're having a restaurant meal or when they're at their homes or when they're trying to enjoy a movie\nAnd and when you take their liberty from them that's not America Michael that's not what we're about where that is a green the disagreeing and the right way and the right place at the right time\nA foot we don't go and hound people try to get them out of business and that's what these loans are doing\nWell okay so the question becomes\nHow do we stop it I I spent a half from show yesterday Governor Huckabee speaking to attorneys who are actually representing people who've defended themselves in restaurants against these left wing mobs it's not an easy question\nBecause there are limits to what you can do to defend yourself but on the other hand we can't run away just because they want us to run away and that's the topic for another day we're talking about this issue but ... for a few seconds to talk about\nThe mid term elections I personally believe Governor Huckabee that the violence of the quote new Democratic Party as Eric Holder calls them these actually saying this is the new Democratic Party we kick them when they're down but I actually think that this is going to alienate the vast\nMiddle ground who are going to move over to the Republican side and it's going to have the the health effects that the radicals want it to have that even Hillary Clinton thinks it's going to have what do you think\nI totally agree because there are a lot of people who are Democrats are people who think left of center or who are unabashed liberal decent human beings and they're not hateful people and they're they're not learning tens or they do have some sense of a personal responsibility and they don't want to see people get hurt and injured\nAnd there's a whole move on to walk away movement interestingly started by young and I had on my show on brand instructor who it is interesting a New York or activists\nOr he's he's gay he probably is the last person to people for being on my show we hit it off great rehab terrific can counter\nOn that he has been a long term Democrat and he's sick of this stuff and he was leading a movement called walk away and people can go to the Facebook page and stay in their houses are people who are\nAre truly you know liberal but they're no longer going to support the Democratic party because they feel like it's gone off the deep end and they no longer can associate themselves or something there's like two of them and that has a encourage people to be violent\nAnd uh and and to destroy people's personal liberty but\nGovernor Governor Huckabee you are a media star you're also a musician you're also a devout Christian and the Christian teaching say that you should turn the other cheek but that doesn't mean turn the other cheek forever does it\nWill turn the other cheek does not mean that you're a tip squeak I I think people you know say Boston doesn't make me does not mean week\nThey're working comes from a word and it means strength brought under subjects and it's the same or it could be used to speak of domestic painting a horse\nWhich doesn't mean you make the horse week it means you challenges strengthen his energy and Jesus said bless them equally saying has blessed are those who keep their strength to have power but who channel it in a way that it's constructive\nBut this idea that Christians are just push rovers and then we sit back and take it in a chance\nOn you know that's not true we're going to stand up for justice for what's right\nI think it's more of an appropriate for people who are full reverse not to be angry and not to try to seek revenge but to try to seek justice and justice is not being served when people lied about when they're ... through things that are incredibly horrible things that happened that human beings\nAnd it is the\nAbsolute imperative for true people face the fight against those injustices so anybody who thinks that that even chemical world is going to sit back and just\nA act like it's okay to be Savage rabbits and destroy boy are they ever ...\nWell the next step is going to be what happened in the in the old days in other words if we don't stop these left wing moms they will go into churches and upset sermons and knocked over alters we can't permit this and I think that we we people\nOf belief we people of traditional values have to understand that self defense is the only kind of defense there is at the end of the day but I don't want to get into that right now I Want to stick to the positive and a\nWill go back again to the politics of the day the country moving so far away even from the Democratic party moving into the street violence of the communist movements I Believe politically is going to have a uh the opposite effect in the midterms I think you just agreed with me correct\nAbsolutely I Do feel that this a blue wave ah is is maybe grossly over estimated I think we're going to see a huge turnout from Republicans and conservatives who are beginning to wake up\nThat this is no time to sleep that after we saw what happened to Kavanaugh hearings the attempt\nOr just destroyed the processes and Michael my comes down to it let's be real clear\nWhat's at stake here is whether or not we have a system of government in which we decide things five elections not by tantrums\nUh the reason we're having all of these issues is because the Democrats have refused to accept the results of the twenty sixteen elections among the weapons that way with it if we reward them for their bad behavior you get more of it\nIs the same thing when you raise your child or trained her dog and then you reward you get more out the behavior that you conscious once you get less off ... editor of the ... the screaming yelling the violence the attacks physically and otherwise the lines that struck fitness\nWe cannot rewarded we've got to go out when elections and what you're talking about earlier uh there has to be legal consequences for the people who engage in the south absolutely\nA hundred percent ... percent\n... and and again Governor Huckabee I I I'm admirer the work you're doing on trinity TV I look forward to being with you a later on in the day and it'll be on this weekend given the audience please the times of the television shows again if in case they missed it\nOn a lot of them on Saturday and Sunday they've got four shots at

it's such a high usage of uh anti depressants white people hanging themselves ... on certain place I saw a story yesterday a beautiful woman in her fifties a psychologist and author\nLive by starting place was married hunger some of the closet with a with a belt on her neck why what's the depression where is this massive depression coming from with all of this affluence last week a guy drove self off a the Carlyle hotel\nHe was like he stole a million dollars worth of wind from some guy out in the in the Hamptons and he was about to go to court at the jail drum shop out of a window would expect to happen you're still a million dollars worth of why would you like not to go to jail I don't understand people commit crimes expect they going to get away with it\nSo anyway we're talking about more dry substance subjects like Amazon minimum wage and\nI'm not in the mood can we have fun tonight or anywhere you can have fun do I have to say Trump every three words for you to understand that I still support the president was with you people your true believers it's like the coming of madness either you're a hundred percent anti Trump all you have to be a hundred percent for Trump\nIf you have any nuance position I think somehow you're disloyal like a new witch hunt in that regard what do you think about that there's a new kind of which are you not loyal enough to Trump\nOh you're you're anti Trump you pro Trump too much Trump from how can one man suck all the oxygen out of everyone's brain how is that possible\nSay he has a rap a rap guy in ... and use it to promote his line of sneakers or whatever he sells and I'm supposed to say that was a smart move\nIt's a it's a smart move I thought that the ... the White House to be honest with you\nOne of the last thing a scientist invited to the oval office or a great classical musician what there weren't enough votes in it none of the people go to classical music what is it less than a cultural event than the White House by the way never\nNever I mean there was a an age when presidents had\n... leading intellectuals and artists in the White House what is going on here I Can't sit here and say I thought that was so smart doesn't agitate me day and I know well I get over it yeah I already have gotten over it but I'm just trying to say to you\nBe careful with your warship not healthy\nYou're not supposed to worship a president no matter who it is that's why my monologue and the first hour so bringing a win win over the has the most listeners it did I Know it it it's just like my book stop mass hysteria because it's not a cartoon cover of people with the cartoon\nPeople don't want to read history they don't want to understand the history of what they are living through they don't want to understand the context the new ones they don't want it they want black or white white or black good bad they're good they're bad where the good guys that are bad guys or you want to hear\nSo when you were a man like me who grew up thinking about everything since he was a kid looking for answers walking down the street in New York and my down and ask them questions and not wise a sky blue I don't know what I asked the moon well remembers what kids ask their fathers I always was taught to try and come up with my own answer my father wouldn't answer a question\nHe was from the old world he made me answer my question and he taught me how to think for myself\nAnd that makes me a great minority of the nation of true believers Andrew ...\nMost people in America today the true believers who hate us this is absolutely no in between\nThis is the problem that I'm trying to tell you about this is why the country's falling apart this is why we're on the verge of civil war the large middle ground has been lost in the middle grounds gone there's no middle ground in the meeting [noise]\nCan you name one country and our if that was not founded and blood and conquest\nAnd he said no I should say why single out our own country as being worse than the others that was the point I'm trying to make\nWhy have we vilified our own nation as being worse than any nation on earth ... and it's all connected to mass hysteria and group thing\nWhich I carefully\nKind of uncomfortable here in in my book stop mass hysteria and I I Want to say one thing to uh to go into the book for one minute we don't have much time and I know people are great\nAnd having me on I've written political books and they've done very well in this book I Try to bridge politics with history and and I found out that a little history goes a long way such as saying that this bartender can you name one country on earth that was not founded and blood and conquest\nAnd it's instantaneous the answer say no I really can and in doing that by learning a few things you can probably turn arguments with rational people now that's a big coffee at rational people\nWrite that down and that that guy there are some Michael asking so you engage with your audience what your caller is telling you about the deep divide between themselves your callers that they're conservative what are they telling you about that divide between themselves and their neighbors who might be ideologically opposed to them\n[laughter] you can't see here's the problem I think the battle lines are drawn\nAs a I have said before and unfortunately I see happening I years ago wrote a book or stop becoming civil war yeah now this is becoming sort of a common thing like are we having another civil war you know\nUh I think the battle lines are drawn to Mason Dixon Line is very clear people are on both sides families are divided just like before the civil war and we'll we're waiting for Fort Sumter and I think Dianne Feinstein was a living embodiment I'm a fought Sumpter with a lipstick\nI've never seen anything like a woman trying to set a nation on fire as what she did to this man\nI think my cell phone for like three hundred and ...\nIt's a big it's a big problem the history has been walked into everything white is bad everything American is bad because the radicals took over the educational system a long time ago Common Core is\nStill in most of the school systems are Trump was supposed to eliminate it on their education secretary divorced\nStill there you know there's a lot of issues that we we can go into my point in writing stop mass hysteria is to try to give people pieces of history that they couldn't use as soundbites\nTo try to get a rational discussion going in their own family with people who disagree with them that don't even know the history of the country\nYeah you know my ... I mean you're asking a big question what do they think I don't know what the opposition thinks that America is the worst place on earth and then anyone white as an evil racist how did this ... how did this happen and it's happened that we've reached the point that if a person like a Palestinian terrorists Linda saucer in my opinion of Palestinian\nThat can lead a women's march and call a Susan Collins a white supremacist because of our vote however we reached this point that any one of ... low caliber would be taken seriously by the media\nYeah no it Michael it's a great point who is speaking of hysteria and it goes to the part of the title of your book about the witch hunt let's talk about the current which on the Russia collusion probe\nIn quotes led by special counsel Robert Mueller notice is very chilling to me and the Gina as people who have worked on political campaigns engaged in campaign strategy so now mothers' day Michael is reportedly investigating Republican researcher Peter Smith\nSmith raised about a hundred thousand dollars to find Hillary Clinton's emails the wall Street Journal's reporting that Mueller is interested in Smith because he told people that he tried to recruit that he was connected to several Trump campaign officials including guys like General Michael Flynn\nSays Smith is a hundred thousand dollars from for investors on top of the fifty thousand dollars he himself put in\nTo me Michael this is chilling because this looks like motors attempt to criminalize standard old campaign strategies but even worse first protected political donations and opposition research because the wrong guy won the election I mean is this not the definition of hysteria\nLook where Mueller when first started with the Russia collusion which fell apart and I'm so you arrested people who did commit crimes unrelated to Trump and now he's going after the campaign individuals for things they did that as you say are legal buddies dropped the Russia collusion investigation right\nWhich let us not forget was his original mandate in other words there was a ball field with parameters on it\nAnd the perimeters war Russia collusion well now he's branched into anything he wants to condemning anyone he wants is now a law unto themselves and I believe it's long overdue that Trump fire Mueller frankly Mueller has greatly exceeded the mandate that he was given this is the kind of persecution that destroys the nation\nSo to answer your question of course is violating the ban civil rights mhm oh where wherever they stop it's like the guillotine who's next\nMorning wait whoops now arrest somebody on Fox News who had Donald Trump on his show too many times is that the next thing say that's collusion between the media and Donald Trump is that in our crime on the on the Robert Mueller\nYeah I'd sure seems that way Michael\nWe only have like a second term any but I really want to get to that because I think it it kept the role of the Internet in the division today and how to branch that gap\n...
