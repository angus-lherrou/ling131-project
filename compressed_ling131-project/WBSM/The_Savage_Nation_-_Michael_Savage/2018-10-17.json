five five foreigners Savage you get you on board the program a five five four hundred Savage and you're on board and have have you been paying attention to the stuff that the hurricanes okay I live in Florida so when I hear the stuff about the hurricanes and I'm being told that they're getting bigger more intense and there's more of them because of global warming\nI said what they want to sell President Trump on Leslie stall on Sunday\nI said boy I Wish somebody brief President Trump because the truth is there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is do trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet I don't care what the so called experts are telling you and when Lesley Stahl said what scientists are saying that's not true he should have said\nRoy Spencer\nPHD because Roy Spencers been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville\nHe's written in visible inevitable disaster why hurricanes cannot be blamed on global warming and global warming skepticism for busy people and he does it with facts from our own government\nAnd he's ... he's got this out inconvenient data no trend in Florida hurricane strikes\nAnd he's just updated apply to Florida major hurricane strikes that he's been doing and it and it follows hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and that includes hurricane Michael\nAnd here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of hurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does do excuse me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is downward but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not upward so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nTo lead the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so expensive points out well yeah but if you look at the history of July August September average the temperature\nWill see that since Eighteen sixty\nThis summer is only the ninth warmest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and\nOther top ten warmest Gulf here since Eighteen sixty seven occurred both or Nineteen Seventy which is both or we experienced any significant warming well but we're going to get more of these really\nMajor hurricanes are part of nature dispenser points out and he looked at lake bottom sediment in western like in the Florida Panhandle very close to where Michael made landfall and he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five hurricanes but\nFrom one thousand two thousand years ago there was a hyperactive period of intense land falls in the Florida Panhandle in other words\nThere's been time in this plan of history where there have been more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes in Florida than there are today or long before so called global warming\n\nThe way the latest hurricane experts\nClaim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes they don't show any data for that\nAnd when Roy Spencer PHD put Michael in his count of all is all us landing major hurricanes hit marketed downward trend since the thirties forties and fifties not an upper trend not an upward trend\nAnd yet they still keep trying to make you think that is Massachusetts Bay colony sixteen thirty five had a cat three or four storm with up to twenty foot storm surge\nHappened again and sixteen Seventy five you don't see those anymore\n[noise] until twenty Seventeen the United states went eleven years without a major hurricane strike according to a NASA scientist that was the one in one hundred and Seventy seven year event to not have a strike that for that long\nAnd yet we're being told that manmade global warming is increasing the number of storms and increasing the intensity and it's just not true based on the debt\nAnd yet Lesley Stahl made it seem like Trump did notice talking about she was the one the new he didn't know\nWhat do you think\nOh one more one more victory for Trump's he's getting tired of winning\nHere's the headline from kitty tablets Trump was White City council offices headed by the San Juan mayor has been raided by the FBI remember when Trump came out and pointed out there was corruption in Puerto Rico and that there were local failures to respond to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria last year\nWell during the recovery process with the feds San Juan mayor Carmen ... Cruz regularly came out slamming Trump\nAnd she would have customized T shirt against him that you were to get on TV Now our officers have been rated by the FBI\nWhat's\nThe operation was related to suspected corruption in the purchasing department San Juan mayor Carmen ...

Molina\nNeeded former director of procurement and she claimed that she was retaliated against for reporting the alleged a regular axe to local controller I have friends in Puerto Rico and when I asked him about corruption they laugh\nBecause they said of course there's corruption there's there's there's so much corruption you you would be shocked at the amount of corruption Puerto Rico's a small island and it's all who you know and there's corruption like you would not believe I said he wanted the hurricane or ... is that especially with ...\n\n... get you on the program eight five five foreigners Savage and you are in a I Want to get you the update of what's going on with these Democrats that are being caught\nLying in order to win in November I got to the latest one on that one my name's Greg nothing for Savage this is the Savage Nation\nJoined us Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred Savage eight by for four hundred seven to eight to\n...

always looking to pick a fight and to be able to do some virtue signaling of you know this is not who America is we don't support somebody who kill somebody who's a journal and yeah I understand all that but there's also the realities I mean look at who we worked with after World War two\nPeople that we knew we didn't we weren't going to the leaders of of of uh of Russia at the time and the Soviet Union that we worked with to try to get a deal done\nYou got to do what you gotta do sometimes in geopolitics is not nice sometimes you've got to thank you I appreciate ... let me get I'm Kevin

think it should be which everyone helps you the most cats [laughter] that'd be you're right that was my point is that you know ... instead of getting closer and closer to what this country was built on that all men are created equal\nWe're going farther and farther away from that into all men are we're we're going to animal farm all men are equal but some are more equal than others based on how much grievance we can claim based on how many factions of our life where I certain identity group\nIt's the exact opposite of what this country's supposed to be and yet that's what people are proud of

the veterans and me for saying it's OK to commit treason\nThe moderator said please we have to get a response running out of time so it may sound I said well we need a response because she owes us an apology now that said that it really you know you hear the word treason thrown around all the time that really is treasonous\nTreason is aiding and abetting the enemy in war time she was on this radio show when we were at war with the Taliban the libertarian guy said I should have the right to join the Columbine she said she's fine with that\nThe Democrats just in cinema so her opponent the

classical music lovers so therefore Mossad as irrelevant [noise]\nAnd that's the world we're living in so if I wake up in the morning and I play certain music it's not only classical don't get me wrong I mean I'm known for listening to jazz rock and roll you name it\nBut if I if I really can't if I don't really feel good I play classical music because it humbled me to the point where I Am was breakdown inside saying that's impossible at a human being\nLived on this Earth like Mozart and had a brain that was like that that could conceive music like that to me it's as as close as you're ever going to get to God\nAnd it goes back to the fact that there are differences between people and unfortunately for us we're living in a time where everyone thinks they're equal to everyone else because of social media that's the tragic truth\nIf you saw the kind of idiots who are on Twitter or on Facebook who comment on things they know nothing about but because they can fire off a one liner suddenly they're equal to the greatest scientist on earth in fact they're better\nAnd this is the problem with social media you could say it's very democratic and levels the playing field no the opposite is true they haven't qualified to comment at all it's like having a more on in the classroom let's say if you're a teacher and having an idiot in the back who keeps interrupting you\nAnd makes the class pay attention to him because he's got a big mouth and interrupts the teacher so no one learns anything trust me I Know what it's like to be a teacher\nI Know it's like that really gets in the classroom will disrupt the class but because of the breakdown of our society and all standards and all forms in every aspect of our lives\nNo one knows what's right or wrong anymore very few people do anyway they don't know north from South east from west truth from fall so good from bad\nAnd so therefore if you go on the social media anymore on to take a picture themselves and now they're more famous than the ... people probably know strip and more than they do Albert Einstein\nI Would say that um the stripper who's attacking Donald Trump\nIs better known today than let's say Martha Washington or something like that\nYou you you see where I'm coming from so anyway to make a long story short so I'm I'm listening to Lou Gehrig or sorry I'm listening to the Mozart and I see the article that Steven ... the guy in a wheelchair very tragic don't get me wrong I'm not mocking is disease it's very tragic disease\nBut it does not make him the genius on every subject on the planet including the kicking the Dutch today he said at his last book that\nWe just got a glimpse at that I there is no God but I don't care what he said he's one of billions of people said said something about God but why why is his statement I've gotten more than an ex guide isn't but because he was a darling of the American left media suddenly because he said there is no God now all of a sudden that's a big deal\nNow I understand that it's not I don't understand anything that's all I Want to say so I tried to tell you something about cycads\nSay go palm the moral population\nThe relationship to blue green algae and micro toxins that are found an algae and lakes and ponds and rivers and things like that and how it might produce nerve toxins that are related to a lesser things like that but it's a long topic for another day maybe I'll do it I park is you know what I'm saying\nOr come January this is a topic I could do for three days health I made to a regular house segment where I don't have the time to do it on TALK radio because you get you know you got a different format is like the way this commercial radio you got it you got to interrupt in order to support your show you need to advertisers let's be clear\nIt's a different story with a podcast you get a chance to expound in a little more depth with a little more you know insight\nIf you get that chance but anyway I'm not complaining I'm just saying so here we are in the imperfect world try to bring some shots of perfection innocent perfect world and we're talking about topics that most people are not interested in because instead immediately shifted the word immigration\nImmigration immigration immigration Honduras\nYou'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should be\nBecause as I said today what's going on in this country right now with immigration as a disaster it's a disaster that I've been writing about for twenty five years and I try to publish a book\nIf I got my doctorate in Nineteen Ninety Seventy nine eighty gold immigrants that epidemic is after had had six books published already and my co author was the dean of the school of public health\nBrilliant man and nobody in New York would touch the book for political reasons that was then you understand how how much worse it's gotten here today it's gotten worse here today than it was then\nIt's a miracle that I'm Still on the radio but I won't be here in January on some major stations even though my writings for higher than anyone else on the station because of political reasons only make no mistake about it joined the Savage Nation cold\nFeet by ... four hundred service\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit west you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHas to understand that no first rate nation from taking all of the world's poor it's impossible\nNow that's what the communist would like you to believe that we should all share everything I Would say start with Bernie Sanders million dollars last year let 'em give it away then I Believe in what he says\nThat they Bernie Sanders gives away the money is making on his communism now believe award any of them say but again okay so what's this rare polio like illness where's that coming from a FM you have to dig very hard to get any answers on this at all\nBecause it's very serious it can lead to paralysis in death and children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota now says six children contracted a a ... which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating this increase in a FM which begins twenty forty but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC I'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know\nWhat kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean paid for if you don't get out of there what you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses so every every article says the causes of FM are still unclear it's unclear when they'll do anything\nBut it's thought that they may be a communicable disease really wild as one link oh it may be a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses that are viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM river West Nile virus come from the west Nile it doesn't say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from or where you could pretty much see where I'm going with this right\nWell you understand what what I'd like to see which is close the borders to health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came your great grandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading into the healthy population but those are antiquated ideas\nYou can quarantine anyone no matter what the season they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\n[noise] and so the healthy population is an increased risk of diseases like this from\nThese third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you don't let a disease person in your country economic sense if you have a house or apartment we let some of the a communicable disease and your partner unless you're a mall on San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably sleep with a person with a communicable disease to show it a good life just they were that embrace them in a kiss them on the lips the show a good good people they are that's how sick they are\nBut if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying the you there's a relationship\nBetween some immigrants from some countries have some diseases and if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union member I told you I ran into a woman last week and then just walking around them all such from Hungary is shocking when she said this to me she said I come from the ex Soviet Union and she said\nPeople are more afraid to express themselves politically in America than they were in my country under the Soviet under Soviet rule I was stunned by him you're more afraid to express yourself at home or at work than the Soviets were under under under Stalin\nAnd I put that on the radio two weeks ago and I woke up and there was an article just the other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because of the insane communist left\nThey're afraid to say one word at work for a few there'll be fired\nYou're afraid to say anything about anything so you're now a prisoner\nIn more fear than the Soviet era in America today\nYeah okay well what can you do it's just one man one man against the world shoveling Snow White against the tide\nIs very very difficult odds here I write the book stop mass hysteria Americans Sally from Salem witch trials and the Trump which on its it's doing well but not great if not doing as good as the comic books and the comic books\nNot as good as the comic books on the left in the comic books on the right people one simple books and simple ideas they don't want to read they don't want to think they don't want history all they want a polemic ...\nI'm not complaining it's the marketplace let the market\nThe tournament there's nothing I can do about it\nI tried something new I went from politics to a history people were not really ... writing I don't know where the books going to be on the list if it's even on the list after week one I don't know whether you bought the book he doesn't buy the book all I Know is that went to my local bookstore Barnes and noble they said they sold it out\nSo whether that'll indicate the country is ready to read something serious instead of a comic book or a comic book I don't know\nBut unless you have a television show on Fox News in particular\nAnd or you are lauded by the mainstream media as a genius and you have no television and radio show but you out every show in the country books have a very very very hard chance to ever get into the public eye\nThose are the odds that like I Love it
