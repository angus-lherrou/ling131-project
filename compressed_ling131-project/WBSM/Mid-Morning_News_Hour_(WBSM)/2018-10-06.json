all of the employees what will that do that will retain the employees\nIt will also attract new employees that might be working at a place that doesn't offer anything\nSo I think this is a great idea\nA maps so multiple employer plans also represent a way for the private sector to do to better address the needs of working Americans\nAnd investment company or bank or insurance company could develop an offer a map that unrelated employers could adopt to cover their employees [noise]\nThe financial institution could take care of all of the administrative steps that often create significant hurdles that may sob small employers from adopting retirement plans among them other plans design investment options and administrative paperwork\nSo a few years ago I got a phone call from a corporation [noise] I'm\nA a it was a excavating in cement pouring company\nOr the owners were Portuguese most of the employees were Portuguese and the owners had set up a four one K. with someone else and unfortunately um it wasn't being used\nTo the extent that it could have been meeting the employees were not they didn't fully understand that they weren't fully participating\nAnd so somehow the foreman got a hold of me not the owner one of the form it's got a hold of me um I guess either a brother and his brother in law was my client already they've got to talking\nHe called me up a and he said listen I like when I Am going to talk to the owner like you once I talk to him and he's going to agree or I'd like you to come down and talk to the owners and see if we can use this plan to its advantage\nSo we subsequently made an appointment I don't normally do house calls anymore I don't go out to the office but in this case I did because of the situation that it was [noise]\nSo I sat down with the owner the wife and the sun\nOr the owners still would go out to the job sites the wife was in and out of the office she did a few things but not a lot or in the sun pretty much was supposed to run the office\nAnd all the other employees that are out on the job sites so they transferred the plan to me so now I became the they broke world record as it's called the advisor on the account and\nI made in ... I made a subsequent appointment to go and speak to all of the employees and because they were Portuguese in my native language there's also I was able to convey the information\nThat why this plan would be good for them um what they could\nSee in the future potentially cause I Can't guarantee anything [noise] um and they started participating more they started increasing their percentage that they were putting in now there's there was some forms that are very very important to put the IRS which need to be in on time\nAnd correct\nThe person in charge of that was the owner's son and unfortunately he was a little ... days ago yeah\nSo the company started getting letters from the IRS for fees for penalties for interest on past fees and penalties and so on and the owner got a little bad taste in his mouth about all of these extra fees along with already paying the fee to establish the planned to maintain the plan and so on\nAnd clearly that this was not a favorite child anymore after that\nI don't know they uh they ended up closing the plant unfortunately they gave the employees the choice which they have a right to\nUm because of the planets terminating you can't keep the money in their right so there's only four things you can do\nIf you are going to leave the company and go to work for somewhere else you can roll over your current plan to the new companies plan if the new company has a plan\nIf the if the plan was not being terminated but the employee decided to stop making contributions or left the company they can still get the money there if they wanted to but that wasn't the case with this case they\nCould roll over the the monies to a personal IRA\nWhich a couple of them did that came to my office I took care of the paperwork we did the roll over no tax issues there because they don't pay taxes on a roll over\nYou'll get a tonight in the next year but it's only for paper tracking a paper trail I or what some of them did unfortunately and that's not a good call and I tried to tell them not to was they took the money\nThey pay the taxes when they filed while they took it holdings but then they it it it gets added to the income uh took a pay the taxes because most of them the ones that the money we're under fifty nine and a half they pay the ten percent penalty\nAnd they take the money and do whatever they want with it\nIf there were this type of a situation a map prior to this particular corporation could have potentially a associated with others in the area\nAnd may be handed off the\nThe paperwork for the rest of somebody else who would have stayed more on top of the ... and maybe maintain the\nPlant so pool the resources to get ... correct correct and\nAll the small employer would need to do is gather employees savings through

listening to fourteen twenty W. B. S. N. with financial expert Jose my test and if you have any financial questions whatsoever not just on what we're talking about which is of recent I executive order signed by Trump\nWhen in terms of retirement accounts it's a five to eight nine nine six zero five hundred that's five and eight nine nine six zero five hundred to sell that continue\nSo along with creating potentially the maps 'cause this hasn't been done yet hey along with that Trump's executive order contained to other initiatives\nNumber one restructuring and potentially postponing the IRS required minimum distribution rules\nThese rules require minimum amounts to be withdrawn from traditional IRAs four one K. is for all three bees for fifty seven ... simple IRAs SEP IRA is\nAnd whatever other savings you have\nThe next step would be to encourage employers to offer options in their retirement savings plans to convert account balances into ... to reliable retirement income\nThis task is beyond the skills of most workers and employers can provide tremendous value by offering a check the box limited menu of retirement income options\nIf you don't have a pension today through your employer and you have a four one K. or you have savings or you have ... you can still make your own pension\nSomething that I don't often recommend but it's again it's doable it's it's there it's off ripple is by taking some of your money's your four one K. money saving money\nGiving it to a company and having it turned into an immediate annuity that something we've talked about before that I don't I'm not a big proponent of but it is available and it will turn that amount that you're getting into a guaranteed lifetime income\nOr periods certain income or amount certain income\nIf it's lifetime you're never going to exhausted\nIf it's amounts certain or periods certain if it's Twenty years and you live thirty at Twenty years your money was done but again you know putting all your money in there you're putting some of it in there just to guarantee that income\nIt's like on the store correct correct\nI'm quite a few years ago I established I had a couple of 'em and I established a it was an idea but it was called the bucket system\nOkay they retired they rolled over their monies to me and I took a chunk of their money and I turned it into an ... and ... and again it's it's kind of based on the conversations that I'll have all the client and how I read people and\nWhat I set up a five year increment plan so I set up the first five years they would get X amount of dollars out of their plan guaranteed so it was an amount it was a ... there was a period in the next five you bucket\nWas put in with a cost of living adjustment so meaning they were going to get more\nAnd the first five years but it grew by the five years that they didn't touch it because they were collecting the first book it's worth the money so when that first bucket was exhausted five years later they gotta pay raise guaranteed for the next five years\nAnd I set up a third and fourth bucket the third bucket was for the next five years so it's been growing for ten years at the eleven year the second bucket it's now exhausted the third bucket starts paying the amount of money ... an amount of money again with the pay increase\nAnd it pays off for the next five years the fourth bucket is monies that's still in the market because these other kinds of guaranteed is still in the market\nThat they shouldn't worry about whatever the market's going to do because it was Fifteen Years worth of time frame that they were getting that guaranteed income coming out to them the fourth bucket and not only should they not worry about it is still available to them if they need to tap in for\nAnything extra by a car going on vacation or doing home improvements whatever it might be\nThere in there\nThey're probably about a year away from ending their second bucket so we still have another one to go for the next five years plus whatever monies were put into the fourth one okay\nThe basement system mhm Congress has been considering the retirement enhancement and savings act of two thousand and Eighteen which would both unable\nMaps multiple employer plans as well as encourage for all and K plan sponsors to offer lifetime annuities in their retirement programs again this legislation is a big step in the right direction but it could go further by allowing employers to also offer\nEvery time an income menu that includes both investing and a new with the retirement income programs step one the president's executive order is encouraging\nBut voters need to continue encouraging Congress to tackle the toughest issues so that all workers can retire with financial security and dignity ...\nOne of the reasons that I think this is important um\nIt it's good for for for everyone for the you know for the for the working class for for every one guy [noise]\nBut the other reason is it's a little selfish on the government's part because they want to alleviate or they want to put more of the burden of your own retirement onto your own shoulders\nBecause again there are a lot of people that are collecting Social Security both in retirement and disability you're disabled disabled I get it okay um you can start collecting Social Security as early as sixty two\nThen you have your full retirement age full retirement age has increased from what it used to be at sixty five to sixty six starting in Nineteen fifty\nFour I think it is and then for every year until Nineteen sixty four\nIt increases by two months so sixty six and two sixty six and four to six uh six and six until Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen sixty four your full retirement age of sixty seven and they might increase that again\nAnd on that now we're going to take a short commercial right but if you have any questions again about retirement plans about any financial situation as much as I recall is five to eight
