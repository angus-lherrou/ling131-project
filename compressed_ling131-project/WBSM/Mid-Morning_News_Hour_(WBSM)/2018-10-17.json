it's a little bit chilly and as you just started Debbie or maybe see six weather center forecast that we might see a shower later I'm just going to be breezy too so bundle up later if you had to go somewhere tonight\nUm that would then said that the well the executive could look at the city councilman and say well you know what I don't like the way you voted on this issue so I'm going to remove you so you know you can't cross those lines\nYeah exactly where you are absolutely a correct and that's why me I'll be honest with you if I thought this provision that the council was trying to use gave the city council that type of power and authority I never would have supported the imam or I was only one of nine votes but I I gotta believe my colleagues I Am a\nCharter commission would've said we cannot give\nThe city council that kind of pollen and you won't see that language ... chowder in Massachusetts oh you won't stay than any charter and the United states that I that I'm aware of I mean I I got to tell you a moot when we went to ... liberating the content of this home all try to I can tell you we never anticipated and you\nKnow the sad events that have occurred over this past week what our mayor I mean how could you um we didn't know and I'm so again we did this you know when we created this charter we looked at a lot of shots of Massachusetts ... a lot of travelers around the states and um\nMade it such that the council would not have that type of power\nThe other question that I have is about conflict of interest now cliff Ponte um who's on the program earlier this week is the city council president\nAnd he would become acting mayor ... be removed resigned from office and or is it a conflict of interest for him to vote on this he made his position clear last night that he was calling on the mayor to step aside he vote since he has a direct stake in this\nI I Would argue that again very that this doesn't even apply there should be no vote right you're right it it wouldn't be a conflict but then it would be a conflict up and down the city council because it would impact as\nThe vice president and then every single member on the body so that's why this is not a political this should never come to a vote it's not it's simply if you read that had a temporary absence of the mayor and we say by reason of sickness or the cause and this is why we wrote this provision in the event that the mayor\nUm you know had some tragic accident car accident stroke whatever that they was the ability for a limited time to keep the government running not\nTo remove a mayor on you know and like they were debating last night about paying and how that would be compensation well we never considered any of that that wouldn't even be part of this because this clearly does not apply\nI'm not I'm not a lawyer but I have to believe that they\nDo take this action and it goes to court I think the mayor and the city will prevail against the city council\nAnd the other thing that I find troubling to Mike is the fact that um you know I'm sitting there last night looking at the the makeup of the city council and I'm thinking to myself some at least six members of that city council either hadn't been more have talked about being the\nCandidate for mayor this would be perceived as tremendously political I even if they had the authority to do that right\nYeah and and there's another\nThe side of that um there's some personal things that I have gone along over the years too and and and I know it's hard to separate that sometimes when you have to take these votes I mean I think it's politically charged in Fall River right now I think Steve ... it was sort of a ... a voice of reason and saying\nYou know we thought to make this decision right away it's only been what five days or whatever uh since this was all ... come down\nA let's look at this rationally let's let's get all the information\nUm but again in my my humble opinion and they are not authorized they don't have the authority to use this provision on a chat or it's a lot of ... in any shape or form and it's going to end up costing the city\nA more chaos because you're going to have to manage walking him and the next day so if next Tuesday they go through this vote that they they can't do but if they do\nWho's the mayor is is is uh the council president style the acting mayor and the male walks when are we going to have a vis a vis the cops on the explorer and what happens who who who's in charge at that point in time so\nI Hope that maybe this time between now and the next city council a this can be some good conversation at the the things that I guess I'm I think it would be ill advised to go down this road\nYou know and I have to wonder to a given all the chaos of the city for the wind through as a result of the last three call just four years ago and then to see\n'em a lot of what's happening here to be a direct result of some of that I I Wonder is it really worth going there again since next year's election year anyway beat what three months before you can even have the\nElection and everything else in in in next year's election year I'm In a in a friend of mine from the private instead of a media pool last night reminded me that when buddy see anti the mayor of Providence former mayor of Providence who's now passed away when he was indicted he remained on the job right up until the day he was convicted\nRight in the city Providence hum right along indeed there was no big disruption because he was trying to play in the defense and it'd be the same time the lawyers play in the defense\nYeah yeah I mean like liberalism I Believe in the uh you know innocent until proven guilty that the burden of proof is on the one that brings the charges on a who denies them all however that being said\nYou know I I think the you know the city of four is distressed I'm given what's going on but to your earlier point about having a recall you\nYou are right there is a timing issue by the time this\nProcess goes through we're ... we're probably in early spring of next year we're going to attack the new mayor\nYou know likely and then that new mail they already campaigning for the November election so how effective is that person going to pay a but again I you know the people vote the mayor an or vote our elected officials and and if they feel strongly enough that this man is compromised and\nIs not going to be able to perform the essential functions of his job and they have every right to charter to uh have a recall of that elected official\nLet me it just might before I let you go Mike my with my my using who I form a city council to Fall River also an expert on the seas charter he was a the a charter review commission chairman or some changes were actually made to the Chinese are on the ballot nine to citizens\nUm the ... they they ... a charter had not been reviewed for a number of years I have to be perfectly honest with you I don't know the last time the New Bedford try and it was reviewed\nUm how beneficial watching how important wants to go back and look at that try to get an understanding of what it said in proposing changes\nWhen you let me tell you this parents shot it was eighty four years old so\nIn eighty four here's a lot has changed in government state law special lax and such so that was the one issue and I will tell you mine for years on the city council we never wants to talk about the shot or it was a a um a document that was not reference a was basically dead or\nResurrected at a I I I understand that that's you know I'm the I'm\nThe legal document that guy's city and needed to be updated it needed to be read are easy to read easy to understand it needed to be format and\nUh so that people could use a and I'm very proud of the data that we frame to Fort river of hormonal shot um there was two ways you could do this you can do it through special election or a special uh an act that would\nGo up through the state\nBut the folks would be appointed to the ... commission\nAnd then the way I went various you know as I went out and collected the twelve thousand signatures and we did it through a lack of\nA process because I Want to people I feel this charter is the people's charter they had a voice in this and we we received feedback from the community thing on a different provisions are so that their fingerprints are on on this charter a pass by I think it was like sixty five percent of the bowl um but it was it was very beneficial and and\nYou know I I served in the city council I didn't know much about our city charter a I certainly know a lot\nMore now I think we put some very good provisions\nIn here uh it's easier to read these you understand there's a lot of financial information are all shot it was silent on some of the financial things like capital improvement plans a order and those type things or this isn't a document I think that will serve the city of Fort river for the next forty fifty sixty years so\nYou would advise any community really to go back and review that charter periodically and then see what it says in there and then make updates\nAbsolutely we put up a vision and that was the other thing that we never looked at our shot for eighty four years so there's a provision in this chatter to look at it every uh every ten years so there'll be a formal process will will be looking at the China we may not need to make any changes\nAnd then again we may need to make changes but at least somebody in the community and it's it's a it's both elected officials in in ... and people from the community will put their eyes on the charter a and reviewing every ten years and make changes if necessary\nMike my always appreciate your time today great to talk to you again very very good thank you and go Red Sox All right there you go yeah did he got to get home in time for the big grand slam last night yeah we missed the soda and replaced so we got it on the radio on the way back so [laughter] actually thanks very thick hair All right Mike my it was a former\nFall River city councilor and he was the chairman of the try to review commission charter hadn't been touched in eighty four years and I don't know when the last time then you got for trying to wish review did now maybe that's something we ought to think about\nUm here in the city New Bedford them take a look at it from time to time let me take a very quick braking calls so our next five awaiting a nice six o five hundred we'll be right back to that\n...\nWhen it comes to finding a trustworthy company for roofing signing and windows so many of my close personal friends recommend Bluey ... of el ... offers a zero percent down there and one hundred percent

I guess it doesn't really all over the and the fact that what the us attorney is alleging has said he took some of the invest their money and use that to run\nFor office in and help to fund his campaign other than that I see no no connection either\nOkay yeah it was it was money that was a ... according to the diamond who was money that was given to him by investors or they weren't expecting in return on that to investment at some point down the road they never did they never got it they never got their money back or whatever\nAnd um this thing uh you know apparently didn't take off quite the way that it was supposed to take off a\nAnd so they want their money back so the U.S attorney says well she took the money that they invested in ... he spent it on all kinds of stuff for himself and then you some of it to run for office the but but in terms of ah you know ... money from the city treasury or whatever there's no allegations that whatsoever\nI mean I think if he if he had gone into the cities money and done something like that then there's no doubt that you know he crossed that line but if if somebody put their money behind you because you're right there and you miss manners that money that's up to them personally to go after you\nIn a civil action yeah and in in a court action or something I mean how many\nPeople lost their shirt and two thousand eight that that nobody you know that was invested into the you know the real a stock market and things and and nobody got behind anybody to help them get\nTheir money in the real estate market exactly and then you have people like Elizabeth Warren that were you know when these people got into trouble because they borrow more money than they can afford it in real estate markets ruined bought their ah for pennies on the dollar shoe and bought the mortgages admitting flipped him and made a fortune on it [laughter] yeah\nYeah yeah I got caught up in that I didn't get caught up in it but I was offered a crazy loans back then I'm In a refinance where there was no way I could afford it or or what ever put myself in that much that but they were willing to give me that money you know all those bad loans\nYeah you know any ... and they'll dangle in front of me that's why that's why you're going to twenty thousand dollars in credit card debt and they're still sending you knew credit cards in the mail Ryan ...\nCredit cards I just I don't know how how that gets approved and allowed is another thing you know I mean how they can get away with charging the average consumer Eighteen to twenty five percent and and the federal government doesn't step in to do anything about that that's that's robbery\nLess predatory lending and that's that is against the law and I'll tell you what\nKids right twenty two and twenty six so as soon as they turn Eighteen I started getting credit cards are in the mail they never even saw them\nBecause they would go from my mailbox to my hands into the garbage can [laughter] you know what I mean ... all of the male coming in the house went through this guy yeah and so I made sure because when you're Eighteen Nineteen years old Twenty years old hand look I'll sing yeah it's very tempting right a lot of people getting a credit card debt that way\nYeah and they both learn to respect your credit rating and and and not not spend beyond their means so um you know I appreciate the fact that that happened to them but\nSure no I mean I'm you know people getting your credit card trouble they get into mortgage trouble if it sounds too good to be true of course it's going to be too good to be true route offerings\nSeniors in high school that credit applications\nYeah and I'm sure they do yeah yeah I get\nThem they have bank go into the schools and talk to people\nIn the runoff it's kinda crazy like you know they make it such that you have to have some kind of credit in order to do any I mean you can't you can't get an airline ticket you can't you can't go to the counter in a in a ... ticket with cash yeah you're going to put it on a credit card right that's true\nBut I think that I mean today where there's a lot more debit cards to which are accepted to some\nIn some cases they are but I mean you can't go and buy furniture say you need furniture said just get married you goodbye bedrooms and you've got to find the answer to whatever you can't finance without credit right so in order to do that in order to establish credit people tend to go out and they'll they'll make credit somewhere with a credit card or whatever because that's the best way to establish regret it\nAnd uh you know a lot of people next thing you know it's because you don't you don't have to pay and right away and said you know you don't see the bills for a while so they'll go out and they'll say well you know what we need a guy living room set to let's put it on the credit card when it comes in will will pay it off and and I just don't get me wrong\nI mean I think the best thing to do with that is the secured credit cards where you you know as a a financial limit on it and it's usually put into an account type thing that's that's the best way to get kids to start out with their credit\nCard in the front and let me hold you right there if I go in and I think so by hundred euro mixed the w._b. us and\nThanks for having a good afternoon Derek hey how are ya I'm very well thank you how about yourself I'm great thanks well\nUm I had said to you yesterday in regard to a man Korea um I you know you're ... you're innocent until proven guilty and that's just how I feel about this young man um\nI really feel this is my opinion only that it's a political a thing that they've done to this man that turn out\nThey want 'em out words is is that that's what I think ... somebody there on that a city council on that job real bad oh yeah [laughter] I Lived in fall\nRiver for a while and I uh oh it's totally different than if they ah you know they don't have ... over there you know ...\nEverything's a large yeah everything is that they didn't want to point have worn counselors and they did away with it oh did they yeah and in part of the charter review\nA was to uh at some point there's going to be on the ballot question asking folks whether they want to reestablish at large counsellors um I think that large counselors good personally um but they didn't have them at one point they did away with them\nOh but you know what they are and if you if you want\nSomething like if you're better off working with the war kind of like a sure know what's going on\nWell that's the first line of defense if you've got a problem or they're they're yeah they're right in your neighborhood and they can tell me a\nLaunch not my the one I usually talk with there's a couple of them they're very very good\nAnd a ... you know whether it's the water on the ... lodge a lot of them do a good job some of them together but hey what are you going to go down to
