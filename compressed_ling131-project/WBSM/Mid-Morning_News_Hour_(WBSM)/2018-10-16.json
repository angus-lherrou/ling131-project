you heard live here in WBFO Sam\nHis addiction status I thought that might have been the subject of a you know we might have explained look we ah had a dispute with somebody and I was kicked out\nOr a he took them questions right took no questions by myself or anybody else and I just never before Seinfeld have I seen a show about nothing it was about nothing very\nWell I'm not sure I'd agree with you there I mean he had to he made he had to if he's going to stay in and I wrote a blog yesterday saying that he should resign but if he's going to make the case that he's going to stay and he had to show I'm south is being strong and in charge of things and I think he did a good job of that\nUm and I think he made the point I think you made a very solid point this was this was a shot across the bow of the council telling the council tonight when you when you take this issue up I'm\nLet this be voted the people who are not at the council\nAlright I'll agree with you on that this was an opportunity for jays will Korea to show that there is a little bit of doubt no matter how big a red herring\nThis uh apps status is there is a little shred of down in the U.S attorneys of investigation look when the U.S attorney was a common thing or the FBI direct or a ... in charge of the investigation the agent Hank Shaw was commenting\nOr about the apps status he made it a slight misstep saying that this was a prototype and it was a never made it to fold development\nAh we get it was false you don't have to spend an hour yes that was a false statement\nAh so yeah there was a I I Believe it\nWas not learn to make the case of the money that was given to him was was actually used wisely now I don't know what that's where he's going to going quarter\nWhether whether ... whether the ... made it to full development or whether it didn't that still lingering question um the Soviets\nHad I had the up I grew up on my\nPhone I Know that I'm saying to you whether it did or did it in to the U.S attorney's office doesn't matter they still have that question\nWell because they may try to make the case that the investing money washing squandered it was actually spent on developing this out and bring it up to a\nStill a question of amended tax returns while he was a mayor\nWell you know I'm with you on on All right I think none of this really matters in oil rights I think what really matters at this point is he's trying to stay in power\nTo finish my thought this was an opportunity for him to show the council there there may be a shred of belt and hopefully give them some pause before taking whatever vote they may take tonight ... uh to show that uh maybe there is something to mayor Korea's defense here\nYou know and maybe the the FBI and the U.S attorney have taken some missteps we should let this play out\nSee I said this is very Reagan ask him that he in rather than a Reagan without often times and you ran into a problem with the Congress and he thought he was going to get his asking you to him\nIf you can go to the people you can go on TV and he said hey folks call your congressman telling that so I I get a sense of what he was trying to do here which played at the bigger question here of whether or not he should be the council that takes him out or whether the people take them out and I think he's trying to get um\nI I think he's trying to elevated to that level I think he's trying to say hey look I'm In charge here this has nothing to do a city finances or anything to do it my job is happened when I was twenty\nI did have to do with this job the tax returns were amended in two thousand Seventeen while he was mayor right there may have been criminal activity\nBy jays will Korea while he was in a little going to be sorted out in the court correct but it's incorrect for him to state and it's incorrect for anyone to state\nThat day he did nothing wrong when he was mayor of course he so we don't know why it All right exactly yeah I'm gonna finish my statement or we don't know if he did anything wrong at all everybody's innocent until proven guilty in this country or something that I wholeheartedly agree with and and\nUh as has come under fire recently and many different events but to say that there are no allegations of wrongdoing while he was an office as mayor is is completely false\nWell there's all kinds of allegations but I I'm looking the way that I'm hearing the press conference today was the number one say look I'm staying put I'm not going anywhere unless I'm removed if I removed\nI think prior to today's press conference it was very good chance to cost would vote seven votes than I to remove him from office I think maybe that's ratcheted down just a little bit now\nI'm not to say that it's not going to happen and may still happen tonight but I think he's brought that down a little bit and now he's able to to cast some doubt in the minds of some of the counselors as to whether they should be the ones to remove him from office or whether the public who bought a nearby sixty four percent in November ... at\nThe same council that put it to the people are the with the exception of some counselors that have since been newly elected a to have will lead again recalled over allegations that he threatened Jay's local radio with a gun guns now\nAre just so many men on your average now know no matter ... ... exactly ... and\nThe kind of know including Leo pelletier who has his own problems with though with with a lot [laughter] there's a lot especially to yeah to some degree [laughter]\n\nWas owed a definitely a a to me and to many other reporters that I was talking with afterwards a very bizarre\nOur\nWith nothing answered that we went in there asking except for the fact is he going to resign\n... which is not yeah\nSo did you get any sense where any members of the council there that you knew him [noise]\nI'm I'm not familiar with the faces on the river city council um as as you are a coming from a Fall River area but ah ah not that I was aware of\nRight did any any bugs in the room about whether or not they the but would still happen tonight or a ...\nI didn't hear one way or the other but it seems to me everything's still on schedule\nYeah see I get my sense but just my total evaluation I was watching it from a different vantage point is that near where I was watching it on a computer screen at my desk or with a few other folks from the station and and what I walked away from that where was he\nLooked to raise a first of all he wanted to state uh that I'm here I'm In charge I can handle all of this stuff I can handle the investigation that can handle the job at the same time\nI'm detractors gives me a wrong\nAnd here's a little bit of why and he was looking to raise enough doubt in the council's mind in order to survive beyond tonight I think I think all of this was about tonight I think he was trying to survive tonight and then he threw it surely and and and the and the laughs at the council and saying look you you really should not\nUm you know oh overdo the the\nThe the will of the people in in in November I mean he ... he made a very prominent opponent back in November while he was under federal investigation or by considerable number of votes so I think what he was saying is what I Want a huge election year you guys should not\nOn do adjust election let the public decided that's going to be the case so that that's kind of what I that was the strategy I saw today I\nI understand you know he's he's keeping his is feed going one step at a time and looking to the rest of the day and tomorrow all at one time he needs a job uh\nHe needs a job but he also I'm sure would like to stay a free man ... uh which is I think if any of us were in that position we that would be a top priority right um\nUh again of course men who was elected a mayor at twenty three years old a there's a lot of pride there and rightly deserved\nIt you're innocent as a lot of pride there anyway\nSure absolutely um\nIt again\nThere's no app ... right now and that's the primary focus or one of the primary focus of this investigation uh it it seems to me that today's points were moved\nOnly they only served as whether or not he'll keep his job tonight or for the council or has nothing to do with the investigation or or\nIt was just trying to cast some doubt that's all\nRight I'll grab a coffee cyber waiting on a six or five hundred a year I'm here with the other Cormier and a very rich or Taylor just back from the press conference go ahead you're on the air\n... thanks for ah getting over there today Thanks for staying in the room I Hope no one asked you to leave because you're a man\nThank God [laughter] and he thinks that Wright was\nYou know that was a terrible thing that I'm On this or Hispanic check or who used to be envious them once a week with Barry\nLet's move on line and let's see what see what you got for an issue\n... about my issue you know and when when Taylor says are oh let me finish my statement over and over and over there must be a problem and I suggest Taylor this expression or excuse me for talking while you're interrupting me that's that's very disarm\nSyria I'm Wondering if you don't get to the point should get you get you're going to get the gong to remember the gong show\nWhere is it for here's the point okay ah you know this guy or\nThe mayor of Fall River here is comes at a good time because we all know that this thinking people who indicted him with the IRS is a fish it stinks from the head down Lois Lerner this Jewish chick or went to ... high school and Bloomfield, Connecticut she was a warrior\nAnd you'll be calm the mascot of your high school and your college she's a warrior and she she ah right Roy conservative\nCan you can you ... back to what we're talking about very so I'm going to give you one more shot walking back to what we're talking about are going to have to say goodbye\nOr let's talk about the the the women that are coming out to\nUh to the U.S attorney out or you know lay out the the case against him so he's got some serious stuff that he's got to defend against but again in this country are innocent until proven guilty is not the other way around they're going to make their case in court\nAnd that he will respond to his ... to the to the allegations but that'll take place a year from now in court\nFor the moment he's looking to survive and and not\nA you know hang onto his position as mayor and he feels that it is a the most fair thing is to let the public to sign a special election rather than seven members of the city council\nIf he walks on these charges he's alleging\nWell we'll see how that works out here to do you think well hold on do you think you should stay in office\nThat we lost ... five hundred your next the w._b. is I'm going after\nThem hey you're on the air\nYou're next on WB assembled afternoon yeah you know there are my there are\nYou there at night in a world there were all we're all go together\n[laughter] yeah take a hike seven people don't deserve the right to judge this one\nI think you're right there I feel about it I think you're absolutely right\nInnocent until proven guilty yeah and that's the end the story with me thank you very much\nAppreciate it dirty dab on Rochester fiber way not now six o five hundred let me take a break and that will come back what do you think is going to happen\nOr do you think the council's I I you know look I Know that most of the bus around here don't know a lot about Fall River politics really out cure all that much but uh this is one of the largest cities in the state and there has been a federal indictment handed down against the mayor they're Thirteen count indictment of a on corruption charges\nAnd uh he's saying look I'm you know there's all kinds of holes is more holes in the story here than Swiss cheese ah he's saying but\nWe'll we'll figure that out in court here just ...\nOther examples to show you that there are there there are holes in the story well all the evidence will come out in court and we'll find out in court whether or not he's guilty or innocent but what he's saying all through his press conference today basically to the city council is if I'm going to be removed\nIt should not be you should not be sending politicians to decide what's gonna happen here should be up to the public let's have a special election if I'm going to be removed let the people decide and not the city council and I think this was kind of a last ditch effort to save his job today\nI'll buy appealing directly to the people and putting the council I noticed that they really should not be the ones to determine his fate that it should be after the people what do you think is he right\nShould this be left to the council none of us know whether or not he's guilty or innocent we won't know that until the evidence is presented we know there was a strong case presented against him we know he came back with some type of the defense today you're not going to see how that defense until it goes to court but if you are\nOn the city council tonight to stop and think well maybe he's got a point here maybe the public should decide this in the city council quick break we'll be right back because on WB is\nBeing
