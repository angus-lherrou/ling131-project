but I just think it's very hard to justify you know not taking action um and to behavior that is just inherently dangerous um those that's you know ... that's a state to state highways intersecting right there it's not safe well\nThose locations are places where pedestrians are forbidden to be anyway you're not supposed to be on the other thing\nIs [noise] well ... right right so the mediums there are actually not for people to stand on they are for people who they are to separate the\nTrend of crossing you're not supposed to be on those things well their ... their cross walks in some of those are so there there there are there any cross rocket but you're not supposed to walk on the media and you go through the crosswalk certainly within ... yeah yeah so I mean that anybody who's complaining that that this is a dangerous for for people to walk on you're not supposed to be walking on it anyway\nThat's right and that's the whole purpose putting the ah that is a medieval what were they medieval or [laughter]\nSomething like that and I've still got that letter some way I I take it out when I needed to laugh at us [laughter] but um [laughter] so so uh this is the second location in now where we're seeing that happen and that's a radical wrote in front of I I think it was describing the front of willow tree is that a\n... ... yeah I Know the intersection of a orchard in Rockville and coal road okay right there and look you know there's there have been people who've been out there and um when I say is anybody is if you see somebody who is you know out at begging for\nFor money um you know ordinarily a few months when you do that I mean not what we want to help people most people want to help you know they're you know fellow man or woman I'm On a lot of times\nYou know by giving them the dollar you know that that's just going to something that will promote the habitat got them and the first and in that position in the first place so\nI'm a you know you can tell them look\nGo to the sister owes house on division street or you know go to city hall or the second floor city hall and and see community services\nGo to um you know any\nNumber of others go to pack I go there and there are there were a service providers out there who who do a really good job and help people in need and we want to make sure that they get plugged into those and into those places\nI hold my breath every time I go down that route Eighteen I'm heading north down when you get to the bottom a union state and there's a guy that's there and he just is like all over the place all the time and you just wonder when it's going to happen and he's going to lean right into traffic that's going to ban the police\nHave been out there to talk to him and his look I mean we don't [laughter]\n... prefer not to be putting you know twenty you know medieval cobble stones or whatever you want to call them but uh yeah I mean they've tended to to him and tried to tell dissuade him from from doing I mean it's it is it's I mean it's obviously dangerous and um\nYou know it's a we're well so we're going to keep at that I think we've made a lot of progress you don't see see that behavior and the octopus anymore that was probably\nThe you know there's a place where the activity was most intense um and you know is there a few other places that I think we need to address but you know a lot of it's a lot of what we're talking though about there is as the result of the opioid problem the opioid problem coupled with\nUm some decisions by both the Supreme Court as well as other federal courts that make it very difficult legally for cities to intervene in that kind of conduct to pass ordinances or to take other legal action to stem\nI'm a panhandling so you know so we do what we can ah with the with the rules in place and uh all with the mind toward public safety\n... market basket it's still the problems by two yeah so there's still it's not as bad as it used to be but still yeah you're right I mean there are people yelling at each other over there\nLiterally chasing each other off of the median strip and I go I go by there every day to come to why do you do to engage in the chase and you know it's interesting I I couldn't go up which straight but I Choose to go by there because I Want to see the the Daily Show and there are literally chase each other out there now and I thought I was the first thing out of the police\nHave been there as well yeah so yeah I mean is this are going to continue to to uh to work on on the problem you know so everybody safer\nAll right um what else what else what else public safety center or the new public safety center going down the south and wear a same time we talked about that a couple of weeks ago yeah you may in fact you mentioned here first it was a that it was going to be built there yeah the accounts I guess voted last week you know that they want a traffic study a problem with that day [noise]\nNo I I don't you know we could I don't know if it's necessary but we'll hope to take a look at that certainly you know traffic circulation around there is going to be important but you know it's not\nYou know there is station eleven is just a\nYou know three or four blocks down the street as it is so emerging fire engines from you know from the new place will and not have that materially different effect on on traffic in that area so I don't want to spend money on a study if it's not necessary it may be necessary I'll take a look at it it's not not a crazy idea but\nBut I I my guess is that it's not going to make much difference\nAnd I said well what's the status on that I mean they they got to be hearing on the site or just ... yeah no I mean that's the site that that we selected\nAnd or in light of the feasibility study those done their city council just involved in that particularly\nAh Joel ropes and I'm worth six in the\nBuilding committed to a really nice job figuring that out um the late ... Burke was was part of that um it's her neighborhood on as well as many others a fire chief of course so I'm In the city council improve the acquisition of sites or what's ours now the same site is now belongs to the city\nSo what you'll see there is um\nYou know we're right what's going on right now is primarily the design work some of that work has been done already by a an architect that specializes in fire and police stations around the country so um they haven't done any work here in the city before but they're they're they they have a great reputation\nSo we'll get some things in there that that um you know I'm an advances public safety that looks good um is very becoming of the neighborhood and help stabilize the neighbor and I think one of the one of the virtues of that site beyond just\nThis location for you know to fight fires and to have a police presence is also that it's\n... it's going to help stabilize restricting ... um that's that's and that's a that excites me because I think just having that anchor right in the middle of it is in the neighborhood that's had a lot of trouble over the years will be will be a good thing\nThat opens that uh\nAnd the police station that's up near county state in Stapleton street\nMhm that'll closed down the uh the one yeah right on the front of coke street closely Yeah Yup cove coach street and you know that'll that'll be folded in as well as stations eleven and sex what'll happen to that real estate well some of it so in the in the case of in the case of the old police\nSay they'll police station and maybe some people out there who do this I wasn't aware of it but um that police station hasn't always been a police that he was actually a library or yeah yeah\nAnd it was actually called the Harriman library was named after ... who was married in the forties so um I think that's a marketable site you know it's on a busy street and you know I can imagine the restaurant going in there you know you proud of the city would have to sell the thing for\nA song you know from from barking at dinner I hadn't bars right I mean what a marketing\nWhile there I don't think there's a ... I don't think there's a selling their now now so uh I may be wrong about that you'd have to resolve this ballistic last and stuff and other protections for police officers and it's not that big of a place but it's it's a cool building so that will um\nSo I think there's there I I think there would be a market there you have you know across more or less across the street you have the new ... Mexican restaurant which is a great place so you know that's an and have no place like nova moon do across the corner around the corner that's another great restaurants\nSo you know there's there's there's activity in that particular area that might allow for some\nUm yeah my wife or are we use like a restaurant\nAnd then you look at station eleven on ... avenue a great building and really need building um you know stuff can be that there may be a a a commercial use 'em for for something like that you know will work with the neighborhood to make sure it's something they like\nUm but it's right there on ... avenue and you can have a combination of you could have something a number of different things or spin around and in in Boston and some other places some really interesting were used as a fire stations right as far as ... which is on um\n[noise] uh what's at the corner of ... street you'd go\nSort of talked into the into the neighbor I guess it's self self sixth street trying to think um but it's I Can't remember exactly this that and I have it in my mind can picture the street but that's\nYou know there may be the city might end up keeping that using that for him as hard to know it's probably less marketable for for reuse but ah the building still in good shape and you know we'll find out of a ... a use for whether it's a city use or a private use that makes sense for the neighbor on\nWhat's the deal with the ... civil defense building on the county ... [noise] yeah that was that thing has been to the I think that was declared disaster back when those each area was there it was and we try really hard way school then\n[laughter] ah yeah the high school college or um ... that are that once it's\nIt's I mean the bottom line there is it's gone and made it we we try really hard to get re developed we had a developer by it a few years ago\nI gather in like\nThe W. B. S. I'm Sorry\nThat you go we're back hopefully you enjoy the moment inside of meditation or ... years time you know [laughter]\n[laughter] do you see\nI'm going to do a little mindfulness for started on [laughter]\nOr listening on\nComputers you know if the computer and you think it's working that's really not so [noise] All right um I I Want to get some calls in a couple of seconds but I wanted to ask you about something before I forget or the city of ... river obvious obviously is in turmoil right now are going on this discussion about whether to recall the mayor or whether they do it through\nUm you know a special recall election or whatever\nAnd yesterday ahead Debbie 'cause I remember when I worked in Fall River they had um formed a special commission to review the charter that Henry new to try to like a four years yeah so there's been refreshed and the charter commission knows everything about the charter now some changes have been made to it more being proposed and so on and so forth\nIt just got me wondering whether um we've looked at our Trotter anytime recently and and where we are with that and it does anybody really know what the charter says [laughter] you know I mean\nI Can't recite is yeah yeah I mean on a higher degree I certainly\nKnow on channel is a million or whether it's sort of like the city's cost too much for the for the framework us national government\nUm yeah um you know I mean we did make one big\nAn ineffective they charter changed uh last year which was to go to the four year mayoral term rights that was probably the most\nFor the ... the one element of a one provision of the charter that are in my mind desperately needed to be changed um man so obviously people are majority of the folks in the city or grief with with that\nUm but beyond that you know so we have a\nFull rivers obviously in a crisis it's you know where there's a time for them search for redress or you know first principles to take a walk at their charter and service do we have a framework of government that makes sense and the twenty first so I\nFor it anyway they had done that anyway and they put some things on the ... I mean they've just gone through all this\nAnyway and they put some things on the ballot so I mean they've just gone through all of this process and in this thing gets but it was interesting that I was at the council meeting the other night watching what's going on\nAnd it was interesting to see how few people really knew what the charter said and when the charter a in this particular issue is recalling the mayor and taking them out of office but nobody really seem to have an understanding of what the charter called for now emergency situation and I like when\nYou know like on breaks down notes although ... exactly what even the lawyers were debating it I mean so it's kind of like when your car breaks down you pull the ... you know the book out of the the glove compartment is sitting there looking at it okay what does this mean and so on and so forth so\nI was just kind of wondering if if if if the city has reviewed its charter anytime in Fall River what they said well no I mean I have an office\nYou know is very diverse than the charter and yeah I mean they they they could tell you exactly what it provides for food I mean the reality vary in Massachusetts is that state law I'm heavily prescribes what\nCan be in the charter and what may not be in a charter and\nUm so we have in New Bedford what's called the form be type of the city government which provides for a strong mayor the so called strong there um in in which you know the mayor has administrative authority over the city government\nAnd the city council doesn't propose the budgets proposed by the mayor and in the city council can only caught generally speaking um and a number of city counselors and such and and their terms in terms of the mayor and everybody else\nSo um and there's just not a lot of wiggle room under state law any way to do make dramatic changes so that changes end up being having to do with things like that you know the terms of office holders whether there were term limits the um [noise]\nYou know recall provision stuff like that that that's what you know these charter review commission is taking a take a look at primarily but in Massachusetts I mean there'll be\n... things in massive there's the set up a government in Massachusetts in cities doesn't very all that much to real big differences are there are two strong there or a week ... model of government some places like low and west or they have\nWeek mayor models in which the mayor doesn't really have much in the way of administrative authority of the city manager that on on the behalf of the city council that runs the day to day affairs at the place um\n[noise] the strongman model of government is the one that is trending more and as well as the length of terms of of marriage because people want to see stronger and executive power and leadership and that's the than the trend in in cities or around the country\nUm but you know even even went down to massachussetts there is for us there isn't a lot else fundamentally to change other than what we just did what the what the term of ... ... ... to my mind\nRight right right well it was interesting to learn that um there is no don't\nHave by the way New Bedford ... there is one thing that we should concern out just reminded of active and move for rivers um\nAffairs and that is the New Bedford does not have a recall provision in its city charter and I think we should um in you know I think that's something that you know we've talked a little bit about what the city council over the years there hasn't been sort of like a you know fortunately I haven't been in a crisis to focus on that but\nIf we don't have we don't have a provision that allows for the removal of somebody for office by a recall a so that may be something that we should be looking at I think it would be if it would be appropriate as tested that has to be carefully right and I think there were problems with with\nFor rivers recall provision that resulted in litigation when a\nWhen more Flanagan was recalled has made a few years ago and um and so you know\nYou what it should be done very very careful and not you know allow for just sort of one sickle decisions to be you know to undo one election\nMm [noise] well it was very interesting to to learn and and I think a lot of the council is mostly the counselors as a matter of fact that they had the authority under their charter to remove the mayor taken no confidence vote seven votes out of the ... what was going we can remove the mayor and you can't do that and according to state law\nI'm One branch of government cannot\nGet into the affairs of another branch of government and in in you know remove\nSomebody from that branch and it's never happened they try to once in in in Boston I think it was where they tried to remove the city councilor and it was out of the court's threw it out yeah so it's never really happened and the other thing that I found very interesting is that um the assumption was that if a mayor is removed or leaves well if the mayor leaves as a different story but if you take a mayor out that the um\nActing\nMayor the city council president become acting mayor that they would have the full authority of a mayor and they don't\nUnder state law um yeah and it's not surprising to me yeah maybe it was to me and and I think it was surprising to them I think that's part of the reason why they had told him and understandably them and they're doing a little bit of this on the fly right yeah it was a little bit of so that's why you were ... with the charter and now you know because of crises come along when you least expect them\nTo yeah when the caves and you don't expect they're drunk you know yeah I mean look at the bottom the bottom line for\nUs as we discussed before as you know I I feel badly for the residents in Fall River who you know um have been through you know over a period of time or in Rico instability in the city government um and they\nCertainly do deserve the very best from their elected officials um but for our part you know as you know are approaching here in New Bedford is all you know told onto the effort all about grand into bed for and it's you know we we free for a\nUs our strategy is a remains the same you know we're ... firing on all cylinders were more blast and I had an a will continue to do now\nSo currently in New Bedford is no way to remove an elected official either then through a conviction I don't I Would imagine and\nI don't know if that even automatically doesn't I don't I don't I actually don't know the answer I Do know that\nThere is not a recall provision in our Turner and I don't know if there's any other there's an alternative mechanism to remove an office holder\nYeah All right let's go out because we got a whole bunch of them at the ... and and that six o five hundred is our phone number and I don't know if this person has been holding to talk to you but this line has been ... for forty five minutes now so let me try it may not even be anybody there yeah you're next on WB assembled afternoon\nNow I didn't think so I so let's go to\nThe other calls that came in after that and you are first and having to be assembled afternoon\nFor morning gentlemen hey I'm On the public safety issue yeah download a book ... and the Rodney French over five or six years ago I think it's ... or John came in the end it was first year\nWhen they read it that those median mhm with all the Korean and a different stuff\nIn the last five weeks since then that will accidents some during the day some at night\nI'm In a

number of accidents that one of the sexual\nYeah I don't know why that is so but we'll look into it it's it's news to me that there will be many but\nThere's a lot of accidents that now that I'm older than usual\nYeah that concerns me so I'll I'll uh we can find out from the police department on what the story is and then look if there needs to be in\nA separate ... second oh same kind of idea but not maybe it's profound when you're coming into the city east ... six and kept them\nThose mediums that color of the median and that street especially when it's raining and blow it and I was in a
