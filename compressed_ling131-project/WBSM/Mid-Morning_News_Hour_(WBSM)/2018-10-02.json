apparently a judge Kavanaugh will get a vote this week the\nTo talk about her decision apparently to get into the race and you think about what the Boston Herald had to say here today and it is is so true I mean it's it's so true that um so for the next two years if she wins re election in November sixth for the next two years she's pretty much going to be an absentee senator\nWhile she runs around the country um if she loses she comes one thing back home\nHaven't missed two whole years\nOr if she wins well then we have a special election or her secret skills so what what is the point you you why not just step aside and now let somebody take that seat fulltime that can keep working for us that's the fair thing that's the right thing to do\nRight and I agree with that sort of taxes you have to you about that a little bit uh but again the cabinet situation and we'll be apparently a vote this week Mitch McConnell says it will be a vote this week and um it's going to be interesting to see where all these people come down and you still got a number\nOf um of a red state Democrats that are facing some ... tough tough tough decisions out there and um\nWe don't we just don't know where the votes are going to go at this point I'm the ACLU is running TV ads in four states\nAimed at center right senator seem to be wavering and their support\nFor\nA cabinet I'm not quite sure who specifically\nA is but they claim to the ah\nAds\nLike in cabinet to Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton Bill Cosby ... sentenced to prison for drugging and raping a woman a Clinton has been um accused to accused by no fewer than twelve women of rape and sexual assault over the years\nAnd was impeached right I'm\nAlso in the commercial it does show side by side images of the Matt Lauer Harvey Weinstein and Charlie Rose the video then cuts to brief excerpts of Clinton Cosby and cabinet are\nIssuing\nRespective denials I did not have sexual relations with that woman a said Clinton um I've never seen anything like this Cosby said is he shook his head and disbelief\nAnd a picture of course if Kavanaugh so the ACLU ah what'd you say the fair and balanced people right they're supposed to represent a fair and balanced the yeah [noise]\n[noise] so did you see this cartoon remember last week when a when a cabinet appeared before the Senate Judiciary committee he talked about how his daughter who's ten year old daughter\n... actually prayed for Dr Ford of course that made a number Democrats or the piano laugh because you know\nThe kid might be praying [noise] um you know that's funny to to some of the Democrats either really yes uh but uh so there was a cartoon disappeared\nAnd all this cartoon is a bad guy you know by the name of a a Chris Britain and Chris bridge\nHe's an independent far left is a cartoonist his work appears in some um ah alternative newspapers and it shows you picture a supposedly ally so\nKavanaugh dealing by the bed and praying\nAnd it shows do you regard forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] keep in mind folks there there is not one single stinking shred of evidence\nThat Brett Kavanaugh has done anything wrong not one that stinking shred of evidence that he's done nothing wrong\nAmazing isn't it five ... five hundred asserted the job you're first the w._b. assume good afternoon\nGood afternoon hey um [noise]\nYou mentioned about fair haven and uh we have some interesting things going on I Am Amish say where we're getting an influx of businesses for\nA while they had that burned Tom plaza where you guys have pretty much in that area or to a venue to other places pretty much everything has been sold 'em which is a good thing and and and here's what's happened which is interesting\nI have I'm On a committee and an orange search said group that we're trying to repel the marijuana\nI'm Bill as far as recreational dogs and the the tower would actually have to seat or or have at least three shots are in town because they base it on liquor stores or make a long story shot\nThere isn't any kind of space so it's going to be interesting that number one we want to put it to a ballot question again and we got over two hundred signatures that we want to\nSee if we can stop or the recreational marijuana shops in our in our town as well is that it ... for some reason it doesn't get a a a passed by\nA town meeting there's really no place for him to go because those have to be a specific his own right it seems like all of a sudden I'm that's been an influx of businesses coming in 'em and this whole\nWhen we're we're in ... would would would they be allowed to go\nIt would be approximately industrial zone I Believe right now it would be a because it didn't zoning I Believe there's Ninety four it is\nThat they would be able to put the so called shops and um because they have to be a certain distance away from liquor stores from this from schools I'm\nPlanning department is in the process right now of um adopting regulations I'm a you know to ah to where they can go\nWell we got car does is a right here where we're located we're in the\nPub Ninety nine of a class\nLast year so we've got quite knows this year but quite noses would\nProbably be a close enough to the uh uh to the building plaza to ride to disqualify that\nI it's a it's a possibility because again it it it has to be certain distances away from you know pre existing a there's a lot of regulations that surely not etched in stone yet like here's here's the interesting point that that I Want to make today is that when when the\nWhen people voted on marijuana or whether they should legalize it or not um it was never said where these places we're going to be trained and so it's almost like the wind turbines okay\nEverybody's everybody wants when but nobody wants to do their town and we're if we're saying now when we got over two hundred well actually\nI'm putting it to a to a vote come town meeting is that\nMedical marijuana absolutely is not a problem it's already in town it it it's great that it's nobody knows exactly\nWhat you have no way she was with that whatsoever we have a problem in our town of these pot shops are setting up in town um we're against that and the vote is when they voted for marijuana they didn't they didn't necessarily stay or are you voted that\nUm you can have it in that town and I so so what we're saying is that we want to ... to see if people okay now that marijuana is legal gay or recreational marijuana in your town and so far like a cushion ... points that are married and I believe\nHave already voted no Mm um to that so it's going to be interesting to see what what what the uh\nUm town meeting is going to say but I'm an at the second time and the reason I mentioned this is because you were just saying how all of a sudden you had of influx of people coming in\nRyan's there's no place for these places to come now\nSo we can't we can't do roll joined said Walmart or something like that you know [laughter] you to do one of those things where you put the quarter in and you have to be ... come down and you can pick 'em up or not you're probably not\nLeave that to the state who knows what or who knows what they're going to come up [laughter] and thanks\nFor the call my friend I appreciate it very much by the way not now six o five hundred Europe next on WB is a good afternoon\nHello are you know yeah well\nYes you're on the air or sorry about that that's OK often I'm very I mean\nI'm the ACLU and against a cabinet ...\nACLU is against Kavanaugh yes they're ... they're actually paying for ads out of all it's\nA mental compatible caught on about his daughter\nWell they didn't do the right to know somebody else did you say a left wing got cartoonist who are whose work appears in a lot of different alternative newspapers around the country and or should they mock a cabinet his daughter forgetting on her knees last week and praying for a Ford\nF ...\nYeah when you when you're picking on a ten year old girl right I mean that's that's that just goes to show you the levels that despite has sunk to\n... I'm calling on the ... in human\nYeah yeah pretty much yeah\n[noise] well who said a lot of those of you in front of me who have not flown to cap the first stone\n... who was that well ... yeah yeah yeah\nI Know I Wish I could vote twice\nYeah I Know I Know well they well so uh maybe we should figure out a way to do that too right right but uh it is sad it is in your ... your I mean you're you're absolutely right these kids are going to suffer through this for the rest of their life yeah unfortunately I think is so much\nThanks for the call appreciate it five away nine that six o five hundred it's horrible talking about this cartoon that's out today apparently came out over the weekend\nOr this independent the cartoon as Chris Brett Brett Brett yeah B. R. I. T. T. and um [noise] this other thing is appeared in the\nUs a mutt um newspapers\nAre all for the call alternative newspapers you know like the the Phoenix was a an alternative newspaper and then some of these others\nAnd um the cartoon or\nThis this guy Brett apparently some of his work appears in uh the uh what was that the Illinois times I think it's called and uh so he signed the cartoon\nA I don't know whether to try to give themselves some credibility or what but he signed the cartoon Chris bread Illinois times and um so the folks over the Illinois times without a a\nUm put out a tweet saying to whom it may concern\nI Would like to formally large protest\nAt the disgraceful a sketch or actually this was a tweet to the paper this is a tweet to the paper from a reader doom and may concern I Would like to uh formally logic protest at the disgraceful sketch a buyer cartoonist course Brett depicting the ten year old daughter of a judge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd um it says ah\nThis contravene every standard of decency in our society please remove it and the newspaper responded by saying hey look we we had nothing to do with this um this was the Illinois time says says I'm for clarification regarding the the judge Kavanaugh cartoon by Chris\nRick while CRISPR it is a regular contributor to Illinois times he is not an employee and also engages in work for other publications across the country the recent cartoon involving a cabin or\nOr Kevin O's daughter was posted\nOn Chris is on Facebook page did did not appear in our publication or on our website the Illinois times name should not have appeared on the cartoon in question and we have us Krista\nBrit to remove it but they didn't ask Chris Britain to step down they didn't say that we're not going to use CRISPR his work anymore and see that's the problem here\nYou know you take a look at what's happening here and this is what's infuriating you take a look at what's happening here now you may have heard a tailor reporting on the news this morning that a a a Brett Kavanaugh will not be teaching at Harvard Harvard this year right now\n\nEven mind you know Brett Kavanaugh is not a rich guy\nI mean he makes he makes okay money buy a New Bedford standard and see the you know we're living the DC area he works in D. C. and I'm mixed about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year which is not a huge amount of money in that circle so he picks up some extra cash she coaches basketball and now he teaches classes here and they're right\nUm so he taught a class at Harvard and so ah he has a withdrawn his class for the\nComing session or because of a petition where the students didn't want him there because of the allegations so you know nobody hounded doesn't write a letter and say gee you know\nWe lost the students to take down the petition because uh you know no nothing's been proven against the judge cabinet Harvard hasn't come out and supported him and uh you know said hey ah now that doesn't work that way\nDoesn't work that way a Kavanaugh's pretty much a you know you got USA Today saying they shouldn't be on the basketball court with young girls are suggesting that is a pedophile\nBut you don't have the Illinois time saying Chris bread will not right for us anymore or do cartoons for us anymore just that we've asked him to take this cartoon down from his website or our name a take our name the attachment of our name down from his Web site that's all\nGender case to me that they probably support one hundred percent what he had to say that a disgusting piece of a cartoon but um [noise]\nAnyway if you're just tuning in or or would it be joined by Jeff deal in about five minutes on the phone or the uh Boston Herald has an editorial out today we need a fulltime senator calling all as Warren\nUm I don't really you know to um kind of rethink the same family lives Warren is a you know wants to be president now after insisting that she wasn't going to run for president now she's saying she is and or the newspaper saying look you know what's the point of electing this woman\nI'm On November ... only to have a a you know the beginning of the next day she's often in the national campaign trail for two years and um you know Massachusetts gets totally neglected in the paper says voters deserve better treatment from from her or from anybody I regardless of party or ideology and um\n\nThey also question her honesty to the Boston questions or honesty because in her statement over the weekend a would find that was the tipping point the major decide to run for president was the other cabinet thing and uh so the Boston Herald says no one believes that Senator Warren was suddenly inspired to run because of the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the lazy\nThat explanation shows a certain disdain for her followers maybe she feels that she could stand in the middle of the bread on the street and shoot somebody\nAnd not lose any of them I I don't know\nWhat we're gonna talk about that with Jeff deal the Republican who's looking to unseat\nLoose Warren this fall in just a few better stick around for that right now what does take a quick break stay tuned you're listening to fourteen\nTwenty WBAI seven as we go to break I Want to tell you folks you know winter is coming and you've been seeing more rain and where the rainy season is approaching snow ice after that chances are you have been putting off doing your roof and you fear you just can't afford to get a new roof go he'd love to have one\nTalked to my friends over Kudo construction company be Bedford you may find out that you simply can't afford a roof\nAnd just didn't realize it who do construction company ...
