I'm asking folks today whether or not they think that a\nA cabinet will be confirmed and and also should he be confirmed ...\nUm because some folks may think that yes you will be but no we shouldn't be or vice versa you know so what do you think do you think you\nKnow what I really I think this is very similar to sitting next to a Yankees fan and a Red Sox fan when a ball comes near the foul line somebody's going to say this was found no no no no that was that was that yeah that's terrible that's how America is right now between left and right yup insane to different things\nThey're seeing it totally differently yeah absolutely a in for different reasons but what do you think do you think he will be confirmed\nI think he's going to be narrowly confirmed and you know I I really think Mitch McConnell\nIs going to sit down with these questionable Republican votes and and you know there is a veteran senators each one you know like\nI'm going away to college right but you know what I think um I think McConnell will do something I mean\nI'm not saying that Susan Collins is going to walk away with a convertible dome of uh Portland you know I think she can use this leverage and get something done for her state and I think my grandma will play ball yeah and I think that's the case for for all of them\nYeah so do you think that was done I think she's got a press conference at three o'clock on a friday afternoon now obviously the timing of that I'm usually under most circumstances a press conference late friday afternoon means you want to something you know kind of [noise] but but at the timing of it with the the closure vote today and then there's the other vote tomorrow the\nWashington Senator is the the one that I Would worry about the most I think Collins is likely in despite Donald Trump you know really\nUh I was not happy that he made that remark and you know when he did and uh that that could have waited should've waited I don't even think it's something the president ought to be entering 'em which remarkably than well even though I I agree with\nWhat he said that her story was terrible she couldn't remember this and then I Am I now come to the conclusion that a doctor for it as as a liar mhm but I don't think the president United States should be in that position making those sort of a mocking toned I'm accusations that is that something you leave to other people\nAnd I don't think it was helpful at all but I think you know I'm Collins despite her being unhappy with with that I I'm reasonably sure she she's going to vote for him flake said something that's\nThey think he's going to vote for him um because he did say he's a little too partisan I'm not very comfortable with that but he also yesterday said there was no there was no ... there was no real evidence against the FBI and I think\nBecause he wasn't yes man before the FBI investigation and waited\nAnd ah you know a lot of these Democratic senators who were defending the FBI against Trump back in February now a costing the FBI and inside and questioning the um the credibility they are really I I really think that the Democrats better consider how far they want to double down on this because their momentum going into November\nIs real and it's it's shrinking with this behavior and and it's not me saying it's the polls that or if they're really in\nIt and there's not a lot of time to turn this around which I'm thirty three days before election day smell like a couple of months ago by people going to forget I mean we're talking thirty three days right and\nYou know or the far left organization move on dot org um they are they're saying that they're going to do something really um huge some sort of\nBig events going to happen on Capitol Hill that they were going to be behind either today or tomorrow and into the behavior of groups like that that that uh you know imply the Democratic party are connected in some way to the Democratic party it that's going to you know that's going to be something that I'm independent voters look at\nOh yeah the Democrats have encouraged these groups and and they have not denounced a lot of what they've done so this comes back on them they own all of this\nI mean the way I look at this ... and I tried to read and predict mainstream media that way because I really think that it's almost synonymous with the Democratic party today the\nThe allegations by Dr Ford are increasingly becoming a clear that she may face perjury charges I'm a sweat Nick miss miss sweating it hurt her she's not credible hurt her whole thing uh there was a conga line of rapists that he was behind and\nThen she's back to I had to go back nine more times just to verify that right yeah well how did you go did you get\nRaped as a third of the ten rate parties that you went to the end of the ... but anyway you know what she said didn't even happen in the movie Porky's right let me this is absolutely crazy and then not even talking about it on ... on Capitol Hill anymore\nShe signed a sworn statement did this she ... she acts on national television she\nDid and I didn't really see him or any ... and he didn't know if it\nWill human around the punch bowl but I I didn't actually see him do so now Dershowitz the saying that people like they should or should should be ... should be punished she won't jail\nCan you imagine if somebody came up with this stuff on let's say November second two thousand they just before McCain and and President Obama ... um you know before their votes were counted\nUm this would be it would be a call if somebody is on this to President Obama and rightfully so they'd be calls for going after these people charged with perjury you know as the should be a massive\nInvestigation and I I agree with it there should be in fact I really think that when the up and I looked at this thing would've I would've I would've been OK with a longer investigation because I Want all of the emails between\nA sweat and her attorneys a Ford and her attorneys and the congressional judiciary I'm a panel members\nI well I Wonder you're getting into this just before I had to run in here to go to the ... on on the air but um does this FBI investigation continue I mean because there's nothing that have Grassley is asking for some information\nRight ... yeah Grassley is is going to subpoena any um any contact between the four team in the sweat and a team to see if there was any sort of coordination right that um that would be you know something to go after\nSo I think that means the FBI while their report here is final on these these allegations and how they couldn't corroborate anything\nUm it's interesting because two days before the final report the president told the FBI goes speak to whoever you want to and that means\nOther things to a lot of different people right and that's what I look I think we should all want the truth to come out here\nAll right if if Kavanaugh was somehow found a\nTo be guilty of any of these things you've got to dump them no absolute right thing to do you have to dump them or even if there was evidence to suggest he might\nBe but instead instead we found that the doctor forward\nA and R anecdotal and under oath as she talked about that second door and that's needed to go up because she needed a second way out because she was fearful of this guy and she might need to escape or home only to find out\nAnd this is real clear politics All right that's not a conservative news group that's a that's a very mainstream media they discovered that a ... this this doors put up years before two thousand twelve when she said it was put up and it was put up because they rented out the room to different businesses who are in\nTheir home in their home they rent the out of home to different business that's why the second what was that this is very bad for the story about the flying fell apart are right there you know\nOne thing I Know as an investigator when you go into court you realize that any lawyer really worth his salt knows the answer to almost every question they ask and when I didn't understand the line of questioning of ms Mitchell the special a sex crimes prosecutor that question to Dr Ford\nI Know she would be going somewhere with it when she talked about you know the the date that she wrote this this letter you know where were you and she said she was in ... beach and ... and she gave the date and so\nNow we know it's incredibly likely that she wrote this letter from the home of her friend Monica McClain who was an FBI agent who worked for Preet Bharara the Obama appointed a district attorney of New York\nWho resigned now there's FBI agent McLean resigned when when Donald Trump became president and if she helped her to construct this letter now we have an almost on provable story where we don't know where it happened and we can't provide the accused a timeline so that he ate so they can create an alibi for himself\nYou know it's it's almost seamless it's almost ... except for her mistake and I don't know if she did this a ton of mostly or not but\nThe very people that she told investigators to make sure they they they speak to these people because they can corroborate destroy and they said they don't know what she's talking about they have no idea that they don't remember any of this including her best friend right her best friend who if you listen to the story\nShe walked past\nAnd left the building right where the alleged sexual assault took place and didn't tell a friend we gotta get outta here she left her friend in that climate where dangerous rape is we're\nYeah and vice versa I mean her friend and go after her eyes or you see your back now to according to her testimony she ran down the stairs hanging off the walls in front of all of these people all of the other party said she ran past them all and ran out the door and into the street now wouldn't hurt best friend have gotten up and going out and said hey what the hell's going on here\nTwo or three at the most and it was there was no loud music downstairs right they would have very obviously getting you know something\nShe said she heard their conversation going down the stairs she said she could hear 'em the the two laughing with you guys ... and she said she heard the ... conversing with the other people downstairs and so she's running past these people she said she ran right past them and out the door when her best friend if you're sitting there go after her and say where you go on and you know why all upset\nYou know and and you know to be honest with you if if they were going to do it I didn't want them to do it right this second because this is so divided this is so bad right now the country's so badly demise is gonna be a lot of violence either way not just in the room\nBut um I I'm not interested in that right now there are other fires to put out in this country and I think I think Kevin I'm not going to sit here and in front of the divide the country with a ... any sort of I don't think it Robin is interested in\nIn a terrible habit authority you've already said many times and this is settled law somebody that's not the truth about abortions elbow room on\nBoth sides because there are scenarios where it may be safer for the for the mother and it may be too late for the baby and you can't stand on the way of things like that and it's it's ... some people are crazy on either side of this but the truth about the abortions industry a issue is that there were there is an oval room for compromise\nCyber weight and then six o five hundred than you are on the air with dairy and can I add\nA barrier earlier you mentioned a couple of times about the unemployment rate and as you mentioned about Amazon a goalie to Fifteen dollars an hour\n... pay them a I think\nYou know that the reason you have to pay more obviously because you can't get help but I think Amazon has a more of a devious plant um they've been putting companies out of business by pricing\nSo the next thing they do is they have a base pay that will put mom and pops at all or even less of a competitive advantage I mean I have a small business and I had a store on the Cape this summer and my biggest expense was labor Mm\nAnd technically I ended up losing money because of labor so the only way I could operate is if I was out there and I can't be in two places at once I just think this is another play of Amazon\nAnd they're just going to stop knocking off mom and pop stores which will give them less competition at the end of the day and then we'll raise their prices\nBut I'm I'm not sure you're making your point to the I don't understand your voice you buy them them raising wages for their employees how would they knocking off mom and pop stores\nBecause mom and pop is going to have to start raising fair pay rate OK competitive with them in order to retain people or I'm Sorry I should've said but\nBut about let me let me just let you know I think the plan is more devious than you know because Amazon is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in robotics replacing humans\nFifteen dollars an hour they weaning people out of there out of their warehouses with 'em robots to do the order picking and other things I mean there's you know there's already under way it's already under way they\nActually have a role bought that well known only Philly you order it will also put it in the in the yard truck for them to\nSee that's exactly right and their mobile ... machines and and so this is a bit disingenuous that they're raising the price for people who won't be there that much longer you know\nWell the other part about it you that's not being reported it my son works for Amazon dot in Boulder, Colorado and I was just talking to him on the phone last night what happened is they actually they increase the minimum to Fifteen but\nThey did away with incentive bonuses um so he said it's a wash it turns out to be a wash are hard to know that yeah\nHe was telling me that he works sales and he's one of the uh they never tell you the details yeah so he ... you said it's a little bit more than what what the reporting at the press you said they're raising the minimum to Fifteen um\nBut then they're open about their design their their plan yeah to is to increase the presence of robotics doing the labor and so that means they're going to humans are going to be waning and numbers\nAnd what what kind of business did you rent sir\nI sell cookies are looking at like I'm already John ... I like him over at all yeah yeah it's ... you have to me it's all retail so that just that it's going to squeezes me yeah tell tells me about a bunch of these guys like\nMe out there and you know people are entitled to a fair wage what risk that an owner it takes to operate a business the he or she is also an title to make a return on their investment right and when you start squeezing people like that it's just like I say one by one that got to go out\nAnd and I know because that's sort of what the design is is is once they eliminate the competition they go up in price\nPrecisely your your cookies are mad good aren't they I heard [laughter] he doesn't even failure from now on the line\nYeah mad mad good cookies what can people get mad good cookies John\nIn the online that mad good cookie dot com or in the ferry terminal or the ... ferry terminal or on your bed for ... oldest Martha's Vineyard Nantucket but you've got to hurry\nBecause I've seen those yeah very hands on on Monday but I'm a I'm available year round\nAwesome well good luck with that and hopefully sell a lot of Christmas cookies because I'll tell you what they are awesome\nCookies they're mad good thank you appreciate marriage on the back seat later John and I went to grade school together\nAnd go back I'd be old Lincoln school years ago by the way down at six o five hundred year on the air without burying can go ahead\nIt was all that blue Jay how're ya\nWhat this vote right all it was the limit the debate it ended the debate well\nThirty hours right [noise] okay so anyway fifty one forty nine so no one really made this true opinions known that's right basically kept right what is going to keep this debate who uh thirty hours\nYeah yeah there could be senators who don't want to vote for cabinet but want this nonsense to end exactly yeah [noise]\nSo so in a Jon Kyl was the one to replace John John McCain right [noise]\nYes out in Arizona yeah\nNow how would a McCain voted on this\nBoy I you know what I I I wouldn't want to\nI I actually think of ... you think you vote for him I I I Know he might have I mean you know McCain does pretty spiteful towards the end there I don't know I'd like to think that he would um my\n... voted for um [noise] of course not sure that's true too yeah he did yeah in fairness\nIt's ... it's fifty one forty nine but like I said this is all this is is a vote on whether to limit the time and debate and like you said so many people are sick of this the FBI investigation again has been done for a lot of these senators\nIt's amazing\nTo me how all these Democrats that pay attention to know what's going on intelligent you know the elected in Washington the people like that they want to pretend that this guy was a known pariah all along you know ... you know who hired him at Harvard University\nWho's at Atlanta Kagan Elena Kagan K Obama point what justice she's the one who hired him at Harvard this guy was was believed to be fair\nMinded and and treated 'em Democrats and Republicans equally and with dignity throughout his career now all of a sudden because people are getting in ginned up about roe v Wade\nWhich is a non issue here that Supreme Court's not going to return it and uh they they just don't they want to basically run the clock out so that until they get the numbers in November and maybe put off this whole thing until they take control in January and they can stop any appointment\nWhat do you think about to do you think there's any chance Murkowski might vote actually vote for confirmation she voted today against ...\nAgain again I think that if Mitch McConnell smarty brings in the office in and says what do you need up there in Washington\nRight now I mean yeah the voters obviously can change between down tomorrow and then she voted not to and discussion on the air we don't know what she's got to do we do know what she's going to do I mean there's still a possibility that she could vote yes he's getting\nTremendous pressure from people who are voted for her from the Democratic side are independent side in Washington not to vote for him\nYeah All right I've got to take a break can you stick
