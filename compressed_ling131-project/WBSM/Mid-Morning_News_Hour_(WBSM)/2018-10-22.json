progress up the caravan of course and a couple of debates between the weekend or the bookends air friday and Sunday of uh for the U.S Senate seat\nA president tweeted out this morning Saturday looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states criminals and unknown middle Easterners or mixed in I have alerted border patrol the military that this is a national emergency must change laws\nHe continued every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegal\nLee think of and

and coming illegally to the U.S we will now begin cutting off or substantially uh reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\n\nAnd I just wanted to quickly on the uh before I grab your calls and I see all the twinkling at me over there on the on the on the phone I'm going to go right to you in just a second but a two major takeaways from the\nUh weekend um debates between Warren and I'm\nA ... deal um\nThe moderator asked Warren last night about the DNA test and her question with this way senator when we spoke in March for an interview and I ask you about whether or not you would take a DNA test\nYou told me that you believed that the issue of your Native American heritage had been settled why did you change your mind and\nRecently released the results of a DNA test was one actually answered this way you know one of the things I see now is that confidence in government is at an all time low and I believe one way that we try to rebuild confidence is through transparency so I really made an effort over the past several months\n\nAnd yeah ultimately I took the DNA test because I Am an open book\n\nOne is an open book you know this woman is held her in such a treat secret for um\n\n[noise] deal or responded during his rebuttal time this is not about senator warrants\nAnd ancestry it is about integrity in my mind and I don't care whether you think you benefited from that claim or not it's a fact that you try to benefit from that claim that I think bothers a lot of people and it's something you haven't been able to put to rest since the two thousand twelve campaign\nThat of course when she first mentioned having Native American heritage um and that's what she brushed that began to be called Pocahontas deal added I don't care what percentage she claims to be Native American I just care that I'm One hundred percent from Massachusetts and will be working for the people that the state\n\nNow is I mentioned uh Austria was talking about Trump for two debates in deal says she's been\nAiding and states that are more important to her as in Massachusetts and um you know went on to a criticize her for all the time just looking through Massachusetts but then there was this bizarre thing on friday night\nThe w._b. Z debate where I during the debate she accused a Jeff deal of being anti\nMuslim apparently a that was her intent um\n\nShe accused him of attending a rally sponsored by an anti Muslim hate group her sauce with a description of the rally sponsor which is the southern or or or source was the Southern Poverty Law Center a which itself as a group\nAnd I'm\nWarren brought it up off talking about President Trump's attempt to travel ban on six predominantly Muslim countries uh with terrorism flourishes Warren was against the travel ban but it's not enough to be against it as a policy matter you must also accuse your opponent bigotry right\nShe said do we know what this is all about it we know where you stand on it you joined a rally organized by the largest the anti Muslim hate group in America\nAnd that's not who we are as a country immigration makes us stronger this is how we build a future says Warren Jeffs you'll responded I'm not sure that she's talking about I'm not sure of that she's talking about as far as the rally with\n'em and then she interrupted who was a rally in burn or the ad a a a a act for America\nA group that the Southern Poverty Law Center designated as a hate group and described as the largest the anti Muslim group in America and it was on April twenty second of this year you were there deal said I don't know what she's talking about so we'll have to clear that one up later on a turns out Warren\n\nWho was represented Massachusetts in Congress has two thousand Thirteen and has lived in Massachusetts is Ninety five is referring to board and apparently couldn't pronounce born to go ahead no recognition that she saw the word born had not no idea how to say it but it turns out that deal according to campaign spokesman Holly robust shot\nAttended a rally at the born rotary that day Sunday or April twentieth and it was called back the blue\nIt was ten days after sergeant John gosh on a gathering of the ... police department\n\nYou Bedford native was shot and killed by a career criminals that he was trying to arrest and the deal was attending a back the blue rally that was in fact\n\nSponsored by the groove back for America now act for America it's not\nQuite what is being made out to be here a deal told that can be done to the Cape cod de de ... new center it's disappointing that Senator Warren doesn't know the town's name is born not burn\nWarren mispronounce born as I mentioned that when a leveling the accusation it's even worse that you would try to suggest that rallied back police officers is racist this is not the first time she's linked to police the racism\nSaid Jeff deal and just theoretically occasion\nOr the group act for America's a act for America's\nMission statement its mission is focused on educating engaging and mobilizing citizens and elected officials to impact legislative outcomes to keep America safe and secure through training and Education Act for America is empowering citizens to help prevent criminal activity and terrorism well a preserving\nA little liberties protected by the U.S constitution and that deals with them all folks regardless of your race your ethnic background your religion\nAnd um\nI mean that's would act the act for America is all about the Southern Poverty Law Center which declared this group the largest anti Muslim or organization a hate group in America um has come under criticism in recent decades\nAnd uh this piece appeared in the\nWashington Post the ball places back in March of this year Washington Post is certainly no friend of Republicans and uh it's staged and briefly after years of smearing good people with false charges of bigotry the Southern Poverty Law Center has finally been held to account a former Islamic radical\n\nYou assume the center for including him and it's a bogus field guide to anti Muslim extremists and this week the SP Elsie agreed to pay him three point three million dollars in a settlement in issued an apology and he goes on to say the S P L C\n\nHe's a once storied organization that important work finding civil rights law suits against the KKK in the Nineteen seventies but it has become a caricature of itself blaming virtually labeling virtually everyone who uh\nDoes not fall in line with us left wing ideology as extremist warm a hate group okay so that's the organization that are named act for America which sponsored the pro police rally the biggest the anti Muslim\nI'm hating group here in in in this country this is my last one sided is your source okay so again Elizabeth Warren taxing attacking police right\nAll right five away nine nine six o five hundred ... because ... hanging on your first this hour and having to be a Sam good afternoon primary high\nUh I listen to a ... and uh but\nI got out of it is a she definitely is running for president see yeah\nAnd um she um she's very weak on a military because she's questioning the budget on the defense I guess you figure some of that money should go through legals yeah\nMm right or ... she's kind of confused with on the ISIS and the the job of the ISIS and the water\nIce yeah ice the immigration and customs yeah\nAnd the border patrol she she didn't know what a little confused on jobs\nRight [noise] well she seemed to be a little confused about a lot of things including we're born is on you know do you have no idea what born was\nYeah and uh we all know she doesn't answer a letter of her ... constituents yup because there was a veteran letter that she didn't answer and we know shit on and for the city council let us\nChris Richard you um have you heard anything Friendly's close yesterday\nI Am one more time to hear anything about what\nFriendly's run up the street from your clothes yesterday\n... even\nYeah Chris rich or poor should allow ago\nI hadn't personally heard about it I don't know if the news or knows about it but I Will um I Know they are still a sequel who\nWere there Saturday wow should they closed up huh it's not a shock because that's what Chris just posted yet coach sharp yep\nYeah well that that sucks I mean there's there are many Friendly's left right\nNo I absolutely\nBetween Friendly's in Newport ... I don't I don't know when I'm In my mid\nFifties and if it's been around since I remember and I was in junior high school over there in the mid seventies late seventies yeah oh that was part of my ... I go to some hustling the waterfront first day in the morning before sunrise make ten twenty bucks quarter Friendly's and then go to class\nWell yeah there there was one of the Washington to where it's not ... yet another boulevard yeah and then there was another one now I think the one year the mall is still the alright ... is that still Friendly's\nOh hey maybe as an hour ago or ...\nYeah maybe you never know if people\nFrom that can call in and let us know\nYou know it's funny how things change um you know ... one point something my new book crime rate was another one that was very popular people went to them all the time and I just lost favor people's habits change I guess in a you know they go elsewhere instead but we do have some great a ice cream places around who still have a question of cream Murray\nOh absolutely and now what is it ... or ... whatever it is everywhere country whip out in the question it yeah and yeah and we got the one down clocks coal large scope is awesome yeah Oxford\nDown hadn't down um six and yet ... Marion and\nIce cream is my weakness ice cream is it a weakness or is it strong up all week\nWell you know what I mean I Can't I can say no to most things ice cream I Can't say no to\nYeah yeah and I would like that one strike about being weak\nMy greatest weakness I guess well thanks for the notice or no Friendly's I hadn't heard that and um I haven't had maybe\nSomebody do the employees were nowhere actually the truth yeah because I'm thinking now that you're\nClose out for repairs or what but Chris Chris Chris live right there in town and he's kinda got to see it on the ground so\nYeah All right yeah anybody anybody knows the true story give us a bus ... thank you my friend actually the notice already five ... five hundred year next the w._b. assembled afternoon\nI noticed story OK and cut the you know what\n... up on especially my people [laughter]\nBut yeah ... that's the nervous slap you what you think of getting around right\n[laughter] right very I Would [laughter] where you live [laughter] I don't know I live down in burn near the burn rotary\nYeah ah for them\nAnd you are a trouble maker you know [laughter] I Wonder if people your stock crap on the radio you know you pick\nAll right so\nThe your news which you just repeat the CBS CBS or whatever it is news is wrong because they reported there I I there's people in jak caravan and they believe they're going to try to get into the country\nOh yeah yeah and CBS News says that the president said that and they are they don't have any confirming information on that\n... so well and CBS going up and down the line if they walked up and down the mile long Caribbean in in ... with us [laughter]\nAnd they're asking how are they getting food out that these people close\nTo her to me ... ... the the sides of them they don't look like you're under no re right look at look carefully look at the sneakers look at the point where you look at the closing look at the phone side then they're not going without food\nEvery one of them got a phone to their all their cell phones\nWell look what you've already and now they're like the other guy said yeah waving the flag mocking on our Florida\nAnd I really think they should put the troops down there and if they don't want to put the troops down there the maybe we should go the people stand hand in hand and let's push the issue\nWell you know you know it's interesting to say you raise an interesting point about the flag I mean um does that make it then invading army because\nWell one of the other caller said I don't want to take I won't take credit for his seeing that and putting that together but yeah it does in my mind\nWell because they're charging the border into threatening to I mean they've already broken Mexico's borders threatening break our border into carrying flags representing another country doesn't sound like the coming here as refugees seeking asylum it sounds as though the coming years an invading force\nI Want to know what you can't get trying to run away from its not the food it's not the clothing because they're very well close and they remain eating extremely well\n... that's that's troublesome\nWell in in ... in ... is has the highest murder rate of any country so there there are there are issues there this in ... we don't want to I don't want to downplay the significance of the issue but I but I I Will I stayed\nAt Barry if they can create that many people to stand up and mocked America than a most certainly be able to get that many people take care of the ...\nWell I agree with you there no question about a murderous\nDown there do you think they're in that ... they come in here\nWell how many how many Chinese to know dealers in a you know manufacturing that how many ISIS how many are middle Easterners or we don't know who's in that crowd\nFor about seven thousand people promising to break are born and where do we do see why they more\nThey stay more and they pick up so many every day it's unbelievable now here's the downside is they do that that could put the uh election I don't know how the news with that but it could give people not to vote for a Democrat or Republican\nWill tell you what are we going to a hundred thousand people right now gathered at the the Trump rally how about if we just put them on the border they that's what I think [laughter] send them down to do what I\nSay we we we do it with a regular American yep and then I think we could\nDefinitely when the uh the mid term but I think as much as I'd like to see our regular forces down there um I don't know I that's why it's not my I\nMean I see it because I'm like I Want to see action right in anything and I I'm not just acting down there I Want result no matter what the problem is\nDon't crying about the fishing industry we have no result oh every therefore I think anybody who's been trying to do anything as the loser and they can't get it done that with the president said you know Brock Obama and the last eight years trying to get stuff done well they'll lose is they can't get it done and he's getting stuff done\nWhat do you think of a hundred thousand people turning out for this rally didn't used to it and you're still trying to tell us who's going to be a blue wave in two weeks why are they doing that they tried to discourage people from ... is\nA hundred thousand people showing up\nAt ... hundred thousand people ask for tickets they've been camping out since yesterday there\nHe ought to hold the big rally on that southern border yeah and again that could create some kind of conflict that a good once again could come against a\nPrimary on hold you down to grab another one ... five hundred your next the w._b. assembled afternoon\nOr good afternoon to have a few things on the debate yeah I'm a little Warren did accomplish quite a bit but if you notice the tunnels because on the first to be she gave all towns\nCitizen terms it was Springfield ... was was the it was ... was Boston it was ling but\nThere wasn't anything below four Ninety five ... which is where we are\nRight exactly yeah and then then she was she went to see more and and she said burn new idea what barn was\n[laughter] and ... and last night the best thing to deal came back with was when she was crying about how\nStudents couldn't afford education and he said well we have we have one professor wants three hundred thousand a year to teach us one cough\nRight exactly that all over the last second thing I'm like take a walk every morning\nAnd on my way home I phoned him with a gun or give you the spelling of the drug in a bottle in prescription bottle it's ... it's\nIn the ... you know the old ...\nAnd it's seven hundred and fifty milligrams I find the quantity of sixty in the gutter\nAnd all I could think of 'cause I was coming back from like my ... joined for coffee and all I could think of with some kid going to school picking this up\nYeah absolutely so I'm going to the police station to turn the scent yes even find out what they are uh well I'm taking it guess it might be a pain killer because it says seven hundred fifty milligrams you for taking a guest that none of you and you're asking a little while yeah can you imagine a kid getting all of this\nYou know let me let me know when you find out what it is\nYeah I Will and number three goals socks the only
