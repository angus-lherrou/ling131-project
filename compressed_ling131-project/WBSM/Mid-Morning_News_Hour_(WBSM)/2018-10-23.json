[noise]\nBailing on our own and [noise]\nYou got to keep all\n\nAnd welcome to the program and he said Tuesday Afternoon cloudy skies shower is quite possible that there are a well\nKind of feels like you're not to step outside a little while ago last phone call and it was a silk kinda damp like he could rain at any time right sky kind of looks at too so you know it's it actually is a good day to be indoors working I get ready to go home and watch the world series listening to it right here at WBFO Sam\nAnd we're certainly looking quoted that tonight there first pitch just after eight o'clock and we've got the up\nOh we've got the pregame show just after seven o'clock right here on fourteen twenty WBAI some game ... of the weather should clear in time for the game so uh we'll get a better look at that forecast the it's the afternoon goes on but right now the the word is that the game\nI should be played tonight I shouldn't be much of a problem at all as might be cool up there at Fenway if you've got some tickets but boy I'll tell you what Red Sox in the world series\nUm that's why they're quiet on this so what happens now without with us and Mexico\nAre because these are folks who are coming from Guatemala from Honduras in March into Mexico and Trump told Mexico do what you have to do to stop these people in Mexico didn't uh Mexico was unable to stop them and really unwilling to stop them\nAnd it was even a point where they're riot police are stopped posed for pictures and their riot gear ready to combat the migrants letting international TV crews film them and then as soon as the TV cameras were out they just them they went away so there was no effort by Mexico to stop the er the caravan\nAnd the caravan marches on and um\n[noise] it's coming closer and closer so what does this do\nOf with our relations with Mexico we'd just negotiated a trade deal with Mexico right a President Trump said this week sadly it looks like the Mexican police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states\nUm he said I don't know what's going on with Mexico it looks like the people are walking right through the middle of Mexico so I'm not exactly thrilled they're either\nAnd I'm\nEveryday billions of dollars in trade cross the U.S Mexico border\nAnd or any attempt to block these flows of immigrants could inflict serious economic climb on Mexico the newly renegotiated North American trade agreement is also hanging in the balance as it has yet to be ratified by legislatures in both Mexico\nAnd in the United states or Mexico's incoming foreign minister Marcello ...\nSaid yesterday and Mexican Radio that it would be a big mistake for the Mexican government to use its own armed forces to try to stop the caravan after meeting with the Canadian foreign minister\nIn Ottawa on Monday he added that his administration would offer more work visas for Central Americans we're going to invest in Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador he said\nAll right so the meantime we keep watching and watching and watching and watching and this is becoming part of the rhetoric that I'm the president is issuing a on a daily basis that the president last night by the way a during his a rally for Ted Cruz of\nTexas a call himself a nationalist and\nThe nationalist has become a dirty word um if you if you worry nationalist you are somebody who uh you know uh uh\nMy view of the national is you are you are somebody west pride in your country and your people and you put you put them first and we've seen it turned toward globalism and recent recent years right\nA dating all went back to er probably Bush one I Would say that the the globalism thing ah the what did they call it a new world of water on the George Bush won right and I'm so we've seen it turned toward globalism in the world and even here in American politics\nThat globalism is wonderful I'm In less you live in the United states and and you want to put the people of the United states in the United states a head off\nUm everybody else which is what we should do but we have not been doing you know Brock Obama went around and apologized for the United states being successful and powerful and and uh you know ... when he talked about the United states would not ever be a manufacturing king again it was as though we didn't deserve it\nUm our our military intruding on people we intruding on people when we forced our values on people and we were just there you know the rude or you know drunken uncle up there in the world break and everything and that we need to be taken down a few not just well\nA president to the public didn't like\nThat public in life that assessment of the of the United states and many people long for the day when the United states was a proud nationalistic country or that doesn't mean that we close ourselves off from the world that's an isolationist but what it does mean\nIs that we root for our home team\nYou know like we're all going to be sitting around the TV Tonight ruining for the red Sox and on Sunday we're going to be rooting for the patriots we root for the home team which is us the American economy the American worker the American education system the American military we root for the home team if that makes us national is okay that's fine and uh some Trump said last night he's a nationalist\nBecause he cares about the U.S in less about the world overall\nAnd the president said a global is this a person that wants the globe to do well frankly not caring about our country so much Trump said\nWe can't have that you know they have a word it sort of became old fashioned it's called nationalist we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist okay I'm a nationalist he set the chance of\nUsa usa now you remember\nA perhaps a bat when Ronald Reagan got elected president Ronald Reagan got elected president ... right after the Jimmy Carter years right and uh you know Jimmy Carter was probably the worst I oh I Would always say the Jimmy Carter was the worst president that is until I'm\n... now Brock Obama was by far the worst president we've ever had in my lifetime modern history modern history not going all the way back when in modern history Jimmy Carter a wash the wars in the ... did you mean Carter was pretty close second\nAnd you know Jimmy Carter talked about the ... when the when the you know the Saudis and not all the rest of the ... the OPEC nations we're putting the screws to us in shutting off the oil ... because we were dependent upon their their foreign oil or Jimmy Carter rather than take them on said wear sweaters remember that you know you've got to wear a sweater and sit around the fireplace that's the way that we're going to fight\nAnd that's going to be that the new norm from now and that was that what you mean Carter's response to the oil embargo [noise]\nAnd um you know Reagan came along after that waving the American flag and said you know BSO left\nAnd um\nYou know he was accused of wrapping himself in the flag remember wrapping yourself from the flyer and they get elected well you know what there was something very good and very nice about being national is there's nothing wrong with being a national is at all but for some reason since Reagan we've decided that there's something wrong with that\nBeing proud of your country and the accomplishments of your country and everything that your country does I don't know how many times have gotten calls from apologist well you know nine nine eleven that was our own fault\nOr you know because we were pushy out in the world and you know we don't have a right to tell other countries what to do who are we to tell him where they can have a nuclear weapon when we have nuclear weapons and all of these kinds of things you know that's globalism that's that's the idea that we are no better we better\nWay to begin on the block\nWell it knocks off the block if you want to be the big on the block but in the meantime with a big kid on the block a we're the best ever in the history of this world we've done more for other countries than anybody else on the planet and the history of the universe and we have a lot to be proud four and a lot to be proud of\nAnd there's nothing wrong with being a national as anybody else out there who feel proud to be a nationalist\nLike President Trump do you feel proud to be in our shores is there anything wrong with being a national is do you think end up putting your nation ahead of the other nations because a lot of folks out there think that there's something on our cystic about that in something wrong about that the other news that came out of the president's speech last night\nOh what's the tax cut\nThat was funny I Want in this morning 'cause I Want to see some details the president is talking about a ten percent tax cut for working\nClass people you know for for you and me middle class working class people right\nAnd I'm sitting there you know businesses got the the first round they benefited the most the in the first round also that we could get businesses up and moving again and investing back in the economy creating jobs and has been obviously a tremendous success eighty percent of Massachusetts residents benefited from that a tax cut as well\nBut this caught is going to be specifically about middle class business you got your is this is going to be the middle class tax cut so you're going to get a ten percent tax cut\nAt what you're going to do that ten percent tax cut is you're going to go back and invested in the economy like we always do well by a new car you going to buy a refrigerator that you want it that you you just couldn't afford you're going to do the home improvement is going to call my palace over Kudo construction company and get a new roof\nAnd and that's what it's all about you get more of your money to spend and you're going to invest it back into the economy that's the way that it works that's why the economy is booming right now\nBecause the president and Congress roll back the taxes and as a result of that the businesses that benefited large and small hire more people bought new equipment\nAnd or expanded to create new jobs and the working people got more money in their in their pockets are more people were forty two million fewer people are on food stamps as a result more people are working record unemployment numbers\nAre have gone to record employment numbers now\nBetween Hispanic and and now African Americans are there have never been lower figures for unemployment youth unemployment at a fifty some odd year at\nA rate right now a low rate of fifty some odd year for for use more kids are working than than in some fifty odd years women\nAre in the workforce we have not seen in unemployment rate is well for women as we haven't sixty five years the economy is harming it is harming it is going along like a locomotive like one of those high speed rail right\nSo give people back more their money they have confidence in the economy they have confidence in the future and they're going to spend money and the economy is going to get even better so that's the thing that's the big thing to the president's talking about a temp\nWell I think by date night looking for a final dining experience\nLand lollipop lobster cheese fries and Portuguese egg rolls I just feel like I'm a ...\nYear round run by with only two shooters jumbo shrimp cocktail\nThe house bar and grill unwritten invariably\nBut not the same\nYou can lose power at any time without warning plunging your home and the cold and dark and\nBe prepared with a backup generator from South shore generator and we're ham

you pretty good how are you doing my friend\nGood good uh I I agree with you about the invasion and um I I heard that it'd be in the last hour on and off I was in and out like doing stuff\nNow people have to realize about a congressman I Want people to Google CNN and everybody it it's amazing how how how it became a moderate Democrat\nHow he just became that chameleon a lake your station yeah he was a whole different men remember Kavanaugh Memphis view the hate that he said absolutely yeah OK it wasn't on Fox\nOkay it wasn't on Fox because he won't go to Fox he goes to CNN so people Google CNN and know what he's really about okay that was it the person is representing us at all\nNo I I agree with you ... is a far left wing um he's ... he knows his election time he knows there has been some moderation\nYes so he's trying to monitor any movie you notice that some of these guys are moving towards the center or not that's the bill Clinton school of running for public office you moved toward the center or election time and that's what he's doing\nBut the differences Clinton stood pretty much in the center throughout his whole career is president they just imitating this because especially with the immigration issue and I wish Chris were to ask about immigration issue if he supports you file notifications if he supports all of that and if it comes down to where I Would love to hear the question\nIf it's not stop this caravan why call it the invasion which you absolutely right do you support the president put in the military because just like how he had a great show like you said he was absolutely right about the constitution\nThe president has the authority which has been done in the during the civil war Lincoln to\nRight now stop Corpus Christi which means there's no due process our borders\nAre under attack the number one job in the constitutions that protect our borders from foreign and domestic enemies\nAbsolutely you know and it's a foreign and domestic threat it may not be an enemy like with guns but the mess sickly it's going to cause chaos in our country because if you don't want to send the button\nNow we cannot absorb all the poor of the world we have a process we take people as we need them so they fit in the system just like pieces to a puzzle just like my parents came here and my parents I'm proud to say only had a third grade education\nBut the there was a need for factory workers and they were never burned into the system and they had a ... and had to wait almost ten years to come to this country\nYeah so there was a ... there was a process\nWhich the process has to be like respected if all those people are so out of it like ooh this is like the mayor says we're welcoming community okay fine listen all the fly is now with the mayor's address all the people that just was so advocate about\nThis year the sponsor you support them you house than you take care of\nWell the problem is that the vast majority of these people coming from a very very poor they have no skills\nThey have no skills they have nothing to contribute to the gonna come and be a burden on the on the welfare system for how long forever and they're going to bring it on you know why yeah they're going to bring on morel though in a you know everybody else is going to come across with him and his ... you know we pay for this\nBan I Want to people in New ... to really this is going to affect cities like new best at the last wave you had of undocumented children\nLook how much school population new ... blew up in the last three or four years where do you think that happens a lot of the undocumented that came in the last came around\nThey came up to the northeast especially cities like new ... it's it's amazing how he like Chris ... and he mentioned how a lot of the property taxes are due to education that can be really Chris and why do you think it's so high Chris\nAnd and ... and ... and all that we had Christie at one caller called you about the only thing we have to do is enforce the laws that we have now at a work and what did he say oh you know that the college getting angry angry he's his passion he sent just do just do your job enforce the law Kris\nIf you will force the law we wouldn't have this so people in the best especially people it any better I Know because I live like in ... I've seen it I Know what's going on\nWell Massachusetts is one of the states that as a magnet for illegal ... well you've got to sanction\nSee and you've got the benefits we we're one of the most generous states in the entire country so we act as a magnet they're gonna come right up here isn't going to be on the line right for the United states right for a Massachusetts once they're in the country\nSo right now I this this is this this affects New Bedford what's happening thousands of miles away in the southern border is going to affect the best way to see that a hope and pray that Trump does follow through if he has to do has the ... who is\nTo protect our borders because if it's not look at your school budget now very look at your property tax is one thing I've always told you there's two things about I learned about living in New benefit that I've learned and I've gone now your property taxes go up and you're depreciation is going to go down\nI poll let me hold you there five ... five hundred your next to the w._b. assembled after\nNew primary Hi how are you good how you doing today\nGood thing um we've had this conversation before about putting military at the border yeah to assist or the patrol [noise] um I think that's a good idea that they send them down there\nOr um you know you got to stop them before they get here a because there's going to cost goes an awful lot of money as you stated to ah support these people medical insurance and and you know just taking care of them in general\nYeah medication police fire all the different things that go to watching care of community absolutely\nCorrect but now it you know we spent so much money in Afghanistan Iraq and so on what's it going to cost us descend on military to the border you know they should have done this a long time ago and maybe that would have been determined enough to stop them from coming saying listen you know there's military at the border we're not going to get across\nWhat we should have built them on the wall should be up by now could have been done in a year I you know the Democrats wanted the wall they voted for it they voted to funded and uh and now they're against it and you're holding it up in the meantime we got seven ten\nFourteen thousand people marching to in the morning so what happens we send the military down there right and are these people decide they're going to force their way in what what do we do we start shooting them do we do we beat them was clubs or ... how do we stop it\n... if that's what it takes to protect our borders because look at you know history in the past nine eleven and so on\nLike the you know what's gonna happen so these people are going to pull up to the border right and if you're gonna shut the women and children first and uh they're gonna start coming across the ... so what do we do I mean how do you respond to that in a way that is humane on\nI mean what I just I Can't even imagine what's gonna happen I mean I'm all for sending the military there if the wall was there when you wouldn't have this problem\nBut we don't ever lost we got to put humans there that are going to be armed I Would assume I just stop this invasion but what do you do when they push the women and children up to up to the front and start pushing them across the board and we knew we shoot him\nWell this is what we're calling it we're calling it an invasion and literally it is\nOf course it is they're marching with foreign flags toward our border with intend to crashing that border gate\nWell what is what does any military done when there's been an immigration based on the ground and whatever it takes to defend your borders\nWell that's my that's my point here and I agree with you but I mean to what extent are you willing to do that give give the order to start swinging clubs and women and children\nUh yeah I guess it that's when it you know what I'm saying I mean do they because around where we can ... well hold on I mean we we can all sit here and be bad actors\nRight and I'm One of them I'm some spouting it off to defend our borders that my brother but then they put the women and children first and they start shoving them across the board and what do we do at that point do we wanna cannons clubs how do we stop him\nI think if you you put them in a military or the parents there I think that's enough of a strategy to probably ... the tour of them the other thing that that I wanted to comment on what you would made a comment about um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mid-Morning News Hour (WBSM)", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "23"}
