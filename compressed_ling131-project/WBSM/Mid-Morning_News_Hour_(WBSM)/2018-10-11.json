afternoon\nHey Barry hey how are you pretty good how are you doing good thank you very quickly tell you a funny story about one of your listeners knows listed I'm OK\nOkay or you have a democratic whip and who who uh does not like of course the fact that uh we like Trump um and I just happen to run into her yesterday and I know she was saying I'm going to be very coy ah what\nYou told me that you would not at all happy with their party on holiday they treated path and all\nRight ... ... not voting Philip Morris [noise]\nBecause of a hat that hold on and tell you I Would\nNever write without that was what I thought that was quite interesting yeah um it's just such a strong Trump lover [laughter] fought I thought it was I thought it was funny to hear that you know\nPeople would be would be shocked I well I think that's great to hear the cheese open minded at least in that uh you know she's not just going to vote the party line and ah you know she's willing to look at Martin and say Warren just doesn't warrant ah her her load because voters valuable impression is saying\nUm but I you know it ... to be honest with you um I was not a Trump fan at all I I never liked Donald Trump I never watched his TV programs I thought he was an arrogant ass and uh the the first time that Donald Trump ever got my attention was when he was coming down the escalator was millennia\nAnd I sat down with my son knew we watch Dan and I thought it was going to be more of a comedy show I'm like you know this this guy camping serious right and then he started to talk\nAnd he got my attention and I said whoa this guy is so it's only been since two thousand Fifteen that I've been a an a strong Trump supporter and\nYou know you're always been though you're always been somebody uh since I've known you and it's been quite a while now who always wanted somebody to come in and shake things up\nOh no question about ... oh yeah yeah yeah you know what I have had\nSome long gone wrong or on radio film yep pros and cons going at it about about my party the Republican Party you hammer and beyond them so\nWell you know what it's about time the Republicans put somebody forward and and I got to tell you I'm looking at the Republican Party right now and I'm saying you know what these guys finally found there [noise] you know\nUm if they finally started and and it's like they they they founded as a result of Trump the same people who are willing to sell this guy down the river now saying hey wait a minute this guy made me the best thing that ever happened to us\nWell I think you can say that you can say they found that because of the truck you might be part of it but they found that because of the because of the left the Democrats did something that the Republicans could never done\nAnd this whole mess this whole mess with the Kavanaugh issue as United them\nBut that but that's a point and that's the thing the Republicans have never been United they never learn how to get along well in the sandbox and now I think they understand that behind a strong leader they can unite and they can accomplish down and you're saying hey look what we're doing look\nCan you imagine that a year and a half ago if the Republicans do strongly behind Trump what they would have accomplished by now oh yeah\nAbsolutely and and there's times that have been done with you know with all the\nWith all the push back in the resistance still going on I have to tell you about it and one thing that's intrigued me the last couple of days is this whole um uh this whole mess with the media and the word mop\nI Would encourage any of your because the Republican listeners are going to agree with me but I I Know there's a ton of Democrat listen as we know there's a ton of good Democrats up and I don't mean because they're\nThey agree with something that I agree with I mean the fact that they're willing to stand up for themselves you know a ... against when it's Democrats or something like I handle the Republicans when they do something walk I might be a die hard conservative\nBut I Am to them when they when they do something wrong and uh I I Want to hear them come and tell me the monitor that's been on MSNBC and CNN that this is not mob mentality of course a mob mentality\nI mean did you hear what's called ... have you watched MSNBC it's a concerted effort by the mainstream media to say this was not and you know ... we can go back and pull out all these tapes to the peaceful demonstrations that happened for\nTwo years with with the Tea Party not one incident except with those people getting hammered from the from the people who are counter protests thing and uh they will call the mob mentality\nWell why don't you call it was it was it was a John of Brazil that said we got to go out in the streets I think it was thought to Brazil last year they said we got to go out into the streets take it out and I think it was it was she but you've got you know Hillary Clinton just this week talking about instability and now you're good to Eric Holder on last night or yesterday during his hold\nOn one thing that something that I recalled I'm Sorry I cut you off but I found that to be the the most troubling of all of them\nWhen when they when they go low we kick them wow you know that's not mentality\nYeah that that they don't call at my mentality they call they called it on CNN and MSNBC\nOn it would push back and uh it's sticking up for their country\nYeah yeah that's a that's ... that's what they're calling it today right yeah actually appreciate it got to hold
