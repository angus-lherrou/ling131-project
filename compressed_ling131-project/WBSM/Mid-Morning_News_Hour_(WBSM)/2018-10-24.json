down out there right now and also\nI see some blue sky to or not expected to be much now I said that yesterday about twenty four hours ago right now we're forecasting yesterday chance of scattered showers they didn't say chance of scattered tornadoes\nAll but apparently the entire region was victimized yesterday by what a in some cases working from tornadoes and another is they're still being investigated and suspected water spouse and a funnel clouds\nThat really impacted our area yesterday horrendous whether it's late afternoon thank goodness I was home by then\nUh but uh it was an incredible day no question about it has anybody seen the photograph from the New Bedford airport yesterday and have a what appears to be a funnel cloud coming down toward the are\nAre coming down to the building at the airport ah born bridge the burn ... tried to burn bridge with the uh a funnel clouds spinning in the back\nA da Jess dot Gov can confirmed that there are individuals within the Caribbean or gang members or have significant criminal histories\nUh that's attributed to department spokesperson title Holton\nAnd are citizens of countries outside Central America including countries in the middle East Africa South Asia and elsewhere currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S stopping the caravan is not just about national security or preventing crime it's also about now\n... and the rule of law hold an added those who seek to come to America must do so the right and legal way\nA Fox News is also noting this week that approximately eighty percent of the people traveling in this caravan are men under the age of thirty five now again we're being led to\nBelieve that this is a situation where mom is lifted their children out of the mud puddles and and and not began carrying the border because they're looking for a way out of violence and and then for\nA something better for the kids and just agree that sure there's no question about it but they're Fox News is reporting eighty percent of the people traveling in the Caribbean or men under the age of thirty five\nA full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border President Trump broke this week on Twitter\nOr people have to apply for asylum in Mexico first and if they fail to do that the U.S will turn them away the courts are asking through uh the courts are asking us to do things\nThat are not doable every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remember in the mid term so unfair to those who come in legally says President Trump on this issue\nAnd you know the president has also been busy researching and tweeting out um\nHis position on all of this and so the president did tweet out or some memories right let's go down memory lane how 'bout two thousand five and ... and actually the president has posted a video on Twitter you can go and see this video and Twitter of a president Barack Obama\nAnd number apple bomb and two thousand five says I'm\nWe're generous and welcoming people here in the United states\nBut those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked\nAnd circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently animal awfully to become immigrants to this country now to his tweet or the president as I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nYou also an actor Bill Clinton and came up with a bit from Clinton from Nineteen Ninety five and which a Clinton said quote all Americans are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country\nThe jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants the public service they use impose burdens to our tax payers that's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by\nDeporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before by cracking down on illegal hiring by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens\nWe are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws is wrong and ultimately self defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws that we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop it that's Bill Clinton so what happened between\nNinety five when Bill Clinton said that in two thousand five when Obama made his little ... uh remarks there what's happened since then but it changed the Democrats' minds so that they now want open borders and they now want to condemn President Trump for\nAh for trying to seal off the border from my illegal immigrants and just one more thing we know a little bit more now about how this thing gets started and who's behind it and there was a piece today on the in the New York post or by uh Marcia shoals and apparently and God\nIt's a total ... who is a a Honduran\nOr a former lawmaker in Honduras okay and uh he helped to launch the ah the caravan I'm marching towards the United states in September ... began coordinating with groups dispersed throughout Honduras seeking to make the trek north\nOr the initial number of people to worry about two hundred\nNo one expected this human avalanche one taste till the Daily Beast in an interview that was published yesterday what changed everything was a TV report on the government news channel in Honduras a woman reportedly part of the caravan told TV anchors of monkeys F. words and she said\nThat assistance was being provided\nThe Anchorage then supposedly said twenties would pay migrants food and transportation cost which he denied in the interview\nStill thousands took a chance since a human smuggling coyote charges about seven thousand bucks to take somebody across the U.S border\nAfter that news program I started to get hundreds of calls then it took a life of its own twenty says\nAnd Honduras the government wants to minimize why people are leaving they know they are going to leave and they want to say they are doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that they have created he said\nThis is in line with what the United States is saying and there are false promises being made um\n\n[noise] so I mean there you go so uh the uh apparently the government news agency in ah in Honduras was reporting that if you get involved in one of these caravans and you take off side of Honduras that this guy Fuentes is going to pay you some money\nNow he's saying that he never said that it didn't do it by the way he was held a when the when the Caribbean crossed into Mexico he was apprehended and he was deported back to Honduras\nAnd um but he said he never he hasn't paid anybody and he never promised anybody any money but we know somebody is paying them right we know that there's food being provided and we know that there's money being provided that to these people are to get to the border\nAnd are largely the administration has yet to settle on a plan for what to do once these people who live here and there was considering the options\nUm presses go nuts on this too but uh [noise]\nAll right let's get to calls because some folks that have been waiting for a while and I appreciate that five away nine six o five hundred ... right here in your first then WB assembled afternoon [noise] very hey how are you\nIs anybody really think that these are\nBomb scares a bona friday that the Rio de\n... ... you know don't you realize that this is all a continued a scam by the theater cooperation of the Democratic party socialist and the media to to create a false narrative that they're bombing things that\nOh no they were happening no doubt in my mind is happening\nAnd gives me now there's no doubt in your mind that the bombs are coming from uh the enemies of the people that received the ... is that true do you think this is coming from the right\nNow I'm not sure I Would not be shocked at the end um ... well how do you ask me questions answered on the road now\nUm I don't know who's sending them we don't know we won't know until somebody who's apprehended in this but I suspect that it might actually be coming from supporters of the people that received them\nOf course they are and they're set with their cooperation in other words they're all in on the scam it's a play all the world to stay in the actors on it or or the other\nThe socialist are funded by Charles so what they do what they say okay the last day on the call everybody in Massachusetts\nAnd the rest of the country is so stupid and the ... or poor\nAnd they lack military intelligence such as the caller broadcasters cover with military intelligence high IQ high education modicum of wisdom and and we know from our common sense\nThat these are this is a stage thing by the left in other words the victims of the bombing or the perpetrators of the body bombing and they're all complicit and they're all they're fully aware of it\nIt it's a scheme to to to do a play with the ah\nThere's no paper shape when wrote the book just how stupid are we\nHave we're that aid I Would I wouldn't be surprised that I I don't know where they're coming from to be honest with you know whether you were going to find out um but I Do believe in Rio and we're just getting we're breaking news now that another a device has been discovered in the office of about Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNow there seems to be um what we are hearing to appreciate the call a is always curious what what we are hearing though from or at least um at the Fox is reporting this I don't know about everybody else at this point\nUh but the package that apparently was received it it's CNN or was addressed the John Brennan the former CIA director\nAnd uh but we can't confirm that yeah we'll get more on that uh when they when they have a the police briefing enough probably about twenty minutes from now a bite to apparently there has been if you look at this though this ... this sounds\nThey you know they weren't a radical ... woke up from her\nRight right and that brought up well\nYeah no exactly I agree with you let me tell you right there five ... five hundred um it just seems to perfect I'm I'm not throwing responsibility anyway at this point I mean I'm just kinda you know throwing things out there who you know it's off the top of my brain um it sounds as though they've got all of the\nPlayers you know I mean why would somebody today why would some nut bag conservative Trump supporter white supremacist night and neo Nazi or whatever why would they weren't as Debbie Wasserman Schultz has anybody been hurting Debbie Wasserman Schultz in in in like two years\nI mean she's pretty much been off the uh\nSo it seems as though it's it's kind of like a text book we got to do this one we're going to do that when we got to do Obama and Hillary uh CNN George Soros these are all the big name players that were involved in the two thousand sixteen election right um the fact that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is\nOn that list kind of makes me think maybe somebody from Florida or that general area\nThat um [noise] was uh uh\nI I don't know I don't know what to think here yet I'm going to keep an open mind on this I don't know it could be some nut bag\nA far right wing extremist it could be somebody within the liberal mob that are trying to again this is the last two callers suggested a you know tried to make things look bad and stir things up before the midterms who knows who knows who's who's responsible for all of this right\nOr we do know that this is it fits more the\nAh mode evaporating die for the the liberal Senate does for the Republicans are we we haven't seen\nA very much in the way of violence coming from a your average conservative group we have seen obviously some extreme in groups that have a\nA you know down in um [noise] um\n[noise] ah Wilmington and uh it was a woman can wear was the\nOr the or a big a riot in the last year last a year ago springtime is in Wilmington hours for that and um\nAnd of course we've seen violence on the left as well you know my ... my lower at Berkeley and I'm you know a black lives matter we've seen a lot of this violence on the left hand side but we haven't seen a whole lot from the right\nAnd um but it is entirely possible that a right wing extremist is responsible for sending these bombs uh from what I'm hearing about them they're rather crude a with signatures on them when the\nUm from what Fox was reporting before I went on to your they all appear um\n\nOkay we're getting another one here that a a suspicious package in Florida was addressed to former A. G. Eric Holder so another one that fits or a ... this whole thing so I I [laughter] this is getting more interesting as the as the moments goodbye here\nUm\nI don't know whether the one addressed Eric Holder was the same one that they mentioned for uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz or whether she I I don't know it's very difficult to to follow this while I'm On the air but\nI'm In any of that what do you think who are sending these bombs and why and what do they hope to accomplish is there some democratic operative there trying to kill the midterms that way or is it some right wing extremist that legitimately is trying to blow all these people up and see an end to\nWhat do you think five to wait another six o five hundred and what do you think about the uh the caravans are still pushing north well here's another case where the press and the left is trying to hit the president and make the president look bad on an issue that's really common sense um\nWashington Post coverage of the of the Caribbean issue um [noise] Trump and Republicans\nSettle on fear and fall sewage as mid term strategy that's the that's the Washington Post headline coverage of the Caribbean thing\nOkay jump by Trump and Republican settle on fear and false words as mid term strategy where's the fear Charlottesville thank you Charlottesville are my friends Steve just actually Charlottesville my mind just went totally a blank on on that\nOr that's where the other big riots or took place a couple of uh what about a year ago April I think it was somewhere back then\nUm but anyway so what Trump and Republicans settle on fear and phone records as mid term strategy\nSo in other words what the\nWhat the Washington Post suggesting here is that um well this caravan it's no big deal Trump is trying to blow it up in the Democrats are trying to blow it up to make people afraid in advance of the midterms\nDo you see that as being a a reasonable assessment of what's happening with the\nUh with a response to the caravan I mean what what would what I get for the Washington Post theories that well you know we should just sit back and let this happen um Trump was fear mongering and the Republican or fear mongering trying to win back the U.S support from the people so they can stave off a\nOf stave off a I'm a blue wave\nA post analysis this analysis from the Washington Post Trump's embrace of a ... term nationalist\nCould cement a dangerous racial divide\n[noise]\nSo I wrote a blog today about nationalism because President Trump the other night declared himself a nationalist okay I'm\nPresident Trump the other night declared himself a national and I knew this was coming because what the left and what the media wants to make you think a nationalist is is a Nazi\nThey want you to think being a national issue or Nazi or you are a white supremacist okay so the president said I'm a national is now the president has been said calling himself a nationalist since she\nCame down that escalator with ... remember that and the president said border wall border wall you know or protect America protect our borders protect our sovereignty\nOr protect I'm a ... a trade need trade deals that are good for America is not a good for\nA not good for Mexico and China we want to trade deals that are going to protect the American worker port America First make America great again even themes of the president's agenda since he first announces his candidacy for president have they not\nSo the other like during the the uh the rally or after the rally and and I think it happened during the rally he said I'm a national is I'm not a global nationals lawless cares about the whole world and not about America we our national is we care about America First\nSo I knew the buzz words we're going to call them this is a this is a buzz word because this is the way they reacted to make America great again make America great again oh for the white people whom I write\nAnd not for Mexicans are not for black people and certainly not for gays and lesbians Trump is that race diseases Xena phobias a home phone and everybody that follows him or a bunch of truth was ... and they all hate gay people in a black people and they Mexicans too\nSo that has been the label that has been put out that were deplorable ... come from right so that's where we had been described as by liberals and the left leaning media the fake news media\nAnd um so now Trump comes out and calls himself a nationalist\nSo that starts to buzz all over again so now Trump is more white nationalism\n... is um you know you're you're you're a white supremacy asked you were a white supremacist you don't like those Mexicans anyway and you want them all the die and you don't want to\nSo that's where we're at at this point so the um [noise] and now let's just from the from\nThe post on there is the Washington Post Trump is even more\n\nHyperbolic about immigration now than he was in two thousand sixteen so the hyperbole is worse now than he wants to do that from the sixties so in other words he was a noxious sixteen but he's even worse now\nMhm\nAnd then there's the New York times or Trump and GOP\nCandidates escalate race in fear as election ploys selection ploys drama the Republicans escalate race in fear\nAs election employees so the fact that we don't want\nA caravan of seven to ten to fourteen thousand people crashing our borders we are racists we are racist and when you're when you're using racism as a tool a ploy in order to win the election\n\nThe post jumped on on a Trump or for being a national is as I stated if members of nationalist anyway and your mind what is a national is\nWhat is the national less than your mind what is the way that I had to find a nationalist is somebody who\nUh is proud to be an American\nSomebody who thinks America is exceptional somebody who believes that America has done more good\nFor humankind and for those in need than any other country in the history of civilization",
