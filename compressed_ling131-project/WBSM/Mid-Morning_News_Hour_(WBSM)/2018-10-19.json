hurt 'em but I mean I think they're raised and desire for change on both sides I think people are sick of the status quo and uh I was reading a quote yesterday or the people are sick the sick and tired of being sick and tired\nOf the same thing and they want to see a shake up they want to see some new Faye yes it\nIs and I think that's a lot to do with the fact that we're a a\nA modern democracy a western modern democracy and we're still dealing with issues um labor issues health insurance issues um you know ... ... budget issues a lot of things that shouldn't we shouldn't be dealing with uh on on such a large scale um and I think people getting sick and tired of that\nUm you know whatever their political ideology maybe um so I think that a lot to deal with it\nTo what extent do you feel like you were in a short leash that you got you got a lot to prove in the next two years or or secular because they're having lunch it but I've\nAlways felt that was on a show at least my whole life so okay um so I I the only thing I can do is go there and do my best and work hard um and that's what I've been doing\nUm they're my least my professional career um since I began so um you know I I I I Hope I'm On a show at least that means people are paying attention and I want people to be paying attention they want people engaged um they want you to be paying attention to right\nUm so um I you know I Hope we get when I after I get sworn in we can get the town hall started um discussions in my district from no just community gatherings just to just talk and sit around and then\nI'm going to get people's thoughts on on on the on the issues and then that's why I plan on doing and and that's how I when I get the community engaged um with with a solution solving essentially in Massachusetts\nSo you want to buy a total of twenty four hours racked up yes I Believe so so that was never any discussion at all like off\nTechnically I think it was still outside the margin that he had um I think it's twenty five\nA full percentage point and I I was successful by point seven or no one point to\nIt was so so seven tenths of a point that I'm able to record automatic right yeah yeah so it could have requested one possibly you know I I think it's surprising that um\nWould you have you know I I I don't know [laughter]\nI I don't know if I Would have um I Know that the voter pool was very small so that has a lot to do with it um meaning that if there was a recount likelihood of that amount of votes even however small they were tied in with the likelihood of slipping a not for a change election would have been\nAnd I think I've heard that that is true or not\nUm but but yeah I was a little surprised that there wasn't a recount I thought they might have been wants you know you have not heard from him no he didn't he didn't call you can see it he didn't call to congratulate you like some ... ... uh\nI I really don't have anything to go off on the other point\nI'm not I'm not disappointed I really didn't have much of a relationship with his era when I saw I mean they were fashionable courtesy right now yeah you're going to be working together

S.\nI welcome back to the program we've got Chris Hendricks with us he is the state representative or a lack\nRun by the eleventh personal district if you're having trouble getting through I was just so by my MA in terms of the phones need to be re booted and uh because I guess it was a technical problem with the phones phones are computerized so ah they have to be ... to just like a computer so if you're having trouble a calling and just give it a minute and then not try again and um\n[noise] would you want to hear from you but I had a couple of other questions to a for a course Hendricks and one of them had to do I'm going to get an education and among said they had some interesting ideas about education but the other issue or they're raised a lot of concern after your your debate appearance ah what is your your ah position on immigration mhm\nAnd ah there are a lot of folks who are under the impression that New Bedford is a sanctuary city it is not officially a sanctuary city but we do have sanctuary cities in the commonwealth and has a lot\nYeah it is a matter of fact there are people who are trying to make Massachusetts the actual every state that was an issue that help tie up the budget back or a back in June and July and um so what is your position on sanctuary state status is that something you would support if it came up again this session\nSo so here here is how I feel about the issue of cooperation with states municipalities towns with with the federal government\nSays I sat in the debate in in um subsequently to that um it's obviously immigration the federally enforced um managed issue or by law Neal constitutionally I'm so when you have an illegal immigrant who gets picked up for drunk driving per se\nUm buy New Bedford police okay it's man's illegal he's not supposed to be here um you get a job he's working um you know criminal history but it gets picked up a drunk driving let's just say\nHe gets picked up a drunk driving he gets books he gets arraigned and typically and in that situation they would just get like goal or bailed a bond or whatever the case may be um with\nThe sanctuary city issue and how that works is that the federal government could put a request and to to hold that man for two days I think forty eight hours if I remember correctly I'm\nOn the fact of his immigration status alone I don't agree with that went on I don't think the states or the cities and towns in Massachusetts should be holding people and it's all already been deemed unconstitutional hold someone on the immigration status alone if you're not a federal ...\nI'm so on those grounds I don't think you know I think as it stands now we are sanctuary state because it's just not written I think they were trying to write it into law ... I don't think that's necessary\nRemember that nine eleven right obviously remember nine eleven we all remember nine eleven the biggest criticism that came from nine eleven or when they did the review in the study of nine eleven was that we had government agencies that weren't working cooperatively mhm okay that we did they just weren't working together\nAnd that was one of the biggest goals was to fix that problem so if you have somebody who was arrested as an illegal immigrant for drunk driving a New Bedford um\nDoesn't it make sense if they are here illegally that New Bedford police holding for the fast we don't know who this person is we don't we we don't have any idea who this person has this could be the next month\nThat's our you know in theory I mean it it would make sense but but as I said that has been deemed unconstitutional um and you know to hold someone unconstitutional like that um\nThat that's why you're having this pushback of all these mayors wanting to be sanctuary cities because they don't want to have to do something now if the federal government says this guy's been you know accused of of this he's he's he has a a criminal record of that he's been in and out of the middle east that's a different story [noise]\nUm if they if they provide a criminal warrant or or some sort of um a probable cause showing probable cause criminally then we should hold that person\nUm I ... I had no problem with holding people who are accused of criminal activity will know regardless of their immigration status um I Would I take ... what I have an issue with is holding someone\nWhen state or town or city um hold someone on there the basis of their immigration status alone that that is that is problematic\nTo me All right so do you believe in Massachusetts said the way the mayor described it a\nRecall where there's this week last week when he was on the program mayor Mitchell that New Bedford is a welcoming city without a sanctuary city but we're a welcoming city we welcome everybody here regardless of their uh regardless of their status and people resent that people who pay property taxes resent very much the fact that they're being asked to\nFor example I Know this is a federal issue to provide educational services and and other services public housing and then all of these different things for people who are in fact you were legally\nYeah no certainly it's I'm to be a welcoming city is great you know I'm no it doesn't say well women all illegal immigrants that come in here and drain the system that's not what being welcoming is all about but if if you're an immigrant\n'em and you want to work and provide for your family you want to come here there's plenty of jobs you can get on on the docks I represent a lot of those folks um\nLegally or illegally or um ... you're talking about if you want to come here and we want to come here work legally as an immigrant we've got ... I don't have too many people are ... the problem\nIs illegal immigration you know their their visas expire you know they didn't they came here legally and now they they are qualified as illegal aliens [noise] um ... that's where the problem lies\nAnd I think um you know the solution of rounding up all those folks and just kick him out of the country is just a impractical um if they have a criminal record they got to go there it um you know that there's nothing you can do about that\nWell should the state and maybe ... play a greater role in doing that in in rounding up people who should not be here\nNow I don't think they should and I think that's the the job of the federal government um\nBut then again let's go back to nine eleven and the fact that agencies were not working cooperative so that and and that was why we had Nineteen guys who had overstayed their visas they ... they all came in here on visas overstay their visas expired and the boom they blew the hell out of us are well\nI mean it'd be to say that every illegal immigrant who's I'll save their visas gonna end up being a terrorist is little no but I never I was making yeah but but we're a nation to last year and we don't we shouldn't be\nRunning the country that way in my opinion um now if if someone comes here out stays there welcome and they have a job there have you know kids here they're you know every every migrant workers that I Know is it a hardworking individual and I think we can all agree on that\nUm it it's it's the people who come here well stay there welcome 'em do their visas when they expire that don't have a job who you are criminal or a ... you know have criminal activity or\nAnd the Thirteen all that obviously they have to go this idea that Democrats and people on my side of the aisle want open borders and they want to let every Tom Dick and Harry and who has a gun or is um [noise]\nUm if you want to hurt people is just this is false you know I'm ... you can't ...
