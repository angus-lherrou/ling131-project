Warren had no choice but to do the DNA test she was back into a corner she wants to run for president or she is running for president she wouldn't have done the DNA test she doesn't need DNA\nIf you look at the Boston Globe and you look at some of the other a pro Warren pro liberal media you would think that they just announced that Elizabeth Warren was full blooded Cherokee right\nUm you couldn't even be further from the truth and the reality of it is is that I'm I'm\nElizabeth Warren would have preferred better results than what she's got\nBut she could have done two things she could have sat on the results not even mentioned that you hadn't done or she can released the results and hope the media is going to carry the day for\nSo far the media is carrying the day for\n'em but you look at some of the the more honest medium of Breitbart for example\nA right to piece today or the by the way the story was broken in the Boston Globe where else would you expect you to be broken right Warren releases results of DNA test they by the way have already had to run a correction to their story\nOr the kind of downplayed the significance of this uh this test results okay or because they were describing at the mouth to\nProclaim that Elizabeth Warren knows right now I don't know but they had to fix their story and say wait a minute is not quite what we said it was the first time out\nBut the reality of it is is that lose Warren\nHas declared herself vindicated a for decades long claim to be Cherokee Indian thanks to a DNA test that she ordered in response to tons from President Trump and another signal there is a former professor is gearing up for a twenty twenty presidential ...\nAccording to Warren's own DNA test she has the best one sixty fourth\nNative American ancestry\nBut could also be as low as one one thousand twenty fourth\nI mean that's like a drop of blood I mean that's like you know\nUm percentage wise she can claim somewhere between zero point three percent to one point five percent Native American heritage okay so between zero point three percent in one point five\nPercent Native American heritage maybe okay ah is what she can claim [noise] so\nDoes this mean well the minimum requirement to claim membership in most Native American tribes ranges from twelve point five percent two fifty percent\nSo she misses it by a huge margin okay her test results say she could be zero point three to maybe one point five percent Native American maybe\nBut again the threshold in order to claim membership and most Native American tribes including the Cherokees by the way ranges from twelve point five percent two fifty percent and last one you know she would need to take a a a high speed train to get that to get there from where she is\nA few tribes have a minimum requirement\nOf six percent\nWarren changed her ethnicity from white to Native American both at the University of Pennsylvania law school where she taught from Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety five and at Harvard law school where she had a ten year starting in Nineteen Ninety five\nRight yeah just where we knew we had a good sports we can anyway yeah absolutely okay very starkly as always thank you\nThank you my friend appreciated by the way nine and six so five hundred yeah it was quite a good game last night I'm exhausted like everybody else I'm not complaining I got up this morning with the alarm\nIn about a quarter past six and I'm like what the hell [laughter] out you know I I'm thinking kind of call in sick today can I can I can I just you know not show up just go back to sleep whatever you know but I think everybody's kind of walking around groggy this morning between the red Sox and the and the patriots going late last night as well\nUm [noise] but it you know it's kind of worth it when everything goes well and I'm\nShocked last night a big game or two bad or about ... we'll see what happens with him and I'm hoping he's back on his feet by the way of President Trump responding to the uh Elizabeth Warren DNA test\nAnd said today that he hopes Elizabeth Warren are runs for president because quote she'd be very easy to beat and um jump of course as a nickname do lose with Lauren Pocahontas and I'm\nVowed to pay a million dollars to his or her favorite charity if she did get the DNA test\nOr when asked about it this morning you said who cares\nHe was born in marine one for a trip down to view the hurricane damage down in Florida he said I didn't say that I didn't say about the million dollars he's trying to get started with a lot of ... I didn't say that you've got to read that again\nI'm he said I Hope she's running for president because I think she'd be very easy I Hope that she's running I don't think she'll be difficult it all she'll destroy their country she'll make the country and to Venezuela without being said I don't want to say bad things about her because I Hope she would be\nOne of the people that would get through the process is going to be a long process for the Democrats\nAnd um since with Trump and said this morning about Elizabeth Warren DNA test what about the DNA test what do you think it proves getting approves anything ah what about ... do you think Jason gray onto a resigned or do you think he should stick it out and fight\nYou know your your\nYour first instinct is always to stick it out and find right you want to stay in finding especially if you're innocent I I don't know the change of career as innocent or not\nA of the charges against him I guess the you know I'm not everybody always says well up there were lots of chargers so you've got to assume that no you can't assume that there were a lot of charges against the Duke lacrosse team too and I keep going back to that because a bunch of young men's lives were ruined as a result of the uh\nUh the fake rape allegations right and what about what we just witness was not cabinet lot lot of allegations nothing proven not right\nAnd um so you can't just assume because somebody how many buddies answer twenty six and a corruption charge they found him guilty of conspiring to uh think about committing corruption or something like that you know something that stupid um\nSo I mean you can always go by the fact that there are a lot of charges or you can indict a ham sandwich as they say\nRight seriously think\nAbout that for a minute [noise] alright fiber way not nesting so five hundred you're next on WB is I'm good afternoon or\nGood afternoon Barry how are ya oh my friend I saw some of the quotes from I'm Lesley Stahl interview with Trump blasts like what'd you think and ah oh let me put it this way I excused myself excuse me\nBecause I always have the intelligence like everybody else should President Trump yes because\nI made a comment on the radio yesterday about everybody's call Donald everybody's calling truck no matter who is president of the United states should be called Mr President [noise] good point I right or wrong\nNo you're absolutely right you should always respect yeah no I mean if you're into that as much as I can if I see a former the actually the protocol is when you see somebody who has held public office you were supposed to address them by the most powerful position they felt\nWell well every you know I'm a I'm a I'm a pro Trump you know that Barry yep a you know my called um I I'm strictly Fox 'cause I go to CNN I Wanna vomit ...\nHe's never addressed as missed the president or president right let's see that Donald Trump I'm so that's where I got that from but anyway he did a good job and I like when he ended up that's common of the end of the night at the last thirty seconds says\nI'm the president you are not\nYeah right I'm Still president you know [laughter] and I love it [laughter]\nYou know they weren't going to run the show yeah 'cause she had a comment than\nEven like too much on the president's words I'm calling the shots not you\nWell he was she wanted him to pledge not to fire I'm Bob Mueller as the as the special counsel then he said I don't pledge anything\nBut I Will tell you I have no intention of doing that I think it's a very unfair investigation because there's no collusion of any kind you said but I don't want to pledge why should I pledge to you it he says oh pledge outlook ledge he says but I don't have to pledge to you\nYou you notice all these news casts as they want you to the point and so they can sure they want you to give me that light punch in and say I gotcha\nWell that's the whole thing I mean if she wanted to get him to pledge well first of all she thinks she's superior to him anyway and she thinks she's a hell of a lot smarter than years that's how these large so she smarter than him she's more superior so she wants to trick him into pledging that he's not going to fire so that if he does she's got it on tape he promised you want to notify\nYou why drugs yeah so no matter what a mother or my do he might get caught breaking into the uh uh you know breaking into the cookie jar but if he gets fire truck primacy wasn't gonna fire so but you know the the\nReporters is they do all believe they are smarter than all of us not just drunk I think they're smarter than the rest of us\nOne more thing before I go Barry I'm a little bit concerned\nI'm about ... about a boy that is very different\nYeah I'll go and a question of gone democratic that that the mayor bothered me um I I guess I'm losing sleep over it actually yeah um because that's been the main man behind the scenes\nWell he's been the main man behind the scenes is very very well respected but the thing is you got to play\nYou know anybody that gets on the field with the patriots you gotta play Tom Brady game you don't play Tom Brady gave me sit on the bench right I mean John Brady is the general Trump is the general here\nAnd if you don't play the way the Trump you can be the greatest guy in the world Trump probably I Know he loves manners but if he's not willing to play Trump's by Trump's playbook he's got to go and somebody else has to come in at will\nI mean that's that's the way it works in in in government you've got to have everybody on the same page you don't have to have all yes men that agree with everything you do yeah um you know a very yeah any sport smart business guy wants people to disagree with him\nYeah but in the final analysis you got to at least be on the same team right\nWhile he's always got people to come and go but he's got the death\nHe absolutely doesn't it you know what there's any time you think oh my God this one person whether it be Nikki Haley or or a or a ... a mad dog around irreplaceable there's always a long long line of people wedding detector positions so\nFar berry you have a great afternoon\nPrejudge caught my friend thank you five away nine six o five hundred odd you know I'm not too concerned about mad dog I think mad dog has done a wonderful job but there's somebody else in the wings if mad dog besides that it's not working out\nOr to move along and then in not take his place but uh yeah the interview install I got to be honest with you I didn't see it I read the transcript because I was watching the red Sox last night\nAnd the patriots last night it was just a whole lot of stuff going on\nI'm to be honest with you I didn't even know Trump was on a sixty mask I don't watch TV enough to see all the little uh you know all the little blurbs up there what\nDo you mean by the way speaking about TV of ABC now apparently saying it made a big mistake and firing Roseanne Barr ABC believes that the show was going to tank without Roseanne Barr it starts up tomorrow night I Believe\nAnd the red Sox are going to be playing against the Astros into to the markets are between the uh Houston ah all the way up to Boston people are going to be watching the game so that's going to hurt anyway but ah\nI'm without Roseanne who who would even watch Roseanne Roseanne I I have no interest in it I mean I remember Roseanne fan I like Roseanne the show Roseanne on to be honest with you I I think the only other people on that program that really have any talent to speak of\n'em are the sister Jackie I Can't think of a ... or ah professional named her real name I mean the Jackie's her character to learn that gap thank you very much uh there's Taylor are supposed to tell yes yes Jesus thank you for that\nUm are you [laughter]\nAnd uh the uh the older daughter a Becky whoever is Becky Becky somebody rather sort of real name but I'm the rest of them I really didn't you know I Can't imagine John Goodman carrying a show or a or the younger daughter [noise] um so I didn't know\nWe'll see how that works out but to ABC's already expressing regrets it had to let Roseanne going so you can imagine that Roseanne is probably going to pop up uh in some kind of an appearance at some point or or perhaps even with their own get will say\nAll right I've got to take the second break five away nine and six so five hundred a little bit behind we'll be right back to your calls it a WBAI some stay with us\nFor the ... bill you start your day\nOr one five hundred and
