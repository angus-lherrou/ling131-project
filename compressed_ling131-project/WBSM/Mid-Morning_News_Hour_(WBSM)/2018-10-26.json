Ford although her story quickly fell apart\nOr during public testimony for the three plus weeks that would follow in an effort to derail his confirmation Democrats in their allies and the established media\nYou know that's another thing too I mean it was okay for the Democrats in the media to rent a Brett Kavanaugh's character to pieces right and it had death threats against him and his family\nAs a result of their irresponsible I'm Andy inaccurate I may add a press reporting about him that was okay\nThat's fine but Trump can't call CNN fake news that's off limits\nWe are we are the fifth estate you can criticize us you criticize us and reporters are going to say oh my God\n\nSo empty news at NBC News and a ... he played a huge role\nIn the uh obscene a smear campaign on Kavanaugh one notable example was NBC breathless publishing and airing and assault allegation against Kavanaugh that just quickly exposes a hoax NBC did not even bother to\nIndependently corroborate the allegations prior to airing it\nA Democrat handed NBC it's me or an envy you simply ran with it to make matters worse we know now that NBC News withheld crucial information that undermined the allegations made by sweat Nick the ... clients who accused\nThe high school age cabinet of spiking punch bowls and house parties so he and his buddies could engage in serial rapes and we know that NBC deliberately withheld this crucial information because NBC has now admitting it had this information all the way back on September thirtieth\n\n... piece written a on Breitbart today\n\nBy John ... you might want to check it out\nAll the Caribbean by the way has had to stop not the caravan that's marching up buffer through Mexico but the caravan of tolerance white man at the Quantico all because the blues taught blew off\nSo the or the FBI agents have now climbed on top of the flatbed truck and they have re fast and the blue tarp and are they are going to stand on the back of the truck\nOr I guess all the way down to Virginia and or in whole or all the way up to Virginia whatever your perspective there's and hold a blue tarp on this thing\n[noise] crazy crazy times\nFive away not now six o five hundred and some folks that hangs so let's get right to cause ... waiting for us than ever to be something to sell\nThem pretty good how are you know that well\nYou know I told you last week and I was telling you you're talking about who could have possibly be doing this type of thing for me to death and you\nAre my criticism to you is like putting it out is saying you know some crazy Democrat\nThat I didn't say that whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa slow\nRight down pal I didn't say that I said it could be anybody we don't know who it is it could be a radical right wing and could be a radical left wing or I said he could be somebody in the middle of that has no political fully fill affiliation\nBut I did say that this thing stinks to high heaven it's not adding up and my gut is telling me that it could be somebody from the left now that's what I said okay I\nKnow yes you could say that All right I was trying to say that to you but you kind of like well\nI Want I Want my words to be to be heard by people out the way that I intend to them I'm not through somebody else's interpretation of\nMy ... the reason why it oh on that particular call was my criticism because it was ... I felt as though is that you just kind of put out there you know and I went you know here we go again you know just kind of putting it out there and people started with and you know when we\nWere well what about what I just said it's confusing to you I just get that through explain ... exactly what I said I said it could be somebody from the left it could be somebody from the right or it could be somebody with no political affiliation whatsoever I said we don't know yet and we won't know until somebody is arrested\nAnd then I said but it is my feeling that this just isn't adding up it doesn't seem right to me\nAnd I suspect it could be somebody from the left that's a that's doing this to try to influence the election that was my opinion but I didn't say that was factual\nYou know the second point I wanted to make was you know I like to be born here and everybody you know\nOh by the by the way before you get your second point we still don't know at this point yeah you're right and who this guy yes I mean we know there's strong evidence that this guy was some kind of a not supported Trump and uh you know but that's all we know what this but that's what we think we know at this point to the FBI speaks to us later on go ahead making second point I had\nMy my second my second point was you know a year like you know anybody's against you know going against Donald Trump I think people forget when Obama was the president I mean I guess it all depends on what you're listening to I mean it was all you heard\nWas was not a marriage is a Muslim you're talking a lot of Trump supporters filled to go [noise] then I\nI never heard a ... I never heard anybody you know I never heard anybody on CNN said that Trump was a Muslim\n... I said\nOh okay but you hear people on CNN said Trump is racist but you I never heard anybody say let me just\nSay that you write a hooker factor when you get home go\nOn all or a and the races website ...\nOld on that's that's not you can't go on\nIt's just website any days a week that's a fringe that that that's not representative of America you can go on fringe left wings wait wait wait a minute you can go on fringe website from the left as well and see all kinds of nasty stuff out there that is not representative of the average Democrat in this country we don't count fringe\nWebsite says is being representative any of anybody but\nLet me just say like this like you when Ronald Reagan was the President Bush was President Nixon was the president and go on and on never in my sixty five years of living\nThat ever seen where so many racist people follow that but I mean\nIt's on ... so many racist people do one follow Donald Trump\nYou've never seen certainly are and you're you're when you're ... you're not making sense you you said during Nixon during the Reagan you've never seen so many racist people falling Trump what does that mean Trump wasn't even a politician back there and\nWhen we when we were well we had Republican presidents in the past yeah right yeah we did not have\nWhite supremacists and neo Nazi skinheads everybody on the bandwagon following them\nWell you're you're making a correlation is do skinhead not see a means Republican and that's I think that's pretty that's that's pretty uneducated or not\nI'm not seeing them in the opposite\nLook this is their skin hands in this country to support Trump their skinheads in this country that don't support Trump okay to Donald Trump can't go on and didn't didn't say who's going to support them and who's not going to any more than Iraq Obamacare\nYou gotta antifa people out there they're supporting Democrats all over the place there there were those black masks and go around beating people and in several places on fire can you blame Hillary Clinton for antifa well can you blame bronco bomb of ...\n... ... you know my point of view is that oh no but you can blame White's for Donald Trump for the white supremacist ... they are you\nWhen you know what I'm saying is that when Obama was the president he cut whatever president is city you're going to get people that bashing the hat to them and having their own opinion what\nWhat what what we got that you're losing the point here at the point is we're talking about the media the media goes on television CNN Don Lemon calling the president a racist\nAnd you've got people going on not MSNBC like Mika Morning Joe are saying the president is is certify bleed nuts and racist and a massage and this and all that you had anybody doing that with Brock Obama\nWho didn't get it the Fox news ... ticking bomb bomb Awlaki and around when when when he was the president\nI never I never heard anybody called in official news reporting capacity called Barack Obama unnamed this certainly weren't Obama's political critics to call them names I never saw that on TV\nFox News never said he was a communist and he was and he was in\n... women can can you give me an example of somebody at Fox News that called Trump the quote I mean is that called the bronco bottom of the equivalent of a racist\nNo I was talking\nHow our almost no but that's what we are talking about because what I was talking about here is CNN is all in a big old Tennessee because Trump's CNN is fake news but yet CNN's people go on TV all day long calling the president Nazi and racist and ah\nAll right do you you are just totally going off the walls find a way not now six or five major I'm next to the devil to be somebody that you know\nA lot of blah blah blah blah blah that last call I was a real quick to Ferris there's not much common sense in the world today so keep hitting him home runs\nBut but you there\nI find a way not necessary so five hundred I got to take a break stay with me you're listening to fourteen twenty WB assembled be right back to your calls after\nDeath download those do you read them I didn't think she was\nHighly concrete products in where him knows there's more to your bank your demeans beyond issued impress your friends and neighbors during ... wild surviving the hard sell two winters my way concrete products blend of superior products and experts new house is what has their customers coming back again\nAnd again his family owned business he's the best choice or turning around her living area into the SARS another neighborhood get a frequent today gold mines zero eight two nine five zero eight thirty four four you can visit their website and highway concrete Don Kim [noise]\nAnd I'm the ice house bar and grill and we are not the same hungry for a fun casual night out well I\nThink for a date night you're looking for a\nLand lollipop lobster cheese fries and plus you have ... I just feel like I'm a ...\nA year round run by with only two shooters jumbo shrimp cocktail\nThe house bar and grill unwritten buried\nBut not the same\nBedford 'til you\nSaid for news station\n[noise] alright well come back to the program eighties are now ... twelve forty one and we welcome you five ... five hundred is our phone number and let's get back to calls I appreciate your waiting an extra WBFO\nMayberry how you doing pretty good how are you\nBad and they called the U.S out on the caller before Bob Baer I'm so his whole thing was um [noise] this had to than Trump\nNot bad and he called the U.S out on the caller before Bob Baer I'm\nSo his whole thing was um [noise] ... than Trump or Trump related because the guy had bumper stickers on his man now that's really brilliant a that's a that's a great conclusion except\nThe facts are as this guy lived in New York and he was sending letters to judges and two senators and representatives for years and they actually um have busted him in the past for doing that\nRight but he was already a radical before Trump was even elected right um so it it it it's so he you could say is that right wing radical\nLike there's a lot of left wing radicals ... regardless of what President is in place\nUm I guess the question I Would ask the gentleman caller is what's the motivation of the guy who was the motivation to defend Trump or was the motivation to\nUh respond back to negative comments from Democrats that are in a powerful positions in the United states I don't agree with what the guy did I think he's a he's an idiot\nOr and or and I you know now he's a felon and now he's going to jail for the rest of his life and you should yeah absolutely should\nNever escalate rhetoric to the point of violence but the fact is there's an equal opportunity um rhetoric on both sides are I don't see any uh people were big big white pants on the Democrats I just think\nTrump's rhetoric and a lot of cases is totally off the charts and I totally disagree with him I think he's ruined a lot of his presidency by opening his big mouth ... um but I you know I get a caller stupidity here because\nIt's real easy to you know to sit there and go oh it's all Trump's fault you know you must have done it you know because the Trump and it's like come on you should have started to look at the facts that you know\nSteve Scully shooter okay there's a guy that went with eight automatic weapon um to a baseball park ask people who in the park was a Republican or these Republicans here didn't ask for the Republicans were just Republicans in general and sat or opening fire on a group of\nPeople right um you know hitting the school lease and so that guy was clearly a Democrat what was he motivated by was motivated by the or Hillary Clinton election or the Trump presidency ah so you know we we eat equal opportunity more ons out there um I think the some of these comments or I'm hearing a good system\nBut it's a slight if that's the thing is selective outrage you know and and now you know again I Would not blame a Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or anybody for the actions of the guy that when shots Elise what I Would blame used rhetoric that is being a perpetrated by the media\nUm because to me is responsible for it you know what if if if uh uh the media was not how they are feeding off this stuff and feeding it to us um you when you go anywhere\nIt wouldn't impact us because it would just fall on deaf ears right I mean but what happens is the media tries to play a you know play one thing against the other end and he creates a lot of this drama for consumption and for profit\nAnd ... other people to get influenced by by what's being reported on the media absolutely the guy that shot Steve police escalation of the Republican certainly was a this guy apparently they did the these are alleged to have a mail bomb things\nI'm was also I think influence you can tell by the various people who were targeted from Debbie Wasserman Schultz to ah like deniro to um [noise]\nUm you know a clap or two or ...\nDeniro is a good point there is a good point okay so\nWhat if you're just like deniro in Trump did a tropical after deniro deniro go after Trump how did that start\nWell it started when deniro started making repeated comments about wanting to beat up Trump\nYeah is that I I Want to punch him in the face on what we show is that that was the view\nWent on to a couple of late night shows and uh with threatened him on the Madonna wanted to blow up the White House\nUm these are like you know pretty high level figures um oh what a Johnny Depp said one was the last time an actor kill the president\nSure of that one yeah I'm ... so none of these things affected\nYou know and you had Rosie O'Donnell Rosie O'Donnell was that we're making derogatory statements and not advocating by New York times this week ran a a a a story\nAbout the assassination of the president\nOr about you know the fascination of Trump a fictional story they ran in the newspaper I thinking this was entertainment so\nI mean yeah no absolutely um I think there are people out there who are nuts and who are glued to the media and you know this guy probably sits in his underwear every night and watches a ... you know a a Hannity and watches all of these shows and he gets all used up by it and then he puts on the the ah you know the ... the right wing media\nAnd he gets do step by this stuff and he acted on it but it's that who's responsible for that it's not ...\nI obviously the shooter is responsible and with the ... and so as the\nThe potential bomber from uh for for these acts that just happened um it's you know to to try to make a connection and make it stick and these are the same type of people that think along these lines that say oh the patriots head for losses let's get rid of a Tom Brady and then Tom Brady finishes here at the Superbowl\n[laughter] you know exactly anyway I appreciate let me hold you there five or six o five hundred Europe next in Libya some\nAre very high\nYou know it amazes me reverse calls in [noise] and when he or she takes the conversation ... ... you know don't want to go and you kind of more for your call listeners idiots Mm you know\nWell you know to me there's a time in a place for everything and I'm sure you know I think this whole thing about building seven at the world Trade Center you know a lot of people were victimized the nine eleven and and what not just talking about\nAll the people who died there but we're talking about their families when talking about all Americans who were on corporate by so when you start what do you bring all of this crap up with was no proof of any\nUm anything that you're saying here either hurts a lot of people and there's no need to go there we're not talking about that anyway so\nWell no no but you know the the comment that I really wanted to make was is the the people would call in and they attacked the president as well as things are going in the country today it all leads to one person\nAnd then in everybody's has called in to attack the president of the things that are going so well in this country today has affected them in some way more ...\nSure you know with an aunt that lives\nYeah if Trump had not denounced\nThese bombings that we keep calling the bombings they weren't even bombings but the male is right so they weren't right if Trump it not stood up and denounce this then then I got to be for them to have you seen whether how were you why we're not denouncing this because you know when when the the Black Panthers turned out to the polls for Brock Obama\nAnd uh you know when you got Hillary Clinton out there saying we can't be civil way down with the Republicans until after we went back to Congress when you've got to Eric\nHolder saying window when when they go on a ... what was that when they go low we can't come from yeah yeah Maxine Waters a you know seeking the dogs on on on a government or administration people when they the problem is you get this ... the other side doesn't denounce it they say it's okay\nYou know in the media the left wing media will come out and say well that's okay I mean there's a lot of America you know so\nThey went out the window a long time ago very\nAbsolutely so Trump's up this week you denounce what was happening he even uses rally the other night or he he dial back a lot of the rhetoric that usually puts down and he called on the other side to try to uh have a more civil discourse so\nLook what the plot and then\nAn from there yeah but I mean everybody of course this is you got one not in the country out of three hundred twenty eight million that males out [laughter] and he's got a bumper sticker for Trump on his car so immediately knew about it right and this reflects what he was all about and I grew up in your number red hat on gee I probably did who knows [laughter]\nAll right you
