Obama took us further down that road and we've never been I mean here we used what kneeling to a ... Saudi princes and nuts\nAnd other people across the apologizing for everything the United states has done to people all around the globe and all of that I'm working with Iran to get nuclear weapons dropping off pallets of money to them and and various things or you know I'm actually\nTaking it down to an age should joking about breaking our relationship with Israel in favor of the terrorists in the Palestinian territories and so I mean there was there was a record is clear you can look back you're right we were on the verge of the best and I'm not sure how many people truly understand homeless when we're find\nTranslating into people having more money to afford things in life whether it's sending kids off to college may be retiring when they expect to um the here is Elizabeth Warren vowing to repeal the tax reform bill that's given businesses the chance to reinvest in their employees I get people back to work\nAnd you know Massachusetts the legislature has taken over one point two billion dollars in New unanticipated tax revenue so the tax reform as helping businesses grow and get more jobs out there is also putting more money back into the state\nCoffers that we can afford things like making sure that uh we have projects that could potentially like south coast where we could tackle or making sure that um schools are are properly funded we don't have to worry about whether this charter schools or public schools they all get the funding they need that tell you grow the economy\nYeah and I'm sitting there last night listening to Jay Gonzales before you were a introduction before you came up onto the stage\nAnd and he's talking about taxes and more taxes in more taxes and I'm thinking to myself you know this isn't what we want this is what we've been running from an Indian you're right we're seeing surpluses in\nIn in a you know more tax revenue coming into the and these guys are talking about raising taxes and Elizabeth Warren is talking about repealing the tax cuts and we got and then not obviously she'd be opposed to this new ten percent tax cut for working families have the president's proposing so\nNo that's the wrong direction is taking us back to where we we weren't we want to go forward from here\nRight and look I have a\nBack and she does fourteen when I left the repeal of the ... you know we were able to cut ... billion dollars in taxes off of the people of Massachusetts\nOr the Olympics wanted to come to Massachusetts I work to block that we knew that the taxpayers would have had to find the overruns the average overruns for the last five Olympics has been ten billion dollars so Massachusetts would have had another take take type of you know big a boondoggle\nAnd that was an Gonzales Patrick deal wasn't it\nOh yeah no believe me there was they were trying to roll out the red carpet in any way possible uh yeah there was a lot of people from the Patrick administration or once they were out of office are into that as soon as he got involved in the Boston twenty twenty four groups and they were all on the payroll to try to push this huge boondoggle down our throats device\nIt can self was getting paid seven thousand five hundred dollars a day a day to try to sell the Olympics on Massachusetts um you know again the price I can billion dollars we couldn't afford it and that is that didn't matter to him\nJeff I Know you've got some appointments or you're going to busy busy schedule I just wanted to get your reaction to ah the ah the White House announcing that ah apparently some eight hundred troops being deployed to the border to help it a support role I Sai Caribbean and gets closer to the border with what your thoughts\nWell look this is a problem we've had for decades and that is that we don't have a secure border I'm Senator Warren my opponent ... open borders or she wants to get rid of ice you know the agency that would\nUh make sure that we identify and deport those here legally or we should have been sending a strong message for a long time now that was committed to a secure border committed to having a sovereignty to our country or I think Mexico as a a trade partner we just renegotiated within um\nCould have done better as far as trying to prevent this from happening but because it's happening I think we have to do everything we can to send that message that we are going to\nA enforce the laws of our land and that people cannot come in here illegally and expect to just be able to ... these laws that we put in place by part is it's not a Republican law it's not a Democrat law it's an American law that you cannot come into our country illegally there is a process to come in and the fact that there's this\nCare of and it's that that think that they can you know circumvent our laws they're wrong\nAnd what do you make of the uh these alleged bombs or alleged exploiting explosive devices that are being a center running up to nine or a lemon at this point now that they have found that they don't appear to be dangerous but just the thought\nUm then this is being done news is frightening Republican and are you really do the fingers are all pointing this morning when it's your fault you a fault and so on and so forth what do you make of all of this\nYeah I mean this is just a continued problem in Washington that every incident become so politicized obviously this one is more directly political but in fact that the matter is if the rhetoric that's been happening for a long time that pushed you know people I'm\nTo the edge and to do things like this I mean it was a a Bernie Sanders supporter that that that\nWas basically the shooter that hit a congressman ... and they had a a congressional baseball practice right it was\nA Senator Elizabeth Warren supporter out of Cambridge you put a five hundred dollar bounty or if somebody would shoot an ice officer and he was arrested about a month and a half ago you know when you have a politician's ramping up the rhetoric and the negativity that's when it happened as you push people over the edge and I think we need to really pull it back\nAnd we need more civil discussion in our country and that's a that's something I promise to do down in Washington\nYeah we get a candidate for Congress in New Jersey ah Jay Webber a who what about the same time CNN was receiving guide notification that he had been sent to one of these fake bombs uh he was also receiving a um a a message in the mail that we see just seeing that uh\nUh he and his seven children might be in danger if he wins the
