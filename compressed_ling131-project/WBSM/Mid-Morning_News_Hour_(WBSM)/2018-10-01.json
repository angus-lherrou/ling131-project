I'm so there's no there's no consistency but with with regard to I'm Lindsey Graham I'll say that uh he feels like a soccer\nField like a soccer because he thought that the Judiciary Committee was on the level you thought that it was truly a non partisan and\nSteeped in these honorable tradition and that's why you voted for Sotomayor in ... even though both of them are left wing radicals who crafted their rulings according to DNC press releases as opposed to actually reading the law and the constitution to people like a sucker for voting for them and\nThen you can understand why Steve rom as soon as on the housing costs you of course every day see what are you guys are talking about today I Would imagine a lot of Kavanaugh suffering\nYeah we'll be talking about cabin on we'll be talking about this this UMass coach who is in a in a lot of hot water he's been suspended for a one\nGame or one week or because they use the word rape in a non politically correct way Mm but we'll be talking about cabin on we'll be talking about this new NAFTA trade deal and you know what you mean the times we live in I'm sure there could be some big giant breaking news event before\nRequire slated to the show how do you still living in very\nTasty Robin ... having you on that how we ... from three to seven o'clock right here on fourteen twenty WB a semi every Monday to friday Steven Gray is a big part of that program you guys helped to make that program what it is in no love listening to you guys every afternoon thanks for spending some time with this\nProblem thanks very All right we'll do it again there's the Robin ... a great guy fiber wait another six o five hundred a couple of folks hanging on to get to calls Europe first then WB is a good afternoon\nEighth or as far as checking in from Washington DC once observed making\nCapital of the world well I would've liked to talk to your guest Steve Robinson a as many of your listeners would like to have a crack at your gas and challenges about certain things and one was Steve Robinson is the influence of grace cruelly on that show\nThis is being run by this young girl and ah they're banning callers from WBAI sums listening audience or through Taylor ... a ... call screening that's why we say costs\n... I ... ... it's too early on a Monday to get on my new cyber waiting in six o five hundred euro ... will be some good afternoon\nThere I Wish you pick me up first set in the fall of the village idiot every [laughter] anyway um you know you're asking about why I'm\nYou know why is it the Democrats get away with all that stuff and um I think that ... you know my my opinion is that the press has much more of a influence on Americans the average American\nUm and how they're going to vote then then we probably take for granted because I think you and I and there's a lot of people\nThat they can smell when the press is bad and they can they can smell when they're\nLeaning laughed and doing their left thing but the average person that Jews and for\nA two minute soundbite or a five minute soundbite or just gets enough information for the you know the the ... the water cooler at work um they're getting a a very heavy biased approached everything and so they're assuming that everything\nThat Trump's doing is bad wrong whatever uh and so I mean there's there's ... I mean unfortunately it's very tainted the amount of information that's out there that's\nWhy Trump started the whole fake news you know you know\nI think that's you know you're not going to hear about Cory Booker you're not going to hear about\n'em you know ah what's his name from Minnesota uh\nUh Allison ... yeah\nYou hear about a thousand I mean that that to me is the crime I mean it's okay to talk negatively about Trump but why are these guys bringing up you know these are these just spent a couple of people out or a shopping and raping women or writing stories about how to do it\nAnd yet you know how is it ... me too movement\nI don't I don't get you know it's um but that's that to me is the reason I I run into it all the time in my everyday life people that are so died in the wall but they don't know anything\nRight and it's it's amazing I Am always baffled by it\nBut what really frustrating because so many folks in America today you know the reason why we've got the situation that we've got right now in the country is because people stop paying attention and like when people stop paying attention people start to get away with things that is why is it a corrupt government here in Massachusetts that's why we've got corruption or\nA throughout Washington that's why that hearing in Washington last week with the Senate Judiciary committee was allowed to take place\nThat's why somebody like Brett Kavanaugh as a career his family his reputation were allowed to be destroyed because people stop paying attention they need to start putting their foot down I get a sense though\nPolling that I've heard about this morning the kind of kind of disappointing indicating that really the goalposts wasn't moved in either direction last week that\nAre those who supported cabin are continue to support and those who supported Ford continue to support her and it really hasn't been much of a movement there at all\nBut I get a sense that people have been a the sleeping giant has been awakened again that people did not like what they saw the Democrats do here and I think it's going to translate in a huge turnout\nOf by people in November who have had enough of this kind of stuff and this could actually hurt the Democrats in a big way and November\nOh there's only there's only so much Barry that you can you can have an opinion or you can be part of a party or you can do but if you tell some of the\nFabric of their um existence got cancer that their value system is wrong and it's going to change you know and the next election I think that's where people draw a line it's like look you know this country um two hundred two hundred and fifty plus years was built in a way\nThat cherished a certain value system\nUm and that's how we got to where we're so successful as a country\nOr you can't come in and they say well we're going to put the value system on a side we're done with capitalism we're done with a respecting the flag I heard one yesterday that you know that that people that are protesters should be a veterans now people that protesters protesting during the Vietnam War should be considered veterans get veterans' benefits\nBut they're like no serious I can make this not this is our national News I'm like\nYou you know you you cannot\nYourself next to my father my brother brother served in Vietnam and my father served in World War two in both theaters and say you're a veteran not in a ... million years\nAlready met and got to hold you appreciate it five or six o five hundred you're next on WB is some good afternoon\nA battery you know you know where to get away with it the crash why because because normally the Republicans are the same ones but then I asked him from local\nYou know they're using words to describe her testimony as compelling ... come on you can put a you could put a machine gun through all those famous she married right and then and then you have another Republican senator saying I Believe her talked before but I also believe the judge\nAnd finance it for you potentially for what was Ninety nine dollars a month now that is affordable chances are the reason you have not had you've done yet is because you've said I Can't afford it and Ninety nine bucks a month you probably can't afford it so\nGiven the call kudos construction company we Bedford they've been in business here for over Thirty years is a business started by their dad way back in the day and Derek and Jason Kudo have taken over the business they grew up on roofs they know what they're doing and you see their Kudo construction company signs all throughout the great New Bedford area\nAnd the reason they've been in business so long and the reason you see those scientist because you're good and they are fair in the uprising\nAnd they are part of your community right these are not guys that are formed out buy a Home Depot Lowe's or whatever these are these are local guys who are part of your community\nAnd uh they offer the fifty year warranty that is transferable and that is so important to get you moved on today and forty years from now you want to sell that house\nThat warranty goes along is good for

eight one for for fourteen pulley that will you be us\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\n\n[laughter] well\nVery welcome back twelve forty one on a Monday afternoon five ... five hundred your next and W. B. some good afternoon\nLet me on this huge going okay a lot to get to so far for for two days\nNow looking into all the CIA stuff and have had nothing that makes any sense nothing that I I question all these sources um [noise] so I think it's a what is it when the propaganda that they're trying to to throw at you so\nCouple of things are true though she left her late and uh she had problems with her father her father when at a golf club a very\nExclusive now only golf club um called burning tree and for years they resisted having women and even when that was very popular for women to get into golf clubs Sandra Day O'Connor was one that wanted to get in she never cross the threshold according to them [noise] um\nSo she did have problems with her father there is some evidence or you might have had some addiction problems whether it was alcohol drugs for sex and\nThat makes sense because on Fox News you know former CIA director assistant director Joe ... the John of a ... I Can't say his name anyway he had indicated there was something about the PGA who use that for burning tree\nThey said when the FBI contact them or somebody had contact and I think the Senate investigative committee people he says you don't want us to tell you about her\nNow that that piqued my interest and apparently has you know after looking into a lot of stuff she's a groupie she throws her keys especially at PGA people how that might have nothing to do with it except for the fact when did this behavior happen what year was she'd be very young when this happened\nUh but she's got some instability problems [noise] um\nSo where where where's this going what are you where do you think it's going\nWell I don't know where it's going but she's she's had problems and uh she's got a she's also into the left wing\nVery left wing ... politics you um she's she's\nYou already know she's a liar from her flying information that she gave terribly California says she's really not what she said she was a\nShe she didn't have the um required a number of hours to be um [noise] uh [noise] into what whatever she stayed was her was her occupation\nWhere where are you finding the information so that other folks ...\nAround and I discovered a lot of like Dicky was um um\nSources for the CIA its empire and something else and it ... it started about countering demons and stuff like that you know that's off the wall then there was one that says new Jew order right so you know that that's off the wall yeah um but and and there's that material that you know makes sense\nUm as far as what happened recently oh by the way the press and the media that did you do it in ... having a at first he was a sexual aggressor and then he became what a a rapist\nAnd I was ready to share what you've never been accused ... which is I'm Glad you got a very very much because you used to being accused of being a rape is now a ... what we got up and he's never been accused of rape and\nNow he's Mitt morphed into a drunk an angry man who was unsuitable doesn't have the right to just show temperament he's unsuitable for the job and today usa had something that says that he got a lot of letters about him being a pedophile he's morphing and getting worse ...\nI Know ... million excellent excellent excellent shelf when I Do appreciate I Want to move on to the national but you were you raised some excellent stuff\nThis guy started out as being accused of being um sexual or somebody who was sexually assaulted this woman I pushed only been tried to river a bathing suit out and now she's the caller is absolutely right if you read or listen to the media accounts of this uh this guy now he's gone\nOr just simply being a I'm somebody who was sexually\nAssaulted this woman to have a hard core rapist a pedophile\nA drunk ... by the way Sheldon Whitehouse made it clear that he far to lie to write in ... school [noise] um so it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse the USA Today piece by suggesting that he not be allowed on a basketball court while kids are there she makes it sound as though he's a he's a pedophile\nBut where the hell does that come from\nBut this is the fake media I Am so glad you called my friend because this do you make such a wonderful point here\nI'm In the ... what they are doing is taking this man's character and progressively making it worse and worse and worse and worse this has gone from a Seventeen year old kid who tried to have his way with a Fifteen year old girl on and then after a party or someone who was a drunk\nOr somebody who uh passes out drunk somebody who is a becomes meaning belligerent\nSomebody who um um again this is a pedophile who has an anger issues uh who has a you know you see what they're doing this is what the press does and when the press doesn't challenge these allegations that are being a forty by\nThese Democrats in the Congress look what happens it gets reported is no which the truth\nAnd this is the character assassination process and the pressures is aiding and abetting in it\nMight not challenging it when has anybody what anybody in the press challenge whether or not this guy is fit to be on on on a basketball court with young girls we have you weren't anybody challenge that thank you so much for\nCalling my friend you really really really hit home run with that five or six o five

Pittsburgh twenty six to fourteen oh you have ... I was watching the other game on you know what I was doing actually I was reading a book and and kind of look at football over the top of the book so I kinda got it all a run together but doesn't know Pittsburgh did lose sorry about that I Will\nGive you now here's another thing I Would like to correct what I sense friday about on on that was\n... his wife that has beat his wife that he remember I told you that yes and while its term I don't care I forgot his life then begins with a C. it's cool I ... I forgot already who it is but I saw his face\nYou know what I remember that story now um I Do remember that he admitted that he assaulted his wife and I can't recall ... who was yeah it's\nSo many people involved in so much that if you don't you know pay close attention on you know get disrupted or something you just lose it you know yeah and you know that little that mistake that I made unintentionally", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mid-Morning News Hour (WBSM)", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "01"}
