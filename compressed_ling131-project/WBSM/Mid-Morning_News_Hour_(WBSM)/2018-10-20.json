A. S. D. S. I. P. C. registered investment advisor\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nLooking back to money matters here on WBFO I'm fourteen twenty with Jose metro\nOh at least that's the right ... absolutely right my fault with [laughter] you know are we and we are regular but yeah we are back\nI'm All right so we're going to shift gears a little bit we're going to talk about life insurance or because it is protection for your family or but it is money it turns into money or in an unfortunate situation so um [noise]\nLife insurance ... what is it it's a contract of love normally you love some ... spouse you let the kids you love your grandchildren right and you want to leave them something when you're not here\nRight and you're you want to make sure they're taken care of after ... um financially anyway right All right thanks\nSo I Want to leave my family a million dollars but I don't have a million dollars today\nBut but life insurance I can buy you a million dollars right now there are there are different a payment options\nNormally what we're accustomed to is either an annual semi annual quarterly payment with the company builds you for nowadays automatic bank draft that can be take\nAre there a specific like health firemen so they they all have or are they\nAll have health requirements guy once you hit a certain number most companies are a hundred thousand and up\nThere were a few companies that started fifty thousand where they require you to do an exam ... now the exam is done by a private company that gets paid by the insurance company not by the insured\nSo so you wouldn't go to you and your doctor and just get a note saying like now they might still require\nMedical information from your doctor ... from a hospital if you've been in turn for whatever reason an operation or a health issue they will require the company will still require\nA potentially more information than what is uh just gained from having the nurse go out to see you and the nurses and make an appointment with you so if it's ... it's sort of a person came into my office\nAnd we're talking about life insurance the first thing is the phone call comes in to my office one of my girls picks up\nThey're going to ask the client what it is that they're coming in to see me for could be investments could be retirement plan and could be rollovers could be a five twenty nine so for the kids but once they say I'd like to talk to Mr models or Jose about life insurance\nThen they're going to ask my girls are going to ask\nWe need your name your date of birth and whether you're a smoker and not ... because right off the bat I'm going to try to get a quote\nFor the client potential client so that I've got something to show them something to talk about when we get together because I don't know what the conversation's going to end up being but at least I've got something that can present to them right now why smoke or a non smoker\nBecause right off the bat being a smoker or a nonsmoker the premium is higher for a smoker then a non smoker I say I once they come in I looked at their outside I can see what they look like\nI don't know what they're inside something like ... so then if they like the quote or if if the conversation takes a turn where I presented something that that's not what they want we might need to make a subsequent appointment but the point is once we get to a point that I'm taking an application so I take the application for the client or potential clients still\nAnd then I start asking some medical questions I sat asking some moral questions also okay ... um\nDo use scuba dive do are you in the military uh uh have you ever been convicted a there's a bunch of different questions have gotten that have done nothing to do with medical issues\nRight I mean are there you know there's a use drugs yeah I mean you you can be a perfectly healthy person but uh you could become like the like I said if you're if you're a ... a scuba diver I understand Dr ... exactly okay and that's one of the questions\nOr do you do motorized racing cars bikes and then and someone okay because that's that's an issue ... okay\nUh then the medical questions will come in and it's everything you can think of I write a depression anxiety ah cirrhosis a\nHeart attack diabetes or asthma everything you can think of right whether you've been to the hospital within the last twelve months if you've been into her\nYeah it's probably like a ... FBI investigation [laughter] so after I take\nAll that information down ... we send the application to the company with or without an initial payment because the the company uh gives you the option of making a pre payment that if you get declined they will refund do the money or\nGet accepted your technically insured from once I took the temporary insurance agreement and gave you a receipt because I took money so everything with normal\nAnd you passed before the policy was issued and everything would have been normal which has happened in the past not with me but at the people that I used to work with that that I Know\nUm that the company paid the claim ... type because the agent took the money up front for the\nUh for the binder and the person passed over the weekend and the company paid the claim\nOkay but anyway so I was on the application up going to say you're saying\nIf I'm a a\nAlligator wrestler who yeah it was probably the fact today the three facts we could ensure you you might get raided but we couldn't show you the alligator wrestling and probably not go probably not or if you're an alligator send him to have teeth\nHuh what if they didn't they were like what if they didn't have to you whatever they didn't have IDs yeah listen the the from what I understand just the power of that John dropping crowd crush your brain are okay so even if they have not maybe not still\nSo my my uh but if you're you know a a kitty trainer right yeah you probably get the insurance is always so that's a a a career path that I should go down yet sorry that's a career path you shouldn't go down whether you buy a license [laughter]\n[laughter] and it allows us [laughter] or I get off the ... now that was actually good because if you got to make it a little livelier All right this is more of a stuff right nobody wants nobody nobody nobody does want to talk about why they gave the they don't at least that's what I think you know my whole life insurance now\nBecause if if they called it what is actually is that insurance somebody would buy it was true yeah and I said\n[noise] so I take the application I sent it to the company I'm my secretary my assistant my right hand\nShe than colds the nurse who use that they're they're here from the area their environment um\nAnd that's who we almost always used exclusively a we schedule where will we give her or him because it's a couple we give them the information we give them the\nClients name the clients address and the clients telephone number and then they have to go out and do a pair of medical exam\nSo when they go out they're going to subsequently asked a lot of the questions that I asked for the medical side of it they bring a scale of which they asked you to weigh the way it a step onto way\nThey bring 'em a uh\nI forget what it's called the ... to taking the blood pressure cuff and then take a blood pressure they\nUm they give you a little cup tend to go to the bathroom fill it up and get back\nTo ordered overflow don't that don't let it all [laughter] um and then they subsequently sense that up to the insurance company and the insurance companies have labs\nAnd they have medical professions professionals that then break all this up and and you know and oh and they take a little bit of book blood ... either from that to be a finger on the inside of your old but they also take a little bit of blood all that gets sent up to the insurance company they then or do some exams on all of it\nThere are plans that depending upon your age\nThey're guaranteed issue or almost guaranteed issue okay and what those plans do is that they offer you a life insurance plan but in the first either to some companies that to some companies have three years\nThey will not pay out the full that's benefited to pass they will pay out what you paid in premium\nPlus a certain percentage normally it's about twenty percent so if the plan costs to a thousand dollars a year and you passed at the end of the first year and you paid a thousand dollars you're beneficiary would get twelve hundred dollars back\nInto the second year you paid another thousand dollars and you passed the beneficiary beneficiary would get twenty four hundred dollars\nAnd ... again some companies started the third year most do so if you make it to the third year they're going to ensure for the full amount so then if you passed there you're on then they're going to pay out the full amount so if you if you bought a twenty five thousand dollar policy or fifty thousand dollar policy that's what they would pay [noise]\nBut um to me that's normally a last resort type of policy because I'd like to see\nNormally with anybody I'd like to see that they get an insurance policy that will insure them for the full amount day one and I can't get that I I wouldn't know if the company is going to issue or not without taking a nap sending you and and then letting letting them do the findings whether they're going to insure you and not\nYeah 'cause I did that for a while ago yep I'm sixty I'm sixty seven years old okay so I did that a while ago what was I was young younger it was probably my late fifties maybe yup and uh they why they were a big onto a price of like a hundred and fifty dollars a month or something is\nOkay but but when you said they came to a price of a hundred and fifty dollars a month they'll pay you didn't tell me the amount that you were purchasing because let's\nSay that you were purchasing for a hundred and fifty a hundred thousand dollars and that was going to become an affordable you you could have asked the representative or the agent okay let's\nFifty would be and they are paying one fifty it could be it might not be an exact path it's like buying a box of cereal that doesn't doubled in price because it's doubled in size but the point is you could have asked them to show you what a fifty thousand dollar policy might cost\nOr a thirty thousand dollar policy might cause then it might have been affordable and at least you would have left something to your family versus leaving zero\nRight yeah I Can't even you know I Can't remember what I Would I Do with that but I just read about but how about you but across in your book where\nBut again it doesn't hurt to try again\nYeah across the rules are grown up so I mean [laughter] right so you know okay All right ... thank you because there are no problem by [noise]\nBecause of the all by the way yeah thank you because of this is there another one okay because of this question I'm actually going to tell a story that happened with a couple of who are clients of mine right so I had a couple of come in\nAnd I'm just so clients by the way not well the wife his client for the insurance plus what they have an investments but it was the situation with the husband so the the wife and husband came in they applied for life insurance and\nThe wife's policy was issued almost immediately because she was a preferred the husbands took a little longer because he had had a mild heart attack and I think I've told a story on the before so we had a ... a mild heart attack but the company's still issued him\nAs a standard because it had been so mild they they talked to his doctors or had gone to the hospital they they asked for information from the hospital I Believe they issued him as a standard which is which is a normal premium okay [noise]\nWhen the wife's got issued I called him up and said look your wife's condition yours is taking a little longer because the company needs to do some more research because of your health issue so why don't you come in and pick up your wife someone uses it should come pick up he was he said no when mine is issued will pick up both\nI Can't do anything about that and\nSo the company any insurance company if you don't accept the life insurance policy and say yes I'm taking it normally it's thirty days they close your case because you can apply and then they'll have second thoughts and say you know what this isn't really for me I don't want it\nWhich is what the company thinks if you don't actually take it\nSo the waves are in a case closed soon after the wife's case gets closed his gets issued\nSo I called them up again I said listen\nYour wife's policy that issued very very fast so the case closed but they're going to reassure would again very fast so now yours has been issued\nHow 'bout you come and pick up your nose and then would hers comes and you pick up her seat and he said the same thing to me when her's gets issued because it should be quicker than I'll pay will will solve by and pick up both again\nAgain what am I going to do I can't force them to come in\nSo hurts gets there should have been very very quickly I called them up they come back into the office and be based on his situation the company had a forum that I had to fill out and ask him some of the questions and the very first question is\nIs your help the same as it was when you initially applied for the policy\nAnd he put his head down\nAnd they didn't say anything and I looked at the wife and she's nodding no I said okay what gives what happened you had another heart attack he was in turn them hospital and this one wasn't as\nThat's the other one was mhm I have to put that down right yeah I have to send it in the company's going to be a medical record I directly absolutely the company declined to him he had already been offered the insurance company then declined him\nThey took the whites she still has her insurance today I and to this day whenever he comes in he always says\nI was a ... [laughter] right right right so uh but again I Can't make a person to do something they don't want to do\nYeah yeah no I'm just this might be a little off topic and um and maybe opening a can of worms ... especially in the last a few minutes of ... still arguments for 'em\nSo it in in that situation where someone would get denied a some life insurance uh-huh what ... what other options could they um [noise] I\nCould they explored to take care of the family\nWell what I said I'm there are plans that are offered\nA which was called guaranteed issue\nIt might not be enough to take care of the family but it will be at least ... of last expenses like what I was told them this gentleman so for this with a client gets denied but it's also based on age twenty year old getting denied might not be able to buy a guaranteed issue because normally this plant start at either forty forty five on up okay\nBut if the person is forty forty five on up in age\nAnd they declined for a regular immediate coverage life insurance policy and they can apply for for a a a a guaranteed issue\nUm and the questions they're pretty much three\nAre you on end stage renal failure are you in a nursing home and I forget what the other question is and if you can send notes all three you get as you you can have a you know once the grave but you will still get issued\n... I was curious to if there was I I Know there's a certain bank accounts that you can set aside a for funeral expenses are there any yeah Glendale in bank accounts that are um that you can kind of throw money and that can only be a withdrawn upon death\n[noise] uh not really because who's money is getting thrown in the account you're so yeah who has access to the account mhm so unless you're very disciplined unless you're very disciplined ... something happens you can read the account because in the origins that came up right okay\nOtherwise you can set up where you can go to the funeral home\nAnd prepay it's on installments from what I understand again I don't work for the funeral homes I'm not a funeral director art but if I if I'm not mistaken you can set up where your pre pain and installments pay or you can pre paid the whole thing if you have the money right now here's the thing that I have been told\nIn the past about life insurance [noise] nah I'm going to take the money that I was going to pay for the life insurance and I'm going to put it away and the bank\nWhich is kind of what you're asking here's the problem\n[noise] so let's say that your premium costs you a hundred dollars a month ago so the first month you put it away second month you might put it away\nThird my month might be if the if you're going to put it away and then you pass which family going to get three hundred bucks right now if you had applied the premium to the life insurance and you qualified\nOn your age depending on your health issues they might get fifty thousand or a hundred thousand or more them right now you were disciplined enough to put the money away\nFor three years\nWhat have you got into thirty six hundred dollars plus", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mid-Morning News Hour (WBSM)", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "20"}
