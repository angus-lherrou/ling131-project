Fox borrow right you've got a Fox or to see a show and you're going to pay a hundred and fifty bucks for a ticket a piece of this three hundred bucks poof read out the door and then they charge you forty bucks to park in the parking lot\n\nAnd then you get inside and oh you want to you ought to be your those are like what twelve bucks a head at Fox borough cup of coffee nine bucks for the law for big Dunkin' Donuts caught me nine bucks\n\nSo it's an event for a lot of folks to go to something like this there's some of the smarter big stars will say you know when I talk politics these people have saved all year to go see the show and now we're going to be on a ruin their night by talking politics don't want to talk politics\nBut beyond that a lot of the stars are smart enough to know that they can ruin their entire career\nBy getting into politics on stage because you've got to assume that half your audience is going to disagree with you\n\nAnd particularly in today's day and age where folks are so divided politics is very divisive the these days and ... it's more than just a friendly disagreement into blood sport\nYou can ruin your career us the Dixie Chicks right when the Dixie Chicks went over to to England and spoke out against Bush while we're at war that was that was basically the end of their career they're still out there they're still putting out some CDs and there's still a lot of travelling but nothing like they were and they were blacklisted for a long time I was in country radio at the time they see these were being burned people wouldn't take\nTheir tickets um\n[noise] so you got to wonder why any entertainer would even want to get into this whole thing about to endorsing somebody because it's it's it can be suicide it can be the end of your career you can lose half\nYour fan base when you were counting on people that's why the you know the NFL doesn't make sense to me when he got these moron kneeling during the national anthem knowing they're passing people off you are literally angering half of your your fan base that way you do the same thing with music and then with entertainer so I'm always looking at Hollywood\nShape Hollywood's it nobody will buy tickets to go and see movies that these are activist actors are starring in their careers are pretty much over there has been washed up look at Michael Moore's new movie they had to yank it it was so bad after after a week I think it was two weeks and they acted in\nThey were trying to pay the Peterson taken they finally had to close it because people are saying that they don't want that they don't want to pay money for that crap anymore\n\nSo Taylor Swift decided that she was going to get into the foray and you got to wonder what kind of impact this is going to have one or career but the the the the big part about all of this Taylor Swift is that\n\nDo you recall the last time a celebrity endorsement influenced your vote\nWho influenced your vote was Rob Reiner\nWas it um Rosie O'Donnell Barbra Streisand Taylor Swift anybody has an interest in entertainer ever influenced your vote\nWhen you're out they say well I'm going to vote for candidate a buddy Robb Reiner says I should vote for Kennedy so therefore I'm going to switch and I'm going to go vote for candidates who has that ever happened to you I Can't recall a case ever more celebrity endorsement has had any impact on me at all\nAnd celebrity impacts really are meaningless they don't mean a lot\nIf anybody cared about celebrity endorsements and celebrity endorsements were worth anything at all think about this Hillary Clinton wouldn't be president right now right not Donald Trump\nBecause all of the celebrities endorsed Hillary and all of the celebrities told you not to vote for Trump so there's exhibit a in terms of evidence that celebrity endorsements mean nothing\n\nIf celebrity endorsements meant anything at all Donald Trump would have been impeached by now because just about every Hollywood type is called for Donald Trump to be impeached right\nBut he has not\nIf celebrity endorsements meant anything at all guns wouldn't be outlawed because almost every celebrity has marched in cold for going to be outlawed\nIn guns another one\nAnd celebrity endorsements meant anything at all celebrities statements in politics that Kavanaugh's confirmation would not have occurred\nAnd it did so there's not a lot of mean pat from celebrity positions in politics you know with all due respect to the celebrities shot up and said because people love to hear you saying that they don't want to hear you speak\nVery little maybe limited if any impact whatsoever [noise] now what is it is unusual about Taylor Swift endorsement she backed the man\n\nAnd not just any man she backed the man in Phil Bredesen who is actually a staunch supporter of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd if that's not bizarre enough\nTaylor Swift does it mean to or\nTaylor Swift back what five years ago claim that she had been sexually assaulted remember that the whole case with a DJ she said the DJ she I guess she had this dress on issues where no no underwear under the dress and I guess this guy's stuck his hand up there and\nShe wound up winning a court case against them\n\nTo me to her so her politics are all over the place I guess her big gripe with Marsha Blackburn is their Marsha Blackburn did not support\nLegislation that would have forced a Baker to bake a wedding cakes for gay couple because it was against his religious beliefs that's the biggest gripe the Taylor Swift test I'm just curious whether or not\nI I mean you know tell us Web bulletin big story for for fourteen hours now right big news story Taylor Swift um endorses bread is sitting in the race in Tennessee I just don't get it I don't understand why this is a significant anything but it's what the media tells you is important\nI mean what is more important than that is what is happening\n\nWithin the socialist movement you know we've got all of these\nIt it's a it's like a clown show here it's like a circus you've got you know between the Chuck Schumer's and between the shows in White Houses and between the\nYou know the Maxine Waters that's the clown show that's the that's the clown car that's the car was you know the the Fifteen clowns jump out of it you know you got you got all of those people in the in the clown car\nUm but there was really some serious business going on within the socialist movement that we cannot ignore and we cannot\nLet it be overshadowed by the clown car because there is some serious stuff going on right now and in part of the serious stuff right now is Alexandria okay so you're Cortez\nCalling for the ball Schmidt of the electoral college in this country and she's not alone Hillary Clinton is out there campaigning for it and lots of other socialist Democrats are also calling for\nThe elimination of the electoral college the electoral college was put in place in this country for a reason\n\nIf the electoral college did not exist Hillary Clinton would have easily won the last election\nThe electoral college came in\nPlay in the ... election if you remember as well\nBut here's the reason why the electoral college not getting a great big diatribe over it because I think you understand this if you look at the map\nOf the United states right after two thousand sixty and after the election was over and you saw that\nNine tenths of that map was read in other words counties that were carried by Donald Trump and probably one tenth of the map was colored in blue those were counties that were carried by Hillary Clinton\nYou're talking about metro areas you're talking about New York city you're talking about ah what LA you're talking about um you know Providence Rhode Island you're talking about Chicago\nAre and how do we overcome that I don't know because facts won't do it right\nNow what I mean now Susan Collins over the weekend shows on TV as she was almost sounding like she was a college I think for her vote a ... and I wish Republicans who thought that\nYou know I mean I like Trump fight back right don't don't apologize I'll make it sound like the apologizing\nYou know what the Republicans remind me of right now that the the kid gets bullied all the time in school he's always getting pushed around pushed around and then one day she had enough and he hauls often wax the bully and they had knock them down\nThat's [laughter] that's what they reminded me of is like finally the Republicans they found and they've got to this weekend and they they did the right thing and you you've got Lindsey Graham now I'm going to go all around the country and I'm going to you know a campaign against the Democrats running for it\nThey found it and you know it's so unfortunate did have they found that their gods a year and a half to two years ago can you imagine you know it would healthcare and and all of the different things that Trump was trying to get them to do and they just kept out waffling and they were afraid and backing down in a you know knees buckled and everything\nI I'm almost afraid of these guys going forward now and they're going to stay unify do you think of what\nI I if if they follow Trump\nAnd let Trump pick the the hits because he's wrong so yeah I think they can get a lot of Congress 'cause a lot of Republicans have no backbone right uh you know that uh you could tell like Susan Collins because repeating or I Believe\nHer to soak credible ... if you look at it there's no evidence right ... I Wish there was not saying that\nI Know yeah you know what I mean\nYou know what it is I was saying that too and and the thing is I think she was credible but I I was saying that I Can't even remember what the way I was describing it uh\nI remember buying ... compelling I think that was the word everybody was using because it is difficult to call a woman you know the caller out I mean not learning we learned a lot of information now that we know that her story I didn't add up and there's all kinds of that or\nEven the woman today a map because they're saying that when we can tell when I Know the woman whose line sure I mean women on not idiots right there on me I mean my wife gives me a lot of vices [laughter] the goods from time to bet you they you know for Democrats think that women don't thanks\nYeah yeah so what are you on campus from no I I like the way you put that led Trump's if the Republicans would let Trump take me to follow him I think that was very well said it'd be Trump is willing to take the hit she can take the the huge let him go out there let him be the the block or in just one behind them and and\nI Wish the Democrats have done the sooner you know maybe they didn't maybe they didn't know that Trump was going to be able to withstand this marching industry will be around at this point and now they're seeing hey wait a minute this guy's not going down easy let's work with him because this is this is a conservative dream come true everything they've ... they've gotten\nTheir use that they have to jump on the bus and a for years now or even my uh my grandson he's which to me that in school they talk he will about Columbus and for years because same nothing but now we're going to say merry Columbus Day here\nMary Columbus Day again thank you my friend and I always appreciate hearing from you know not six o five hundred and Mary Columbus Day you're up next on WB ourselves\nThank you hey I'm confused about something I thought to live\nThat Warren on television to an end to the ... by a man yeah and he had a microphone but she had her um around him very close I've never seen anyone\nDo that and an added in the field if uh if it was the opposite a girl with the microphone what a guy put it in his I'm of a around him that looks kind of like strange\nSo the the the interviewer had a microphone and he was asking her questions and she had her um it she put all ... all over\nThe back of him where her hand and purple um could be seen\nOn his chest wow and I'm saying why she\nIs that a husband and I didn't understand that because I didn't think that look professional yeah and I've never seen anyone do that\nSo you don't know who the interviewer was no well I hadn't seen that that happened over the weekend a couple of days ago yeah yeah\nAnd and I I I'm not sure if it was in front of the Supreme Court okay when they it was after the vote I I Will look very very strange right and a woman would have said never touched me\nOh my God is can you imagine if a male reporter put her his hands on a on a female I mean that would have been a ...\nYes I I I found that very very strange I don't know what the symbolism was ah like she was almost like saying this is my buddy\nMm but it looked very very strange that the guy if it were the opposite sex I\nMight have to look that up when I get off the air so I can see it so I was kind of bizarre [laughter] I'm\nWondering if it was her husband collects it looks like that's what you would do would only a husband right\nBelow what her husband be doing interviewing or\nA while I was wondering maybe that was his job I'm not too sure\n... you know he's not in the media I don't recall what he does new but he's he's not a media guy\nYeah I just found it very very like whoa yeah somebody can could use this against or you know it's like all of this doesn't look like\nSo is is this all over do you think or do you or do you think we've we've not seen the last of this cabinet story\nI think they are going I think the Democrats\nI'm ruining and highly insulting educated a white woman especially college I guess thought they said that Trump having a problem with gaining their confidence well\nI'm a Democrat but I voted Republican right and I'm getting so angry I'm ready to change my late and so that I have an hour instead of the day\nBut I have you so so embarrassed with the mob and\nThinking that they can climb all over the statue and do anything they want like a well classroom right so\nThat the angry mob that's what Trump said the other night you can't give ... to an angry mob\nAnd I I'm I'm more civilized than that and just to show them it's like hey I I don't want any part of the you know this uh group\nRight well there's always a good idea to go independent anyway because that way you're you're free to go with whomever you want in its ... you know you're out of the country club that's just my opinion\nWriter I I did that years ago I dropped a party affiliation said no I think this is what you make them accountable you know they make you they they have to prove to you that they are the better alright yeah\nBut it's I think a slam to go to the opposite party and they oh yeah absolutely that was an independent they you might still be with them to\nMy friend ... thank you very much a Trump just landed in Florida is going to speak to other
