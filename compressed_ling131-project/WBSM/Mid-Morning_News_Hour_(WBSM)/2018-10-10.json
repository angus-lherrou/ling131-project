Daniel says this is what Democrats do they try to divide our country they try to incite anger when we saw that play out through the campaign she says she believes the American public can see through the left this propaganda and will vote for Republicans in November in the midterms because they want a strong economy in a safe country\nShe says and I quote we're delivering results of the Republican Party three point seven percent unemployment the lowest in history for African Americans and Latinos and the sixty five year low for women\nWe are a party that is making lives better for families across the country so Democrats are going to continue the policies of destruction and Republicans are going to continue the policy of results\n\nWhat do you make of Hillary Clinton and we pick an honor I'll buy that wasn't the only a news making headlines from that to interview with Christie on 'em and\nPoor by the way it was more there was more\nBecause of course the on I'm poor who pretty much is it Clinton bootleg liquor\n\nConducted an interview full of softball questions this was going to air uh what is it going to hear what is it gonna air may have a reading of it because so much of it is out of mayor the mayor and already I don't watch CNN so I don't know what\nI'm\nActually been on already but two so she leads are into a question about Bill Clinton you guys going out on the road together\nAnd look this guy is accused of you know a lot of sexual shenanigans on his oh he's been accused of raping women how you're going to deal with is how you got to deal with it\nI'm In port interviewed Clinton about the adjoining speaking tour that begins after the midterm she said you say that you were going to talk about the difficulties that your husband went through\nThat you went through obviously you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight the impeachment the allegations of sexual misconduct against your own husband\nAre you prepared to answer those questions I'm In port asked is he prepared to answer them and how do you see that similar or different from what President Trump is being accused them and cabinet and others today\nSo Clinton responded by saying the allegation against her husband were totally different because partisan politics were involved hey you mean as in a vast right wing conspiracy is that what you're trying to say\nShe said quote there is a very significant difference and that is the intense long lasting partisan investigation was conducted in the Nineteen nineties if you know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down\nWant a comparison they should welcome such an investigation themselves Clinton concluded while nodding her head in silence for a few seconds\nAnd to the interview\nAnd an interview questions about one yeah\nWhy NATO Broderick or any of the other women specifically Paula Jones or any of the other women came forward and said they were raped\nOr groped physically where's the question is about Monica Lewinsky you know the lady with a blue dress on one of those questions\n\nBut Hillary said it was along partisan investigation against their husband and Trump ought to have one of those two\nI got Trump was already undergoing a long part is an investigation that cold Russia gate\n\nBut Hillary Clinton or the other so quick to accuse cabinet all of wrongdoing I Believe the woman\nBut yet in the case of bill while I was just along partisan investigation that was very different from anything that we've seen going on today [laughter] yeah it was because rather than the media going after Bill Clinton when there was actually accidents that have done something wrong to me it was hush hush\n\nYet they attack Canada all without evidence and want to condemn here without even a jury trial right\n\nThis is the media cashing in on people's misery because again worst storms than this ... state of Florida maybe not in that spot\nBut they have ... state of Florida so thoughts and prayers to all the people that are being victimized twice by the storm getting hit by the storm and getting hit by the media too and um it's a shame I mean a lot of people are going to a lot of people are gonna be injured ... there will be some doubts and there will be a lot of destruction from the storm\nA but keep it all in perspective a Florida gets hit with hurricanes Florida gets hit with major hurricanes and has been hit with bigger hurricanes than this before\nAnd um that's all you simply need to know um\nMy buddy Ken Pitman texted me during the break to remind me that the uh the guy who assaulted Rand Paul Rand Paul's neighbor as he was a mowing his lawn was a New Bedford native remember that I went to high school and then we graduated the same year I didn't know I'm In school but\nAh we actually went to high school together [noise] All right uh apparently not a whole lot of interest in Hillary uh which doesn't surprise me sending most people just want Hillary to go away but uh there's a story on the table for you and uh you know if you'd like to pick it up and go with it um I I think that Hillary Clinton and I think that um\n\nMaxine Waters\nAnd some of these other folks are certainly responsible\nIf\nRand Paul fears somebody get shot somebody gets assassinated that happens I think they were they were they share the responsibility for it but uh\nAnd I mentioned to you since we're talking baseball baseball very much in the air the Cleveland Indians where an ceremony asleep bounced out on their tuition is on Monday Night\nAnd day out of the play offs\nAnd along with them along with the Cleveland Indians being voted a\nJeep why who is gone\nAnd some of you out there are probably saying hello hello Steve wow achieve ... who is the mascot for the Cleveland Indians I Know you've seen his picture he is on the emblem on their hats the emblem on their sleeves\nAnd\nHas been the mascot all the Cleveland Indians for the last Seventy one year since Nineteen forty seven Chief Wahoo ... who is gone now the Cleveland Indians ah gave in to pressure to get rid of\nChief Wahoo by the\nTwo thousand Nineteen season but decided that when the when the team that bounced out of the playoffs and on Monday Night that maybe that might be the time to do it plus retired Chief Wahoo right now\nI'm\nChief Wahoo apparently was offensive to some Native Americans and do other non Native Americans\nWho have been trying to get the team to retire him for some time now um you know this is not new it's all throughout sports Washington Redskins or you've got a lot of local teams to\nGet a lot of local teams that we've had people here in Massachusetts I mean they're Massachusetts\nNew England\nLot of connections to Native Americans Indians here you know for\n... see a panic would uh [noise]\nPanic when Indians I I don't recall but it probably would have I think as a dark myth of course\nA\nLot of the teams high school teams and a lot of pressure to do away with references to\nTo Indians Atlanta Braves um\nAbout a year ago we were talking about this because there was a woman from I think late bill that was attempting to have a law passed in Massachusetts that would ban the use of any kind of Native American mascots or names\nAssociated with the teams and that is pretty ridiculous then\nWe've got a call from a woman who I I won't say who has publicly right now but a woman who um I Know is a a\nA quaint of ... and uh she called in to the program and said you know this is a lot of basically what she said and I'm just not rebate him obviously this I'm kind of a lot of crap because most Indians do not\nTake offense by these names\nAnd and she expressed concern that if we wipe out all of these references to Native Americans and we don't think we're talking about Native Americans anymore I'm\nKind of ... the history and that's not a good thing because\nAmericans Indians American Indians are huge\nEspecially here in New England but all across the country all across the country\n\nI think we've done a poor job in educating ourselves about Native Americans in this country\nThey real long before any European settlers were here and we did our best to eradicate a lot of the tribes there were here\n\nBut I think we we need to if I'm gonna study real American history we need to understand about these tribes and we shouldn't be studying them we should be learning about how they lived in where they lived\n\nI'm Amazed when I go out west and and you know you see so much more appreciation of the of the Indian culture in this country than you do around here\nBut I Would hate to live in such a sanitized society that we can't say the Dartmouth Indians anymore that somehow or another that's offensive\nThat there has been there have been pulled over the years about all of this and whether uh Indian mascots or names such as the red skins are offensive and I got to tell you folks is dizzying because\nThe polls have been all over the place on this I've seen polls have of Native Americans I've seen polls have just Americans in general and the polls are all over the place on this there doesn't seem to be any consistency in the in the polls that I've read at least anyway and I did a review of it again this morning on line just to make sure I knew what I was talking about [noise]\nBut the national Congress of American Indians\nThe national Congress of American Indians says that while who Chief Wahoo is offensive I Will yield\n\nTo the Congress as American Indians if they say it's offensive do they have ... who am I hearing debate that if they say it's offensive I I take the word for either offended by it so I Will I Will I Will view to them now\n\nSomehow or another I have a sneaking suspicion that we haven't seen the last the cheap waffle yet\nSomehow I have a sneaking suspicion um that a lot of this is is is driven by a political correctness you know you talk about the Atlanta Braves every brave is ... when my friend who is the uh quite a whopping ... told me at the time\nThat a lot of these references were actually shows of respect that are being mischaracterized somehow by people who want to be offended by staff\n\nSo I'll take that from somebody who is a lump in India and I'll take that into consideration as well but somehow or another I think that we will get past this political correctness at some point and I suspect the Chihuahua will re surface or because you see\nSports teams\nConstantly it seems like every season they make some kind of alteration or change to their to their uniforms\nThat you and I run back to the stores and buy another hundred and fifty dollar Jersey right because you got to have the new law patriots you got to have a new look whatever I mean look at that all the money that was that we spent when we went from a minute man patriots to um Elvis patriots right and then as soon as everybody\nIt gets rid of their met a man patriots stuff and goes out and buys the eldest patriots stuff what do they do\nWell they'd bring back the Patriot guy right well they're both now so that you can buy both right old school logos\nSo somehow or another I don't think that Chief Wahoo was gone for good I think we'll see him again\nAnd his face will pop up and a couple of years on a retro Jersey and millions of dollars will be spent by fans including", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mid-Morning News Hour (WBSM)", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "10"}
