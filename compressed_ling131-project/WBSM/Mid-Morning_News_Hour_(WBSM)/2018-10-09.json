Harris from California lightweight a lot of light weights out they're\nCrazy uncle Joe he's an old\nLightweight he's he's run for president a couple of times and has not been successful so I you know I think the Democrats\nThe same Democrats that are I mean Bill Clinton maybe a crook but he's saying I'm uh looking at the same as saying well wait a minute there's nobody out in that field it can be Trump nobody strong enough to be Trump\nSo I think Bill Clinton is looking at this and saying hey you know what there is a possibility that in a crowded field Hillary could get the nomination\nNow the problem is convincing the public never really liked Hillary to begin with\nUm to vote for and I think they're going to try\nMaybe a softer Hillary I Know is that possible and then put Hillary out there on the road for Thirteen city touring and just see what the reaction is see what the response is you know with the Democrats out there those middle class middle of the road Democrats that I often ask you about\nI didn't look at Hillary and say well you know what\nShe's a piece of work but she is far better option than some of these mug bags that we're seeing out there\nThat are all left wing socialists so who knows does anybody think that bill and Hillary of testing the waters for a Hillary Clinton run in twenty twenty could it be and what about the Democrats\nSaid that they are trying to write this boat and trying to kick these liberals these uh these socialist that occurred what do they think\nIt's like you know it's like\nTo get that that news you know that that staying out of your favorite blue dress that you just can't seem to get out and they always there doesn't go away\nThat that's like the Clintons you know and um\nThey just won't go away I think a lot of Democrats would prefer to see some young I'm aspiring future thinking\nMore moderate Democrats emerge rather than have to either go to the socialist so go back to the well from yesterday and drink a drag out you know bite in order to Hillary or whatever\nUm but there just isn't anybody there\nMichelle Obama cannot win ... that's ... that's an impossibility have these Democrats that have been mentioned so far don't lose big time to Trump's\nBig league vaguely\nSo what do you think about Hillary Clinton hitting the road do you think this is a campaign a kind of a ... a warm up or or test the waters trial balloon speaking tour and I wonder what she's going to drop off a crowd she thinks anything like the crowd said that Trump gets at his rallies got another one tonight in Ohio do you think you\nI don't [noise] All right by the way ... five hundred let's get to calls want to start right here you're first then WB us and good afternoon\nA parrot kept talking about something else when he got on your mind\nOr the ballot was shoes I just received to fire this three questions yeah valid yep uh one is about limits simulations from news the other one is about nursing yeah but the one on what we'll let you talk to you about I don't know if you've got a flyer yet\nYeah I've uh I've already made my opinion of I've already decided how I Will vote and all three questions that I was going to do a show on it but I mean ... that's fine looking we can start talking today about it absolutely\nYeah yeah ... that's where I was worried about your show like\nThat because the third one about making it harder the constitution that men can go into a woman's\nBathroom yeah this very yep I mean part of the constitution it's already state law\nWere but they want to make it a part of the constitution up the space for the can never be changed and it's\nYeah I mean yeah they want to seal it in there and ah yeah yeah I mean is it just goes back to the bathroom bill ... Baker signed late friday night uh about a year or so ago\nAnd this uh supposedly gives rights to a a transgender folks to be able to use the bathroom other choice in the ... of the bathroom that goes along with their their birthright and all that it's disguised as a civil rights bill\nRight right but I you know I I just can't understand how a question like that could be on a ballot and and\nWell here here's the reason why it's about well let me let me explain why it's on the ballot because the law has already been passed and what this is a referendum from people who do not support the law it's a ballot initiative from people who don't support that they're asking you if you want to repeal it\nNow it's very tricky because when you think about what do you want to repeal it you're thinking that your vote\nWould be yes I Want to repeal it but a yes vote keeps the law on the books or no vote would repeal it\nIt's just ... yeah you're the\nAuthor okay so I'm reading the wrong way\nIf you want it to go away your vote no because what they're asking what the question kind of asks you if you want to see this permanent law in Massachusetts\nOkay the the warnings turkey though\nIt is very tricky so you want if you want to see this go away then you know\nOr they were thank you for that because I was extremely confused with this yeah uh so I definitely want to go though I wasn't sure what the way it was worded is very confusing\nYeah it is it absolutely is and then again they disguise it as a civil rights law\nI mean we had a ... or the or a state representative or from west\nAnd you think of his name up on my head represents part of the north end any bad for two on the program and this was happening he was talking about how this was this important bill as the civil rights bill I'm Nineteen sixty five\nAnd I'm like dude how many times have you been kicked in the head by one of your columns this is not a civil rights bill 'cause it's a civil rights bill and that's insulting to anybody who is impacted by the civil rights movement on the civil rights bill this is a special a protection for special interest group\nAnd it what it does is it allows man who feel connected with their you know with their ah feminine side to be able to go into girls GM's\nGirls locker is a girl shower rooms in schools and and all of this kind of stuff and use the bathroom of their choice or not based on their their plumbing based on what they feel like today\nYou know and so yeah so I mean if you want if you want guys to go in and the grandmother or your daughter take a shower with your daughter in school then you vote yes with us if you want to get rid of that you know\n... thank you for for educating me\nYeah no problem I'm going to get deeper into the ... all of these questions I don't have my red book with me but we're going to try to schedule some of these people that are are sponsoring these things and I tried to talk about it a little bit more uh the nursing one is very confusing too and that's very deceiving that's question one\nYeah I don't think most average person ... even the talking about\nYeah what what we're going to go through it yeah this is the first\nYear the other one above the ah the elections are spending yeah the the the United States Supreme court already ruled on that ... ... you know what I mean yeah again\nYeah I I've never been one who supports the government telling me how much money I can spend you know I don't think the government has that real ... I'm going to vote no one to I'm going to vote no on all three of them actually\nRight so that's that's just that you know I I don't think that the the ... the ... the nurse staffing thing I'm most nurses oppose it or is going to cost the commonwealth over a billion dollars a potentially hospitals are gonna you know potentially forced to close\nI'm going to have to turn people away because you got to meet certain staffing levels that are set by the government and again I don't think the government should have a role telling local hospitals how to how to run their business I Want to smaller government not a bigger government so\nWe're ... or ... there's valid or the you know governing by voucher stop this is confusing\nWell this is Massachusetts and we are we're one of a handful of states that have an issue to petition instead of legislators doing their job or letting private industry do their job we've got the uh you know we've got an issue to petition it's just like the marijuana thing instead of the the the state legislature or\nA debating a bill on on whether to legalize marijuana they put it on the ballot let the public decide and that's not why we have a legislature ever going to let the public decide everything why don't we fire all these guys with a great big pay raises what are they doing there\n[laughter] I mean if we're going to decide all these things why we shouldn't get that money in and get them the hell out of there\nRight more anyway very thanks for the education here because now or not which way to vote\nFor gene pool only below UPS [laughter]\n[noise] and the way this life plays\nRight welcome back to the program much wealth thirty nine did you hear about this story out of ... England [noise]\nAh we're a Seventeen year old boy had falsely been accused of rape [noise]\nHome themselves [noise]\nFalsely accused of rape you hang himself Seventeen years old and um\n[noise] after he died the accusation was recanted okay\nI'm as a result his mother fifty five year old mother Karen ... actually the family name sir I'm not sure where in England Mrs but a ... um said that she couldn't foresee a future couldn't see a future without her son\nJay and I'm so she hung herself to\nSo this is that where we were in the United states they're less than a week ago right falsely accusing people of rape Seventeen year old kid\nHangs himself\nAnd then the accusation is recanted but the mother still doesn't matter that her son's name has been a clear now but she lost her son so a fifty five ... herself by the way nine six o five hundred a crazy world we're living in right in Europe next the w._b. us and thanks for hanging on\nOver there that is terrible unbelievable how oh then yeah\nBut how does your dog or a snake this money on made money\nOn my he was an investor I'm not quite sure I read about him I read a little bio on him one time how he\nMade his money I think there's a whole different a lot of things real estate ah um investment in in into various things I think he inherited some of his money I'm I'm gonna have to do a quick a brain refreshing on that because I don't recall entirely a they had\nTo have a book out or something like that\nKnow I'm not sure I mean I I don't know that he does um I remember researching it on line one time I don't do that yeah it wasn't all that long ago\nUm if it just so you can check out what the PDF yep and uh you know and that's probably one of the sources that I read yeah\nNow the second thing I wanted to ask before I forget what I Want to ask you a last night did you happen to watch the swearing in ceremony as\nThe White House I did\nI was watching the red Sox pre game on TV and I had my phone I'm propped up against the lamp next to my chair and I was watching the watching the swearing in there and listening to the president\nNow did you notice the Supreme Justice Ginsberg did not clap one no one time I\nDid it look up when the president ... uh you know acknowledge all of them she didn't even ... how can you be so damn road\nYou know at first I was wondering if she was asleep or because she has been known to knock off before\nNearly when if you notice during the when the president delivers the state of the union the members of the Supreme Court you not applied because they're supposed to be a political right this must be above the political fray and all that\nI'm In in ... at first when when Trump started to talk I noticed that nobody in the Supreme Court the ... you know the roads and the Supreme Court justices were sending it were applauding but as he went on ... and the others were plotting and yet in in she was not\nYou know I almost it almost look like very she was a mentally disturbed or something I mean they have a plus on her like she did not even two at night which uh you know anyone they ah what do we need her they have far\nWell she's made public statements which I think more outrageous than anything or that the Kavanaugh has said about a booth thing in boxing and Ralph singing all of that kind of stuff\nI didn't uh she's means more outrageous statements about moving out of the country if Trump was elected and uh when I read that yeah in worrying about the uh the stability the Supreme Court or the validity of the Supreme Court if Kavanaugh is appointed she's not supposed to be saying stuff like that\nSo childish how does that woman she's like eighty five\nEighty five well I Know a lot of people that are eighty five at a very shop they look nice um and this woman\nAnd she certainly didn't present a good uh to me she looked like I don't know the the or maybe the people at cleaned the rooms they are I don't know what she looked like but she certainly didn't look very professional\nOh you you've never seen her before oh oh oh okay I'm from the neck up okay [laughter]\nWhat she had my God I sit\nThere and like gold one final get no even they don't\nFor the sake of those children that were there you know the daughters everybody was so happy and to set the election was had a cramped or something\nYeah yeah yeah there was one point where she didn't actually look over and then when they went that yeah when they were sitting down there was one point that she did look over a but then ah I mean she was kind of leaning thought I was afraid she was going to fall on the floor [laughter] I'm not sure I was gonna go here's\n... woke her up or [laughter]\nThing I don't know she's just I don't know what she needs thank you

she's got to go for Ninety years old before she gets out\nKnow I don't I don't mean to pick on her I really don't because she is she's an older woman and she still out there working real hard and and\nI can respect her for that she's going to stay until she's Ninety because the Democrats ... she has no choice ah because yeah because they can't afford to have jumped appointed now the Supreme Court justice\nNot to interrupt you a battery but Deitch she's not a Trump supporter\nOh absolutely I trust me\nNo no she's not a Trump supporter at all she's made that clear no\nNo and um I I like to
