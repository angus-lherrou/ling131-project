it back together using all sorts of means um\nYeah we uh you know we've certainly interviewed an awful lot of people I mean they're they're just about everybody in South Boston ah\nI'm quoting as family members and interview people\nI'm all over the country that he had some contact with in places as remote as a Grand Isle Louisiana in Chicago and New York and California but also we ... we did an awful lot of work overseas in\nPlaces where he had been and set up either a bank accounts or a safe deposit boxes so that included in Montreal when doubling and London\nAnd uh there was one on the European continent trying to remember that was but\nIn a you literally had to go to all of these places and ... yeah or send agents and ... um FBI agents everywhere\nYou know we had um because we get we get we get calls all the time I'm from the most remote places and and ordinarily most of those can get rid get shifted out as being not credible are just not enough information to act on\nA but sometimes you had to act on them so we acted on leads and places are remote as the you know Brazilian Amazon there was somebody who you know they could get a call from the\nAmerican embassy in Brasilia uh uh you know saying that somebody had reported\nSt Paul's hearing some town on up there the Amazon like literally in the jungle right now that we had to run that down we had sent a an agent to the coast of Cambodia there's there was a one story where\nYou know we got a call from the American embassy in ... pen that uh Bolger was cited and an Irish pub on the on the Cambodian coast\nIs it an Irish pub now so just think about that so westerners [laughter] I mean there are Irish pubs are kind of like Chinese restaurant and try and ... and and and there are western ex patriots in all corners of the globe seemingly and\nUm we um so we sent reset than agent or to put on tend to go down to the coast and uh and he sat at the bar and I'm about an hour later a guy who looked a lot like Bolger um\nThen pull up to the bar clearly wasn't him and the agents were shut me down the bard said guess why I'm here in August and I do would you mind if I take your finger it's all no no no for that [laughter] they they had they had to laugh and ah and that was that that was it but there was some you know that they did was they were there were times like that where you still have the run\nRun things down you know in retrospect you know we did we did get at one point\nBut there are some you know that they did was they were there were times like that where you still have the run run things down you know in retrospect you know we did we did get at one point they\nAttempt um say two thousand nine issue that ah someone who looked a lot like him was on the Santa Monica pier right\nNow right near where he was ultimately found but there was just no other detail you know that was that that was a long and short of it so we couldn't do\nAnything about it um and as you know as time went on um you know we started to focus more on Cathy Greg his girlfriend and you know rather than having you know focusing so much on him right if we assumed that she was still alive and that was you know an assumption\nThat um she might be easier to find that him and uh and so you know efforts were were you know directed toward her so we started you know we were able to find more pictures of her and from a number of sources and\nUh we knew that she had been a dental hygienist so we put pictures out and um magazines that dentist offices subscribed to like professional journals and we knew that she had plastic surgery when her twenties and so\nAh you know it's someone's getting plastic surgery in their twenties would probably likely to get more as time goes on right and so you know we were doing the same with you know cosmetic surgeon a professional journals as well and stuff like that and then ... and then ultimately the public service announcement that was geared toward women\nUm and her um alternately a land of the tips so and that that's a it's it's I mean there's no denying it you know this story about Bolger and his wife a is you know this is the stuff of books and movies\nWas just going to get a handle can you on this one I've been in a couple of the books but have you read a book and all I Know I don't know the Nobel coming now to my\nFellow on Whitey now now there's a lot of stuff I Can't\nTalk about what I'm Talking about now wisely has been made public here where there's a lot of stuff particularly ... including\nYou know a number of things that we did in the grand jury in some other you know investigative measures that you know I Can't like down at liberty to talk about but now I'm trying to be cute about I just had a legally permitted to do that but um [noise] uh you know as it is is no doubt it's a fascinating story\nAnd he was the idea is that a Monica right in a NATO to read a lot of apartment buildings signing spotted him with a camera on the phone or something and you can take care of them\nThough was what was the woman who um you know saw one of the advertisements and\nWho called in and said you know I saw somebody look just like them in Santa Monica and I you know right near the Santa Monica the third street prominent examined Santa Monica in Santa Monica has this nice like sort of outdoor mall right near the water that's you know a big shopping area\nAnd so they you know they are Jimmy Bolger and Whitey Bolger used to comb Jimmy Bolger 'cause all the witnesses called them Jimmy Bolger\nWhitey Bolger and Kathy Greg lived um about three blocks away from the surgery prominent in\nIn um Santa Monica now retrospect it made a lot of sense right because we knew\nAmong other things that he really wanted to live in a place that was warm you wanted to live in a place near the water you want it to um he was on a heart medication or a tennis all a which is I think it's a hypertension a medication\nAnd he couldn't readily go to a drugstore couldn't go right away to go to a CBS to get that but you could drive down to Tijuana and and\nAnd Mexico and buy a lot of that because you know so much of what's\nYou know prescribe to the United states is can be bought over the counter in Mexico so you know so ... and ... and by the way this is what what was unique about Santa Monica remains you know remains one of the few communities in the United states that still has rent control so if you can get a rent controlled apartment\nYou can live on limited means for a long time and no rights you know you couldn't go out and get a job he had stashed away a lot of money and that he knew that I'm a number of his bank accounts were burnt right so we knew he knew he suspected that we knew\nAbout his bank account for instance in London at Barclays right so\nRich you didn't touch for years when we were intercepting the bank statements for a long time and and uh you know he wasn't touching that so he was you know ... certainly savvy enough to know that that was you know he couldn't access that money and I'm sure some of the other bank accounts\nSo what he did was um [noise] uh so we had all this cash and was able to get a rent controlled apartment and knowing it so he had a one or two bedroom apartment that paid just a few hundred bucks for a month you know in a very otherwise very affluent place\nSo it all in retrospect that all made a lot of sense\nSo I mean there's still a story that he's got a safe deposit boxes with money stashed all over the place that nobody knows where where it is I mean is there any there may be I mean most of the some of them were found\nThere was one in Montreal there was one one in London was one in Dublin um there was one in\nFort Lauderdale says these are the ones that are just coming to mind that may have been other than their ... their they may well than others that we never found\nAmong so she's still in prison right and she'll be in prison for another couple of years [noise] yeah so she was convicted of harboring a fugitive yeah did you see the movie black mask or is it minimum wage was a close to reality would sometimes Hollywood takes yeah\nI think so no I'm you know Johnny Depp plays ball Germany and um you know he's a he's an extraordinarily talented actor um and ah I think it's you know it's pretty convincing yeah I think it's a pretty accurate\nAnything about that story idea or about the case in general that that might surprise people that they didn't know about I mean anything that say well what's been set on it over the years um\nYou know I mean I\nYou know so when we're working on like the case the task force we had um\nYou know there are lots of folks out on the public ... you know who insisted that the government didn't want to find him right and you know some of its understandably corrupted a number of positive FBI agents there was some\nUh there was one you know it's just us attorney in Boston back in the seventies that uh has since passed away who are the ... that some of suspected was and corrupted in the case\nSo um you know I mean I like I get that um\nSuspicion but you know the reality was working away at it and if anything the the\nYeah the task force was was spending an awful lot of government money right we're flying agents around the world that's not cheap and uh but you're so the the the bureau in particular which was funny most of the funding most of the task force was you know not not pinching pennies on this thing in fact they're spending\nCushman as south of the downtown I'm like Bertie in guardians of people are familiar with that development so I offer all that background my take on it is is this\nI Want to do something that works well with the neighborhood but they're really only two options either you do this deal more in all likelihood we're going to have to demolish that building and that will do two things at all\nOr you know bill will it'll be the loss of an historic property a school that had been there for a hundred years right and by the way it will probably cost the city about a million dollars to uh to demolish right and and if they are to leave the state you know a gap\nOr in the street right there which won't look great um but just just just to complete the thigh know some people are concerned about low income housing they're proposing\nUm I forget how many ... Eighteen something in the teens upon number of apartments I forget I forget the exact number but half of them would be\nUm designated a low income and I totally get in and you know we've had these discussions before saline\nAbout you know my you know reluctance to bring on more subsidized housing right we do there are different when I Would suggest to folks is that there are different kinds of subsidized housing um you know I've been concerned about the use of section ... vouchers because they're not that closely\nRegulated or at least compared to other forms of of housing subsidy\nAnd the reality is that in our real estate market um it it is very hard to redevelop or property without some level of subsidy and those are the only ones that would work that question always as well who's going to manage and afterwards is at a responsible manager\nOr is it an irresponsible manager we have lots of irresponsible property owners around the city as you and I both know saline and we've crack down on them are in this particular and and and those folks and I won't name names but I think a lot of people are familiar with those names of any of those folks\nAbout the site I'd say no no I'm interested in this particular case cruise John crews and and and and his family I think a very responsible and ... and I thought\nWell I have nothing against the development\nI give you a very want us to be a brief question ... and I did a very long time line waiting I let you\nKnow I can hang up now I Would say are ... and I'm totally against the project I suggested that either a community center for you or I you know raise those people\nThat live in those neighborhoods with three and four families tenements in some houses they made their parking parking is outrageous up\nThere in the name of it were a lot of people there I might help spoke against it yeah unless it was you know these people need parking up there it's really people were living on\nThe African we had to they they can't even walk in front of their homes they have to pack elsewhere and walk today at home\nYeah it's a it's a legitimate that's a legitimate concern all I Would say is there some angel would sure a community center would be great but who's going to pay for it right like the the city the city doesn't have the money to to build a brand new right unity center so\nYeah I think I think you know I'd like to someday do that in the north than we drill most of our community centers are rec centers are all\nIn the southern half the city you know there there would be useful to have something like you know Miami I drew McCoy Center somewhere in the north end but we're really not near that in constructing something like that would require funds that signals and we have right now\nWell thank you very much for your time\nYeah no ... no I I appreciate your bringing up its it's legitimate you know you and I might not might not agree on on the course but that's you know but right now are you and I agree and I'm like Ninety nine percent of everything else Celine\n... good to know [laughter] actually the comic around five or six o five hundred or so is there a timeline for when the decision has been being made by this and who makes the decision to use the citizen\nShould the city council property committee and then the full city council\nOkay is there a timeline by which they have to act on this\nYou know not formally no but you know if you're in the position of the developer you're only going to wait so long it's actually going to say you know what they're not doing anything about it I'm going to move on to my next project\nYeah isn't it a case where generally when did like that or is it a shot\nIn the bits commanded they're only valid for so long before they expire in the process you are in some instances I think it depends on what the ah the European requests for proposals says and I don't know if there's a deadline on this one but I think there are a fact that they\nThey have to act on it at some point because the developers just ... just won't just say look I've had enough\nFive or six or five hundred your next to the mayor thanks for hanging on good morning gentlemen hey morning\nJohn ... who days out of the year you get to take off your costs too so this is who we really see what other customs\n[laughter] I'm not leaving federal prosecutor\nPolitician alright hey keep it in a neighborhood a behind the male the big field at the box company and factory mhm I Know there was committees going on and meetings I haven't heard it on a couple of years is anything looking good over there or what\n[noise] yeah so this is a\nLot of people would remember is the co dressed side pain and the pain cutlery site ah right there at the end the church street in the southern and the church street\nShow um it's city owned and you know there's been some interests by some commercial developers of late to do something over there you know I'm tied to me but that's another property you know if you so\nYou know I Know that should winner in San ... owns a much of the property across the street where there's an old and corrugated used to be right if you remember that pilots\nThe tracks and by the railroad tracks and uh and so they may be interested in human obviously they can they can speak for themselves Henry winner Ken I'm but because they've expanded their business isn't really nicely a over on ... street on the other side of the tracks\nUm you know they may need some more room um but again that's been no guarantees there\nI'm so we'll see we've put it out that's another property that we put out a couple of times and and both times and this is in the last I guess five years maybe longer maybe that was one of the one of the occasions was before I took office one when I was in office and maybe slightly off about that but in any event\nYou know there were no takers you know the land is cleaned up now and so you know there may be more interest but uh\nYou know you'd like to see some combination of of you know I'd like to see some kind of commercial development there because we put the property back on the tax rules and there are you know this is that everybody wants more Parkland but of course parks\nYou know they don't ... pay taxes but you know we want more parts we built the bill five clock since I became ... small parks and you know the reality is that um there are parks within you know I'm I'm a reasonable walk of their\nHigh fiber waiting on that six o five hundred year next inevitably is I'm Diane\n... yes it did yeah good afternoon\nAlready yeah it is indeed\nAlmost died out because the\nPower elite that story and on the\nTable for the longest I did it feel about the drug dealer than there how people get the table I don't know that all day every place that I that I don't mean probably well why am I white vote it\nDoes it get tired of it because they were like April I have no problem but I think probably the right people what the I mean by the control of all this get ... get a free\nI let me let's go let let let me get a word in edgewise scan your understanding of the\nMost talked about subsidized housing a lot and I think you know compared certainly to my predecessors I've not promoted the\nUm the addition of subsidized housing in the city you know in fact we've tried to reduce the footprint of public housing so we just had to cut the ribbon on a new public housing complex\nI'm a west one over on liberty street you know and that's a\nThat was a site that had I think it was thirty units and the Patrick administration wanted to replace every one of them one by one and I said no we're not we need to reduce or footprint and so they you know the ultimately did they are they added it replaced it with\nTwelve handicap units set a thirty regular units will ten percent under the law ten percent is is required to be a well now that's that's that's a separate totally satisfied with the way he's referring to he's referring to a public housing\nHe's referring specifically to trip towers on ... street and ways in more particularly he's referring to the fact that\nYou know some of the elderly housing that there have been disabled or younger folks who have been introduced to\nUm elderly housing in the city and that's you know there are some there was some issues there has to do with the housing authorities funding and you know the housing authority acts independently of city government so it's not like I have control over that I take his point you know I I we're not looking to expand public housing and\nIn the city and and if in in my dorm my time there actually reduced it right by the way down to sixty five hundred year next to the mayor good afternoon\nHello you're on the air oh oh now I'm In that town [laughter] I Know a lot I can promise\nAnd we have here we are getting a chemical K now to my water at the end of the day ... and the man came down last Thursday they catch my downfall a couple of minutes and then they'll the man that came up with a young man that everything was OK downfall\nI get bottled water well that's not that I was packing something might be
