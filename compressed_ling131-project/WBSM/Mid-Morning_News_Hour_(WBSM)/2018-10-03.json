make very good grandfather have [laughter]\nSo and it is an election year and um you know we've talked about this before and and and I know uh uh the various candidates all coming knocking this time of year looking for your endorsement last time I spoke to you you weren't ready yet to endorse or the Democrat nominee for governor Jay Gonzales have you made any decisions in that area at this point you\nGot it I Would like to my house today Sharon right here I mean there's got to my phone is a lot of live here I Am so um how convenient him [laughter] I Know making no announcements\nToday I mean obviously as a as a\nYou know I I Am a Democrat and so you know I Would presume to support a dumb or the Democratic nominee and [noise] um let's not to say that I Would agree with him on every and every matter and there are some you know some things that I agree that the\nYou know the current governor on some things I think he's done well some things I think that they need some improvement um but I'm\nI'm you know I'll I'll make that decision when it comes but you know I Am a Democrat so it's even people shouldn't be shocked that I didn't go walking with you know a number of other mayors to endorse a Republican governor and it's um you know my\nIn my view is you know I I have a party affiliation I also want to make sure that we're doing the best absolutely best thing above all for this to the city and so you know way all those things together before I make my decision\nHis party affiliation more important than I'm endorsing the better candidate and the guy is getting better plane or the gal who's got a better plan for the city I mean Gonzales this time of taxes and then you know raising taxes on endowments for the colleges which would ultimately mean that New Bedford residents will be paying more for tuition or we lose money for a for\nWe don't have a we don't have a college from one of the few sub national government earlier mom Massachusetts reading and we go to school but I Would actually I think I'd actually would would resign\nA benefit to the right to manage just looking out for the most parochial sense 'cause it's not you know if we if we if we had like two or three major universities in the middle of the city I you know I Would probably think differently about it but strictly from you know from um\nYou know the net benefit that direct financial benefit a prospect of a New Bedford will probably be uh they would probably gain from them and loose but in answer to your more mature broader question um\nYeah I mean it's the city's interests first and and I think there's some things that Governor Baker has done well and there are some things that that a concern\nMe in a specially especially as I see them through the prism of this of New Bedford zone interests um you know there's there's um there are a number of things actually so give me give me an example of something that is then that's kind of\nWell I mean I'll just throw this out your name him in New Bedford resident that's on a statewide born\nYou can actually I'm the only want to pick because either by statute I after there is an economic cows wind but there's no there's nobody on the Massport ass development mass cultural council um\nYou you name um the Massey see I mean you can go down the list or I'm not aware of anybody um\nAnd those are the big boys it may be some obscure\nA state board that has representation here um\nYou know the governor's transition team there was a single New Bedford resident on that and there were dozens and dozens of people on that um\nYou know I've raised yeah and and when they did their state wide listening sessions at the beginning of their administration um was ah they did them all over the state and they get again that dozens of them\nThere wasn't a single one held in New Bedford\nI mean like it's in that that to me is\nIndefensible right um\nAnd understandable um so like you know the lack of representation of New Bedford in administration is a concern that I've shared it with them at the public about it um and I and hasn't it hasn't changed so um that's why one of the things I I often get accused of being\nYou know louder than most when it comes to advancing you know my cities in our regions interest and that's because you know I have to be I have to be more short of more aggressive in order to get the point across\nSo I mean that's just that's just one example and that's certainly a concern and that's something I've told him I said look if you get reelected and they probably will get reelected that um you know I Want to want to see addressed and that just that that was just throw it as one example but that's not a trivial one\nHas Gonzalez aligned himself with anybody from the city then that might yeah I've had many conversations with him um and stay why can't it's all come knocking for my last year and a and so I'll continue to talk to him and and um you know see we're we're that goes I Know him I knew him\nI actually didn't know him before I became mayor but I had a number of uh you know people that we knew and in in common and um and so but I've worked with him when he was\nIn the Patrick administration as the secretary of a administration and finance and um you know I've I have a lot of respect for him I think he's capable guy and so uh so we'll we'll see\nUm yes any gift deal was on the program you had a press conference in town all throughout the area I guess I'm addressing this\nApparent decision by a Senator Warren to explore a run for the White House boy big surprise there right um well that's the ... yeah well that's a huge surprise I mean I was pulled over by that Dr aren't you [laughter]\nSurprise there yeah so I was there um he makes a valid point\nIf this war in the middle of a term\nThree years into a term for you is a new atomic says you know what this is my opportunity this is my now this is you know I've got to do this you understand that but when somebody is running for a new term\nAnd the day after they get elected\nThey ... you know start the resumes and then you hit the campaign trail and everything else I mean\nThat doesn't\nShow a whole lotta speck in my pay respect in my opinion to the to the voters in Massachusetts I mean we will be if she decides to run for president that kind of leaves us with one senator for at least the next two years\nAnd possibly puts in its into a situation where we are having a special election in a couple of years down the road yeah I mean she can she make a decision one way or the other because this isn't in the middle of a term it's decided by I don't know I\nMean I just consider the the opposing are so I get that and I'm you know I think as a campaign you know saying that on the campaign is probably not something that she wanted to I presume that she was asked the question somewhere and didn't want to come across as you know to call you on the issue because a lucky man she's\nShe's clearly interested in the in the job and you know there was a there was certainly the start of a groundswell of support for her even in the last um presidential um races so\nYou know I I I I Would offer people that there is that there is a sort of a countervailing view and that is you know if she's raising if she's might be the ... potential president of the United states um I Know that's not something that you get too excited about that but if she's\nI'm going to Australia with Barbara Streisand [laughter] so Rosie O'Donnell [laughter] hang out and have to look out something that you know on the Barbie [laughter] that I'd love to see that [laughter]\nUm\n... if she seen as a as a as a you know as a legitimate presidential contender in some ways that actually you know raises her political profile as as senator right and so and that's because what\nYou know if they think that I don't know I mean if if another senator is a is um if she needs to get the support of some other senator for some particular bill\nAnd that senator knows that one was with Warren might become the president's Sunday the ... now and I might need the president to be on board um with the things that I like to see that done then you know that uh she might just be able to win over support that she was\nLiving a lie and they don't do so that's the thing I mean how many bills as she filed on behalf of the fishing industry\nWell she's been support so I mean if you're asking me about her support for the fishing industry I think it's a little unfair to say she's done a ... inside of it is somewhat fair to say that she's done nothing for them and\nSo she really on was a supporter of the buyout program it was it was pushed that really hard um you know when they got ground fish industry really started to collapse after the\nAfter the institution of the catch share program and should there was that she was certainly I'm involved the directly involved in the championing of of of um you know establishing a fond and also making sure that individual fishermen which got something that was limited to bone owners in particular\n[noise] so um you say you're Eighteen is going to be done about a year you said they'll be less than a year less than a you know generally all said and it seems that guy I mean it's going all the way down in the golden road ...\nYeah yeah uh in it'll look a lot better there'll be more ornamental lighting and and um you know more trees it'll just it'll it'll be a lot less asphalt you know we got rid of the old I'm\nA cement pedestrian overpass down by the European Theater down by um by Ben rose and and so I think that was you know nobody was using that very few people were using that guy that got rid of an eyesore\nSo it's looking the way that it should I mean people should be able to drive in the city on on a main road like that and and how to look nice and inviting I mean the water is one of the things that will ...\nWe're we're going to be focusing on the next you know and the over the next year is to to get all of a team from one Ninety five from clogs all street all the way down to go straight to look to to to be in better condition in a big part of it is nominally under the state's control the northern stretch of it but you know\nWe need to make the whole thing look good regardless of who owns in and and if we have to step then we're probably will step and the tech tech or some other states maintenance load off\nAs the state's not really get into it enough or then so be it but a lot of people see that stretch a runway and we want to 'em and residents and visitors to the city I like him and it should or should we reflect well on the city should be in a condition that people can say oh yeah this place takes care of itself\nSo that's the goal and the next year and a lot of garbage you know accumulates in the wintertime rationalize it on the snow melts and ... so it does require work but that's that's something that we want to uh to to prioritize\nFrom a non partisan point of view how do you view this ... thing that your father of two daughters obviously three three dollars that you had to when did you have the otherwise [laughter] is that news unless ... while the years I go well okay I I don't know if you had two daughters\nIt's a high school and one in middle school All right so you're you're a parent and three daughters and and obviously I'm a lot of this is concerned that you as a parent and I I'm a father two sons\nAnd again from a non partisan point of view how do you view this I mean we've gotten to a point we're certainly we want to\nTell women that um you know the days when something happens and you bring it up and you're not believed or you're ridiculed you're afraid to bring it up because you might not be believed those days are over and you got to be hurt you made an allegation you've got to be heard but yet at the same time\nIt almost seems what's happened in this case is that we're willing to um believe an accuser without\nGiving the accused the benefit of the doubt as well um\nAnd again from an empty I see that from a non partisan point of view there's a lot of concern of parents with with with young boys\nUm you know be careful don't be alone or\nOr or guys hiring people don't Iranian women I mean you might wind up in trouble so somewhere along the way this whole thing just went nuts wait what what do you make of all of this this whole dialogue\n[noise] yeah um well a couple of things um you know there's\nThe social norms of change driving I mean I don't want to sound like much of a social scientists but like you know the way that people\nThe way that the\nMen and women interact and the expectations around that has certainly changed since you know this incident occurred right now there's there's some of that so the\nYou know the scale by which these things for judge does definitely different and I'm not saying that's an appropriate or not but I'm just saying that that that is different\nUm I think why and it's hard to you know I Know what I'm saying is is not partisan but it's almost like you or I or anybody else comments on this will be the the singer so hyper partisan highest of like of a better term um\nThat it's any comment on it will be seen as taking you know a democratic or Republican side um I think what's one of the reasons it's divisive is because you know there is this evolution of expectations of you know the way that\nMen and women in Iraq and I'm sure that there isn't sort of a general agreement out there um\nYou know my aunts and but more particularly you know\nIt for me it's it's it's it's very troubling I'm In the sense let's troubling is that on the one hand\nYou know as the father of daughters you know I Would never want my daughter to be put in a situation like the one that had been described by Dr Ford right you know regardless of you know however you credit her story you wouldn't want your daughter to be in a position like that\nUm you know and the other hand you know I worked at a guy like Brett Kavanaugh who's\nYou know you know more or less my age he's like five years older Catholic like me I'm you know\nSame world high school was halfway same line of work when he was over at Kent stars office I was down the street at the Justice Department ... and there was some you know multiple overlap and all that stuff I was doing with him although I don't know him I don't know I don't know um so you know and I've been to\nThe summit parties in high school but certainly part is in college um and you know it's like so you know in a new stuff in college and when you're younger that you don't\nHave might not be proud of it but that is true for everybody right and um you know so there's a it's hard not to be at least somewhat sympathetic about that I did I did think and you know if you ask\nMe because everybody listen to what you're saying on the one hand on the other hand um\nAnd I'll just say I I think I did find his representations to lack credibility though I it's just the or the the to the\nSome of the stuff that he was and and and look I mean some people think there's just the whole wind the whole time I I think he just the the there wasn't you know a degree of um you know hey look I did stupid stuff\nAnd you know I have no recollection of this but I feel so badly for her and she brought to it I just that you know and and even if\nYou know at some level you think the guy would say something like you know I I kind of remember her but you know why that would never do anything that she would she's describing I'm not saying that she's\nShe may be missing misinterpreting things but um but you know forcing myself on an outlet as he wasn't even there yeah which is kind of like you know\nAnd he did say we have no malice to her at all and I'm In my daughter even prayed for her uh you know\nSo yeah so you know that's all good but when one but it you know that the you know diminishing of like you know drinking and partying when he's got his high school yearbook that is just said some pretty outrageous thanks for high school you know high school yearbooks or\nI Would not want to be judged by my high school ... neither would I but what I'm saying is but there is but there are differences in degree\nRight I mean he's talking about being you know you know\nAn alumnus of an alumni or alumnus of ah you know you know being with some you know other high school girl and that's just like come on as a father daughter so I'll be like and they talked about my daughter that way I you know we've been fighting words um so you know I just stood there is just and there's a level of\nAnd I know and frankly I knew people like that I went to college with some guys who went to George ... my wife did you want to you know because she went to college at Georgetown University there are a lot of these guys from Georgetown Prep who they're and they're feeling was like yeah that's the culture at that prep school yeah I mean there's a lot of really will really wealthy kids\nWho are entitled and and um so he sits a certain stereotype and um\nBut we can't judge people stereotype and ... and then as we go you have to have the euro black you have you know there are others who\nCome out and say yeah of course he was drinking all the time and then he's like now that you know really wasn't any big deal like ... is a little heart little farfetched and I also you know he just didn't sound that judicial when he was up there I mean the the renting the science and then getting into\nPartisan stuff like this just like talking about the Clintons and whenever you feel about Clinton Clinton had nothing to do with with us so um and I just thought just while I was just it just sounded really inappropriate for a guy who was trying to get you know\nBut now you drive is going to your drifting into the partisan stepping out what what no one no let me go I'm saying he's still talking on TALK no I'm Talking about no because I I just figure next quite what I mean what if they were on the Judiciary Committee man what would you\nI don't know I mean I'm not going to go there because I Want to keep it I'm trying to keep it as a parent of daughters and I don't care and of of sons and here's the situation where you got a guy just because you've been in college and humid limited to drink a lot of beer we all did write\n'em allegations were made against him\nAnd there was no proof to back up those allegations see that's the problem that we're facing right now is a case where she said well he did this to me and he says I did\nNot go there really are is that there is there is that there is evidence right if you would say that this as a prosecutor to to coin\nUm I don't know I Would certainly investigate it a lot more before I made that decision but there were a domestic violence cases and sexual assault cases that are brought in courtrooms all courthouses all across America that are based you know largely on the testimony of the victim right so\nAnd we're not in a courtroom went on you know there's there isn't a you know the the standard of proof is and beyond a reasonable doubt here asking the question whether there's something that's you know has a much lower threshold of of of for the outcome which is you know this is this the should this
