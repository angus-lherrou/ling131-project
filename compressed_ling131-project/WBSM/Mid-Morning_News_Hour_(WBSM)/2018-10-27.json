B. S. M. staff for\nQuickly finding somebody to replace me 'cause I was just not you know and are now so yeah\nYou were feeling under the what the last week the weather is feeling another\nOne this week I you're right it's just life imitating art or vice versa back on anyway so\nLast week or what we're discussing has I\nThink we had started talking about life insurance and we got through through a few things but I think we're going to continue on because there's a I think there's a lot of information that a lot of people don't understand a lot of times\nYes and if you do have any questions about life insurance or any sort of financial expertise need anything at all a heads up at five or eight nine nine six zero five hundred that's five or eight nine nine six zero five hundred so ah let's continue this discussion\nUm the again the worst of the same way you pay a premium a portion of the premium is taken out to pay the costs of the insurance a portion to ... to pay the um the administrative costs and then the the balance goes into a bucket\nOr which now instead of being a fixed bucket is buying securities so if the market goes up your policy can do very well if the market goes down your policy can take the hit but just like regular investments I raise um just a non qualified investments and\nIt doesn't go to zero because it is very very diversified yeah and again if I were to recommended it would probably be somebody much much younger\nIn their twenties or thirties early forties or ... maybe even up to the early fifties but I probably wouldn't recommend it for somebody a little older because of the catch up time yeah okay [noise]\nUm there's a type of policy that is no longer available it's no longer sold it was called an endowment\nOkay and what an endowment was was usually your whole life type of policy and it would in down at a particular age normally at sixty five so you'd you'd purchased this life insurance contract you'd pay on it you would increase your cash value in it and then when you turn sixty five\nIt would be paid out to you either in a lump sum\nOr a monthly payment or that you could use to supplement retirement or whatever okay\nUm but those are no longer available by ... the I couldn't even tell you that I'd have to look it up at the industry or the insurance commissioners the insurance or\nThe state commissioners a put a ... on that ... that no longer available if you own one you still have it you own when when you bought it back when whenever that might've been you own that you can still keep it it's just not available\nFor sale for someone to purchase nowadays because like some ... and I'm thinking life insurance being what it is it's life insurance that that it's not\nLike we don't think about yeah you don't think about it as a a a a cash account and even then ... that's the only thing I can think of yeah okay now um when you buy a car\nYou can either have crank windows you can have push button windows you can have power steering or not nowadays mostly all do but you can you know you have and not have power steering pay 'em\nThe bells and whistles right well you can you can add bells and whistles to the life insurance contract for certain things okay so you can add waiver premium\nOh and by the way let's go back a second because I actually did not go over one type of life insurance before we go over the bells and whistles I didn't go over the term okay term insurance is a non cash value building typing\nIt's it's just pure life insurance unless you at a writer to it the return of premium writer which I think is a total waste of money ... it'll increase your premium sometimes by the fifty percent\nAnd all the companies guaranteeing you is that you're going to get the money you paid into it back\nAt some point in time so let's say you did a thirty year term and you cancel it out\nAt Fifteen Years you don't want it anymore but you're not going to get a hundred percent of your money back that you paid because it's based on an increasing percent or for the timeframe that you wanted when you get the thirty years then you get a hundred percent of the money back ... ... women come back to that in the second\nYeah see well and again if you have any questions ... excuse me if my voice crack funnier if you have any questions whatsoever about financial advice life insurance whatever and it's up at five or eight nine nine six zero five hundred that's five or eight nine nine six zero five hundred and we'll be right back after this short commercial break\nThis October I think all these different in casinos you could we\nPlaying dying\nAnd every Saturday some eleven AM to win a grand ... dollars dining hard\nLocated just off interstate one Ninety five and re

to water but maybe in turn to leave your desk and spend your lunch break volunteering with\nMeals on wheels dang meals on wheels for me and the joy that I look for I think it's on my way not come to the door when one male and I'll walk away with this whole heart and drop off a war meal and get more than you expect violence here in America let's do lunch dot org ... dot org rocky meals on wheels America and the ad council\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to money matters here on fourteen twenty W. B. S. and with financial expert Jose mockery of silvery continuing our conversation on life insurance you were just about to go over the bells and whistles that you can add to these policies while\nI Am but I'm going to go back to the term for a reason of when you purchase term or you can purchase it in increments of time right so you can purchase what's called an annual renewable term or yearly renewable term it's the name is interchangeable\nSame thing okay and those types of policies are very very very inexpensive to start and every year they go up in premium by a few dollars initially by quite a few more dollars the older you get 'em and it's as you're getting older the policy is getting more expensive because you're getting older\nSo to to kind of put a a a ... a a a stop to I don't want to see my policy increasing the premium every year so these companies came out with um\nThe the ... uh the timeframe of the term of ten years Fifteen Years Twenty years in Thirty years ... [noise]\nIt's just like leasing of building let's say you can Lisa building year to year\nOr you can be said for five years ten years Fifteen Years Twenty years Thirty years you can go all the way up to Ninety nine years but or longer but in the in the case of term they're kept that are out at around a thirty year policy now the thirty year policy is going to cost more than the twenty to twenty who's going to cost and one of the Fifteen Fifteen is going to cost more than ten\nBecause it's a longer time frame but during that period your premium will not increase guy but\nOther than adding that return a premium writer term is term this term is just like renting a house you are never going to have any cash value build up the only thing you're going to have is the roof over your head up you're renting and the only thing you're going to have for your family is the death benefit once you pass and if you bought a thirty year plan\nAnd you get to the thirtieth year you can continue the policy\nIt'll turn into an annual renewable and it'll be so expensive it'll took a horse and you will not want to keep it by now there's a way around it all term policies have a conversion period you can convert your term to normally it'll be a you will now a universal life\nUh but uh if if a company still offer his whole life you can convert it to a whole life\nUm and it'll allow you and you don't have to convert the whole thing so if you have a hundred thousand dollar policy you can convert twenty five or fifty of it if you want and now it'll turn into a lifetime policy\nAt either the same amount or lower amount depending on what you can pay okay okay so now it's all the bells and whistles [noise] so you can add waiver premium or waiver of cost\nThe waiver premium is normally going to be on a a cash value building policy so let's say you have you bought a whole life if you add waiver premium and I'd just helped someone recently with this\nSo you add waiver premium and if you become sick or disabled you pay another six months and then you called the company or you call your agent\nAnd you'd do a disability claim they're not going to put a check at your door it's not a disability payment\nBut it'll wave your premium for as long as you were sick or disabled and depending upon when you uh make that claim it could turn into a waiver for the rest of your life ... ... so how did I help someone who\nHas made ... sorry [laughter]\nRecently I had a well not recently last year I had a a friend\nBecause even if he's in a hospital and the guys working 'cause he's still have the guys working for him I Will go tell the guys what to do\nAnd they'll get it done and the paycheck will come in getting a preventive thing well he agreed with her then we talked about the life insurance having the waiver on it\nShe said that's an extra cost said little bit of extra cautious he doesn't need that either because again the paycheck will come in and will continue to pay the life insurance\nFast forward he left his guys go he's working by himself he's putting up staging on a three family on the outside of the house to go do some work he's up on the third landing of the staging he didn't put it in writes the staging moved he felt he landed on the roof of his truck\nOh my God [noise] [noise] so I get a phone call now I was told us afterwards because I get a phone call he's home they live on a second floor he's wheelchair bound I [noise]\nUh no disability insurance for no pay check okay no waiver of premium and he said we can't afford the insurance anymore and it would have been paid for had he had the waiver\nOh my God yeah that's ... that was terrible things happen so tomorrow the story is is it does have a kid and listen\nTo your advisor yeah he's not out to just make money is out to help you most of the time and I say most 'cause that's what I Do I Know there are a lot of people out there that are you know there's sharks yeah but if you've got to end it doesn't have to be Jose if you find somebody that you're comfortable with\nAnd you ... you know you ... you're listening and he's giving or she is giving you good advice\nUm you still don't have to do it it's just like I and I use the example all the time you see a doctor when you don't feel well and the doctors probably going to prescribe something but you don't have to take it you can't make you take it and even if you take it doesn't mean you're going to get better so when I'm sitting with clients\nI can advise something they do not have to do it yeah okay\nSo there are a couple of other writers\nTerminal illness writer and the other one is a chronic illness writer okay [noise] uh the terminal illness writer uh normally there's no extra cost to add the writer [noise]\nUm and when I say the writer it's an ad on okay and and that is so let's go back to the gentleman who unfortunately has the cancer and so first I helped him get the waiver\nIt's up to the company to make the decision whether the person is going to qualify or not\nOkay he also had a terminal illness writer on his policy so we again we called the company\nWe got some paperwork and the what the terminal illness rider does is it will pay out a portion of your uh eventually best benefit\nAs a current living benefit meeting yesterday or they're going to pay out a portion of the money to you so that you can either try to find something to make it better or have a last her out with your family because unfortunately you know you're going to go okay so we're in the process now of a requesting\nHalf of the death benefit paid out to him now would shoot equate to a little over eighty thousand dollars if he gets it but again it's up to the company after doing their research\nWhether he is going to qualify or not\nAnd how long I mean each policies different each elements there's different long does that you that span of them trying to figure out\nWell and with all ... they're going to ask for doctors records that going to or they might even call the doctor is his personal physician or whoever's treating him um\nAnd kind of get an idea of how long he has now because the last time he has the more likely the company was going to pay I pay a lot the break\nWe're going to take a short commercial break again you have any questions about life insurance or any financial advice whatsoever and
