IRAs solo or a four O. one K. is um profit sharing plans are trying to think of others but all of these are what are what are known as qualified plans by the way\nNone of these are actually the investment vehicle all of these IRA Rafael rate for wouldn't pay for it through the and so on all the ones that I just name what they are our regulations\nFrom the IRS which tells you what kind of account you are setting up but the investment vehicle where you're actually placing the money\nCan be banks CDs bank money market accounts um it can be a securities that can be a brokerage account with let's say stocks or bonds the securities can be um stocks bonds or international\nAnd the client is pretty risk averse they're going to want to try to deplete the account that's in the market first because they want to have less and less money in there\nSo that it won't be affected by a downturn in the market so they want to solve they want to keep they want to protect the fix the ... ... if you'd be the other way around it's a client has an account that is at a bank\nAnd they have an account with me whether it's a very below faced and they're they've got a better rate of return with the ... that are with me they're going to want to deplete the account that's giving them less of a return so if the bank account is it could be an Iraqi debate\nIf the banks becomes giving them less of a return I'm going to recommend that they deplete that one first so in that case\nThey can take from whatever account they're teaching versus taking out of both enough to encompass the total armed days from both\nSo if they had a hundred thousand in the bank and they've got another hundred thousand with me and the depleting the one in the bank they would have to take three thousand six hundred and forty nine dollars the first year based on the divisible factor right they would then have to take seven thousand\nThree hundred now seven thousand about seven thousand three hundred dollars out of the one at the bank versus taking the other half of the one that's with me because of getting a better rate of return with these ... with me for example you know\n... to continue\nWhat if my client misses an RMC does that'll happen\nYou know you're you're in the hospital you out of the country you're just forgot I specially the first year were you know where to get right or you shouldn't forget because um these companies will send you out a letter but what happens the letters people put something inside I'll get to it on to it and then it's forgotten because something else gets put on top of that I [noise]\nSo the tax penalty for failing to take an are empty or failing to take a large enough distribution\nIs fifty percent of the are in the amount not taken so the example with a gentleman and his wife with a little over at one and a half million dollars in their account and they would have to take their armed they if they did not\nTwenty five thousand ... let's say it was just an even fifty thousand yeah twenty five thousand\nWould be taken as a penalty by the IRS\nAnd then the fifty thousand whether they took it the balance or not the fifty thousand would go on their tax return as if they had taken it anyway so in essence your tax that year isn't just the fifty percent penalty\nIt's a fifty percent penalty plus whatever tax bracket you are in that you're going to pay tax on that fifty thousand dollars\nSo it could be sixty or Seventy percent\nNot ... it's not a whole mill though and um\n[noise] who is in reality responsible for their arm the\nThe the person the older they count their exactly it's not where the money is that it's not the advisor no I go out of my way I'd bend over backwards sold my client right but in reality it's the ... money right\nI'm I'm the
