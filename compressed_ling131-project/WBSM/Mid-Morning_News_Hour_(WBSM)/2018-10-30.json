noon on a Tuesday Afternoon glad to have you find a way not now six of I talked to a lot a lot of things going on everything from the latest on the caravan which will have for you know obviously coming up and just a little bit to President Trump says he will sign an executive order curbing birthright citizenship\nAnd that is expected to happen today the president is expected to have a or something to say about the caravan and about efforts to stop the caravan at the er at the border that to assess supposed to come up at some point you to I haven't heard a hard time for when the president will actually speak also tonight is the final debate between\nAnd uh you know it's often joked that or or if you can swim across the Rio Grande then dropping give birth your golden right get across the border come birthing vacation to the United states\nYour child becomes a citizen then you get to stay and then you get to bring all kinds of people over as well to chain migration\nPolicy which stems from\nA disputed but long recognized interpretation of the fourteenth amendment has given rise to what Trump considers abusive the immigration system Trump told Axios on HBO that the U.S is the only country in the world where a person comes\nIn has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states\nWith all of those benefits that Trump may have misspoken there according to Fox News ah we're not the only country of a Fox did not provide a list of any other countries you do a there are other countries that have\nDropped\nThis provision including France in Ireland in Europe and a New Zealand and I believe I maybe Australia's up a number of others around the world I no longer offer this\n\nUnder current policy anyone born in the U.S regardless of whether they are delivered by a non citizen or illegal immigrant is considered a citizen the interpretation has been blamed for so called birth tourism and chain migration\n\nThe fourteenth amendment states all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and of the state where Iran they reside\nMany legal scholars would argue such a change requires a constitutional amendment that some conservatives argue that the um\nThe existing amendment holds a room for some interpretation\nNow Michael Anton who's a former national security advisor points out or in an interview back in July with Tucker Carlson he says there's a clause in the middle of the amendment that people ignore\nOr they misinterpret subject to the jurisdiction thereof and he says what they are saying is if you were born on us soil subject to the jurisdiction of the United states meaning\nYou're the child of citizens was a child of legal immigrants than you are entitled to citizenship\nIf you are here illegally\nIf you owe allegiance to foreign nations or a foreign nation if you are the citizen of a foreign country\nThat caused this not apply to you because there's not apply to you so what do you think about this I mean this is a this is huge now we have heard for decades\nDecades we've been hearing from Democrat and Republican about the broken immigration system we've got to fix the immigration system do you think this would go a long way toward fixing it\nNow the outrageous already beginning right and we're going to have a democratic Democrat media pungent after media punted lining up criticizing Trump for this heartless are illegal\nViolation of the fourteenth amendment you know this will be challenged the second it's issued through executive order and you know to go to court in some federal judges going to um um you know some federal judge of course it's gonna it's going to overrule it declared illegal\nAnd then eventually it'll make us where the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court will probably a rule in favor of it but it'll take a long long time and in the meantime how many\nTourists in births will occur in the United states now if you do away when birthright citizenship\nThat will go a long way toward preventing people from locking all the way from Honduras or or whatever\nMeans they used to get to the United states ... it'll it'll be a deterrent for people to come here because the incentive to come you drop a kid and and they have that kid become a citizen you get to stay in your family gets become that'll be good that'd be wiped off the books so that's one more incentive or one less incentive I should say a for these people to come here\nSo\nNow this will be challenged by the Democrats this will go to the courts and it'll take some time in the courts in the meantime everybody and their sister will be heading for the border while they still have a chance to do that right\nSo we'll see how that plays out but if if the Democrats you know the same Democrat to a few years ago were for a border wall and war for curbing illegal immigration you know the Democrats like Iraq Obama who are on tape videotape\nA saying that Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton John Kerry if all of these people who claimed to be back then\nBefore it was Trump's idea in favor of a border wall in for securing the border if they want to get on the bandwagon and say hey you know what\nAll this is a good idea we need to do this this works to our favor and helps to decrease the number of people coming here illegally um we could get this thing down really quickly and I think there should be a big key toward reducing the number of people who come here illegally\nUh but you know they're going to fight it\nThey're going to fight it and there's one more frustration for the people of America who are waiting and waiting and waiting to try to drain the swamp and try to fix the border and try to get our country back\nA one more frustration because when you have to wait now and and fight with the Democrats over this one so I don't know where this is going to go I'm not quite sure when the president is going to one else's but it is expected to happen sometime later on today five to eight nine nine six o five hundred All right let's get to calls preceded hanging on your first than WB us and I'm gonna have to know\nWhat I mentioned before Trump or as far as the city of New York is concerned Trump is organized crime for over ... city or the state of New Jersey as well as the state of Nevada gaming commission to arrive Trump\nA casino licenses based on his ties to organized crime\n[noise] have you got documentation on this yeah where you just look up or whether or not a Trump will now have you got documents now have you\nYou mean Haitian of this if you get can you point to an article or someplace where I can go and read this because I I'm not being a ... I'm not being a White House I just want to see what this is documented I I haven't read the\nNevada gaming commission New Jersey gaming commission\nNo no I'm ... have you got an article where we can go and read that says there is there a story that you read the sooner we can go in you can sources that we can go and read this\nWhen Trump applied for his gaming\nLike you're not answering my question is is there a store a place where we can go is a Newsweek is the time is in New York Times the washing someplace where we can go and read that\nGo to the gaming commission\nKnowing All right what do you still get to your larger point then you obviously have no source mess so that you have no source but they're still get to your larger point that\nSome of the larger point is that when you start taking away citizenship then all of a sudden\nAlways taken away citizenship who's who citizenship is being taken away\nHere saying that Trump wants to announce that he can take away the citizenship of children born in America\nThat's not what I'm saying what Trump is saying here in what the legal scholars there are saying that agree with him is that the fourteenth amendment is being misinterpreted to say that if you are born year to an illegal alien you automatically get uh uh that type of that status insurance citizenship status new challenging that saying that's not true\nFree tag you're free right what was that Trump can take away citizenship\nNo that's not that's not what's nobody's taking away citizenship you your intentionally distorting what the reality is nobody's thinking why anybody citizenship\nSo you're you're claiming that with his executive order that he hopes to pass today or claimed today that children born in America would no longer have citizenship\nThat no no that's incorrect that's incorrect children born in America will have citizenship if you are born to in a legal immigrant or somebody who's not here as a citizen\nThen you do not do you do not get citizenship under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution what the Trump Administration is arguing is that the um the fourteenth amendment\nWhich has long allowed that practice is being misinterpreted\nSo my point is is that if Trump is organized crime he's a real estate developer and he figures out a way that he can seize land of people who were born in America than he can basically declare you know at the port them and then still their land\nYeah that's that's exactly what he's trying to do that is exactly you get it out if I had a price here I Would give it to you 'cause you just figured the whole than out in California and new just they just\nGet it out you get the whole plan here world\nWar two and the Japanese\nRight by the Democrats walk the Japanese internment camps remember\nUh yeah and those were the Dixiecrats\nYeah those were the Democrats\nAre well the the Dixiecrat\nHow they ... the Democrats period there were no Dixiecrats on the ballot those were Democrats there were Democrats and Republicans on the ballot\nPeople that will be going on retirement goals that are still alive on retirement at that point in time\nBut see that all that is basically a forecast though based on information that is a current and in you know when that when that was a theory was was being present it I don't disagree with that at the time that certainly was the case if we continue down the road we're going now the dynamic may change if we go back to a scenario where\nUm you know taxes increase uh employment unemployment goes up people go back on food stamps and various other programs again and assuming that we allow the the immigration system to keep running a mocking people to continue to come across the border\nYeah I mean there's going to be stern dynamics and we cracked down on the border and we stopped giving\nA birthright citizenship away\nUm we stop allowing people to just cross the border it will ah that that I mean I'm all for immigration but it's got to be married we ... we talked about this before you got to come here with something on the ball some money in your pocket and in ah the prospects for a job you can't come here with the idea that you and I I'll go to support you\nI mean this is the the issue there or the the issue that I question there is what cowards these people have come and go across the board\nOf none they may be nice people\nI Know I'm disagreeing with you and maybe that's what they want to sound sure I don't\nWant to sound inhumane to these green light right there in fact having issues in their country you know what I'm saying I Would be the first one to one to helping hand\nYou don't want somebody had a great a mean posted on Facebook the other day a picture right in the show to all of a picture of the seven thousand strong marching to the United states and to see justice these people turned around and marched on their own government back at their back when they come from\nA they just might be able to bring back some change where they come from right why why any attorneys marching seven thousand toward our border why don't they turn around and march back toward their border and make a difference\nBecause in their country they have a fight we're thinking of walking distance and getting to a place where they're going to be free and possibly not have that issue\nThat see the whole the problem with that though is in and I know you recognize this is once they walk here\nUm they've got new skills they've got no money they've got no education so they become a drain on the society here and I'm all for taking seven thousand immigrants in but you know what how about if we the host country get to select tool gonna bring here and let's bring some more computer scientist silver springs similar nurses unless bringing some more\nYou know people want some cash in their pocket bank account or some skills that are going to benefit our country and sat him drain on our country we can't just open the door and say\nEverybody doesn't have a job doesn't have an education doesn't have the any any hope for the future come on and we'll take care of you for the rest of your life\nWhat is the average age of the person that is in this group or people that started this\nI read thirty five and I don't recall we're that came from so you can certainly call me out on it but ah I read thirty five an hour because that's just a guess work on anybody's part because I don't want they interviewed all seven thousand people ask them the ... yeah so but I read that somewhere the other day that the average age was about thirty five\nBut obviously have a whole group coming is going to take an awful lot to educate them to put them in sure uh positions with going to be productive citizens\nYeah especially if you're going to come here and they're going to have families are gonna have more kids in by the\nTime they get into the workforce I mean obviously we need skilled labor you know and when I say that I'm Talking nurses and doctors and so on and you know ... and to to bring them in and praying that many people quickly to prepare them for their work or is it just ain't gonna happen\nWell right now because of the current economic situation a McDonald's is offering Fifteen bucks and paid vacation but you know what and another how many years from now when the economy slides again they're going to be back to minimum wage and you're not going to get a vacation and they're going to be too many people in need of those those few jobs so\nThat was my point yeah one of my points was is that the army goes in cycles yep so here you are you know you stated that if it does slide hope it doesn't for everybody because what I see right now going on I never seen anything like this\nWe we've just taken forty two million people off of food stamps now that's not not because Trump said uh you know what you were going to stick it to you and we're going to kick you out for food stamps you gonna you're gonna die out in a puddle somewhere it's because people moved from food stamps in public assistance in two jobs\nAnd so we don't need to bring in thousands more and start them on food stamps what what's the point of that\nYeah you're you're defeated the pro Israeli\nAbsolutely thank you my friend I got older you're five away none at six o five hundred your next the w._b. assume good afternoon\nI'm very high I send them\nAnd I think people that to immigrate legally apply for immigration status legally I Believe they're required to sign a document to to the effect that I'm a they become a burden on the state that they have to leave and they have to have a sponsor the kind of back them up kind of like a co signer\nSo if that's what I Believe that's correct um and if that's correct then\nIs it a disincentive to people that migrate during that at\n... ... immigration status illegally to do so\nTo know that people who do not immigrate legally are allowed to um uh come here and become a ... state right although it's if you apply for illegal immigration status you're not allowed to become a burden on the state if you don't apply\nBreaking the status and you come here illegally and you are ... are able to become a burden on the state\nYeah no that's absolutely true and that's the big contradiction here and and and that's what a ... you know that's why there's a lot of folks that are Hispanic that did come here from Mexico from Cuba from places or you know\nThat that are saying the same thing I mean wait a minute we had to wait ... family is still on waiting lists and and then friends that we know we're still waiting lists and these people just get to walk right in the front door is the we catch them we release them and they and they disappear out into the fabric somewhere and it's totally unfair uh for those who have done it the right way\nAnd I I I think I hear some ivory tower read anything going on a on the airwaves [noise] never got this uh issue a well if they have a bad time back home and we must allow them to come here or is there possibly going to become a\nA very highly contributing members of society here if there's a chance of that than we need to let them come here I think it\nNot to be facetious but I think the people that are trying to make those cases they need to have some skin in the game and I I Would suggest that\nThey find they co signed for one of these people to come here a few close I'm somebody to come here and they become a burden on states and you're required to reimburse the state for the burden that they've come right on she once you've done that well then you can go ahead and reason about why we should have people here but if you have no scanning the game\nI don't understand what you're ... who's a forty and I'm standing there actually at the discussion\nWho won ... I mean what what do you think about the the whole debate about birthright citizenship or do you think it's fair do you think it's unfair do you what do you think about it\nWell you mentioned earlier that this uh some some follow up ... wording or to the uh what is the the uh the fourteenth amendment ocean\nYeah yeah in the fall burning there that actually clarifies to me what you read on the air seemed what seemed to clarify I'm the ah affording of birthright citizenship that is restricted only to people that are born here of legally residing a legal residents of the United states\nYeah what the for those who are just tuning in what the what the gentleman said Michael Anton whose former a national security advisor he said what folks aren't or saying is if you were born in the U.S on a or if you were born on us soil are subject to the jurisdiction of the United states meaning that you aren't and not\nBe he cannot be subject to the jurisdiction if you're not a ... a legal resident and\nYou're not asked what he is saying and I ... yeah he says are meaning that you were a child of a citizen or the child the legal immigrants other than that he's saying the fourteenth amendment doesn't protect you doesn't apply\nThat uh various I Believe I Believe strongly that that is a qualifying the equivalent of a qualifying adjective right the description of people born in the United states born in the unit or to this question of how people born in the United states can become citizens\nSo your your suggesting that the very careful when they when they were these things yeah you're suggesting that we just there for a reason it's an adjective and they chose the ad for a reason\nSo you're suggesting that the Trump Administration has said this is this is being misinterpreted to to imply that anybody ... can drop a kid in in that could become a citizen\nOr if if if you're not leaving anything out as far as what was the end that amendment and I don't think it's a matter of interpretation that thing it's a matter of a a lack of full analysis of what was written shrunken\nAre opportunistic analysis of what it was written excluding that that had you to edge type of language to\nArm effort let me able to appreciate it five or six o five hundred I've got to take the breaks\nIt's an age of fourteen twenty W.
