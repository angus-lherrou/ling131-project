know he he knew of this investigation back in May of twenty Seventeen\nMiles on the investigation that long ago but yeah who pony alright um everybody knew about it that long ago the worst kept secret in Fall River right um so he had all that time to take a trip if you wanted to\nIs only the back story but but the pilots now how is the only one thing gets you to look at a small story that will give me the background on it and reports usually biased misinformation and it's not her Taylor corn here and it's not what I was trying to say I say it's everywhere and that's why I mentioned\nYeah we ... we introduced ABC News which which covers\nNational news and you're right it's not a lot of different stations ABC News is a good product and ah can be heard on a number of different stations but that's the cover of the national stuff and of course we have to do our own local legwork to cover the stories here but I Will say this I share your frustration with the mainstream media with the\nChoreographed\nInformation that is committed and provided for the listener or viewer or reader I I Do know that happens but I also think that you know the alternative media that sometimes comes forward with information\nOr that is accurate and sometimes is not accurate I Do still like\nThe practice of walking toward a story and waiting until things are proven facts instead of going forward and and then having to correct themselves and and and that is a problem with alternative media because a lot of the times when they do report\nIf not substantiated and often corrected so I you know I I Would just be very careful in more patient about listening and waiting for information to come in before you go forward with it not you but I'm saying people that trust alternative media over the mainstream media I\nRealize the value of of the alternative media it's forcing media mainstream media to be a bit more honest but it's not working entirely but I I I also think that this information they they fall for this information to show that the people can play with the credibility and sometimes they're right sometimes they're not but I I I Would encourage people just ...\nYeah that's why I'm interested in the process where do all these um stations get their news from and then if it comes from a certain area where they getting it from its gotta start somewhere and the\nWell I'm a times is that oftentimes is from the authorities\nWell first of all ABC News and others uh they're run by political hack like um [noise] what is it George ... threat\nI I I get I get I I Know what you're

think tries to be a Patriot Act I think he's often wrong with a lot of them actually says he's very impatient about letting information coming I disagree with him strongly on issues like um you know the Connecticut mass shooting I I you know I think it's ... without\nClear evidence you can't go forward with that you sound crazy and I don't think he can provide it right\nBut anyway I Do appreciate

actually a very very smart\nIndividual five oh eight nine nine six o five hundred All right so Kanye West was in the White House yesterday and saying some very\nUnusual things for a guy who was the darling of the Democratic party eight years ago\n\nWho has since stopped and looked around and said well wait a minute maybe I don't agree with this or that maybe I agree with a guy like Donald Trump on this or that and for that\nI mean that that they have been\nTormenting I mean the liberal media the Democratic party has been ripping him apart how dairy I mean in particular is very very difficult for a black American to to say that they're not necessarily with the Democratic party or another get attacked\nMy friends have been attacked\nBy remember sending money to Dr Alan Keyes who I thought was a fantastic candidate for president and this was in two thousand Dr key and of course he's been far to the right in in terms of his religious principals as a Roman Catholic\nUm ambassador or Alan Keyes a he has fired me though I always sending him money every month\nAnd of course he lost in the primary to George W abortion and it was then Bush again score but whenever African Americans take conservative positions they're accused of either mental instability or being ... sellouts\n\nAnd they are shamed and disgraced and it's only the most courageous of them that they their their ground they stand their ground they stay the course\nUnapologetic\nBut it seems to me that it's really the ones that I understand the constitution that they're free to think is they will but buyer beware you get on the conservative and what I mean you're going to be attacked individual you're going to face a lot of scrutiny\nParticularly if you're an African American kind of watched it it was and don't think it wasn't choreographed because they were all saying the same things that my friend ah Kimberley Adkins of the Boston Herald African American lover she's a wonderful person\nOr she was on CNN and elsewhere yesterday saying hey you know may have some mental health issues and I think I think it's been proven that he's he's had mental health issues but um\n\nYou know are they going to shame them in in now anybody that's had any therapy or anything in the past they should not feel free to speak their mind as an American you lose your First Amendment\n\nSenator Hirono of Hawaii the Democrat on the judiciary panel telling all men to shut up\n\nThe freedom of speech in this country is now limited to those who will agree with the progressive otherwise you better shut up\n\nIt's that bad and and I know I've spoken with moderate and conservative Democrats who feel they have no say in the in the way the parties going fearful of speaking out when they do speak out they're marginalized\n\nYou know the biggest piece of evidence that can offer us I think is a congressman ...\nWas thrown away I thought it was one of the safer seats in the state and it was thrown to the side for\nA much more progressive but almost unknown city council of from Boston or at least impressively who is very much like ah okay so you're Cortez a very radical progressive\n\nAnd you know so what they're doing the ... is really not for the purpose of doing it to county but anybody else that that might be thinking about speaking out\nAnd making an example of him\nYou are a prisoner in the Democratic party in particular if you are an African American if you speak out if you leave they will come for you especially if you talk about it publicly\n\n[noise] if I were Donald Trump I wouldn't be doing things like making inroads toward the African American community because I Know there are plenty of hardworking black families who don't like the taxation who don't like socialism don't like giving out everything that they've worked hard for\n\nWho don't want God's stuffed into a closet in this country\nWho think just like we do\nThe average American everybody's the same only for some reason the Democratic party feels entitled to the African American vote\nAnd indignant when they don't get it\nThe Republicans ought to be making inroads with two groups African Americans and unions 'cause there's a lot of common ground and they've got to define themselves and not let themselves be defined\nThere's a lot of room for improvement on the Republican Party a lot of problems with it can't disagree with some of the criticism but I can disagree with some some of it\n\nAnd particularly unfair way it's being described\n\nBut there's a lot of opportunity here\nIt interesting that the president is ... is getting according to a couple of polls I've looked at his ... is improved his favorability ratings with African Americans to the point where it's about one third ... the thirty six percent which is very high for a Republican president\n\nI don't think they mind the way he goes about things as much as just the typical snowflakes I don't like the way the president goes about some things\nAre given example when ... you know it was clear that Kevin I had made a\nAn emotional compelling\nResponse to talk to forge testimony it seemed things were going any better direction than before his testimony and Donald Trump threw a wrench in that by\nMocking doctor for it on the campaign trail at a rally I don't think that helps I don't think I disagree with much of what he said oh Dr Ford contradicted yourself and every time she couldn't remember this how do you defend it was it was a\nIf it was a ploy it it's a brilliant one moving\nBasically the Democrats were saying well judge Kavanaugh where are you there was where I don't know answer the question\n\nWhat are you there on that night what which night I don't know that's the question it's madness what they came forward
