first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to be close but I just can't\nI Can't see that being any more than two points in either direction and I think that that one is\nIs done yet I think that ... that by the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum and this caravan that's making its way to the border\nBelieve me in the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are fed up with people coming across the border with out efficient effective border security that has said democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona and that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there is a doozy is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to the former one more word on the caravan I ah it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nThe public looks Wilson says why do we have no control over our borders why is it still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting ah the vast majority of Americans want compromise they're willing to accept a path\nTo legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants what's so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of barrier and genuine border security with the American people are saying is first fix the border\nThen why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their own\nOf your listeners don't like the second part but the majority of Americans support\nActually my audience is very much beyond that my audiences pro than some pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audience is reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree\nPeople who are in the country already we're not law breakers can stay but we want to double sided strong called fence with a road between it\nAnd I know my I I've been talking about this for Fifteen Years and my idea is they don't find other audiences that are harder line but my audience is very very smart very apple at very educated very a Christian memory fades filled people who do not want to punish anyone\nNow Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying\nAbout big farm and and you also it's also the other no my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma I Know the good that they do the drugs we developed everybody gets that but this pricing it's crazy what should Republicans say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if they're pharmaceutical companies ... used to do it voluntarily\nThe public does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want Americans pay more than Canadian\nThat if they will not what we're drug prices here as they've done in other countries that Americans should be allowed to purchase trucks under FDA supervision says nobody wants the hype lines the poison\nWhat Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that one change alone\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying\nBecause of the pursuit of profitability reminds you of conservatives do believe in the free market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged that's what you've got in this situation\nSecretaries are of ha chess has been a guest on my show what he's talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the ah new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done for a lot\nMore than that needs to be done at least some of the public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face low doesn't help\nIt's actually finding a way that they will still be profitable but that people will be able to afford the medications or if they want competition in the marketplace they walk the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available asked\nThe tired

place I think there will be more biographies device now\nI think the way he handles the presidency and the dignity that he brought to it\nAnd clearly the leadership he brought during World War two and two the beginnings of the Cold War I I think these leaders sometimes it takes a generation or takes the biography written about the person to put their whole life is you just did in in those moments in perspective not just but he did as a president's evoke what his whole life meant to be\nAn yeah I think he'll come up in the presidential historian polls they come up and down after a period of

turbulent times has to do with Donald Trump was numbers are improving is change the Supreme Court is one of the third year battle for the Supreme Court military thing rebuilt the economy is harming along but of course we're divided country and I'm just watching the news this morning was blaming\nTrump for the pipe bomb that cetera what do you see emerging which way as his reputation going go based upon extrapolating the first two years in the next to impossible sex\nI think the main question will be is there a point at which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he helped to do and that in trying to reach out to expand the base not just up the base and try and become the leader of all the people at the huge transition that still has not taken place\nAnd the question will be yes\nPeople are feeling better about their jobs\nThey may be feeling better and that's important they made me feel better even about the confidence in the economy they feel better as citizens right now they feel that the country it's more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way they wake up every morning and they see something on television that they wished they weren't seeing\nThat sense of feeling good about being a citizen as a country on it's another level I think of judging Iowa better or worse off having been here for two years\nAnd simply the material goods that are at the bottom which absolutely important as well so let's see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and if it leads into even more violence as they might be seeing potentially in these last couple of days and I think we have to use that as a standard for its\nLeader leading us in a
