I had to think kicked in our son is actually start to get to that kind\n... well that was Eric Holder ... say yeah I Know they all look alike\n[laughter]\nWow isn't that amazing isn't that amazing\nAnd there was no outrage at all five ... five hundred year ... will be some good afternoon\nOr do you think that someone would challenge that\nYou are you would think wouldn't you\nOut of all the Democrat in this world wouldn't you think they wouldn't be one that would take this to complain about er\nWell the fiber Cory Booker mortified were Eric Holder I certainly would stand up and say sorry Mrs Clinton but no we don't all look alike\nI Can't believe that there really is no\nUm what I'm calling for is do you have any information on that Indonesian blame the\nYeah the last I heard was that uh they I I guess they've they've recovered quite a bit of the plane they have not recovered the black box the ad\nRevenues and the finger on it\nI'm Sorry I haven't seen a thing on it\nYeah well you know it's very typical of our media media focuses on you know the strangest damn things but um apparently um all one hundred eighty nine people to believe that they haven't been slammed recovered anybody alive or they're still looking for the black box to figure out what went wrong flew out why use it so many planes in that part of the world\nI asked him to go down here that's really yeah\nI mean it's it's you know when you hear a plane going down quite often it's a it's in that part of the world and it's a\nHow ... what a turning was it that they left before it crashed I mean was it halfway to where it was\nGoing law I think it was shortly after takeoff oh no kidding yeah I Believe it was shortly after takeoff rather but um\nYeah a hundred and eighty nine people you would think that there would be a lot more on the news about it right\nRight yeah but there is and it's more about Trump and what he's trying to do and shouldn't do and every all the darn thing right right\nI've come to the conclusion everything I see on the TV that that are on negative I was like ... a family member the other day I go to blame trip for this insurance\n[laughter]\nThat's why I don't even watch anymore I've gotten to a point that that you know we do you do raises my blood pressure when that stuff so it's like why even bother you know it's so predictable no matter what goes on in the world are going to blame Trump for that and um the you know so I mean I didn't even watch it in into to listen to a one point Fox News was the\nIn the last scene news outlived their uh but they've taken a big shift to the left and you listen to stuff like we just played from a chef Smith and and it's like you know I I don't I Can't even deal with those people anymore\nWell I never did like a chef chef Smith before yeah even the president and got in I mean he's just I don't know why is there well you know at a different view about their love of what they preaching\nBut you know what I can I understand and I appreciate a different views that's why I Do what I Do I have my view you guys have your view and sometimes we agree sometimes we don't um so I can I can agree with that but shipped Smith is the chief news guy so he shouldn't be giving his opinion was\nHe's the chief news guy yeah oh I didn't know that he's the he's the head news banana over there so I'm you know he should not be giving his opinion if you're gonna have to lean\nWell they should take him off that job than if he wants to give his opinion so much they should take him off the job and put them on one of these opinion program put among\nThem in the peanut gallery where along\nI you know what it is great here debates about ideas so Shepard Smith has some ideas that are different from from a lot of the folks and put him on a program where he can give us opinion put 'em on without jobs with Sean Hannity at night that would be a great show\nOh I sure would\nTake him out of the news department should not be the head news guy if he's going to offer his opinion and all the news stories\nAnd that I didn't know that yeah that's why I call your program I tell you that all the time [laughter] when I listen to believe in and I told you that before\nI appreciate that ... that give a contributing yes good afternoon\nThat you use well five going on at six o five hundred I don't know I don't I don't know chefs a exact title\nA Syrian find here real quick but he is the he said that the number one news guy he's there to number one oh let's see just real quickly here see if I can pull it up in front of me a shepherd Smith Shepard Smith my I'm a mental lousy here we go um to doo\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo\nOr well she's being called here Fox News's token lunatic uh but that's not his position I Know he's got a job official jumped title here we go uh we're competing you can probably helped me out let's go Shepard Smith a shepherd Smith\nWhat what what was taking hold on a second what was taken out of context I didn't\nKnow she was kind of thing and jazz and David Levy as a black guy who's on Syria's next up a and he was he was saying he wasn't offended by because he understands how it was worth for how she was being ...\nWell I I mean isn't that convenience do if Donald Trump had said it would it be asked if she said she said and you heard that the the audio you ... you read the story yourself that's\nAll right yeah exactly if this was a Republican it would be front page news that the racist all blacks locally\nSo that's why we haven't heard from Sharpton today\n[laughter] yeah yeah it's crazy and and I don't know if you get to touch on me a ... and the things that could have ordered that might be signs about the um\nBirthright yeah birth to their birthright citizenship yeah\nYeah well it's crazy is um\nFor the second amendment it only applies to the weapons that were from the Eighteen century correct but now the fourteenth amendment says oh no that that applies to people all\nSo they you know the left which rules and twist arguments to fit their narrative no matter what so certain amendments only applied so when they were written and other ones will know that has nothing to do in the ... and ... as it applies now\nSo again the ends justify the means for them they will do whatever they have to do to win whatever argument they have to have to regain power\nNaps and when people need to point out the ... the the bath\nYeah because the media won't do it appreciate your call my friend thank you very much five away nine six o five

charge and we'll get a new way B C D in in in any way that we don't have that from them\n[noise] yeah that's I that's what I get out of it of course I think they have no a solution no sensible solution about the immigration problem I mean the people coming up you know I'm so [noise]\nWell you got you got to keep in mind as well sir that back in two thousand six when the Democrats were\nCharge basically of the of the of the Congress they endorsed in fact even going back further than that when Bill Clinton was president the Democrats in doors to the idea of a border fence or wall\nRight and they said that immigration\nAre illegal immigration was sucking American Jobs away from from workers here was crushing the economy and that these people I Do understand that he had a right to come into this country illegally\nAnd they all said it it's all on tape you go on YouTube you can listen and watch with your own eyes and ears Bill Clinton or Barack Obama I'm John Kerry Hillary Clinton who voted for a border wall um you just a whole bunch of them and now all of a sudden they've done a complete one eighty\nYeah well yes I I seen a lot of those clips on the the\nPrice

you're a ... on a one of the channels last night um I was watching and they had a former State Department official I don't know what who served under but I I assume maybe Obama and uh they're asking\nHim well these people coming up now what are we going to do with them and\nHe says well we have a broken broken immigration system is broken but I Am scratching my head I says what what does that moon you know what does that mean\nYou mean they they're going to come up across the border just because we've got a broken what kind of a broken system is that there there's laws that you can't come walking across the border\nThat's right yeah so I you're right and nobody knew that that's\nThe same old political gobbledygook that both parties have been giving us for decades all we've got a broken system well why they held on to fix it if it's broken what tell us what's wrong with it and then fix it other than that just enforce the laws that are on the books that makes it a crime for somebody to breach our sovereignty\nIf somebody wants to cross the border illegally that's against the law they get deported that's the way it's supposed to be right under the law\nYes and what do you think's gonna happen when they reach that quota\nThey're going to meet a wall of resistance because Trump descent down fifty two hundred soldiers and are they gonna meet resistance every every ... or ... or any of that border was going to be blocked and now they're just going to be turned away they're not going to be allowed to commit\nI have no problem with that\nNo I don't either it's our

seven tumbling for you every weekday from twelve until\nThree right here on fourteen twenty W. B. S. M. eighties your [noise]\nYour guy in the afternoon it's me little me [noise]\nHanging out with the glad you're hanging out with me too I was glad to have you with us and now he's glad to chat with you about what's going on and a lot of folks want to ... a lot of things going on today including the president expected that today too I signed an executive order that would curb birthright citizenship this big big stuff\nI'm for many years the fourteenth amendment has been interpreted to wear a by many to believe that um uh I if you are born in this country\nUh whether or not you were born to legal um while people who are here legally or illegally\nCitizens or whomever gives birth you automatically become an American citizen Trump Administration saying no the fourteenth amendment has been misinterpreted that's not the case president is expected to issue an executive order later on today that would that would that change that eliminate the\nUh the uh uh birthright citizenship and most countries in the world had done so already if the if there are any countries that still do it is very very few and I'm\nSo we'll see this is seen as a a a mate\nStep toward that controlling who enters our country or through the border and I'm obviously this will be opposed by the Democrats are to be opposed by the media and or the wind up going to court and we'll have to see what happens there but a\nA meantime the or the caravan are still coming there are some reports today that it may be splintering and shrinking as some folks are beginning to turn around and um\n\nYou know not a a lot of folks getting discouraged with uh the thought that they might get all the way up here and the only be turned away at the border by the by the U.S or by the U.S troops\nIf if if you are correct and Trump's critics to correct in what will happen is either the fourteenth amendment stands or it gets goes to the legislative process and getting somebody proponents of anybody wants\nTo do this that and that's where you don't understand you're trying to say I'm not I'm On his ...\nAnd I know I Know you want to do the one that's not I understand it can be funny and I know you understand it come when you don't like the idea that he you don't like his opinion on that I don't like presidents grabbing power little pets not grabbing my our asking the courts to resolve the case is not grabbing power that's the way it supposedly be legislative\nProcess to do the no knock down to the point you're putting their heart is still with with immigration and your ... I had the horse here the that was\nA uniform rule of naturalization is the um\nThe court has to determine the legality of the law for that's the way it works that's why we have a judge we have a three tiers this\nThe ... the law has to do that the amendment was approved the fourteenth amendment was approved the administration says we don't agree with the interpretation of it so now it's up to the judiciary wayside\nAmend the constitution through amendments it's already explain\nBut we don't know that we need to change anything yeah then\nWe don't know I mean even if we don't know that we need to change anything yet that's the point here the point is the fourteenth amendment is there some people say well the fourteenth amendment means this other say well no it means that so we need to bring it to the Supreme Court to the brain Supreme Court can determine\nA wedding in fact says now if the Supreme Court says you know Trump you're right you can do this is what the law says well then Trump so sad if the Supreme Court says no Trump you're wrong you can't do that it either stays the way it is or Trump can go through the legislative process and try to get a change that's the way our government works\nAnd the court the says it can do this does not know the U.S constitution [noise] I'm Sorry every what any any court says yes President Trump you have the right to do this by executive order your opening up basically a basket and just destroy that\nYou're still not you're still not getting it and I think it's intentional he's trying to get a court ruling he's not trying to do anything by executive order all they were there and get the court to rule on this he's saying that the fourteenth amendment does not allow for birthright citizenship\nHe's saying as it's written the fourteenth amendment does not allow for this [noise]\nHave you read the fourteenth amendment I have the right in front of me\nThan we've been reading it all day it's the whole point about the jurisdiction\nThat's when the debate falls whether or not that that's that part of the amendment means that you have to be literally under the jurisdiction that you have to be a citizen or here legally that's where the question is that's where the gray area is that what they're looking for some some resolution to [noise]\nI mean that's that's the whole debate there I mean they they I mean I Know you understand the process you're smart guy\nAll they're doing right now is trying to force the court decision does the fourteenth amendment read that you can come here legal or not give birth in that job becomes ... an American citizen\nI'm or does it say that you have to be here legally or a U.S citizen in order for that to happen\nSo in order to force it into court he issues an executive order within ten minutes of his signing that order some court some judge in the Ninth Circuit whatever's going to issue which day it's not going to take effect it's going to a a block it until it goes through the legal system it goes up to the Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court will interpret the fourteenth amendment Howard sees a the ... the intent of the fourteenth amendment that's how it works\nAnd um I mean that's the way our system is supposed to work\nI appreciate the call was always very impassioned and a good debate I thank\nYou very much for that by the way down at six o five hundred year and next thing that will be a Sam Hi Mary how are you good how are you doing good\nYou know I understand what the previous call is trying to say because you know I agree with what Trump trying to do but I don't really think it's going to go far because there's that fact though this it was written for the slaves that were here and brought here and they made them citizens\nWell actually that's not quite sure what happened was um include them\nHold on there we we had quite a problem we had the um the ... that was was passed them to John Adams odd because we wanted to slow down and we wanted to stop we actually literally stopped immigration a for a time back in the Seventeen hundreds and you know we gave the the authority so\nWhat what Trump is trying to do here I I don't want it need to repeat the whole thing all over again is he wants to hear the president believes that he has the authority under the constitution\nTo uh control immigration that he has the authority to do that he believed that you know what I write so he believes the fourteenth amendment is not being taken in the way that it was it was it was intended to be\nAnd um so that's all the states here he feels state right he feel so we shouldn't uh we shouldn't allow this\nUm he may be wrong the courts may come back and say you know what do we looked at this thing and the fourteenth amendment is or you know says hey you get here you have the baby that kid is in so I mean if that's the case then we find a route to either fix it or it stays the way it is\nYou know also that the previous caller I understand what you're saying that from trying to do and it it that's the way he has to do it and\nAmong you know he's he's mistaking what's going on here with the monarchy a monarchy the king says hey listen this is what's\nHappening and there's no room for anybody that challenge anything and that's the way it is and it changes from that moment on when he you know he gives an executive order it doesn't I mean we've seen it in previous order that he's made it doesn't necessarily\nMean that that's the the the rule the land forever and it's going to stay the way it is it as a means that challenge that and like you said they're going to challenge it it's going to go through the legislative process at that point and it will be determined in the end whether he has the right to do it for he doesn't have the right\nTo do right so it goes so originally right you have the youngest reaches of government right the legislature three branches the legislative the judicial and the executive so rigid only the legislature war began the process of the fourteenth amendment beginning a legislative a arm of government and then\nNow the uh administrative branch of government is saying hey wait a minute we don't we don't think that this is you know this is being interpreted correctly so now he goes through the judicial\nAnd and that's where the checks and balances come in and that's why our system is so great so\nUh by issuing the executive order that's really the only way to get this to the Supreme Court\nIs the only way to get it to the judiciary because the president says well I don't like this so I'm gonna you know issue an executive order changing it or or or or but you know ... giving me the authority to read this thing the way I see that it's written so then the judiciary steps in and says well wait a minute we have to review this we have to look at it that's the way it's supposed to work\nRight I mean did you think back just recently with the with the ban on that from the six countries are the seven countries\nAh when he wanted to out a limit to people coming into the country from those countries he wanted to have and and of course the left wing nuts and there were six countries out of what fifty four dominant league monitors a I'm a Muslim countries right now it's racist ... Muslim\nSo it went to the court he issued an executive order the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the issue to stay which meant that he couldn't enforce it and then went through the court system eventually the Supreme Court said he at every authority to do it that's the way this works\nSo that's that's America\nThat's America I mean he does not have the authority to change the constitution there's no question to that in a no question about that and that's not what he's trying to do he knows he can't change the constitution this legal staff is going to say if you can do an executive order that changes the constitution\nBut he's trying to get the the the constitutionality of an amendment to that constitution before the courts and this is how you do you wish you weren't ruling and let the court stick at an end and fight it out and see what they say\nAbsolutely yeah appreciate and my friend thank you five or six or five hundred you're mixing WB assumption afternoon\nHoffman war isn't is kind of like with the lawyers or the judge says ... I'm going to think that under advisement yeah ... exactly yeah\nKind of ... he he's reading something any scratching as ed than I Do know and you know what I did not know anything about this and and you have educated me on it and I understood you perfectly because you explain things better than any\nI Know [laughter] I Would have to buy like to nominate you fussy could\n[laughter] no jobs out there that'll never happen [laughter] that couldn't happen [laughter]\nAll of these callers who bullied me I didn't understand that at all and K what are we talking about and\nWhen you got done I went wow I get it he didn't like\nIt or we don't understand that we think is wrong with it so he he sends a litter out and you know and then they in trip they go to the court will join those are the court that ... that can be the end of the conversation at anybody\nWell right and he was so both sides are going to sit back now yeah both sides will sit back in the way to see what the court rules and like you said they could say hey ... you're\nExactly in which case no she ... the the the founding fathers made it very difficult to change that the constitution so you can't just write an executive order to change the constitution you can't even pass a law in Congress to change the constitution\nThis has to go it has to be if so example we don't like the the the uh the fourteenth amendment it would have to go through Congress several times and it has to go to all fifty states to ratify the change\nSo it's a very difficult process and it's a lengthy process and it was done that way on purpose so that you can't have the time were just writing an executive order to change the constitution it you can do that he doesn't have the authority to do and you know he doesn't have the authority to do it any more than Obama did when he would write all those executive waters\nShe was applying for citizenship and those guys to over the years over twenty thousand dollars over twenty\nBarry to become a sort of sort of this country and you know ...\nHave died and he never became a citizen and and those people who come here for free and and and and take care of it can we talk\nAnd she wanted to be a citizen just didn't have the money or the resources to do it\nWell you can't root for thousands of dollars so she did pay and okay yeah rowdy while you're paying to write\nYou know why didn't you know they come with the hands open they're coming in with their hands up and then they won't even put down here they weren't even put downloaded the Honduran Guatemalans flags and pick up an American flag while they're walking\nAmong us who battery let's let's Florida for the violence in our own country they can all go off of the freebie electrical route afraid we never would have thought that we that we are why were\nYou know I'm sick or stop by the people were calling us Stay in a ... minute\nIn Latin America and we're a nation of the nation that let me tell you the battery I'm having a hard time getting by right now and I'm seeing here says another beginning to like what is it that's all\nRight let me hold you my friend who make a great a lot of great points good call I appreciate it very much thank you for your services well let me take a real quick break we're going to come right back after this fourteen twenty WB Sam\nStone river mayor James Graham versus below the drama here for the\nWhat do you do with several hundred dollars buying your homeland auto insurance by calling Pauline Dixon insurance they represent several top insurance carriers including our Bella mutual place right here in Massachusetts they offer the coverages and\nDiscounts that could be just right for you ... can answer any questions you may have review your current policy can recommend\nWhat's best for your family's insurance programs\nHand at no cost to you if you're not already fallen Dixon insurance clients you owe it to yourself and\nHow much you said tall and fix it was to locations three eighty eight counties street and forty four thirty six a cushion to them you into bed called vital eight nine nine six eighty five Ninety three or ...

appreciate your hanging on your next inevitably or Sam\nHi Barry pay what question a quick comment and then a question or comment is I remember last year on Fox News watching a live show\nOr or have their team at the border when your kids were supposedly being locked up behind fences um you're probably remember that in\nYeah absolutely but I remember in the background of the show there\nWas a large facility and my understanding is that it was a family facility meant how people who came over the border illegally\nNeal bomber administration had previously quote the facilities and I'm a man of liquor why some of the people had to be put up into ... and compounds the folks that voters have\nBeen open or we paid for\nThose people who want to know whether you know proper proper rooms and care\nYeah the the other thing to do when you talk about the cages and all that um we we have to keep something in mind that people who cross the border illegally um\nWild is that the ... legal right there in suspects it in the criminal justice system\nYou have to incarcerate them one way or another but a lot of the kids that you saw to put this in perspective\nThe vast majority of the kids who were coming across the border with coming across unaccompanied either on top of the trains you remember that or they were coming across the border with coyotes or to sex trafficking or whatever so they didn't have parents with them\nAnd that's why you saw so many kids that were there were alone because their parents weren't there\nRight but if the ... has remained open and your family's stuff right exactly yeah they were close by their ... sure\nA question for you Barry is when they go to the border\nAnd going through the court system said in the best for you can't just leave without closing the barn that's right I think that if people in this country want to take you know control of this maybe they should come forward and posters twenty thousand dollar barn trivial here for the court said\nNo I think then you've got some skin in the game of these people will come back to court for just a release of more than an ankle bracelet they're going to cut off right now I don't know if the law prevents them from requiring a barn\nI'm not sure I don't know who has the legal system that has allowed so I don't know why or they're not required to do it yeah\nThat'd be probably because they don't have it I mean you've got to figure that there's probably use I mean you've been mostly these people coming across the wood nothing's done with them and their backs right now you're my friend good call appreciate it finally known as five hundred actually hanging on your next the w._b. assume\nHi thanks for taking the call appreciate it called a\n... um a couple of callers back you had a guy talking about a a swat re out and was sport and um I was kinda interesting actually because a couple of reasons or he mentioned without naming names which is right you shouldn't\nUm but I ... I think you called them I profile people right and at the same time the the uh Michael Bianco answered in Ghana mob and um\nI it it had me wondering and we've seen this before we've seen that with the Clintons even vote when he says high profile in was what I started thinking to myself well could that be are they are they farm\nOwners of the venue the owners are one what is their motivation for not given there's money to help these people on the legal path to citizenship citizenship which I think he he pointed out that that was not the case right exactly who is\nMore more to keep them in the shadows and and the reason I bring that up our is because I'm\n... it's too bad but I think too many of these people and I've worked with some of them when I was in the in the in the fish business I'm a truck driver and I spent all the awful lot of time on the waterfront and there is there's a lot of hard work and people and\nThey don't realize that the people that are telling them that they're offering them are actually exploiting them", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "30"}
