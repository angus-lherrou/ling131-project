you know I'm\nI'm very suspicious now the state and the left wing they made me like this you know going on now I used to have good thought of the government and good thought you know what you know particularly democracy and everything\nBut what's been going on out in the past couple of years not because of Trump got elected after him what they've been doing you know yeah so they they made me lose confidence what's going on I'm very suspicious\nAnd the this works this look that too it looks like it's the state or the left wing I'll be very surprised if we find out if if we ever find out that somebody conservative\nDo you think we'll find out who it is because the government and the deep state have a nice way of keeping secrets something\nWell if it's a deep state you know you're not going to find out and that's going to make the more suspicious if they don't fight though you know right right yeah\nYeah well that's that's true because you know I I listen to a number of security experts this morning when this was first starting to break and they had the former ah a commissioner or from the Boston police department a guy didn't handle the uh\nThe Sunday off of a Patriot's day bombing in Boston and he seems to think they're going to find somebody very quickly he said because when you use the postal service for this type of thing\nUm that is the you know that is the dumbest thing to do because it's so easy to track\nAnd uh so he was I think his name's Anne Clarke he was convinced that there was going to be somebody a within a day or so and I've heard a couple of other security people suggest the same thing so if we don't see somebody within the next day or so and then I'm going to get mighty suspicious you\nKnow are elections coming up yeah and uh the left wing is losing badly I think so are they going to come up with something\nWhat you know I ... I hate to sound cynical but I think I I think I agree with you now you're in a state of the record we could find out that this was some conservative extremist that that is out there some right wing radical that he's out there doing this\nIt just isn't adding up to me\nThat's not the pet yeah in the in the past it's always the other side look what's happening I mean they're they're acting like zombie people on the streets you know people down yeah they might not have a the walking dead party\n[laughter] you'd go thank you my friend pre she had to find a way not not checked so five hundred your next unable to be some good afternoon or\nGood afternoon very simple way to find out whether this was left or right okay if it's a right they'll report it if it's a left like we'd never found [laughter]\nYou've got a note that as well as I Do yeah because they are in bed and\nPeople will say oh this guy ... they're they are so deeply embedded in our forces you know and I'm not saying all well enough that they can control things it's obvious would have been due to Trump during the campaign\nSure don't tell me that don't tell me the ... and the left is\nTrying to swing things their way we're warrant for with court with everything\nWell you know in another caller earlier had a good point too I mean you know the fact that Susan Collins received some threatening male all the fact that Ted Cruz's office or in you know in Texas and got some uh I had some problems even the Pentagon run the Pentagon got that to the ice in less than about an hour's worth of coverage and that was the end\nAnd um but you know that the the targets of this are really really suspicious to me because it's it's almost like they are trying to lead us down\nA tree I'm not somebody who was honestly interested in getting at the deep state right I don't know some radical a right wing not wanted to get at the the deep state I can see going after Hillary I can go on after I'm\nI'm a uh the George Soros but why would anybody want to go ...\nWhy would anybody send the thing to to Debbie Wasserman Schultz so why would somebody said bombed him into CNN that just doesn't make sense to me\nBecause it's just going to give\nRight they want they want to be able to say look Trump did this because Trump's out they're calling the news media fake news now somebody wants to blow up the news\nWhat we I think we can all agree the of the Democrats and Republicans that all of us on the road people could all agree that whoever did it left or right away\nYeah whoever did it as a way which\nThey don't speak for the honor roll they don't speak for the right and they don't speak for the left because they just wouldn't do that kind of thing however we will have to say that the left has the condoning violence going after people\nWell you know ... years in orange do here's the difference to within minutes of this breaking this morning Pence issued a statement Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement on behalf of Trump Trump coming out before the microphones very shortly\nUm you have heard from a representative Peter King you've heard from a number of Republicans have come out and can dusty skull nice um have come out and can damage there now when Susan Collins got the the uh the the white powder in the mail couple of weeks ago after the cabinet oh did you hear\nThe rock Obama come on and condemning oh no here Hillary Clinton condemning what am I what about Eric Holder did he condemn it\nAnd the other thing to look at and I'll let you go to this is or how many were set\nUm it just yeah it's it's ... it's been increasing since I've been on the air so are they just added that\nPerson is either really really really hard for any of the ...\nRight and so on that one yeah good point All right thank you my friend ... show five hundred let me take a break we're going to come right back after this they want us You're listening to fourteen twenty W.

I was up in Boston over the weekend right my wife and I went up to a to understand why area just to get a little mo Jo and they have something to eat one of one of the restaurants around there\nAnd I was noticing some of the parking or you know fifty five bucks game day parking um yeah you go to a concert at Gillette Stadium in addition to the pay like a hundred and fifty bucks for a ticket forty dollars parking\nAnd go see the Celtics side you know ... the bank not garden up there uh you know like forty bucks forty five bucks parking it's unbelievable what they charge you to park your car and I'm so five bucks a dizzy was not too bad I Can't complain to oil and even\nThe shows that the zero bargain for yeah area\nYeah it's great I mean there's great and I'm hoping the or the strand gets developed like dizzy or that's the plan anyway and not give us another place like that but ah\nWell thank you for your time marrying the good work appreciate\nThe call thank you very much call again now and yeah that is something that it it was a parking lot that you were able to park in for free I guess there was an agreement between\nA busy and the folks that are the back I mean I'm not sure if they're still Santander banks a parking lot I don't know\nUm but in any event or they do charge five bucks to park and then what now and that's reasonable right if it's a private life if you own that you'd be charging everybody five bucks to buy their\nA minimum right so um that is still a reasonable price for for an event and again I mean you know you go see a concert up at Gillette what is your going to cost you a hundred and fifty bucks for a ticket and uh then you're gonna have to pay forty bucks that really pissed\nMe off when you're paying that kind of price right and then you gotta pay nine bucks for ten bucks for a beer and hotdogs going to cost you another nine bucks and some French fries going to cost you another nine bucks they get ya so what are you going to do fly in by helicopter you got to park\nAnd uh so they charge you forty bucks to park I mean that is totally crazy I understand that a lot of these acts are very expensive but I mean to me that is you know this is going after somebody's jogging or and I know if you're like me\nAnd you're going to do and I did a Gillette Stadium it's it's it's it's money that you save for a while\nYou know it's money that you saved up for a little while to to to be able to go out and uh most families around here I'm sure the same and um you know to to really to me that's a rip off I don't see really charged twenty if you have to charge but uh\nUm I don't get it and and they work it that you're less so that you because when you go to the Gillette ride Gillette has a patriot place there and they used to be a lot of stores now there are fewer stores\nAnd a few restaurants bowling alley and that kind of thing um I don't think the stores did all that well because the um the rent them I'm shopping plazas just up the street a little ways um\nBut they still businesses in there and they got some hotel very very expensive hotels in there that patriot place and um\n[noise] so I mean a lot of times you just go to Vegas I can remember one time two years ago we went to a concert but we also wanted to we went early because we wanted to um\nUm do some shopping and then have lunch and everything else and uh they make the I'm sure that you're going to stay for the thing because they put a sticker on your window or put a ticket and your window or whatever\nAnd at a certain time of the night like when all the stores close if your car is still there if you told her no I'm not going to the costs are so I'd have to pay the forty bucks I'm just going to shop over here so you can't charge me forty bucks to park his job well you know a certain time of night ten o'clock conscious still going on you're in the concert and they go around in your car still there\nAnd you don't have that ticket they'll tell ya\nSo they make sure that you know that you got to pay that and if you don't pay into your life will come out of the classroom to find a cart and gone now that would be", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "24"}
