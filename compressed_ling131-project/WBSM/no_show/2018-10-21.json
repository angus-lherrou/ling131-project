I think that the media problem in part\nUm and I think that like my pod cast start engaging other side and having a conversation hopes to puncture those levels because I think if people are really engaged with all the information that is out there in the world is a complicated place people I think are\nGender January good I and I think people that are so angry or you know let's say the far end of the resistance or the most ... most Trump is Trump or is that you can can find a it's because they they live in a bubble of of information that that pushes them and only inflamed that race\nI Do not know how we get out of that bubble I because I Am Seventy rural on yesterday my colleagues um MSNBC and she agreed with me\nMedia has an incentive to very deep and send them to super served their audience and so if you're MSNBC you have a super super incentive to over serve the people in the far left end of the a progressive agenda one percent two percent you'll have a a successful cable show\nIf you're on Fox News ... super serve the two to three percent of right wing American watches Fox every night and have a successful show there is really a place for Jamie wind surfing\nWell so I think when I grew up with you entirely incentive structure and that's the theme of my shell out over the past that have been on science that was good talking to Carlson Don Lemon this very question could you uh if you're gone lemon become a pro Trump your and keep your audience if you're a cocker ...\nBecause you become anti Trump in the eye your audience might do they\nDance around it a little bit um but I think the answer is is obviously now I Wonder if you if you ... you know your ... never Trump or you could keep your body is I think ah if it would be a very difficult thing I Do think there is an audience for something different I'm actually working on a project to see if we can create something a little bit different\nUh but right now I think the media incentive structure or is there any negative and it's not only those networks if\nIt's the desire to be her on a lot of stories that are meaningless with oftentimes\nLet things go wrong I says you put out you know false information that's corrected and no one reads the correct information I think there's a whole host of negative media incentives that that are out there\nAnd help create this current polar polarized moment um and uh it's a real problem\nThis is self serving but I'll say in any way talk radio is the last place where you can afford to be subtle\nHonestly because I Am twelve segments today and sixty segments a week I can bring on a David Kirkpatrick yesterday ... going to talk about ... and I can bring you on and I can talk to ... and I can talk to people to the left right and center quite a ways I've got the\n... when he sees that Gorka tonight ask them why you off your lifestyle and now he's on a on Twitter or he he uh you know one of the people that adamant my clock that\nOh that's interesting he would sell a lot of books we got a brand new book out I'm a why we fight which would be good for him to sell books on maybe he was waiting for the book to come out like Tucker I Will ask him\nBut it does seem to me that the talk radio is really the last place that can drive people to work I got to get in breaking news I gotta I gotta make sure they know what the markets are doing and if something happens big I am here for them and I will tell them exactly what's going on\nBecause we have lied breaking news all the time\nBut I don't think television can afford to do that because every individual show is a half hour or an hour and a half to super served their people\nWell I'm interested in your your radio perspective\nI mean I I Wonder if Glenn Beck would agree with you I think he\nAh has been hurt mightily by by his position on the election I Wonder mark eleven could become a remained in ... I never Trump or as he was in ... Joe and maybe they shouldn't be you know maybe you have to therapy audience but those incentives truckers I'm sure a came into play with mark lab and was thinking\nAbout uh whether he continues on a interviewee Adams Donald Trump or not and it seems like he's taken a one hundred and eighty degree I I Do think the media incentive structures a run run the gamut everywhere but you're in radio you might might have a better perspective than I\nI Do believe you cannot be never Trump and expect to have conservatives listen to you got to be a balls and strikes person and when you got justice Gorsuch injustice cabin on its dispositive I had this arguing with the never Trump or before Justice Kennedy retired\nSaid if we had a retirement and we get another Gorsuch it's dispositive you should have voted for Trump and the never Trump or said no it's either this is silly yes it is a must you come up with a counterfactual where\nA Kennedy doesn't retire Hillary Clinton put two people on the court the court would have been lost to originalism probably forever as it is to Supreme Court justices twenty nine federal appeals court justices in southern sixteen billion dollars in the defense budget\nThis isn't an argument anymore you can't be a never Trump or any more Kenya Jamie\n... I ... I did I Do think it is an argument you I think that there's no question that praised Trump those moods but I think there's a lot of them and and this is not a theme but my I guess I bring on people who are super pro Trump if people who are never crop or you're a though the left and I and I do pose this question\nI I Am and I lay out a similar view of the positive things that Donald Trump has done but then I Do think there are the questions of ...\nAh that that ah you know this quarter ... society is that right now if you um ... not a claim Donald Trump or significant part of that is president of the United states\nThat actually I can I cannot not blame him because I think that preceded him I Believe he is a product of that division we'll we'll\nPet president President ... have you been presidents I disagreed with him at work that tone it down\nBut it doesn't matter I mean President Obama's ... allegedly worked to tone it down with his beer summit but in fact he always felt that President George W. Bush work the tone I always joke that we\nDisagree to some extent who after Carl then what happened there are no President Obama gave a speech a credit to tone down the quality of how things\nAre what about after what about after Oklahoma City when Bill Clinton the land rush\nBut let me let me finish you President Trump I think are undeniably\nAnd I I Will agree with you that you know that's going to be historically with again a I think that I think what I Would give him credit for it and then it is rhetoric on business being open an America that kind of your role has has probably helped released an animal spirit I\nThink when you're out who this guy the court fire on them after they make these\nFishery as Sherry I'd just like every other presidents Jamie we're out of time will continue a genuine sings\nOne nation and almost human history was built on that bedrock [noise]\nNow we're in a Republican opposite people lines of people and for the people [noise]\nSelf government requires street\nJustice freedom requires an individual willing to self governing\nFreedom made America exceptional but it can only last as long as you and I seem to be expressed by the laws of nature and nature's God\nYou can only laugh you and I choose to act as people's character [noise]\nForging character has been the pursuit in Hillsdale College Eighteen forty four\nHillsdale comments for just carrying during the civil discourse moves on campus and nationwide to find out how you\nCan take their free online courses where we see the complimentary subscription to find a monthly speech digest visit them freedom dot com that Hillsdale freedom dot com that is just a shoo shoo shoo [noise]\n\nHey I'm Scott from plugging pest free I Want to personally think all my plug in past very cost most who have taken the time out to call right and who left messages to thank me for ruining their homes and businesses of I'm wanted wrote it in the past\nSo for me to you I think you\nPlug in pest phrase the only scientifically tested and more importantly\nConsumers proven electro magnetic pest management system since Nineteen Ninety five why put up with those annoying ... any longer plugging in past phrase one hundred percent chemical free making it you'll safest bet to manage your wrote an impasse problems around your family and pets\nWith a six to eight I money back guarantee you have nothing to lose\nSo older yours today at go past free dot com you is probably my card save twenty four twenty percent off and free shipping\nThat go past free dot com probably my card save twenty times spraying regret plug in and forget go past free dot com today\nMidterm elections are right around the corner and it's obvious ... will do anything to win you may not realize that even your cell phone bills used up on liberal cause those which now through the nation's only conservative cell phone company patriot mobile patriot mobile provides nationwide reliable service with unlimited doctrine text and know hidden fees", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "21"}
