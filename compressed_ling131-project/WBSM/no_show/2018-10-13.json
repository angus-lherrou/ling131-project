different than a than than me you can get in a supermarket\n[noise] yeah so I mean there's several differences or across all the different types of meat for the pork it'd be fit it all depends it all started with a me trying to find grass fed beef um for my wife\nUh so we're doing all these different diets and I'm uh trying to find every guy was like a hundred percent grass fed beef and I started looking for it and couldn't find it couldn't finance supermarket couldn't find it and I just got obsessed with finding grass it'd be\nTurned out I got a cow share which is like you get a cow share yeah [laughter] you get like a folk how I'm it cut up into steaks and uh\nI got to share it was too much meat so I gave them my friends they like this they would like that yeah next time I got more next time I got more and the last time I basically I split it up uh I I say like a drug dealer and split it up on the floor and all these people bought their share and one guy was like this would be so much better if it's just delivered to my house\nI was like yes yes it would be [laughter]\nAnd you had to do business [laughter] yeah so I was um I was a CEO of a company called custom made dot com which was Google Ventures backed and brought a connected consumers with makers so all these American makers across the country who can't make a living doing what they love\nOur whole thing was they could now a basically tap or an audio across the country\nI'm really cool business we you know lots of the tens of thousands of families were able to you know yeah get all this\n... this I asked her about this if I could mention it the ... the the beef comes from Australia\nYes why is that yeah so um [laughter] so a hundred percent grass fed beef let me just like take a step back and I got on the market a little bit so\nA Ninety eight percent of the beef consumed in this country was put into was fed grain I'm generally in a feedlot so what happens is the first Eighteen months of cows lie for exactly the same six months a cow calf where the cows eating milk from his mother and then a year where it's called the year ... and it basically lives on grass\nAnd then Ninety eight percent of them instead of just continuing to eat grass go to a feedlot or they're fed a diet of fat and up they get fat and up yeah\nAnd if you even think about like um\nA in a restaurant you know people no choice prime select right all that is is a marveling scored how fat that we get that animal that is that there's no like how tender or was it what the taste like\nAll the matters is putting found in the turns out in the fifties and sixties and seventies and up until today people care a lot about eating cheaply this this tastes better way better way\nBetter you know like I read the copy of I say I don't know if my people ought to be healthier but they they are concerned that pace\nThe taste is incredible um yeah so grass fed basically the animal just lived on grass for his entire life um and going back to your question\nThe challenges this country is set up for a couple of things one nobody cares about the farmer anymore to um everyone's trying to get the cheapest price possible to you I'm basically\nFeeding an animal grass takes a lot of time or in the system is set up to incentivize the farmer to get rid of the cat right it's actually kinda crazy like even down to the loan so\nFormer gets alone to take the cow between six months in Eighteen months that loan expires at Eighteen months which means they have that cow has to trade hands they\nCan't really the cattle and we're talking about how there were thousands of dollars yeah you're talking about\nBecause we don't have that much time and I didn't defend Australia\nBut oh no [laughter] no but it's good it's really it's really good be quiet but I Wonder also ... would you go to what your box dot com you get all the stakes that you can only get at restaurants you got to get them at supermarket right like uh like I was mentioning earlier hanger stick yep hanger stick by Kevin why can't get a hanger stake except at what your ball\nWell so we well we do is we ship a month's supply of meat directly to your door
