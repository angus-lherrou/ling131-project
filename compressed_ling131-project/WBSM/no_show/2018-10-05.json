should he be confirmed as anybody flip from here what is Susan Collins do at three o'clock this afternoon now she's about an hour and twenty minutes away from announcing her vote on whether or not to confirm Kavanaugh do you think anybody's switches votes at this point uh we saw a mansion go by the way of Kavanaugh\nOr we saw um a ... a go of I'm away from him\nI'm calling ... voted yes but this was not necessarily voting for him this was voting to end the debate and setting up\nVote tomorrow or the vote today does not necessarily have to go to the same way tomorrow could go differently and that we could see some changes so I didn't know what do you think should he be confirmed and will he be confirmed do very different things there by the way down at six o five hundred and Europe next and nobody BSN\nWell to answer your question yes I Believe they should be given the position okay and I believe it will last but not a quick question for you yeah\nWhen he was accused of this he lost his his his job at the university they told them don't come back at Harvard at what's going to have to look for what you think she'll keep her job in the California system washer she'll be ... ...\nOh you know she's going to keep her job yes she will in fact she'll get she'll get offers so\nQuite a five hundred thousand dollar job or someplace that they should do one for the team yeah who can get some quiet corner of northern California doing welfare so well\nShe yeah she she she she'll she'll get electric tore she's going to get a book deal um she'll get a you know opportunity to do some um uh some teaching at some other school some guest a guest instructing as some other schools Harvard will probably however\nUm so yeah she's going to make a lot of money off of this there is a possibility though that she could be in some legal peril here and I don't know if you've heard that a Senator Grassley who chairs the Senate Judiciary committee is demanding a further FBI investigation and he wants some of the documents and communications between her and her lawyers\nOr whether or not there was a any a a cooperation of this whole story not cooperation but any um oh what's the word I'm thinking about here um um um [noise] yeah and they accuse trumpet collusion any kind of collusion here to try and come up with you know between the Congress the Russian collusion yeah the Russian collusion yeah that\nIs that's the only thing that can your\nHow 'bout Democrat collusion so you know is there any collusion between the Democratic party and her lawyers and her to come up with a story to ah you know to try to take him down and that's what Grassley wants to know so ...\nVery aggravated because you're going to want to Rollie yeah the Duke lacrosse case yeah those people's lives were ruined yup ... shows or gets away with it it becomes to become a celebrity\nWhat do you think in terms of Brett Kavanaugh's life will ever be normal again\nOh God no number and the kids\nWell hopefully the kids they well they can have some sort of a normal life yeah\nWell you've got these these fools these these more on that or a chasing Ted Cruz do restaurants in Mitch McConnell through airports in and Jeff Flake or into the elevator and everything else you don't you think they're going to harass these kids if if he gets on there I don't I don't think that all of a sudden come Monday morning\nUm all these people just go away I think they're going to continue to harassment of him and I think the Democrats get control of the house they're going to try to impeach him\nBut I think it's going out for Bill is one thing going after a child they should bring them up on charges on sugar tractors they can they can bring them up on\nYou know leave ... since since Chelsea Clinton you leave kids alone it's not their fault yeah\nNo I agree with you hundred percent and then I was always um I remember when the Obama kids were ah or the ... the oldest daughter was working on the vineyard and everybody was you know it's like you leave the kids alone they deserve their privacy uh they're only kids once and uh you just leave him alone there that that that's off limits\nYeah she was working at the ice cream shop like most normal kids would love to get the normal\nRight and then there's there were people calling in their problems with the fact that do we had secrets or a service sitting outside the ask them you know what she didn't ask for that\nYou know she didn't ask for that unfortunately we live in a day and age in a world where you got to have six Secret Service agents sitting outside the ice cream shop while you're working there\nBut she's sixteen Seventeen year old kid and she wants to where I you know do things the way the normal sixteen and Seventeen year old kids do and we shouldn't deprive her of that and we shouldn't we shouldn't to deny her an opportunity to do that so I was all for the Obama girls\nAre working and I think any a child of anybody involved in public life should be left alone\nI agree with you there are a hundred percent\nPrimary for good call appreciate it thank you find a way not not six o five hundred and um yeah I think I I this is not over\nYou know and again we talk about the midterms coming up if you like what you're seeing right now with this harassment of a cabinet on wait if the Democrats take control of the Congress there are already promising they will impeach judge Kavanaugh\nSo his nightmare isn't necessarily over and the national nations a nightmare isn't necessarily over either because they're already talking about elect us so that we can impeach Kevin us how would you really want is that what you'll elect politicians to do members of Congress do to keep on harassed\nHey Supreme Court nominee and ultimately a Supreme Court justices that that really what you want people\nAre you are paying to run your country to do um so I mean this is not over and it's not over by a long shot all of this doesn't go away Sunday Morning if they vote Saturday Night to make ... a member of the Supreme Court and the stuffing just all go away the cats don't just take their hats off\nA disassembled their science thrown back in the SUV and head home and say oh well we lost this one ah\nYou know it goes on in it intensified she gets worse and worse and worse and if you give the Democrats control of the house they are promising you\nSheldon Whitehouse promised you Gerald now around New York they're promising you they will proceed with impeachment proceedings against the against the cabinet if they get control of the you know the house in addition to that deal and proceed with impeachment against the Trump to they're promising this\nSo I don't know why we would disbelieve them so that's what you want to honor in total chaos after November six then vote Democrat but personally I don't think I Want that by the way not now six o five hundred your next in Libya

you don't\nHave the right to me this second the second thing and he was quite honestly you know hit hit try to destroy somebody's in Korea with their family their children and parents are part of the world\nYou know tell them you can't call it any more chicken off the coach for the all the all the things that he wasn't enjoy and expect him go up there and just will like\nYeah you're kidding me and don't have any money is if they all said and done perjury that the Democrats are on their back on or walk away\nOh yeah they'll kick her to curl up yeah yeah well I like to think\nWell maybe even sooner than that because grass we use demanding some by the FBI to get a hold of her route communications with the Democrats in with her lawyers and and uh the polygraph she asked me never saw the entire a thing that we never got the uh\nUh the notes from her a counselor that we're supposed to I indicated back in two thousand twelve she was already talking about that so they started to get a little bit close to the Democratic well you can you get that Sunday Morning if this vote happens tomorrow night and he is confirmed by Sunday Morning she's useless to them\nYou're absolutely right that he could have gone yeah [laughter] yeah yeah the ticker or money from her home or go on that\nYeah but you don't think a little bit about you know I'm sitting here listening to you and I'm thinking about this you know so these people come along right these Democrats come along and they take this guy be absolutely whip the hell out of him right tears family to shreds his reputation to shreds\nA and everything else and then when he sits down they say and you sit there and you better act the way that we think you better be hey man you got to step out of line and get you know what I mean they're they're trying to control this guy are easy to every ... as the degree here and they don't have a right to do that\nYou know the problem is when you when you put somebody in a position where they have nothing\nNothing yet nothing like going in there and the un yeah\nI agree with that I I agree with that a hundred percent I think at that point he was probably wondering whether he was going to be confirmed or or what the next year was was going to be to drop\nAnd everything that he had and that he's worked so hard for up to this point was already being taken away from him you're right what does he have to lose and if they turn around and say well you can't have a job well then he says well up yours I don't want it anyway so what is lost but he's he's he's uh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley a Chuck Schumer come out and say hey you know what this is a good idea well hey you know what this is this is worthwhile I Can't remember a press conference with Chuck Schumer has come out and and and not said something to the fact that this is why we got to stocks humor\nAnd and his ilk below sea and in Feinstein and\nWas with Warren and the rest of them they really really come across a slimy and I don't understand how people can understand being a Democrat anymore can't hit you guys wake up your Democrats out there and I understand that some of your pretty intelligence and you've got you've got some intelligent callers that that guy a cause of the\nDSM frequently I forget his name all of a sudden I'm drawn up front part\nBut that could be anybody we've got a lot of intelligent call us\nBut no you know what we had a great example of what you're talking about I don't think people we had a couple of weeks ago I don't know if you've heard we had a former state representative Bob Korea on the program here's a guy who's in his eighties he's been around for a long time he was in the legislature for thirty some odd years\nAnd he's been a Democrat is whole time and he's a voting for Jeff deal in and against Arizona okay so here's a guy who a caller called up and said why don't you there and walk away from your party why are you still and he said you know what I'm going to walk away from much harder\nTo walk away if my party is that for me I Need to clean I Need to work to clean these losers out of my party and reclaim that so there are a lot of Democrats getting around the earth let me just sit out I'll give you a chance to respond but there are a lot a lot of good Democrats out there listening right now that are very torn between all of this they don't want to leave the party they want\nA with lying to Congress right the perjury perjury\nSo that's what he was um\nBut he's still watching removed from office because the uh the Senate voted to uh to not do that and not to follow that so\nI just because somebody is impeached but what it does do is to create a constitutional crisis and uh you know you go to trial going on now you got to try to get a Supreme Court justice on trial you go to president on trial or whatever and that's what that you know that's what the Democrats want to listen to what you're telling you what the Democrats are telling you as a leg just to the house\nA you know to control the house you get electricity control the Senate and we will come up with any charge we can find what Trump on trial\nAnd deport judge Kavanaugh trial so that's their agenda going forward impeachment trials for all the president for Supreme Court justice just what we need for the market just what we need for a stability in our economy right\nIssue I have the Democrats focused on impeaching the president and a beach in the Supreme Court justice is that what you want is that the direction you want to go in I don't care whether you're a Democrat or not and that is certainly not the direction of anybody should be looking out for our country right now I'm going to take a quick break stay right there we'll get to your call next and nobody is yeah\nYou think you know movies British installment of don't trivia here's and things you may not have known about the star trek

be an ethics series I mean there's going to be really tight is going to be a lot of fun\nAnd I'm looking forward to it or the last time the red Sox and the Yankees met in the post season it was two thousand four\nAnd you know what happened there\nOr the Yankees were three games to none and the red Sox barrel back and won four straight first time that's ever happened\nAnd a big Papi and all of that kind of stuff right wasn't that something I'm hopefully we're not going to do the same thing this time I mean I Want to win the series but I don't want to lose the first three caves and have to go through that stress again of watching for four days after that that was a\nWho that was a that was something wasn't I'm so we'll see what happens so we've got the Sox Yankees tonight game one of\nThe season of the series begins with a pre game it's six twenty\nAnd ah actually I think six thirty six thirty in the first pitches at seven thirty two and a ... by some great great sponsors like a shooting supply in of course you could pass right here at fourteen twenty WB is and what do you do for the game tonight I'm I'm going to be a home\nAnd watch it at home with my wife and maybe my son I don't know if he's going to be around or not but I Know my wife and I watch the game probably go out for by the first and settling and not watch it and I'm\nLooking forward to it right what's October without baseball I got to have some some baseball\nAnd my friends who were arrive A's fans have got some friends out in ... in Oakland stocked in actually in California and they were they were thinking this was going to be it they were going to get through the Yankees are never going to come and beat the red Sox and eventually go all the way of Cinderella year I was more if I was really afraid of the AIDS that at the age where a\nKind of like a Cinderella team you know and sometimes you get something like that going and it's a little team that could that nobody else believes and sometimes it can be very dangerous those are the teams you can overlook and um but uh the is gone and now the Yankees are in town and it's going to be a fun night\n[noise] alright fight away not next week so five hundred we are awaiting a a press conference at three o'clock I'm not even sure if it's a press conference or if it is a I'm\n\nJust going to be a statement delivered or what not quite to the Republican senator from Maine Susan Collins is to a an ounce\nAt three o'clock which way she plans to vote tomorrow and the Kavanaugh nomination if you're just getting out of work and you're not quite sure what's happening or there was a vote today it was a um a procedural vote\nThat's what they called cloture and uh basically um it ended the debate on the whole Kavanaugh situation and proceeded\nOr or move the whole thing a forward to the a formal vote which has now scheduled to take place sometime tomorrow or four or five o'clock tomorrow maybe even a little bit later than\nThat is when the vote is going to happen and um [noise]\nWhat what was so so ah what was interesting is that Susan Collins did in fact vote foreclosure did vote to advance this to the next to the next big vote tomorrow\nBy Jeff Flake also voted yes and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia ah one of those are Democrats in in in in a boost in a red state that I have a little bit worried about in terms of his reelection he voted yes\nA Claire McCaskill by the way he voted no and uh Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Republican voted no as well and again these are not\nSo Kelly's because just because you voted no this afternoon or you could do more or vice versa right so uh we don't know exactly how this is going to go down a Ed Markey of Massachusetts how do you think he voted no he voted to know how do you think you'll vote tomorrow he'll vote no hope\nI'll lose Warren yelled out her no today and you know she'll do the same to mark\nI'm there so the announcement at three o'clock is going to be very significant in terms of how this thing might go tomorrow or Susan Collins does not have the luxury all sitting there listening to the way other senators vote because it's alphabetically\nShe's one of the first ones right or at least with Murkowski if she wants to see if you take a ... percent voting\nAnd then decided last minute which he's going to do tomorrow she's got that she's got that ... ability to do that because her name as a\nYou know way down the other end of the opposite qualities right into it to be getting so the book today was fifty nine forty one out Collins goes a if everything else stays the same Collins goes with the nose or they were looking at a fifty fifty by it which case ... steps in and she asked the Chinese ... breaking boat it would be a\nHobby you know fifty one to one fifty but ah one senator can use a daughter who's getting married in Montana and here he is going to fly and he's going to the wedding for his daughter's wedding Japan's gonna fly into boats and see that should\nBe fairly interesting that you have to explain how much time right I think that there's no snow on the ground up there yet but it's the second break up anybody at a mosque and go\nDo you think he will be confirmed and do you think he should be confirmed it's very very different questions there\nAre so far the results are on that score well written down somewhere here and there are so far but it's only been in any form of old swam to too many votes to nine people say he will be confirmed only to say you know\nAnd your on your side\nUm should he be confirmed at the tip of people say Oh yes you should be confirmed down one says no she", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "05"}
