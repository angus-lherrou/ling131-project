thing is is that the way they handle it\nI think so very I think so I I think I think you come to work or alternative but to do that and I think that's got to be the best way to handle it mass mass arrests and just fall\nYou take back over the world that's all we got we got the book is like you said the women and children\nYeah I'm afraid I'm going to hold you right there I Want to see what some other folks thinks ... five hundred thanks for hanging on your next in Namibia Sam\nGrasping but I always have a\nLot you handle it it's real simple you have to women and children and then you turn only the males that's it that's how you handle it and then ... then you find out who's sponsoring this then you freeze their assets you get the best computer hackers in the world the dream that bank accounts so they won't do it again\nWell the only problem though so you let the women and children and ride the children automatically become citizens and\nThey have to be born here they're they're they're not born is about citizen\nScience they got it All right you you you correct in that point but do you get the issue with chain micro first of all the all go on welfare second of all um they

which we will have right here on WB assembled game one of the world series gets underway\nOh with the pre game and about seven or seven o'clock and then the first pitches eight or nine or some make sure your president right so you can listen to it and find a way not now six o five hundred and thanks for hanging on your next the w._b. assume\nLike hey I'm this is not a a migration problem now it's a it's a foreign invasion organize forward and then you have you have to send the troops\nOkay ah I was watching Fox last night and I'm a claiming liberal what's his name Rielle go oh Geraldo Rivera yeah ah ah\nDon't send the troops he says don't send them up with her for her to ask them world order when these people got no answer ... so\nThese liberals I guess they all they want to let them in but what happens with the next wave and an extra weight that's going to come and yeah\nThat's true and you know what this is really the result Trump is right when he said when he says this is the Democrats ball because this is a result of eight years of catch and release\nAnd are you know Democrats are they the one open borders\nAnd Democrats want to do away with the ice so you're sitting down in Honduras Guatemala and you say hey I got a pretty good chance of getting in listening to these guys I all I got to do is get up there and then I can get in if I get in I I get to stay there I get to Central Park five men may and everybody else they can all come into and\nYou know so yeah I mean this is the result of politicians and Republicans get a lot of blame for this too because for decades we've not been able to get any kind of a political um agreement on what to do to stop it from happening\nAnd um you know that border should've enough years ago two thousand five two thousand six Democrats were pushing for a border but rock Obama Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton all wanted it John Kerry they all wanted it and now they don't want it\nAnd when you were you notice we're not getting any help from the Mexican [noise]\nNo not at all no now they're actually they're open them come up\nYeah so you got to wonder you know you gotta wonder who is involved in organizing this in India is Mexico\nPeople who is eating these people along and down but more importantly we got to get out on election day we gotta send help to Trump and he's got to get the votes that he needs to get full funding for that wall maybe a year from now at this point we can now look back at this in in you know have the wall construct and he says it takes less than a year to get the wall built\nAll ah incidents of going to happen when these people arrive at the border you know so I think the majority of the people don't understand that they don't know that Trump because [noise] what else can we do yeah you can't let 'em all them\nNo well I agree with you thank you my friend ... five hundred thanks for hanging on your next the w._b. is a\nGood afternoon pay\nAnd consideration of everything you just said as well that was said by your two callers ago\nAnd maybe I'm misinformed but I haven't heard or read about a plan to deal with this other than we may send the military there there are no refugee camps being built I conjecture that this first wave is as good as in this country\n'em do more American troops behind it was called ... and they they're out here for\nThat but it does it does in the long run it doesn't matter what troops there weren't that we became the picture of the war\nRight right but I Know you've sent us\nAll right okay what did I misspoke okay what what are the troops were in the picture um I guess it's kind of irrelevant in that that became the face that America saw at home this is what your troops are doing overseas and and that turned to turn these is the opinion on the war instantly overnight in\nThe south you mean\nWhat was actually bought an order from the American commander\nAll right but you know what it didn't it doesn't matter whether it was bombed from the moon it happened in this picture was captured I Believe it was by UPS who's put on the front page of every paper and people here and all they do and and the shows they sitting here at home and they look at this and they say this is what we're involved in it and it changed the the public opinion immediately\nI mean you know there were marches going on all over this country everything else people were upset with the war but nothing turn public opinion on the war faster than that picture dead\n... yeah that's right but I'm just saying it was an American wind\nWere okay All right I stand corrected on that basically that was many many years ago my mind is getting a [laughter] that foggy I can pick I see the picture as clear as day in my mind or or most people probably can horror around then right\nAnd ... and now he's been off a she works for your ... and ... and it's because she's about ... ... ... or like a changed around\nYeah so what do you think's gonna happen here in the border\nOh man I think that if something mocked on and off it's just going to continue to be some comic crap you know I mean in a\nA build up to like\nContinuous continuous and it's just gonna keep happening to their people get their way they're going to keep trying to travel more and more people are going to get it wants to\nBe like that right yeah and again my my question is how do you stop it how do you stop this immediate situation\n[noise] I don't know um I don't want to be like for\nI I don't know what to say\nWhat the Israelis\nDo stop traffic you know the wall to wall would be great I'm as a first though yeah\nYeah well that would make it a hell of a lot easier to keep people from coming across if we had a border wall\nRight if we had a wall there and make it more difficult for them to come across um and if we can figure out a lot of the other stuff after that appreciating my friend thank you for the correction I Do appreciate that fiber waiting and I think so five hundred you're next on WB assembled afternoon\nHi Barry Hi how are you today pretty good how are you doing not bad or a range coming down pretty good\nYou know what you're up there have been the sun's coming out again\nOh is that right [laughter] it's all over [laughter]\nNo this was a when I just try and tragic my phone and call yeah I'm trying to make a voucher analogy about the Vietnam remember that picture was well yeah\nI think there are two thousand ah twenty or twenty Eighteen is the different period mindset or people with uh the mass protests that that happened back then against well Vietnam wall that's way in the past\nI look for a second but you know what it was who wrote the song goes to picture paints a thousand words that was that was brand riding it was back in the ... they could make a yeah somebody some somebody wants to get a picture paints a thousand words okay\nSo you've got a picture remember just not that long ago we had the kids in cages down on the ... down on the the most when I write\nSo you get a picture of a kid in a Cajun automatically the you know the whole\nThe whole uh you know the country comes apart over that you see a kid on the ground you see a woman on the ground trying to cross the border\nAnd what's that going to do\nIt the image and they'll be portrayed and all the papers but I usually uh as as a pet got voted Democrat and all that stuff I myself ah not a\nThis to me it's like an invasion and innovation him and I don't\nPersonally see any uh I saw them clashing with the Mexican\nOn the television and it was violent they were pushing the police the way and I think they may try to do this if they do this there'll be some conflict with the American military there's no or if you're going to get ugly and yeah I don't think there's any solution Barrett people not going to be happening in\nThe other side is gonna want them to be stopped\nUh anyway it's that's how I take it anyway I just\nYou know I I agree with you hundred percent I think I think what's gonna happen there are people that are in this caravan that want violence at the border\nAnd um they want that because that makes the case it makes it more you know people are more sympathetic to them\nIf there's violence a lot of these poor people try to drag their kids out of mud puddles in Guatemala they walk 'em for thousands of miles up there to try to find a better life and some food and everything else and these mean right now so be us troops are beating them up with sticks\nI understand I understand how many people are in this country anyway if he's if I could go beyond\nIn Honduras that can't be many left yet we have\nSo much people in this country in the bars the taken all you're pouring yeah because it's a this we reached capacity\nBut we got three hundred and twenty million at the last estimate our country that three three hundred twenty eight million the estimate of illegals in this country ranges anywhere between say a eleven and maybe twenty two million yes and those just illegal immigrants\nAnd maintenance for probably even higher and you have probably even higher whatever could say that I just\nWonder why is switching topics do later subject why the Yankees fans over you and against the Dodgers\nThe red Sox won or you are you a Red Sox fan\nI Am a I Am ... I Am a I'm a Red Sox fan but I'm saying if you're you're in key fans out there they don't want\nTo happy and they're yeah they're it's like to\nSee if I was a Yankee fan I Would be I personally I'd be rooting for the red Sox and because it represents the American league\nYou you know I mean that's just me maybe I don't know I I'd probably a lot of people don't agree with me on that but I mean if the red Sox had been eliminated um I'd say you know what we played a great series congratulations Yankees and good luck against the Dodgers I might not watch the series but I Would say you know I Hope you're not going to pull it off\nUnfortunately I Can't be like that I'm a Red Sox fan and the Yankees are you know with Greg loaded so many times I've read science being beat and\nBut that's why we're better off without a rare\nOr adversaries I guess if you think he's in Red Sox fan I Hope it's a great series now I just wanted to get my input and uh it's not going to I Wish ah this is going to be some conflict and nobody wins in that situation was keep them\nYeah I agree with you they are unfortunately there's got to be a lot of losers appreciate your call my friend thank you very much I just I just I was telling the guy the sun was coming out we just had a big flash lightning grumble of thunder here or there have been but by this guy doesn't appear to be brightening someone looks pretty dark over um I guess the Easter haven and maybe not fair haven from where I'm sitting in my window here\nOr there may be still some more rain out there but it appears at least where I'm sitting right now the rain is over or at least for the moment but we did have a big old flash of light in a couple of seconds ago so [noise]\nIn any event that your observation weather forecast remember less ... used to do that on a K.
