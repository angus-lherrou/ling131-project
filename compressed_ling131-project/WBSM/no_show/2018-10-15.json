[noise]\n[noise]\nWhat it is the militia cut off from Rocky Carla all morning ... coming up bottom of the hour a okay\nI'm Sorry to report more a party or in terms of Republicans trying to suppress the boat Ari Berman says SCOTUS SCOTUS there's that oh hey guess what the first thing a drug or a judge are drinking the great the anti environment\nMake a ... which I Can't remember which means we're using now written with\nPerjury youngsters ... he uh he uh ... on his first day of the court so that's how we know he's going to be completely nonpartisan via impartial SCOTUS just upheld\nTrick or treaters it won't even go just stand on their front doorstep and just start yelling at the door until they come down and I was scared to vote but I mean\nIt's true but I think we're underestimating the number of voters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so who are fed up and and now's the time to rise up because again\nIf only women voted weed out of the most progressive country in the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party yeah this is so important for for women especially to get out and and change the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know and Bob I think I'm like I was saying it it is an interesting I mean Ted Lieu tweeted that yes the electorate has was transformed this November we experienced in Nineteen Ninety two years a woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out tonight we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so you know voting early as ... keeps saying voting by mail once in a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right\nOr oh a lot of these machines broke who sell well\nYeah and and as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression voter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans what I mean we've got so many impediments that are passed ultimately in terms of winning back at least one chamber of Congress\nAnd you know we've got all these things voter id as I said and and gerrymandering and the Russians and so on\nShiny uh and if the Israeli a habit that way but in fact I mean back in two thousand six when the Democrats sweating the and\nThere were still gerrymandering there were still voter id there were still voter suppression voter purges and all these things that we were able to overcome\nYeah exactly make a change election and I just want to say\nYeah I mean Bobby ... you know you wrote a piece here's how Russia could attack the midterms but I you know we had a caller calling yesterday that oh this is rigged already there and I'm like don't say that this is the what they want you to think to depress turnout your votes not going to count\nSo you wrote a piece you said so far there hasn't been any real proof Russians have hacked\nThe vote totals two years ago well so far but what we know for certain the Russian sent out the digital equivalent of skirmishes to test our election systems Ramona ... ability Twenty one states were infiltrated voter registration records were the very least some truth not altered perhaps just allowing democratic voters to cast ballots do an incorrect\nOr apps and registration above the point is you're right we are armed with more knowledge this time and people are finding this I mean we shouldn't have to the people are checking and re checking that they're registered finding they've been knocked off and having to re register you mean it's it's\nUm but if you say a however last time the Russians didn't really have to alter votes on election day since they fulfill effectively change the minds of voters through malicious hacks and unprecedented unchecked psi ops on Facebook Twitter except for everything we know as well as compliant segments of the news media minds were changed before the fact why risk reaching servers and the day when everyone's attention will be focused\nOn yeah yeah so you say however discussions on Twitter about voting against red state Democrats for their conservative leanings especially income incumbents like Joe mansion had been stoked by obvious rushing trolls and bots encourages liberal liberal either stay home or vote against the Democrats yeah\nThis is a is a case where I've seen the most trolls are all year in fact in discussions after the cabinet vote and uh with Joanna everyone angry at Joe mansion for casting a yes vote for cabinet which of course was was terrible and and you should've caucus with the rest of his party on that\nBut the reality is reality in West Virginia and and and we need every vote we can get in the Senate so that's all that being said you know their war they were so many trolls that were popping in\nDiscussions and and they were obvious roles to who would just jumping on the other hand all ... you know just a string of numbers yeah no profile thing and and I hadn't seen them any trolls in the area of discussion\nUp to that point and and so that that was a little concerning ... and ... and by the way I'm not trying to slow walk a possibility of a a continued Russian attack obviously\nThis is something that we all have to be tremendously concerned about but the reality is is that uh all of the hacking a has been or at least the reported hacking has just been attempted hacking and the efforts have been forwarded\nRight oh time while I'm a huge or oh they tried to spear phishing thing but we were on to them and we stopped them why they didn't get emails and so on\nThat's you know I mean not only do we not have the electoral college ball but did you say compared with twenty sixty were more prepared to deal with trolls in Boston this time and the various social media platforms to wise up a little blocking some of the more obvious efforts what we do know whoever's when the Russians will sit their attention on the ... election day or sooner\nOr given early voting um\nYou know Bob again all we can do is ... ... ... says turn out in such numbers that we can overcome all this I mean you're right we seemed like the ... Russian boss like we see you we we see you be getting involved in you know these ah you know trying to ... now they're trying to divide among the sexes you know there was more like\nThe rolling the racial issues during the twenty sixteen rings right trying to get black voters to stay home or\nNot oh yeah yeah well there today and they're trying to get liberals to stay home where you know or ... or to vote for the Republican in West Virginia a in that case and certainly in Tennessee you know we need a Phil Bredesen to win him Marsha Blackburn and Tennessee as well and\nAnd people are angry at filled bread is ending the trolls are are seizing upon that\nA man named my real concern here seven is not\nNot necessarily the trolls and the boss on Twitter and so on but ah with\nThese close races yup got so many tossup races\nAnd those are the ones that I Believe the Russians if they're going to alter vote totals or pull some sort of shenanigans on election day it's going to be with those close close races because what happens is if we were all talking about a blue wave but if the Republican candidates in these\nVarious tossup races end up winning just by a few votes\nThen it's really easy for the traditional pressed to say oh that was just because of of the energy from the cabinet confirmation of the younger the male vote after that there and and everything that Trump has been say it's going to be a red wave all this nonsense that he's been predicting about the election\nThat's what happens if not then they're not gonna go oh it's Russian hacking yeah nearly imminent fate is this innocuous thing\nYeah and you know the same thing I think I said yesterday basically you said um it's highly unlikely conservatives will be energized Kavanaugh's confirmation a month later on the other hand Democrats especially women will be out for blood and you say ... country to the bulls among a D.C press the most energizing unified ... politics right now is the Democratic party\nAnd that's why you're right you keep seeing these repeated efforts to I think I'm hoping we are too smart to fall for the same like trying to divide in the left and right\nUh yeah I I I Hope we're smarter [laughter] I I you know honestly I wasn't I was a little skeptical watching some of the reactions to Joe Manchin\nI have to go back to that ... for a second because again we're talking about electoral politics here we're talking about hard enough\nAnd we need every Democrat we can get in the United States Senate because and then half two years we may lose another Supreme Court justice and we're right back into the Brett Kavanaugh debate again yeah and in order to for that\nThe United States Senate so we can have a say so the Democrats going to have a say in terms of who Donald Trump nominees to take over I mean we're talking about a roommate or Ginsburg is eighty five Steven writers eighty a Clarence Thomas is Seventy and Sam Alito is sixty eight\nI mean these people are getting any younger and Donald Trump is still the president so how do we stop the next the cabin on disaster from across the United States Senate and that includes well elect re electing ...\nAnd we include getting people like him rather than in there too in Tennessee yeah and when you\nTalk about um you know by these how these ... these tossup races do remember that the Russians Mike Rowe targeted those three states those swing does\nThis election was decided by Seventy something thousand votes um and you see Democrats have no choice but to set all time record turnout in the mid term we're talking presidents level turnout sent a levels and greater\nI'm particularly in these aforementioned tossup races um yeah\nThat's always the key with midterms it's turnout turnout turnout whoever turns out the most voters wins these midterms because it doesn't have you don't have the celebrity at the top of the ticket to draw people into the voting now we just have\nA you know on the house side for them to thirty five different elections we've got state and local law as well and those as you were saying earlier Seventy user\nSo important because what we're talking about what the state and local elections or things like trap laws and we're talking about gerrymandering and we're talking about a census that's coming up soon we're talking about marijuana\nLaws looking about ... being able to vote yeah yeah yeah I mean these\nAre all things that are happening at the state level that I think very few people who are engaged in the daily shovel fights on Twitter or paying attention to but these are reasons we after it out and vote not to mention\nThe reality that were staring down the barrel of a possible a Republican a constitutional convention where they started proposing there liberty amendments\nNaive and then we're screw yeah a couple of great points on Twitter you made more damage courtesy of the term crisis any Republican doesn't screech bitch and wine in public is considered moderate regardless of policy positions\nAnd this one of 'em were warning shot across Carlos those rocky style Trump does a lot more skits in ... voices during his rallies he used to I blame the brain brain worms series message Andy Kaufman who's still alive please rip off the orange latex the skies and let us off the hook already president Tony Clifton isn't funny thank you yeah yeah yeah\nNo no no that was a long time ago\nShe was twenty two shoes and then went off on a tirade about Trump and people who are accused of wrongdoing so let's talk a little bit about Mitt Romney coming up in the next hour to stay tuned for that we're going to have a flashback because Mitt Romney are insisting to the media over the weekend that he was not\nA leaner no no no he was not a leader

no or whether or not it had to be public or whatever I don't know is there any details like that but in general it sounds like ... or a million bucks to her job and it's\nAmazing I I I think are strategically correct to get him out with that now a show that this will fade into yeah but yeah a ...\nChris was alluding to today was kind of important that you know this kind of and the the candidate she if she knew I was\nFor you know I'm being the only real envy and then the race and that's kind of benefit Jeff deal that has been just deal\nI yeah I I Know you were changes much though because I mean it doesn't change something for the the the ... presidential race it does because then Donald Trump can't anymore say you need to go get a DNA test because she was she can say look I got it right here\nAt in terms of what ... saying he or she however you pronounce it he's a he's an Indian he has an Indian he's in east Indian right\nAnd I to me when you're talking about zero point three to one point five percent\nThat does not make you in India and especially when they're saying here in the report that the uh the minimum requirement to claim membership to most Native American tribes or in in this country ah ranges from twelve point five percent two fifty\nPercent in the best that she's got here is point three to ... to one point five percent so that didn't even put her in the ballpark\nYeah the point I was ready to do is she ... is a promoting that he's the only real Indian and the race\nI think there's a disclosure diminishes that course sort of his campaign which in turn if you're gonna vote for shaver now you have to you in my opinion knock him off and then your choices are\nJeff deal or or ... yeah so that would benefit in my opinion Jeff deal at this point in time now that can change and ah she was going to law to do\nIt could changes is foundational piece between now and the final election I guess but uh certainly it diminishes scan and she\n... she comes so she comes back how does this impact when she comes back with the test her own test and says zero point three to one point five six and they're saying here well if you want to be considered a real India and you've got to be between twelve percent and fifty percent that she's not even in the ballpark there just this impact or in any way\nOr does it also she claims she's she's been vindicated year it's been to ...\nI I see that I I I don't know how to say as a possible when vacation okay out you can drill down on the application for her job a Harvard and what she put down there and and that could become important percentage wise\nAccording to the Boston Globe today well I guess the articles that yesterday national I today a Warren changed her ethnicity from white to Native American both at the University of Pennsylvania law school\nA eighty seven to Ninety five and at Harvard law school or in Ninety five so she claimed to be Native American so is that if I mean is that a falsify\nData that's to me that falsifying yes okay I I don't\nThink that you know to claim that your Native American not white and partial Native Americans and then that would not be a correct statement to make\nGuide service isn't over for her you know thank\nGod it again you got to pass it you know there'll be those that that keep banging away and and those those said enough you know it's a non issue and and so you you know it's better than it was yesterday let's put it that way\nYeah well I mean you agree that she needed to do that she had to do this before she announced her candidacy\nStrategically they had to do what you can whip that out during the debate if she is running for president\nAnd say look I've got my DNA results fair yeah because within two weeks that would be the issue right they would drill down like we're doing now and realize that it's only a small percentage of that would hurt\nComes out now it gets dissipated a little bit yeah um it gets passed a little bit more and becomes less of an issue in the long run\nIt's going to be interesting to see how the Cherokees respond because the Cherokees have come out of the Cherokee Nation has actually come out and had statements about her or from the get go I have to show\nThat I mean she saying Seventeen hundreds of they weren't there and so I mean the yeah well in a line or\nYeah yeah well that's the thing of the Cherokees up to this point him said that she was not a part of us there's no record you indicated at all that anybody from her background was was Cherokee Indians so ah with this kind of information not and she claimed to be just specifically she claimed to be Cherokee so are those are the condition\nThat if that's the case and historic retrievers rock yeah later the trailer too which is one of the severe is a situation under ... worried about the car yup father Native American church or a\nNation was horrendous and ah this ... this claim to be ... is a false quite you know she she she she shouldn't have that that's probably more important to go after them the percentage\nOf falls portion of histories you should\nDo right yeah absolutely yeah arch I'm going to now says ... judgment thank you my friend ... five hundred your next and W. B. some factual hanging on\nOh hi I work with somebody who claimed that they were Indian and they have they didn't have to pay federal taxes so I'm not too sure if that's really a rolling I've never seen a check but he was into\nThe ... the woman that you knew was was Indian right\nYou have to pay federal taxes the costs I guess that the United states and she was from like a reservation okay I Believe that\nWhat happened to her but my question of Warren is what was the highest for a high percentage of nationality\nWell it's in your hand it didn't it didn't break it down and said that\nUh the overwhelming or the overwhelming DNA was European\nOkay so if he wasn't from this area of the world\nWon't know her people I guess we're we're mostly European but he said there's a smidgen\nOf I'm going to write to you hold on to you as soon as the uh um\n[noise] the vast majority of Warren's ancestry ah is European um but it does support the existence of a um\nYou know a very small miniscule amount of Native American heritage is well DNA as well right\nBecause they could have traveled also ... had children generations in Europe you have the Indian ... stay here right there was a you know trade and create trend slave trade everything was happening\nSure understanding with the Europeans a lot of Europeans travel back and forth and I I wouldn't\nA label myself I have a relative\nWho great grandfather was the head wasn't Indian teeth in Canada the mic Mac tribes and he's got a clock there with his name\nTapes so and so [noise] and um it's amazing but my my relative the offspring never went and said hey wait and then can we get some kind of these apps and they never did yeah\nAnd no one ever like said hey wait a minute you could do this\nRight right you know what I got to believe that that you know when you're talking about zero point three percent one point five percent I couldn't believe that most to Boston New England would be able to find that much Native American DNA right\nYeah and some of these I could be contaminated by other I'm\nA ... that the testing other people and they mix it and I'm sure it's not exactly thorough\nWell I just you know I I just wanted to know that if she qualifies to be able to put down on an application that she's Native American um with zero point three percent to one point five six percent\nI should be able to do the same thing right on ... so I guess I'm One hundred percent something so I mean I think you and I should open a casino what do you think I don't gamble [laughter] well that's all right good that's that's good to put you in charge of that\nThen you won't be able to weigh the profits oh well [laughter] thank you my friend appreciative by the way down to six o five hundred duck Ken Pitman just wandered into the city of actually filling out a friday appreciated that was fun thanks very glad\nGlad you were available to do it now you had Sam sat around that that must have been in that interesting shell\nYeah he was um entertaining the idea of running again for mayor yeah we did not want to rule it out so that they said something contrary later on but I think he already tips his hat when we ask them directly so we'll see yeah\nWell I guess the watch will be on now because if if Korea is either removed from office tomorrow night or decided to resign on his own there'll be a a mad dash without ... again\nI mean Sam accused of all the stuff he scored and sort of like the Mitt Romney of the um you know what I'm Talking about Russia years ago is knee when it comes to that but ah yeah there's some other candidates over there too but what about a development today was why I I'm In the course\nRight away now I think it's probably better for people who are not supporting art in and want to talk about um for me or my position is I'm going to believe everything that test says\nBut if I Do I I think she's got some problems yeah because number one you you're pointing out the euro points we don't point five I think the median average just I think they really wild and fifty right around uh eighty seven percent of one percent\nIndian lineage okay and that by me again so roughly if if if this was the highest\nConfidence I think they said was six to ten generations to ... the median would be a generations okay so that means that this Native American would have been born in the area of Seventeen Seventy three right okay before the revolutionary war\nRight and this would have been a\nWhich means they will settle by the Vikings so\nI have a lot of that in there as well as British Isles 'cause over a thousand years at all intermingled\nBut I have a lot of that in there the Viking mock because we knew that back in the Nineteen nineties because of the males the Viking market was one of the first things they found\nWhen they were looking into Europe and of course since the Nineteen nineties many more of things have come out here I have something like nine hundred and forty two scattered relations who have somewhat DNA situations to me but we don't there's only a couple of them they're actually well if it would be\nClose but I I think my my point is I don't think it's going to be very difficult to to nail down whether it is the ... or the herring family that would have that\nIt would come from the ... family well that's what she's saying yeah and she's right about that it would\nCome from the maternal can come from it won't be the father side the other thing is that American Indians are very reluctant many cases to give up their DNA so the databases small\nIt's getting bigger but it's smaller than other things so they they've always been somewhat reluctant there's a whole bunch of books on this the um there's a whole set of studies from Oxford University Dr Brian ... is the books to read but he talked an awful lot of but he also talked about hunting for a for a sasquatch out there already\n[laughter] you know it was well we'll save sasquatch for another day Peter let me hold you there on the ground another one five when no five hundred you're up next the w._b. assume good afternoon\nOh you there hello Barry yes go ahead oh first project\nAnd from Missoula, Montana Trump will be out here on the Eighteenth\nOr he's gonna hit Montana Arizona and Nevada to try to avoid impeachment for himself and her cabinet but I'd like to thank Kent ... percent and then the other day and allow me to have a back or conversation and the twelve to three segment\nBecause I'm not allowed to have it when you're on new take my opening and then you turn me off and go on ... about how\nYou disagree with me and don't give me a chance to respond\nYou wanted to address the issue or do you want me to a ... here's the issue is okay\nYou issue is you're going to get more Elizabeth Warren's they're waiting in the wings your worst nightmare is by a woman a friend of married but not I was from Maine her name is Emily Cain ca I and like the Cain spell the end of his name McCain\nEmily Cain has founded emily's list dot com the purpose which is to bring women into the mainstream of politics if you get any more women into the mainstream politics you gonna choked to death and if you don't reduce the number of women in office or you're not going to survive this revolution that's coming up here\nAll right so do you think that lives with Warren intentionally lied about her heritage do you think she's actually Native American what do you think about ... yeah\nYeah I think Elizabeth Warren ... intentionally lies about every time she opens your mouth you know Elizabeth Warren is lying is that her lips are mostly okay\nBut the problem is women in high\nOffice the problem is women in high office how can you survive women in the high office you can't\nRight let me let me tell you right there because it's usually eat off the rails\nI I don't even agree with them on that I think Elizabeth Warren actually cares about unfair banking practices nothing I don't I think she's legitimate animals I don't know I don't see any reason to doubt her passion on you know trying to help the poor and that she believes that the the ... the methods that she's you know invested in the are the best ways I\nJust read it to the bedroom I don't like yeah I don't agree with things but I think you're right I mean she was legitimate in in in that regard\nBut um she lied to the point of putting down a false\nEthnicity on on applications in order to get ahead of other people\nSee now I I you know I watched an entire list the professors that were interviewed by the Elizabeth Warren office that uh we're responsible for her being hired in Austin or in Houston or in a I think ... University of Pennsylvania and then Harvard\nAnd all of them said to her a Native American heritage had nothing to do with that but if you ever heard\nOf a hiring or someone he admitted yeah\nWell you know we needed we needed a a a a black female is for a quota so that's why she was hired well yeah when I was ever said that in\nHistory it it has happened I mean it's happened to me personally I have been told by ... and my business years to go back in the Nineteen seventies that\nWe have I'm not talking about our own of action I'm Talking about you know for like a free hiring like like ... the people who do it uh for the aesthetics of it so that as\nWell but whether or not it entered into her being hired and not\nReally doesn't matter what what matters here is her honesty on it\nIt doesn't matter if she checked it off and she made it up and denied an actual minority from getting a position I think\nThat doesn't mean that's the part that matters whether or not the u._s. or serving\nMinority out there that needed that job\nWell yeah but that that I might point but I mean I'm I'm saying ... you're saying there's no evidence that it actually helped to get hired a okay with that but I'm saying that I mean they're they're denying the fact that she lied about it in order to get a foot up on somebody else\nNot just because I'm an investigator I'll say this I don't know that she lied about it she that may have been her understanding but there but I think that when you go forward and check off a box or whatever you do to make again in a you know over others I think you should\nKnow the to the Boston port ... cording to the Boston Globe\nAnd that she changed from white to Native American right it's not as though she'd gone her entire life saying that I'm Native Americans because there's already been told so there's a little bit of evidence\nThere that she may have used it for her advantage and that's that's worth looking at and that's something people need to consider I'm just saying I don't know if if this information fell on hard a point where she doesn't change it or if she actually believes that or not but the fact is is that it's very unlikely should have known about any Indian heritage Native American heritage\nFrom a woman who was born in Seventeen Seventy three ... seven generations before her mom\nIt's very unlikely that they would ... and it's even less likely that you would have her ... her her parents would have had to uh ... have looked over that being the case\nI don't know you know I understand there was a ton of racism that we can't even comprehend the way A People's\nMinds worked back then was based strictly on you know you have to be exactly like may have to believe in God the exact same way I Do end denomination in any other way but I still can't imagine somebody seven generations removed from the lineage of an American Indian would have to hide that in shame I so what does this go from here\n[noise] um well it's going to be a battle it's gonna be a battle for the minds of of the uh the voters or you know there's going to be people just going to matter\nUm I think that uh well it will matter if if they can drum up the idea that uh it was racist who did this to her ... her when she was telling the truth the whole time\nOr they could use that this is why it's being presented at this time yeah because if it's not being presented at this time it's there she's bringing it up because you know it was about to be brought up in another context but to have less than one percent and ate generations removed it does not jibe with her story in an anecdotal somehow she she came to believe she was a Native American\nAnd given the press coverage that this will get CNN MSNBC Boston Globe all of these places they are going to say look she's ... she does have and she's already saying look I'm vindicated in um we may see if there was regional\nReasonable people as your ears political ads which has been the case\nYeah so does that mean how does that play with the I mean the public in the public and look out and said get over this it's a it's it's you know over and\nI think that this is a ...\nThis is a soundbite America and yeah you know it's whoever can\nGet out the repetitions of the message so right now she's American then you know I mean how many are going to actually find out she's less than one percent Native American so I'm not going to actually sort of realized that what she said I'm In terms of what her mother told her could not have been true with how this actually lines up\nGenerations ago does that get too deep for the average yeah yeah 'cause I don't I don't I mean we're headline society\nAnd so when you were shrunk if your advice in Trump's you tell them keep on with the Pocahontas remarks are just drop it in in New forgot about it\n[noise] I I leave it alone\nI'll leave it alone look at it you know ... unless it's brought up mhm and then you can specify why you have a problem with it but I I wouldn't go after it because we all know that part of what the mainstream media does is they omit information in order to get Italy in a certain way so you know you have to it it's tough never getting through the\nThrough the or the media today if you're on a if you're trying to message something that's not you know preferable to what they're trying to get out

know there may be a somebody else has something on her or maybe these numbers and they were going to release it she released this first um she's obviously looking to get this behind her she goes into the presidential race\nUm but I don't think you can look at zero point one percent to one point five percent and claim Native American heritage would that mean that ...\nAnd to say that she got her
