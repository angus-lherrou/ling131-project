done that\nAlready welcome back to the program our number two it is now eight minutes after one o'clock on a sunshiny but very Chilean breezy Thursday Afternoon glad happy thank you ... the mayor for coming in as he does a once a week to chat with us it back\nOr various issues so the mayor I said that there's something very interesting that today well he said a lot of these interesting but I wanted to particular uh that I wanted to bring up ... said to me\nThere's just things that are New Bedford does not have a recall provision it to the best of his knowledge there is nothing in the charter a that allows for the removal of somebody from office and um you know this is something that we spoke yesterday with my my ... from Fall River\nOr who is the chairman of the charter commission or this is why it's important to understand the charter and to know what's in it and the city of Fall River I Will review their charter automatically every ten years or to make sure that it's up to date and the dress a certain things but you know you don't really um\nKnow how to deal with situations until they rise right is one thing to say well we've got a charter and and ah well there are people in the legal department that understand the charter um\nIf you don't know what's in it you can't plan for events that nobody ever plans for a mayor to go rogue or a member of the city council to go rogue or or anybody else in government all but at the date comes when you do need to remove somebody from office if you don't have a provision for that\nThen you have chaos right\nAnd um so the mayor suggested that it's something that he thinks\nThe city of New Bedford should do adopt a provision for recall so that if you have a corrupt may early you have a corrupt\nUh had the paperwork and how to root for the ordinance committee okay a certain provisions unnatural either at the time there was a couple of coke\nSo that was real worried about it so to speak I had to do with felonies I'm not going to mention the name but what I did is I put a a you know I have a sunset provision\nAhead a sunlight provision where are the effects of it wouldn't take place until January\nOf two thousand and one or something to that effect to alleviate of their worries about it just in case something happened with their own cases but um that that after a I Believe is an odd minutes committee a and at the time I I think uh in addition to having\nA the the council support a can make that shot to change your whole new petition or would have to go forward along with I think it was a prime Fifteen thousand signatures\nSo so in other words you would have to get legislative approval\nYeah there there was a bit of Africa through the whole thing because you're actually changing a charter legislative process\nSo obviously you think you do agree with the mayor and see it's time to think about putting this\nOh absolutely I mean I think could happen I mean it's like you said you know instantly you know it can turn the whole thing into chaos right now we're seeing and for a rubber frankly yeah and uh so yeah I recall petition I think it's an important thing\nIn terms of the gubernatorial\nHold on one of my one question on that time before we move on and so so that remains to this day and ordinance comedian that never goes away that stays on the table\nThey'll know where they did with that I I don't know uh yeah you'd have to recall the time I had to step down because of mental health issues and I I didn't follow it\nRight right right but there were a few things that I brought forward that should've ended up in this committee okay I'm a\nSummer would have to go back to the council gender and she could vote on that but I I I think I recall the that's where it was sent choice should still being if a dead or it could have been disposed of in August can vary depending on who the chip person was I don't know\nA city clerk would have that information you\nCould ask equipped to fight it would be somewhere between January of two thousand to a April of two thousand\nOkay uh from the council agenda they'd be able to look it up front that many costs and maybe eight\nConstantly genders I could see the petition and uh what happened to the vote and the referral\nOkay yeah the\nGubernatorial race uh I I happen to support she where I think you should\nBe involved in that they are I think will give the the uh the electorate a whole complete different view on a what a senator should be\nAnd uh how they they they they should uh represent folks this guy is a very bright individual\nAnd ah I'd love to see it but the debate between the two a Democrat and Republican Potter I happen to be independent and that's not why I'm going to be supporting him so far and I will listen to the debate and that may help turn my mind a little bit\nBut I usually don't anyone that's addressed the fishing industry you know I haven't heard a definitive answers\nFrom a show that the war in our midst deal uh regarding the ongoing issues that we have here\nI think you know I think that um\nDid you do whether or not he should be included I think absolutely he should be included um you know I I think if you put the effort in you you get out there you you\nGet the signatures you get self side you know on the ballot and uh you know you absolutely should be included now if we had Fifteen or twenty candidates like we sat there for the Republican presidential nomination and it gets a little bit ridiculous in tough to handle that and we're talking three people\nYou know it's not that difficult you can ... if you say well there's not enough time we'll fix expend expand the debate to Ninety minutes instead of sixty minutes and ... no I I Would definitely have she on the or whether it's\nAlmost on American not to have 'em there sure\nYeah uh that's where I stand up and\nRe she had to jump thank you very much by the way down there to show five hundred you're next on WBFO Sam\nHi okay cup a couple of topics trust baseball yeah um I could not believe it took ... minutes for the interference call last night [laughter] yeah I mean all you have to look it was one where you play yeah and it wasn't the parents\nWell ... you know I'm not sure if\nI think there are a lot of questions in ... you know what it was interesting my wife's mentioned why has this guy not been thrown out of the park or something but the thing is the ball was over the world now legally if you catch a ball over the wall that's an out\nAnd you can get up there and catch it in and everything else that easy now but had the ball past beyond the point where you're not allowed to interfere with that is an interference when the ball goes beyond the wall\nSo I think those were the questions that they were really trying to grapple with this guy ...\nI was more concerned with how they folded up his glove\nYeah I ... yeah [laughter] yeah yeah but I mean again it was it was in the stands at that at that point because when you when you go to the game they always say anybody who are interferes no on the field of play will be punished well that wasn't on the field of play that was literally in the stands\nWell see that's probably why the ...\nWell that's I think why he didn't get punished but um I think the call was a good call uh obviously for obvious reasons right\nWell I think it just took too long yeah [laughter] well ... yeah baseball topic is a missed appraises pitching tonight yes and I found\nThough we have for at least another four years you story isn't his seven year contract\nUnless you opt to betray you cannot be betraying right yeah you do for a gym prices never\nWon\nA playoff game never as good as he is he's a good teacher I mean he wants to games during the regular season but as good as he is he's never won a playoff game and you know so I mean he's due to the gym tonight will probably put you know here I Hope he does\nWell that would be good [laughter] and and the other topic on merit Fall River yeah\nI'm I was going to call the other day but I figured I weigh a because apparently has got a good lawyer number one\nAnd I thought that would catch them would be the Internal Revenue\nBut I have an idea his lawyers on the ball having him make amends if you know proper amended tax forms and if he does have any holes in the federal investigation who could be the rap and I don't I I I don't think he should have been thrown out the way they want to leave\n'em if he got the ah the situation at hand you know running the city\nI shouldn't be able to do it because his his lawyer or she's got the best\nYeah well we'll see how it plays out we're gonna take it up again next week or next Tuesday I Believe the city council is going to thicken up again thank you my friend I appreciate you find the way nine and six o five hundred your next the w._b. assume\nYou're next on WB assembled afternoon\nHey Barry hey I just got to tell you quickly\nBought a phone call I made earlier tonight okay picked up the phone call ... awful yeah course\nDun answering I met left my phone number I left who I formally was that I was born in the community man that I knocked on thirty five hundred dollars for that Governor at the behest of about ...\nAnd I told him I Would ... that I knocked on his door on those going for him because he cannot stand by and ...\nAnd just to get elected I call\nMy family I told my friend I Am not changing my mind you know me I Am leaving the governor's race open at the when I when I go in and sign up uh when I go and vote I Will not vote for Charlie Baker or anyone else\nYeah I got this guy I I'm going\nThe only the only thing though is if you don't vote for him and get you get ...\nI don't care at this point Saturday I don't care to the point I'm done with him let the Senate ... state of Massachusetts he what happened when you get someone like Jake Gonzales but we don't need a trolley Baker who has no conviction none right man that man you know ...\nAs far as I'm concerned I'll be very surprised if he said give me a call back they may because I left my number but it's not going to be very pleasant for them if they don't\nWant the lap of him last night I mean\nI have no Barry I have no idea I think it's not the guy that ran against governor fat yeah I'm not kidding you this guy I mean I spent I spent quite a bit of time talking to this guy yeah this guy I Know I ... I had no idea that you would that he would this way\nBut you know when he doesn't have to be a you know the thing I get it if you're a Republican in Massachusetts you got to worry about a second term because you know the ... the Democrats to dominate this data Scott Brown right\nUm but Scott Brown folded he's he's a system of beliefs as well out of fear of losing his job in in ... I think to the same thing\nBut he doesn't have to do that he's a he's got Seventy two percent of the vote he got he's got enough\nOf the caution that he can stand up and and be honest in in into you know say yes I'm voting for deal I endorsed among voting for him these are my principal says but he just uh yeah I mean I I I'm so disappointed by him too I really am both\nFrustrating I'm so frustrated with him I'm I'm done with him and I don't care you know what it does\nProblem [laughter] uh\n... I don't trust him now what's\nThat they cause a fake yeah yeah yeah how can you tell somebody like that\nReally I mean you endorse the guy then you go on TV I haven't made up my mind is made in my mind and then you tell the press\nAfterwards well yeah I wanted to vote for him hello [laughter] um yeah I I'm\nI'm voting for Jeff ill are no waiver deal\nAhead of all there is to that one I Am good yeah and uh\nOne of the aisle say oh about the baseball yes okay\nThe guy in the fed if the Bible is behind it gets in the stands you gotta catch it or do something because otherwise\nIt's going to hit you yeah you have to do something\nI guess the question was did the fan interfere with ... ... and ...\nSays ... closed his glove exactly so so does that then uh interests are definitely it was that see that's what the ruling was I don't think that ruling was you know who\nDid that was I think I think it was Joel West called out when they called it correctly\nWell he called they called New York and on the headset to make a yeah so I mean it was nothing to the local guys the guys on the field did not make the call of his New York they made the call and I use the replay\nBut I think it was correct in in the in the in the end because of law do the glamour starch well\nHere's the story I mean if that ball if the if the guy instead of hitting ... best glove if he had just caught the ball and that's too bad from ... beds but where they interfered with Mickey bets effort to catch it and they actually physically touched his glove that made all the difference in the oil is\nOverreaction you understand something coming out yet that's being you know what's being balls going across\nThe seas your I mean that your opportunities are fans you'd rather bombing you how many times you see foul balls off the the first base line or whatever and the uh you know the field of runs over to try to grab it and the fans you\nYou react going into stand sitting there it's either do something\nOr you want to knock it out of the way you don't want the guy to catch it you're going to knock it out of the way as long as it's in the family or a whole\nLot of time to think a lot of seconds notice you know yeah absolutely no I ... a voter Jeff still all away All right we're\nGoing to vote for Joe West too good [laughter] thanks dirty down by the right now and then six nobody wanted you're up next the w._b. is I'm good afternoon\nYeah good afternoon very high [noise] how are you get how you doing great great and\nUm yeah I Believe she I adore I should be involved in the debate yeah um I Believe he's going to do I believe she doesn't know the Trump\nTrump when Massachusetts because a whole bunch of us are tired of corrupt politicians that we've had some follow for all these years Mm and then and we can see how the corrupt politicians allow a corrupt you know it falls right into state troopers and everything else I mean we're a\nAs a state we're pretty disgusting when it comes to all the stuff I we're not\nWell under some of us are let's see if I'm not so bizarre you know we'll see what happens to the election\nSo I uh yeah not only do I think uh I adore I should be\nThe the ... I Believe that he's gonna be the upset in Massachusetts I think he's going to come and take him and really I Believe that he's he's got enough of us sleep in here and just keep an eye miles quiet until this whole thing's ready to go down and he's going to win I Believe so my friend because uh the way he speaks this is pretty intelligent\nBut you know what the Seventy five percent of the population doesn't even know who he is\nA maybe not maybe slow though\nYou gotta you can't win that way though you gotta you people have to know who you are now\nThey're getting these understood you know I Know you didn't know that I knew in my my name's not anywhere telling anybody that I Know I'm\nNo but you're you're you're you're you're different because you listen to talk radio you read you go out of your way to to stay in touch with the vast majority of people out right now listen to me on ... on there and there and I know\n[laughter] I hear what you're saying yeah the ... the vast majority are but there is there is a huge majority of young adults who really do care about what's going on in our country and I hope so hit\nWhile you're on them because that I've been involved with with this I adore I think all in their twenties college students they really\nReally do care about what's going on and um\nHe he just has a way of breaking things down he breaks down borders on a cellular level freight from nature explains how everything should be working the way that things need to work and he's a Trump will\nI mean he he he's just he's just an intelligent cat and we need to give him his time on the stage everybody from WBFO sense ABC and CBS and everyone else has kept this guy blind we have not been able to see him because everybody keeps them away from us\nSo we've had him on your I've had him on a new ... Santa Monica and Ken Santa Monica as well you must\nYou must have had them on my life since I started working because I haven't been able\nTo it's been a while since I've had him on 'em but uh we have had them on a we've had him I'll be honest with you had one more than ... Warren\nUm he's he's considerably more are accessible than was born she she just doesn't even answer a phone calls but well he has\nShe has her reasons for not wanting to be in this area and the reason for not\nOne of the problem with somebody like um a machine that is that um he is not first of all these not well known and he's never run for anything so he doesn't have a whole lot of visibility he needs to get out there and he needs to [noise] um he will have some ability as a result of that and he was\nHe's been out there he doesn't seem Patrick's Day parade we didn't get to see all the news coverage blocks and he right out there he's doing his thing but [noise] right yeah it's keeping\nHim and he's not covering them that's in that's fair enough I I don't disagree with that I I agree with that a hundred percent or the media picks and chooses the winners and the participants in and I think that's wrong let me tell you my friend we're going to go to the next five or six or five hundred your next in Libya some good afternoon\nHow are you doing good how are you know yeah but that you want to know how you doing good I heard John Will fill this morning yeah\nYeah it's been a while I had been absent from a radio I get a different were scheduled to death in a family so they probably a couple of weeks that really able to pay attention to\nThe radio and politics and all that stuff out that's been a while but I'm back\nWell glad to have you back yeah and they say your ten rested and ready to play\nBack with the catch it [laughter] [noise]\nYeah so uh I'm Still a survey going shift deal I just you know the media is so much time with all this war and and I just I still don't know enough about shift deal I mean I Wish I had some better choices are actually said ... what you had some other ...\nWell you got to other choices you Jeff deal and he got a she the door and\nYeah go no jak about a I have a garden that's all\nRight have you done have you done your research though have you gone online and look for information on and they both have Web site at all\nI have to admit that I really haven't had brought up a little ad rep someone Jeff deal but I haven't on um [noise]\nThe other guy I Will for watching 'em so\nDuring the debates in you and you'll be able to see him tomorrow night in Sunday night there do debates and then there's the third one is on the thirtieth and now he's waiting for court decision as to whether or not he can be included in in the debates because they want to come to mind\nI don't know why you shouldn't be I I don't get why he's even\nWhile the media makes the decision okay whoever's sponsoring the debate makes the decision who gets to participate and ah who gets to participate is who the media classified as a quote unquote viable candidate\nAlright and fortunate yeah it is unfortunate because the media is controlling who you are hearing from and this is just another case of the fake media uh because they are telling you these are your choices and nobody else\nNow if Chana fight is having a debate they only want an hour's worth of ... of a debate because well you know quite frankly they want to get into regular programming and all that then you know what don't have the damn debate if you want if you don't want to have a debate and the dedicated enough times and then everybody can be heard let somebody else do it\nYeah you know the ... I'll be honest with you in any election from the presidential on that on\nThe very very very important sure love to watch your age\nI make my decision on candidates largely by what I see an end to bake absolutely a debate tells you a lot you know that's how it's where the guy stance has or we can handle himself in a tough situation where is up by the way I saw ... feel miserable you last night on your debate on channel to\nThe ... who did you see a ... a bakery yeah oh what a what a an unbelievably bad performance\nA horrible horrible yeah I mean I think the vote for the other guy but still I mean you know\nBut here's the problem nobody watched it yeah I did I was not enough people\nWatched it I mean people watching the red Sox game and now you know survivor was on and there was probably a this is Austin was on or whatever the hell are you know people are watching these days and so I'm very very you watched it and\nThat's where people's priorities way\nAnd therefore we have the politicians that we are\nThey know exactly you're up at all and then they complain about it and but you didn't\nBut you know back in the day when people used to watch baseball even during the two thousand sixteen presidential election I think the debates both the uh uh for the nomination of the Republican nomination I think that's what what help Trump win the debate when the uh the nomination wants to debate and I think that helped him to defeat Hillary\nUm you can remember back with the the debate with a Mitt Romney and a ... bomber\nA candy or only from CNN interview in interfering in the debate and ... you know or is it very ...\nI like most of us do I mean most of us are political junkies right I mean we live and die for their stuff\nAnd um we're well informed more educated to the issues we take the time to go to websites and to study this stuff and I think Johnny's among them Johnny one no I think he's he's I think he's one of the shop colors and one of the other I think by this point you know\nI mean it's not like lose Warren ... and Jeff deal and like so close on the issues that you just got to really think about it hard\nI mean there was such a a dynamic difference

have to switch over and uh it's always great to be All right a lot of things going on now we're talking about Charlie bakers debate performance would\nAnd spending has actually been increasing over the course of the last year and a half on the Trump Trump campaigned on reducing spending right smaller government and yet we've been spending a lot of money\nUm I think a great deal of that has had to do with rebuilding the military which is very very important we had to do that\nAnd other had been some other a priority projects that we've had to spend money on these spend money to build a wall and nuts and various other things\nUm but okay so we're a year and a half coming up on two years into this thing so now it's time to address spending and I think most people believe that government spends too much money right and I say most because some people think that doesn't spend enough money um I Know some people think that there should be more\nA taxpayer money spent on social programs at your taxes should go up all this has been warned believes that if she\nUm the Democrats take control of the Congress they should repeal the tax cuts for example in order to raise more taxes so that there's more money\nFor the government to spend and Jay Gonzales who was the Democrat running for governor of Massachusetts believes the same thing he has already campaigned on a platform that says if you vote for me for governor I'm going to raise taxes so that we have more money to spend on the people\nOkay so there there are those folks who believe that the government should be spending more I happened to be among those who believe the government spends too much money and should reduce the size of government and reduce the amount of money that we spend\nAnd put more back into the hands of the private sector now let me just give you a little example because you might be saying well five percent that might be an awful lot of money to cut from departments\nWell think about the search for a moment how I I mean I Know all the guys who shot because you\nYou're listening to talk radio when you follow the news and you you watch the political debates and then you watch the way the government works in all of that\n[noise] have you ever heard of a department in government that returns money at the end of the fiscal year have you ever heard of it\nIs there any department that you can name to me that walks down the hall or at the end of the fiscal year and says hey here's a check for all of the money that we did not spend that was budgeted for us\nNo you don't hear that at all as a matter of fact if you talk to anybody who has anything to do with government\nWhen your budget year is about to come to a close if you've gotten any money left you spend like hell out of that because you know that if you don't spend it all\nYour budget will be reduced by at least that amount for the next fiscal year right so people in government spend every single nickel that they are allocated\nAnd the truth of the matter is it's oftentimes on stuff that is really not needed or necessary but they don't not want to spend all of the money that they've been getting so I think the five\nPercent reduction across the board I think that's very workable and I think it's very reasonable and I think the most uh most budgets within our government our federal government can learn to live within that\nAnd that would give us a break as taxpayers what do you think\nAren't gonna whole bunch of stuff out there on the table five away and and I say so five hundred let's get back to the phones in Europe next and WB assembled afternoon\n\nHello you're on the air Raul may that you\nCould say hey listen you know they talk about the ... when I was an easy way to build ... don't have to build a wall\nHave Congress passed a law that says if you're not a citizen of the United states you are not entitled to any welfare or medical care period on food stamps nothing it's a simple do not even a few legal legal if you're not a citizen you don't get a period\nSo you got to be a citizen of the United states but you're tough\nThat says Congress passes bills for the federal sons of the United states right they don't pass for illegal or legal\nOr you know ... ah people from other countries that have for the citizens of the country\nSo but but there are a little well first of all we know there's a lot of fraud that goes on and I were talking about this with a sharp yesterday has a lot of people that come in here illegally and get a legal IDs and illegal you know the benefits in his act so a lot of that will still go on I'm\nWell how you how you prevent that you know it's your turn around and you make it so that people who take the information down if they allow somebody with a slip through then they have to pay the government back for what these people correct\nRight [laughter] so but you know in those jobs they wouldn't be\nA while we wait he's he doesn't have the paperwork but won't let it go right like public housing is supposed to have the Social Security card to move into it but they just for our kids ... Social Security card and they went about the parents\nYeah let the kids are here the kids become legal and that's what the that's the trick is then they can bring everybody in with them at such a\nThing is they shouldn't be allowed to collect any benefits until they're Eighteen\nYeah so I Am well here's the\nProblem though this this whole situation with the illegal immigration and immigration in general has become big business it's a it's a it's a it's an industry in this country and and that's why the politician\nWe're really cracked down on a because there's a lot of money to be made on it there are a lot of jobs to politicians handout to friends and supporters uh in in a lot of these nonprofit agencies that deal with\nA immigration and immigrants and so on his cellphone there's a lot of lot of jobs involved in a lot of money involved in it and that's why it's been difficult for the politicians they actually have a spine and deal with the issue\nAnd the other way they could raise funds is when people send money to the foreign countries and you know why it transfers\nYour coat ... percent back and do they ... income tax so if they fall or income tax than they can get the money back\nBut if they otherwise it's tax money so it shouldn't it you know that we get the taxes\nYeah well look I Know what you're talking about I get what you say and I get what you what you're saying to me and I understand completely but you're you're assuming that the politicians want this to stop and I'm telling you I don't think they do\nA lot of Democratic Party anyway well even the Republicans I mean that the Republicans have never what are the Republicans done to really enjoy your show that [laughter]\nI mean Trump is out there saying build a wall or stop the illegal immigrants let's get the criminals the hell out of here but you don't see a lot of the Republican standing with him do you\nHope no that's the problem\nThat's the problem the government and the politicians politicians don't want to stop this if they didn't they could do it tomorrow\nBut they don't want to and and those are the people we got to get out of office and we got to get people into office they do want to stop these problems and until we do that it's never gonna stop will know how many years and they've been fighting for immigration reform Twenty years or more\nYou mean to tell me and I was Twenty years or more we haven't been able to come up with a way to fix this problem\nFor you know the other thing is you could go back to the way our forefathers are served in office they served they pay their own expenses ever than they'd ever paid by the government they didn't get a pen and\nThis is true yeah ... when they went back home they said former senator and former congressman and then so that when they put their finger all they know that they get their income afterwards\nEven the president's didn't get a former presidents didn't get taken care of after they left office and I know and ... yeah\nNo absolutely thank you my friend does I appreciate the guy's got a lot of good answers on how we can do this but the problem is the will is not there if the will was there we can stop illegal immigration tomorrow\nOr the will is not there the political will is not there are people uh in in politics like two pandering kiss ass and then they were afraid to offend I'm In the case of the Democrats have we seen the Democrats want to get as many legal see her as possible so they can get them to vote for them\nAnd um that's just the way it is I mean it's the truth you can look at it is it's right there\nYou don't need me to tell you that you're smart enough to see it and I'm\nSo there's no political will and that's on both sides that's both Republicans and Democrats because if there was a if there was a desire to stop this it would have been stopped a long time ago but there is no desire to stop this big money in it and um\nYou know the politicians get cheap labor to right let me take the brakes either way not nesting so five hundred stay with us You're listening to fourteen twenty WBRC him\n[noise]\n... we asked them for John Keats windows in

Bluey mosquito of el am roofing offers a zero percent down at one hundred percent financing\nWhat Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump got in the race they were speaking the language of the common everyday people in this country now you can certainly say that ...\nDonald Trump and Bernie Sanders like night and day yes they do they say are they certainly are but we can see how divided our country is right we see how divided our country is you know I think\nThe ...\n... like the conservatives want to be happy right I think they do I think they want their kids they have a great place to\nGrow up good schools um jobs that pay well I I think we all can agree on that\n\nWe had a lot of differences differences that we may never\nBe able to bridge the gap I mean you know who they believe in a lot of things that we don't believe that\nWe believe the things they don't believe that but I think ultimately our core belief is that we want to see we want to see our country do well ... well how you define well and how you get to well well I guess that's that's where the problem lies\nSo people supporting Bernie Sanders I think believe\nThat America is a pretty decent place and they want us to be a better place or people who support Donald Trump want to make America great again\nSo I think we're coming forward the same goal we have the same goals we just come at it from a different way but I think all of us reject\n\nThe same old stuff that's been handed to a decade after decade after decade from the two party system in this country I mean why do you think that the the leftist scene or a strong surge of support for socialist candidates\n\nI'm not a socialist I don't believe in socialism I don't believe in what these people are advocating\nBut they are speaking for their base just asked Trump speaking for his base and um\nSo I think John James hasn't exactly right people are sick and tired of being sick and tired and the sick and tired of the same old stuff from the same old two party system that has gotten nothing right\nIt's got nothing right I mean here we are thinking about this you know after what fifty sixty years since the or the great society what's happened to the great society you couldn't ghettos in in major cities like Detroit that are dumps\nUninhabitable run by gangs in in in drug thugs\nAnd you know ... ... people on on on benefit programs a lot of people without jobs people without education people without skills\nKids without without fathers sound like a great society was supposed to be about\nIs that while we were looking for when we you know set up this whole great big society cradle to grave we're going to take governor who's going to take care of you is that what it was supposed to be about people are sick of this\nHey you're sick and tired of being sick and tired of the same old crap and they want\nSomething better for them in for their kids and grandkids and that's what you're seeing playing out of this country right now that's at the\nCore and at the heart of this revolution that's underway five but wait and and I think so five hundred and you're up next the w._b. assembled afternoon\nHow are you good how are you know that's probably give you another glaring example if you left have double standard and has no standards at all Mm and uh this is concerning Bob Menendez of New Jersey yeah and they're ready to move on and I guess for the\nHe was a ... you know not even teenage children I guess ... down in the ... on a regular Republican yeah and uh well their defense now is a it was a long time ago and no cooperation that's so\n\nIt sounds like the Clinton defense book page one oh one [laughter]\nOther than that you may find preceded by the way not nesting so five hundred euro next to the w._b. us up next we're hanging on primary Hi\nHey explain something to me ... ... ... ... ...\nWhat do you mean by immigration reform\nWhat why you mean by immigration reform\nWhat does anybody I mean by immigration reform\nWe don't know because we've not been able to accomplish immigration reform because we can't seem to agree on what immigration reform means\nRight show I mean I think the problem is there's a lack of immigration enforcement\nWhile I think that's part of it yeah I think that's certainly a part of it um oh it yeah on\nComes here every weekly does that mean that this\nIs the death of water that me because they can't stay because they want to lose if something wrong with our laws\nWell there are a lot of loopholes in laws yeah in a sense there is because think about this now how many how many people are being a steel even even with Trump in office how many people are being detained at the borders and then being given an ankle bracelet and according to show up back\nIn court and then we let him right out the front door and say no go ahead you're going up to Cushing it right but you don't forget you're gonna come back the trial now in a year and they don't get what\nYeah and they ... it could be off and they go to Arizona or something else\nSo I mean you know that there is very little in the way of enforcement and and that's why the president is trying to draw the line with this uh this caravan by saying look we're going to close the border if we have to keep this caravan from coming here because you know damn well all three thousand four thousand people if they get here they're going to get in\nYeah but the thing is is I mean it's like it's a it's not his fault but it's a ... a dollar short because they should have happened years ago ... I mean how many people have already come across the world are the issues are numbered that we're talking about right now\nBut again keep in mind there has been no political will to stop it right and why is that there's a lot of money that's being made off of these people and there's a lot of jobs created to serve these people and I'm politically\nCertain groups lawn to groom these people to be voters\nRight ... I think what needs to happen is that people need to turn around and protest just like the ones that say oh I have a good way to stay right you know what I mean you know these poor kids just seem to forget that read uh the employee you're\nNo no I ... I get that but the problem is we do not take on that rule you know what we elect these people and then rather do we we let them do whatever they want to do we don't vote them out of office when they and that's why they've been in office for thirty forty years\n... good because\nWe don't do our job and you're absolutely right I mean what kind of bossa we that hire somebody to do a job they do a crappy job we make millionaires and we don't fire him\nI mean each ... each ... each Warner was sports we try to better our country you we got our own million who says he's both party line\nYeah yeah that's ridiculous\nWell we don't take enough time to study who these people are what the real issues are and um we like somebody because they came to our you know Boy Scout Danbury and shook hands are they marched in our town parade um you know and and that's how people do\nIt if you're ... if you come up with a good idea okay and I'm On the opposite side I'm not going to say it's a bad idea and wait a couple of years that come up in the same idea you can work for two years before I was a good idea\nWell now it's just don't have to adjust to reverse this happening now because back in two thousand six you had all of the Democrats support building a wall in fact\nAllocated money to to build a wall that Clinton was foreign Hillary was foreign Brock Obama was for Chuck Schumer was warning or John Kerry was for it and now Trump comes along and says well I Want to build the wall you can't do that you'll get it so you know\nWe're all like a bunch of little children escaping it because they don't have the top three\nWell this is exactly what the point is this guy John James is that you know people are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the same old crap and they want these people out of power but they have to go to the votes or go to the polls in do they're they're not going to vanish we have the hell out\nWith the same people who want to see idiots and over and over again they're the ones that have to come to a realization that they need to get them out of there\nYeah yeah exactly well you know we're seeing it in pockets we're seeing it here in town for example we saw this kid Chris Hendricks defeat Bob cause air after Thirty years stunned them in a in a primary\nTo the top leaders in the Massachusetts legislature get stoned in primaries back in September so we're seeing in small pockets but we need to see it happen more widespread and more people have to get out and vote in say enough is enough and I'm not going to vote for you I'm not voting for any incumbents\nThat's the only way you're going to get the Democrats or Republicans to turn around and think of the people for us not there won't be All right\nWell if the these these politicians thought for a moment did their job was at stake they would damn well do a better job right I mean if you've ever made it you're going to get fired you you do a better job right they don't have to worry about it because they know that in most cases they're gonna get reelected", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "18"}
