happen that shows but I Know\nI could no\nLonger am I got serious question about this story is the ... gave a classified information that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia but physically the presidential daily briefing and that\nPut a shaggy in harm's way\nI hadn't heard that that specific piece of information I'd have to see a source on that but we do know that there was reporting earlier this spring\nThat Jared Kushner as an act of ah of guilty or sort of cheese are brought to Mohammed bin saw him on a list of all the other princes\nIn the royal family their money holdings and treasury intelligence about them and Mohammed bin Salman had all of them arrested and stole all of their money on the basis of U.S intelligence 'cause we're really good at that part so\nThat is what Mohammed bin Salman has a in hand in hand with cushion are in fact\nWhen you do something like that over there they think you owe them they don't like to be you and your debt and like well I have a debt for you know can you know what you say about a coincidence is I took a lot of planning this was well number one we've got an ...\nOh that's what it is um Saudi Arabia coincidentally wears a hundred million dollars to the U.S a mid ... controversy the payment or at the same date pump pale ended in Riyadh that's so weird fleeting um yeah it was an amount they had earlier promised a timing Trump officials have ... insisted the timing is pure coincidence\nYeah yeah it's a hundred million dollars that was supposed to be used towards direct reconstruction in Syria of a post war activities but they're very tight fisted over there I mean it is very hard to get money out of those governments\nThey pledge all the time and then deliver two or three years later and suddenly as he is airborne en route to Saudi Arabia yeah that money the button is hit the transfer to ... that is how they do business\n... Middle East expert said in all probability the Saudis want Trump to know his cooperation and covering for their cause she'll give fares important to the Saudi market timing of this is no coincidence or ... in the meantime\nOr new lawyer there ah\nIn the meantime this ridiculous I had new business interest in Saudi Arabia he sold his yacht to a Saudi prince they own a floor of Trump Tower Trump's on tape talking about how many condos they buy from them on ... the experts in their clearly a value customer ... possibly his most valued customer um\nI mean again just blinding corruption on every front\nWell heart is the reason I think the world is riveted by this whole issue of your stories because this is an elaborate play that is happening in real time and people are watching I I think I'm more cynical view I think these are calculated maneuvers\nBecause it's symbolically sending a message around the world how you would have expected the United states to act in a circumstance like this for two hundred and forty three years was clear in the past there would have been international outrage sanctions condemnations yeah and the administration is sending a message that hey\nYeah it's all for sale we'll look the other way and absolute and comes out very quickly a couple of days later and says the United states has lost its moral authority around the world is an amazing how that we're now that are so\nYeah he had nothing to do with that [noise] um so meanwhile you got palm pay over their gripping grinning great optics on that and then he comes back and says this\nPipe told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days sure yeah we have the way to avoid understanding of the facts surrounding back which one we can make decisions about how if the United states should respond to a surrounding this shoving\nYeah they didn't they didn't use the right kind of bleach the first time so they need to uh get to where they get their cleaning crew back in there and uh I mean this is insane I think you get right to send a movie that you see the cleaning crew going in there before they lead investigator\nAnd think about that the comments that secretary palm pale made now we hear reports\nHe was played the tapes the roar real time audio he knows exactly what went down and that is deliberate opposite view case you didn't lying to the American people after he heard the compelling evidence\nYeah you know what and and this is where it's really\nGoing to hurt 'em you know having him in my career I've I've heard\nPeople dying and you know to your person tortured like that it is is mind numbing yeah and the Turks are going to want\nVery big concession not to allow this audio out to the public in that concession is going to be another person that the Turks would like to do the same thing too yeah but you look roulette and offense who lives in Pennsylvania ... and you know they want to kill him he\nA clear and present danger to the United states of America Donald Trump there is no other way I Know ...\nI don't I don't understand why everyone is not shouting everyone a traitor he is I ate there can be nothing more important right in getting this traders limited take away from the nuclear codes as quick\nPossible and that's why the elections so poor because think about how the dominance are gonna fall if we have a massive blues in army like we think and hope and are asking everybody to take part in\nWhat's going to happen next that's going to be seen as a mandate a referendum against Trump and vote for democracy and then the ... investigation will start to leak out and that's the movement that will hopefully yeah ... ... this guy and this corruption them out of office\nNot just the motor investigation we will control all the investigation right bodies on Capitol Hill\nAnd we can really start going into what's truly happening more we'll just have to sit back and and watch that and move towards indictments but this color revolution thing is not a joke yeah this where blue thing is not a joke where blue before last we are here do them\nWe are here in this country where other countries

used in Indiana Virginia Kentucky Pennsylvania and Tennessee So look for more have it in our elections coming up\nYeah absolutely they should be suspending India and you know what the story did come out over the weekend um I did see it I did read it um I Wish they would suspend early voting right now Texas until they get this problem sex all the Republicans are going in and they're voting for Republican candidates in the machines flipping the vote Democrat\nUm like I don't like really voting any way I I think look you know if you're in you're an American we have a day for a loan and go and vote or you know ... whatever you know we don't we don't need that we don't need to expand voting for weeks at a time I'm unfortunately one story hit\nAll the media was too preoccupied with male bomber and um we do to the gentleman's story with the um the synagogue shooting on Saturday but are so many other things that the media to\nSell was more important and particularly the media which is sympathetic with the Democrat candidate to go to downplay bad story anyway right ...\nAnd ... they're saying that a state of Texas by the way the secretary of state is ... and he was appointed by a Greg Abbott and the governor and the and that people are asking them get rid of these machines these ones are suspect people report and were ... ... they're saying well we can't do that we can't get rid of the malfunctioning\nMachine they also saying they can't they have no legal rights to require the manufacturer to correct\nThem so is is that not the strangest thing you know it's a fraud you know it's a um has huge implications on the election results and you can't do anything about it that's incorrect credibly insane yeah um the other the other story I Want you to know about is the um\nJewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh I guess there's a lot of Jewish federations around but they're associated with something called bend the ark\nAnd Alex Soros son of sorrow son of George Soros is is influencing a lot of the Jewish federations and then the arc of there are a bunch of progressive Jews not to be confused with religious Jews progressive Jews\nAre more Marxist and they are religious and they are there now mounting campaigns including this Jewish Federation against Trump the anti Trump against Trump talked about maybe coming there and getting a message and all that and they're saying they don't want to hear his message\nNow do you happen to notice and Kevin out and you happen to know is in a lot of the stuff\nThey don't like your message they want to ah curtail your your um ability\nDr IQ just like when Kevin I tried to fight\nGoing for wrong it's happening to him he went from being a on a groped her to her rape is your pet is a to a pedophile and gas or a gang rape is um and then on to the drunk\nYeah he was in Russia Bronx yeah very aggressive drunk yeah ...\nYeah but you hear words against you and this is what they're doing there's always an anti free expression and free message I'm a purpose to everything they do and there and and they had the media to push their message\nWell that's that's I mean that's the important part here is did they do have a they do have the media um in their pocket and the media does exactly that the media is has become\nThe um uh the public relations arm of the of the extreme left in this country has very sad\nThank you my friend appreciate it very much actually bring the story up to about the voting in Texas because I I just hadn't thought about it since I read it over the weekend and now that is a serious issue and that's a big problem I have with a with early voting and I'm opposed early voting I'd rather not do that but by the way not now six o five hundred euro Mexican WB assembled afternoon\nHello you're on the air\nAre your next unable to be a lot more on this line won't lie that you are [laughter] you're hunting around on me but one job\nWow wow they're Streisand ... only one teacher and her name by the way Bob Streisand she said she was going to leave the country I thought there if Trump cut him up about that\nYeah well I guess you changed your mind now\n[laughter] and look at Obama was he got two three houses now and he's still yeah socialism from what why do they not leave yeah why do they not only\nFly you know I I I think we'd all volunteer to drive him to the border no\nOh big time [laughter] bring on another thing I did\nThe early vote or last friday you went to vote yeah uh\nBut of course I'm Rochester right and I do all the low right there in the town hall you feel put your name on it but they can't tell from the outside of how you loaded right\nWell and I think it was a good thing because I'm On standby it I don't know if I can get there on on it all for trucking right yeah well I don't see why you're against that unless you're going to\nDefault show I Know I I think you know what you could do a um you you would still be allowed to do an absentee ballot because you might not be available to vote right so you could\nWas yeah I Know you put it a little uh a gold Oslo bath yeah and with the\nYeah see I have a problem with with people that you got to basically kissed they're asked to go out and do not I mean nobody's kissing your rats you want to vote you just don't know whether you're available you know what what you were there and he's going to be because of your job so\nFor somebody like you I can see it absentee ballot no problem but so now we're going to lose ... expand this for weeks before election day\nOn to try to get people out there and do what ... what it would have started doing next seven raffles will give away TV's the people who go in and vote and and stuff like that trips to Disney World and whatever look very very few things that we're asked to do in this country right very very few things that we were asked to do or don't cover your neighbors wife and go and vote\nYou know what is the big deal about finding five minutes on election day to get out there and vote unless of course you're going to be out of town or in a case like you ... your your schedule is ... you don't let me see we're not asking you to do a whole lot go out and vote\nI think it was a good safe way to go on I have to agree to disagree with you because uh to get everybody at one place at one time on one day is not easy\n[noise] well you know the funny thing about voting we know years in advance when it's going to happen I can look at my calendar for years in the future and no one election is going to be you know it's not like something that pops up all of a sudden this regime we got voting actually\nAround you might have you know could be a number of reasons are all\nThose people vote right in your neighborhood right so I mean I Walk to the polls anyway\nPretty much so but still get sick yeah electrical out what you saw you know you don't know I I like the early system I really do\nYou might even be dead and somebody has to go out and vote for you right\nWell I guess they're doing that [laughter]\nActually appreciate it [laughter] I have a great day five ... five hundred in Europe and actually the w._b. assembled afternoon\nHey good afternoon very Hawaii yet good\n... you were talking to a couple of callers ago fucking about how the electoral college and and how how the Democrats you know focus on the high\nHigh number of people that are in certain metropolitan areas\nYou know that that's exactly what a lift warrants doing\nShe is her campaign and they they don't get out and now they don't get out ferry and knock on doors they they network\nAnd they only concentrating in these high metropolitan areas [noise] that's why that's why you don't see that people knocking on doors and in New Bedford fall\nRiver it's all it's all major metropolitan areas they all they look at is a number\nYeah and that's that's all they care about\nIt and they know that they can pretty much take or at least up until this point have been able to take New Bedford info ribs granted those ... that's our debts Democrat territory you know we don't have to worry about that they're they're with us anyway so why waste time and resources there\nRight but you know what the funny thing though of you and I talk about science and I've always said I don't don't vote but I Wonder if in all these\nAreas that I've been out and 'cause we we get some driving this weekend in and you're right I mean you can't even count the signs in some of the outlying areas I Wonder is there enough is there enough a turn out in the rural areas\nBut um I have a grand sons they're they live in Georgia\nAnd they put their birthdays they had their DNA done there twenty four and twenty five and their grandmother is Indian and she's Cherokee and they'd be ... they are twenty three percent and they and and my daughter still pay the tuition for their school at Georgia seizing\nBecause\nShe didn't feel that she should take advantage of their background or what their lineages\nRight you know nothing I'd ... really\nWell and I we're from that she's from Massachusetts and I think very proud and we don't take advantage of anything if we can you know to take care of ourselves but anyway I just am disappointed in Cushing it making that move they don't kind of off\nPeople any more they do have the town hall meetings that's one thing we do have right but I don't remember that ever coming up as a factor\nThat the majority of people a lot of the people are seniors will go to those town hall meetings\nSo do you believe they brought that up she would you make that move\nI'm sure you did you say you you did you already voted where you haven't voted voted mind do you do you have voted already okay good yeah I just want to make sure you're going to be good to be able to vote we would have yes\nI miss the primary because uh they didn't have a lot for that yeah and I I Do my civic duty I'm a believer I find us Citizens United states and I ... I'm first American generate ... you know that first generation American\nAnd I will do everything I I don't care if I Lived to be a hundred some way or another and take over\nYou know but anyway um I take great pride in being an American being independent\nAnd uh I Wish more people instead of following all every social program there is to try to walk on their own two feet it makes it difficult for them because if you come from that kind of background it's very difficult to not take advantage of what's offered to you\nWill that does actually correct and that's why so many people have become trapped in these programs because they they are yeah and\nI don't envy them I don't I never want to be in their shoes but we have a long ways to go to make people take their self pride and pick themselves up by their own bootstraps but anyway that's my two cents for the day but I Love listening to W. Sam all of you\nWell I Love avenue and you call me more often alright\nAll if there's an issue that I wanted to take up and today it was a ballot so there is a reason well\nYou just call us and let us know that you're doing okay [laughter]\nYou know what I'm I'm I'm I'm not a person that ever thinks about anything but being well well I'm not on this I I'm In good shape for the shaped by men so I thank God for that\nAwesome thank you for calling you made your resume to make you very much ... five hundred Ninety two years old and still makes you very very seriously and I loved that aren't let me just break find a way no no no five hundred way overdue for break we'll come right back after this\nThese radio anymore if you look at them to do was three years\nPower by jumps your generator big dream is on you can feel listen to your favorite shows on the up and get more details on the daily news stories you hear on the air multiple platforms but still one of the New Bedford new\nYork bomb had over ... for the new bomb making I bring down\nAny ground to get it all away in Georgia and new appetizers like gone wrapped in bacon with maple syrup and brown sugar drizzle tried new salads like the rest of my own I squashed balance enjoy entree touches cod foreign genes started with creamy quarantine San poppy season crime for dessert bring a\nFriend and said by the new apple here no harm its cage and pumpkin cheesecake look forward to seeing you at three pound grill in ...\nCounty street motives were buying a car makes you feel good has a twenty year reputation of respecting customers and helping those going through hard times ... motors we'll put you would have safeguard that they'll stand behind with a thirty day warranty with no interest in a small down\nIf you already have a car any needs repairs ...\nYou'll all ... got a street motors bite eighty nine cottage street New Bedford county street voter as some people pleaser\nPest grocery climbing furniture counties furniture and actresses parties recording soap operas loves each and requires the gold standard in the industry also ... in our lives cautions enjoys a bit of cardio decline as sounding adjust to Ninety eight\nIntroducing a new was collection perfect holiday gatherings entertaining or just hanging around the kitchen granted from a mix of the woods metals and lovers creating a casual industrial look\nCopies exclusive collection features pop height tables are put rest solid craftsmanship all ... ... ... maybe ... mattresses location today Chuck ... mattresses I'm cranberry highway and we're hearing cottages the largest furniture mattress showroom on the south shore in Cape Cod\nI Love your costs the why is your white grain it's lantern ooh that's I think\nKnow ha ha but go up ... joined\nAnd all of us at ... than Rhode Island kamikaze November second to the poor I don't know\nWhether you are closing down your vote with the seasons are gearing up for the winter ahead get everything you'll need a standard marine out better they carry any pre K. one hundred and stable ... you get your vessel prep for its winters now\nBut it'd be more boating ahead and pick up some winter worked here from burden Kelly has done and good standard marine outfitters has everything you need for a day on the water blush wine beer I shouldn't gear standard marine outfitters on boats diamond in New Bedford\nAll day path to walk them through the gaming this Friday I Am only at the the deal dot com\n... next day I deliberate exclusively from parties furniture mattresses\nNew Bedford a safe space I house bar and grill on reject him buried together\nFor us\nFor\nAll right just five away nine six o five hundred we will have the latest on the forecast where you're coming up at the top of the hour so stay tuned for that ABC six of weather center forecast part of the W.
