D I managed to hang on to control thank you my friend preceded by the way not to show five hundred your next the w._b. assembled afternoon\nVery thank you for letting me on projects going\nWe used to see the financial depressions a happen\nEvery sixty to eighty years that's what it used to be nuts\nAre known how much time for um people to forget things and get into bubbles do\nUm but now it's down to less than twenty five Fifteen Years or ten to Fifteen Years now so\nSomehow managed to do it and then somehow managed to get people to forget and um they ... you know make the bubbles that cause crashes afterwards um but I I didn't call about that I wanted to talk to you about what you saw Kevin Kevin uh was\nWas and that's a a new line of attack it was an attack on our us teachers judicial system\nAnd that was that they the nickel part of the U.S judicial system with a nominee was attacked\nBut that same thing has been happening to more than a dozen countries around the world to other countries us um other countries judicial system and it was done under the Obama administration uh by the use of the embassies\nAnd so what was happening the diplomatic corps so what they were doing and these other countries and you can check this out on Google you put the right search terms and um [noise] they would have an ambassador\nNow investors not supposed to engage in cause problems in other countries are supposed to be diplomatic or what they were doing a is they were trying to change a these are a lot of countries by the way they are very religious or very old fashioned traditional kind of\nUm [noise] countries so they would go in with their ambassadors and they start to have these weird things like protest groups and they funnel money to a subversive\nOrganizations within those countries there were undermining their judicial system undermining their traditions and they were pushing the L G D T to chew movement\nSame time and a lot of these countries fought back and started reporting it um didn't have much success and the press now and then they did like Montenegro and things are being done that\nYou wonder um like my one of my doctors I have there she was from a one of these countries Montenegro and she was saying well she was here in the U. S.\nHer ... her family um property was being re registered and taken and they would have to go back and fight to get their own property back but there's a lot of stuff that was happening on to them as a bomb to administration they were pretty much um weaponized and a lot of things including\nMy God I'm at embassies um they did in Russia they did in quite a few countries um\nThat would have been media there to show protests um but you you can also find decided he wanted to this is not what we're supposed to be happening or when the U.S government\nRight shouldn't be doing that and that's how I that's all I have to say on that at all as far as protests 'cause I don't have a\nProblem with protests ... here in the u._s. or anywhere else when they're organic with an independent where their grassroots but I Do have a problem with protest groups\nAre bought and paid for writer organized and the media button take a pay for a media they're covered and saturate our airways make it look a one way when it's not\nYeah and the media is not even looking into any of this which is even more frightening either they know about it and they're ignoring it or they're just too lazy to look into it but I think that if you and I understand it and get it uh I I Can't see why the media can\nUm so I think the media I mean you know the problem is with the media supports the uh\nUh supports the end to the means here so ah because if we can get a you know people out into the streets and that could lead to a a a lot of news stories that they make money on and be the removal of Trump from office well then the the the companies that support the media in this country\nAh they've they've reached their objectives which is what they want\nAnd um but it's dangerous I mean we're playing a very very dangerous game here right now and um oh yeah\nYou know I didn't give them brought my take on the on this whole thing with Kavanaugh was um I think I think you make a valid point about an attack on the judiciary see the problem is it it's not as simple as it may seem it's not just one thing going on there it's like when we had the I'm\nA black lives matter around in the streets in in its own and so forth through a number of different people that were advancing different agendas or they were working or to some degree together and to some degree independent of each other but they were all whenever there's an opportunity for\n[noise] you know some type of a\nA disruption of the systems are all going to jump in there are going to try to advance their own cars their own cause their own agendas and whatever and that's the same thing happening here now um I I think\nPersonally the bottom I still believe that abortion was that the um with the core of the um Cavanaugh a dispute I mean they're not only did the Democrats I don't think it's just as simplistic to say that the Democrats I'd want it to block this guy just simply because he was Trump guy\nI think the the Democrats and tried to block this thing uh for fear of losing the abortion battles in the abortion debate now there were a bunch of other people have jumped into this fight too and they all work together on it and I think part of that with the fascists in the the socialists and everybody else that are trying to dismantle the judicial system\nAnd they weren't able to work in the background and Soros able to fund these different groups that go out there and because it all work together they all they all ... it was very convenient for the Democrats have all of these paid protesters out there a marching against the the judiciary because it also helps them and their cause\nMhm but ultimately the the the Republicans all of a sudden grew back bone\nIn the past they would they would stand down to this stuff you know the first uh a suggestion that might be some kind of a problem and and but this time they stood tall and and they they they they rode this thing to the end which amazes me I\nI think it helped that people would get on the airwaves and other places and say\nI'm going to blame the Republicans if the if if this is Kevin from get through it's right for Democrats you know are always going to do that and researcher I'd gotten to know that the Republicans back down at your home to having looking bad in the press sure and it really ... the\nProblem was in the Republican Party that they have some Republicans are really not Republican and really not what they say they are and\nThe Republican Party but then people realized you had to get aggressive because they're taking down to ... and they're taking down I'm innocent until proven guilty guilty everybody has a stake in that\nYeah no question and and you know the people are out there looking at people elected Trump maybe don't I don't know whether people like Trump personally or not that's that's neither here nor there he gets he gets twenty thousand people to turn out at rallies or somebody likes the sky right there's twenty thousand people in there's thousands more outside trying to get in so many likes the guy okay\nUm I I don't think we need to apologize anymore for his personality his personality is what it is and you either like them you don't like them but\nThe bottom line here is we've got a we've got a guy who's not afraid to take the hit just as an earlier caller suggested and he will run in there with the shield and let him protect everybody else in the party he'll take all the hits but the party's gonna follow him through the door\nAnd um I think we're finally starting to see that now in the public is demanding it because it's like well we've got the White House we've got the Senate we've got the house we get the majority of governorships we get the majority of state legislatures there's no excuse for losing anymore\nRight that yeah you can't make an excuse anymore well they got the ... everything that you guys said you would do I mean how many times did we hear a during the Obama administration oh if only we had control we would do this and if only we can ... you\nGot control any folded like a three dollar cheap suit as soon as you got it\nYou know won't count on just that ... much better than the average public there's so much\nBad around until he brings it to interview um people don't know that have to work I mean all those trade deals were really that\nWas a lot of things going on it and they um international front\nUm who who is thinking we could work with Korea we can actually makes gains with Russia which we have ... do you ever had to deal with\nA lot of the problem with people who weren't focusing on and he did and I I don't care about his personality so much yet I'd like to say a little bit less at times but I like what he's doing I mean like his fighting editor and he's a good problem solver and that's what we were up\nTo see ... fishing they don't they don't believe in fishing these these environmental groups feel that fish um rights too and that we shouldn't be fishing so they want to stop fishing and Ed Markey and was warned take money from these people\nAnd they support these people and they support their agenda that's why it was with one has not filed a piece of legislation to assist the fishing industry you want to know the truth of how our fishing industry of the people who represent the fishing industry feel go down and talk to him I found them on the year\nI've had a gentleman on the other represents the fishing industry I've had city council has come on the air tell me that they write a letter after letter after letter after letter to Elizabeth Warren's office never even getting a response and the same Ed Markey don't even get a response invitation to come to the city no response\nAnd um\nI mean this is the representation so and mark he's got two more years in his um\n\nTwo more years in his term and he's done who can we find a run again who would you like to see run against Ed Markey I I have a ... sneaking suspicion that Ed Markey is not going to seek reelection I have a funny feeling Ed Markey is not going to seek reelection and I have a feeling\nThat you were going to see a lot of people interested in that seat and I think one of them maybe John Mitchell\nAnd I think another one maybe Scott lame\n\nWho else why do you like to see run for the U.S Senate and Ed Markey said\nUm if\nHe decides not to run but Marquis anyway Ed Markey and our list Warren\nFiling legislation to help pay wealthy Malaysian investment group\nThat invested money into the ... casino in in ... which isn't gonna happen now because the Interior Department screwed up and the mashed me off in August not eligible for\nFederal recognition will not get federal recognition will not get land and trust in it taught in the casinos not going to happen but there was a Malaysian investment company that that invest money in these casino projects all around the world\nAnd they invested\n... they invested a whole pile of money into this project in into the mash grew up in the sink and they'd be able to get it done because governor Patrick let everybody to believe you know that the Indians that should get special treatment here in southeastern Massachusetts knowing full well by the way that it wasn't going to happen governor Patrick is a\nHe's a ... boy he's ... he's one that you know you would do with the shells\nThe shell games that that's Patrick and legislative delegation just wasn't smart enough and Patrick they get taken to the queen or some ... nice guys you know but they they get taken to the cleaners like Deval Patrick uh all of them did our delegation of Florida delegation\nThey all got taken to the cleaners cattle viola mark month take me I don't know that you know Bob ... Tony ... brawl\nA whole bunch of a ticket to the cleaners by Deval Patrick you know why because the ball Patrick told them\nIf you're fighting me on this you're not going to get money for your casino you can't I mean for your rail everything was rail because our guys we're going up to Boston thinking that Deval Patrick was was serious about finding a rail project he never was even more serious about funding a real projects and he was about building a casino down here\nAnd you don't want to didn't half deal because he was going to win the election here he was up for election twice right you may run for president\nAnd you know everybody in southeastern Massachusetts yup yup yup what do I sign up where do I get a bumper sticker or right but there everybody's going to be right there even though Deval Patrick played this area like a federal\n\nEight years old we heard about letting the ball Patrick and you know where you're going to get a casino you're going to get a train the Packers going to take good care of you what do they do for us\n\nOr legislative delegation sold out southeastern Massachusetts on the casino\nUnder the premise that we were gonna get money for the real and it didn't help Patrick knew it wasn't gonna happen there were never\nSupposed to be more than two casinos regardless of what the bill said they were going to be to casinos one was going to be in Springfield area one who's going to be in Boston southeastern Massachusetts never had a chance Patrick knew that the legislative leaders knew that but our delegation\n[noise]\nVote for the bill and we'll get our train money right don't ask for anything because he asked for anything at all you know you're already asking for training money come on let's not get greedy here\nGot taken to the cleaners\nDeval Patrick sooner if he's going to run for the presidential nomination and I know it just as sure as I'm sitting here\nThe Democrats throughout the region will be signing up for the Deval Patrick bumper stickers and Deval Patrick lawn signs\n\nYou think about Patrick make America great hats make Massachusetts grade has to make them make the rail happened hats right and you think\n[noise]\nBut anyway yeah Ed Markey you know Ed Markey and endless Warren filed legislation to help a Malaysian investment company that lost their money by gambling on the\nMashed me want to know a casino they lost a fortune on that\n\nSo Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey filed legislation to twist the law to allow this guy to read recoup is money by allowing\n\nThe mashed me wants to know to supersede the law and get will get them in Indian but you don't get their land and to try to actually get a permit to build the same without having to follow the rules that every other driving the countries that fall\nBut they can't file a bill to help our fishing industry led marquee was on TV over the weekend or CNN's newsroom\nAnd then Markey stated that the FBI's investigation to the Supreme Court judge ... or ...

I Believe in that\nHow many women that you are out there right now that are pissed off at the Republicans because of ...

Smith although he gets paid by foxy basically works for there the other side anyway right so what is the outrage over this\nCan you imagine if a Fox News reporter had tweeted this stuff using the word faggot saying I don't know if I Want to be around a lesbian can you\nThe people that CNN would be demanding the resignation the firing of this reporter\nDon Lemon would be all over it as would Anderson Cooper and you know what rightfully so but yet not comment for CNN yet why\n\nCollins has apologized for her quote ignorant and immature remarks\nShe said she was just tweeting she said it was just just tweets to my friends just tweets to my friends well should that matter\n\nIt's okay to be homophobic if you're amongst friends right that's okay\n\nWhen I was in college I used enduring language in a few tweets to my friends and was immature but it doesn't represent the way I feel at all how regret it and apologize\n\nIf it's not how you feel why did you say it in such a public manner like Twitter\nSo that's Caitlin Collins but no outrage from anybody you don't see a [noise]\nYou don't see any kind of pick is out in front of CNN where where where's rosy\nLast week\nWas mighty funny because last week Lindsey Graham who's offering\nBeen rumored to be gay\n\nWhen he stood up and attack the Democrats that we're attacking Kavanaugh Rosie O'Donnell attacked him so closeted ah what did you call them a closeted or something or other [noise] um\n\nThe rest of the crew I'll attacked him Don Lemon attacked him and he's not even gay I mean I don't know whether it was you ... have you ever heard Lindsey Graham come out and say hey I'm gay I've never heard him say that no one's have I ever heard Lindsey Graham say that he's gay and you know what I Believe ... grams gay that's fine that's his business right\nBut we live in a world where I guess if you do not say that you were gay\nAnd gay people have a right to out you\nHave a right to out you because they think you have it both ways right so they so they get to you that's your privilege that's the right to do that so of course you had Cathy Griffin and you had a a Don Lemon and you had um\nRosie O'Donnell yet Bill Maher he's not even gay Jimmy Kimble\n\nCalling them names like weaponize in his sexuality\n\nOr what they perceived to be his sexuality using it as a weapon against him\nTalked about that a little bit last week but\nBut I guess that's okay but but yet this girl because she happens to be\nIn the CNN\nPro liberal pro\nMilitant female corral you know the public relations arm of the Democratic party I guess it's OK nobody's going to get upset and nobody's going to say a word to her about it I'm\n...\nManager now\nThere were some of [noise] follow of tweets are generally from from people who subscribe to the CNN a Twitter page they weren't very complimentary though to her\n\nAnd you wonder why you know what you play that the identity politics thing\n\nAnd it's got somebody whose guys going to come back round it's like a boomerang gonna come back around eventually make you look like a hypocrite\nIt really is\nSo it's okay for Rosie o'donald and it's okay for Bill Maher and it's okay for Kathy Griffin is okay for Don Lemon secure for all of these guys do attack\nLindsey Graham\nBasically calling them ... you know in a closeted gay calling them\n\nYou know if if Lindsey Graham is gay what'd you well maybe I don't know that he is but if he is\nDoesn't he have a right to be without being attacked for it\nThat seem sensible to me five away now six o five hundred a quick break we'll be right back because\nThey're with us [noise]\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speed and\nSo you expect you can just come out and apologized today I don't know if I Want to be alone with with a lesbian and the call somebody else a faggot into winter and the ... old that that was just my useful underscored indiscretion right you know seven years ago I mean he did the double standards are absolutely amazing it's so\nBad yeah it it really felt bad but um yeah I'm curious to see what's gonna happen with this debt task or whatever his name is I I'm I'm seeing what was he getting what was he doing\nThat is amazing I mean you know had to be for some somebody or something and going somewhere I Am to I mean that's serious\nYeah yeah it is is is real serious and um I never heard that term before prior to this happening doc sing I never heard it in your own use ... that way before but\nI mean we're in a whole new day and age and I mean we didn't even have computers when kids do you know somebody's boxing on the computer all okay that's wonderful you know [laughter] okay what does that mean [laughter] you know I understand what what it means now that it's been explained to me but I'm going to\nGet to that point I didn't get any of the isn't I'm like and now this guy can now you've got to be connected to the Senate how can you just walk in there and doing the\nYeah you can't so either somebody was providing him with the information or he was somebody maybe somebody authorized them to do and who knows you don't get in you know maybe there's some ties into Sheila Jackson Lee handing the lawyer the envelope that day you know wouldn't that be something\nI Love every minute on that [laughter] either\nWay I I I just can't wait to see what the hell's going on and it's five ... you never know more about it\nYou know more about the Chinese y stuff to get your blood going [laughter]\nWell we can only hope that just because the media stumps focusing on stuff doesn't necessarily mean that the investigators behind the scenes out and and hopefully they're still digging into all this stuff\nYeah they tell you all the garbage you know what I mean is that I I hate to even watch television\nAnymore you know when you haven't heard any more rubble yeah the New York\nTimes big story last week about Trump ... or ... or you know are doing the show game for his parents there and all of that whenever I'm In an epic story that kind of fell off the front pages huh\nYeah if not then that's positive or anything that's real and you just look at
