M. dot com\nAnd our talk show host Ken is returning to the studio\nLooking back how long have I been asleep that tiny West is now the conservative and and uh Taylor Swift is now the ... of the Democratic probably this is a reversal of fortunes\nYeah but one thing though is Taylor Swift at the American Music Awards urged people to go out and vote and voter registration with young people is just off the charts in the last few days and then so she did something good by you know urging that household ... yes very powerful\nVery popular girl on yeah great songwriter and a clearly has taken a strong position on this whole cabinet thing I think that was the last straw for her right she was pretty much fighting a ton of all these years yeah I think so so but I excited about the games coming up well\nTo tell you the truth I'm I'm a New York Yankees fan having grown up in New York and I was disappointed but the red Sox certainly deserve to uh advance on with the season they've had\n[noise] I think the Yankees are going to be okay for quite a long time looking at them the makeup of this team to young powerful team and they broke the home run record I mean there are only going to make improvements yeah I hate to say but\nThen to the red Sox play them and the you know division ... series so they deserve to be where they are\nThey going to be I don't think that this century will be as lopsided but you never know but it's it's I think it's better for both teams to have each other to make because you know what I'm every great champion needs a rival I think yeah and they're already even\nRight now they both went over a hundred games this season\nYou know very quietly the Yankees had a terrific\nAnd it wasn't good enough to be a division championship you know there's\nSome injuries with a judge being out for a couple of months\nThey heard them yeah and he's obviously fantastic player should be for you know going out of ten years and we would hope yes mhm you would hope [laughter] but you know like the Yankees have to bankroll they have the market and you know the\n... it is the most prestigious team in baseball and will be for you know unless the red Sox when thirty in a row I don't believe in it was going to take them out of the number one of all time twenty seven chance was just that it's pretty hard to overcome yeah well so if we do the math now even if we want to every one of them we I don't think\nI don't want to do the math it would be quite a long time for the red Sox even come close but [laughter] well thank you always see in the in the next hour it yes you will All right and and Sam center is now joining us\nAh and ah the former Fall River mayor a and a friend of mine I'm Glad to have you with me here Sam\nProsecutor bill Connelly and unfortunately the investigation\nTook too long in my opinion um I like Bill and then I clearly respect as work that's why I have pointed in but the investigation took too long and uh and ultimately a nobody was charged and uh uh remains to be seen up who was telling the truth I Know who I think was telling the truth\n[laughter] let me ask you this if you\nThought when some I I think you can read between the lines who I think telling the truth\nRight in any event right let me ask you this if\nIf mayor Korea steps down or there'll be a special on\nAnd well see I'm sort of consider the the the possibility of running again\nAbsolutely can I I Love the job\nI feel as if a and and I mean I'm not I'm not I'm I'm I'm blaming myself for\nUh the the campaign and uh and and I I'm so I'd I'd have to give him credit and I did the night that I lost um but the fact is that I think we accomplished a lot in the one year that I had I mean when you think about the\nAh economic development that I spoke about but also the schools were improving crime was down so I just didn't make the case well enough during the campaign I was it was the it was the the that I that I put in and I was hoping that it was going to be a short term the and I was presented with the choice\nOf of laying off\nThirty one ... cops twenty nine firefighters and thirty five BP W workers city hall workers and and some teachers and I thought that faced with that trying to get Amazon trying to get market basket trying to get a life sciences company for the bio park\nI thought it was the right decision and uh\nAnd I think substantively um it was but I think that maybe I should have waited to do it or if it had to be done I should have perhaps looked for a a an an alternate ... an alternative way\nUh to close that three million dollar deficit that existed\nUm but the fact is that um we were already and and I think um you've heard me say this before\nFall River was already Fifteen police in fifty firefighters behind New Bedford so had I laid off another thirty a deep we would have been eighty behind I felt it was going to be difficult to attract some of these companies that were interested in Fall River we felt that far behind\nSo uh that's why I I made the decision I did and I think that it was the reason why last election and uh and so I Would I Would love an opportunity to be mayor it's ... it's a great job\nI think I think the other for the other problems he got hit up the young vote you gotta you got the young vote out in Fall River at a I think a number that had not been seen before I think that was a factor as well Jim I was always curious because I and I think that the current district attorneys doing a great job I think Mr quite as it is a very good a district attorney\nBut I also think that your position there was very safe and I thought I raised an eyebrow um you know to understate\nI really thought it was a curious ... you're going from a district attorney to the mayor of Fall River walk what made you decide to do that\nWell there were several reasons first of all I thought the city needed new leadership I thought that was clear I mean I I Know well I like will will in all your friends but even even if it was in this conversation with us right now\nHe would concede that there were some the major issues that he was dealing with in the fall of two thousand fourteen that's why there was a special\nElection and I I uh so I thought the city needed new leadership I thought I could do a great job I was ready for a change I was ready for a change\nWhen I ran for Congress in two thousand twelve I Love being district attorney uh but uh I never wanted to be district attorney forever\nI wanted to come in to what to do with a couple of terms a chain job or the sort of law enforcement landscape but as you know when I ran we were at the the\nThe um the greatest gun violence problem that for the rest of the county has ever faced gang violence problems other issues in the in the court system so I I I thought I could bring change and I did and then I thought it was time to\nTo move on to something else and I thought that ah the mayor's job would be a great job I become a very friendly with Scott lying and I knew how much he loves the job and and so uh I thought that was the right move for me and um\nYou think uh I think it I I I don't I don't second guessed that decision candidates hard not to because I went back to practicing law and I'm In uh the fall river courthouse several times a week and a um it's obviously different when you walk into the courthouses district attorney\n[laughter] walking in well then right [laughter] right exactly\nAnd uh and so it's hard not to question it but every time I question that I I arrive back at the same answer which and I'll tell you what else can be difficult is when there's when something takes place\nThat I Know I Would have had an opportunity to speak out on whether it's I'm\nI'm the I'm opiate crisis which I have to deal with regularly but representing individuals who are struggling with addiction or even the other day Ken when the United nations climate change report came out because of that case but I just messed with the two protestors blocking the answers to breaking point I knew\nThat I drove me crazy with that one well we can talk\nAbout that [laughter] I just say well those were issues that I really\nWhether the opioid crisis climate change gun violence I'm just trying to do trying to have more effective a child abuse prosecutions doing something about child abuse prevention those are issues like you're right they're deeply about so there are times when I miss being involved in those issues [laughter] but uh but\nI um but as I said every time I really ponder it I Know I made the right decision it's just a job or it didn't uh I wasn't able to get reelected and if I ever got a chance to do it again I Would do it\nWell I think the the list is short or that I can tell I'm not the the biggest Fall River politics follower but it looks like you'd be at or near the top of a very short list for for being a you know a front runner or if you don't mind you know I think\nSo I think you're right about that and uh I think that um I mean one of the things I think I accomplished over the last few years is that I've shown people I can take a punch a mean that wasn't easy and I just I I I got back up often that went right back to work and I\nCredit my father he really pushed me to go to law school and I told the story many times\nBut he always said the great thing about being a lawyer is\nDay and I think he meant a business or whatever can't really fire you you can always put your own shingle out and get right back to work I think that's something that he wished that he had had for himself and of course that's exactly what happened and uh so I'm\nA I I I Hope I'm not a done with\nPolitics than I Would love to be mayor again I'm not sure two thousand Nineteen will be the year I've got a very busy practice canon dot my clients want me concentrating on their cases than I Am now but at the same time I will I Will definitely give it serious consideration in weather shades of gray steps down or not\nYou know I'm ...\n... ... he's\nI think that he's doing the city of just favor I think we agree agree with that um we were you think his age has something to do with\nStaying on it or do you think it's just his personality I'm I don't know much about him other than what I've read over the last couple of years\nAnd if you don't mind me saying this and I don't take the wrong way because I Know you're not a Mitt Romney voter but ... like Mitt Romney was correct on a number of things during the debate was President Obama especially when you think of what he said about Russia\nYou turned out to be right about geo Korea and some of the things that were going on in the background that you accused him of that he denied people\nNow know you are right [noise] well\nThat's a that's a good feeling but I think the more important point on that is what's best for the city of Fall River right now and if your question is and I think it is your question do I think age his age he's still\nIn his twenties is playing a role in is\nNot stepping down I Would say I'm not sure because it's really only been twenty four hours I I Would be um I I I Would feel better about answering that question maybe a month from now or two months from now he's going to have\nA lot of long night contemplating what he should do what uh I Hope he put the city\nFirst I think if he put the city first you have to seriously consider stepping down but he may not have that luxury city council\nIf they're seven counselors who want him to step down and vote for him to step down I'm obviously is going to have\nTo do it so uh\nWell having Kevin renting sending you know giving you know I'm sure I'm reading and you know because he has to sell 'em ... charges quite a bit of money you know he may be providing a a a ... a delusional sort of look at uh the odds here I mean I I don't think it's you know I don't think he's going to walk away from this\n[noise] um I Know Kevin well enough I and I know I'm pretty well and uh I have a ton of respect for the way he conducts himself\nAnd his practice [laughter] I can tell you this about Kevin he's very Frank with the client okay so if he\nThinks that the government has an overwhelming case he's gonna tell days of Korea that he's not going to mince words that he's that that that's his style\nMhm he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't promise roads gardens and he has it from the moment I ... back in the Nineteen eighties or wherever and district\nWhen when it comes to guys like Kanye West the insulting things they're saying about him\nFor daring to get off of that Democratic Party for speaking out against it maybe maybe we don't have to belong to the party maybe they ought to look at the sixty years of voting predominantly for Democrats in what got them collectively in society because there's been a lack\nEconomically\nAnd while you can attribute that when this should be no denying it you can you can attribute some of the lack of opportunity to racism you'd be you'd be more on to say otherwise well a lot of it has to do with continuing to believe in the wrong people\nAnd it's particularly disturbing to see how they are treated when they question whether or not it is the right thing to continue on this path\nYou know can you started asking questions admit look I'm just a free thinker ... I don't hate Trump in ... people attacked him and yesterday put both feet in the water\nAnd it was interesting that a President Trump certainly one of the photo album Kanye West I think that there's no denying that but I don't know that the video or [noise] you know the video that started the live video feed it I I think that was unscripted and I also think that it's it's you know you never know what's going to have in our life and you don't know what kind of what is going to say\n\nAnd he said some things that upset a lot of progress that they were completely bought hurt by the time the talking heads of of the the cable news networks get on last night and they were all scripted and choreographed and all saying the same things oh he's nuts\n\nAnytime there's a conservative or African American is called some very disparaging things by liberal members of the the black community and by a white members of the liberal community\nWho feel entitled to insult anybody who's not thinking as they're told to think\nIt should be a problem for more people I just don't know that it's resonating thanks for waiting you're on the air\nIt's very racist and there should be a big problem for a lot of people but they're working on\nFor a while but when it comes from liberal blacks talking about ... I Can't say racism but you can say it's a form of bigotry is is an ideological bigotry\nYou wanna call it you know it's something that they would call a white person no matter what they said so there's definitely a double standard shows ... [laughter] now I Want to talk about a bigger issue or why we have so much crime down here\nYou know that they really around on section eight housing in the Boston area that you know that\nWell I can tell you this they absolutely see the value of the property in Boston and have over the years not just starting now I mean the Boston bombing right now but they've pushed they have pushed a lot of low income housing out to the suburbs like Brockton exactly yep rock record area ... Randolph\nI'm sure it's low laundry New Bedford ... get that\nYeah but they don't want it in Boston\nThere the gentrification of the gentrification in Boston\nIt's very similar to I think what the complaints are New Bedford how downtown gets a lot of the money and downtown gets priority Boston is getting priority\nWell I Can't even think you can say downtown did that but I think it's a a lack of um\nIt doesn't seem like the Democrats in this area are doing the right thing for the people why shouldn't um section eight housing people you know I'm for better or for worse spread out either way through the entire state of Massachusetts but yet\nThey well they try they try to cause any sign of doing it though they tried to cause incentives for that small towns I miss out on getting some state money in federal money by denying more area to section eight or two I'm supposed to get\nHit for hypocrisy because they don't want him in Boston they don't want him in Boston any with well I mean come on ... and want them\nIn that and they don't want 'em anyway that was up the idea that they had a very long conversation\nI'm there almost every night there's there's tons of section ... housing in Boston but no but the but it's about I'll tell you to places places that uh we're no go zones after nine ten o'clock for you know pedestrians people concerned about their safety there are now free to walk and a lot of areas that they couldn't Fifteen Years ago so it is getting pushed out\nThe the undesirable community in terms of high crime areas things like that it is shrinking in Washington\nDid that come in this way so that raped me to sit for a a a a a city councilman mayors and so on and so forth because I'm Down here we're really getting the uh we'll\nGet into the cream of the crop if that's all you want to put it in Boston is or even a what's considered a the poorer areas in Boston is a bit better than\nI tell you what you want to call good residential area nice well they've got to be [noise]\nI'll tell you what though one one thing Boston is doing is uh should be concerning the taxpayer and that is that they are allowing a a ... the colleges which are growing big time the growing but they're purchasing property that will be non taxable and so if you're paying taxes in Boston this fewer fewer places that we will be paying taxes that's\nNot really my big beat my huh is that our our area is getting more crime and what happens in the rhetoric of filters into the surrounding communities\nAnd it is I don't know the correct a terminology far but it's not it's not good and I we\nAre really really really this area he is getting a disservice by ... in um these Democrats in New Bedford city councilman the ones that want to do good for the that really loved\nYou and your back but yet allow allowing this and not speaking for the people because I'm a very very\nHigh you buy you pointed to any particular spike in ... I'm not aware of any particular spike in crime that you're referring to how long are we talking about\nThis this Claudia crime in the New Bedford area cards\nTalking like you know they don't have no problem in Boston we got here they have some they they definitely have some ... they don't have what we have\nWell maybe that's because a lot of Boston unless you're pointing out is three thousand dollars a month rent [laughter] a lot of people have worked hard and function\nYou know where they got whole limited some of these are smaller tenement houses but they're\nUm\nThey're trying to get those people out to the regular African American people that live like in mad at the end um and I had a long conversation with one gentleman yesterday and they're trying to force them out to\n... I I was so I'm I'm In Boston almost every day I'm going to tell you right now I speak with\nPeople of all races all colors different if it doesn't matter these typically people in Boston I'm going to tell you right now overall they're paying attention to what the kids are doing in school\nThey are there and working closely with the with the teacher by comparison to to the satellite cities and when I tell you what the parents more involved and it it things are going in the right direction\nOf course they are because they're forcing all undesirable\nOut of it out of their city in air that might that's what I'm saying and they're forcing it on our areas therefore even if it's in a like an inner city like New Bedford with the big huge problems there are still forcing it into the rural areas\nThe veterans of the veteran can counter if they can provide opportunity and jobs and that's what that's that's how you made it\nBecause they're trying to put every business out of business you city councilmember entrenched in there and the city council that don't want to speak up there just\nTo have a section ... in an industry and I know what you're talking about but I I also think there are people who are very interested in in growing business and growing opportunity down here to the caller I gotta I gotta go thanks for calling your next\nYou hike that by popular demand and that of the hosts broadcast\nWe should see the all the emails I didn't have to have you come back welcome back first\nYes it's always nice to be welcomed back especially to such a welcoming environment which which is worthwhile radio and I'm checking in from Missoula, Montana where out here for the coming of Trump the big rally on the Eighteenth\nSo we're we're getting our forces lined up and I called to talk about of course the ah the courage of ... and also to a certain degree\nThe courage of a cat Ken's courage because can offer something in the afternoon the witches extended conversation about topics of interest to the listeners\nAnd ah there's a back and forth that develops which is not available during the week because when I call the afternoon\nI say something and then the volume gets turned down on me and the whole broadcaster continues to pontificate and disagree with me without giving me a chance to have any dialogue\nOkay now that is that is despicable behavior on the part of a talk show hosts broadcast\nAnd margarita play every Wednesday you could be biting into a juicy ten ounce Angus burger washing it down with the plight of either beer or margarita it's just twelve dollars for the beer flight or Eighteen dollars for the margarita get to reach them the grill forty one William street New Bedford this Wednesday night\nFiber optics move crazy amounts of data and even crazier speeds and filed by horizon is the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nWith files that connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty makes\nTV phone ad a two year price guaranteed all for Seventy nine Ninety nine per month on line with a two year agreement plus get two hundred dollar shorter range of Google and that's smart home devices and a one hundred dollar visa prepaid card when you order online go to get by US DOT com and switched to the one hundred percent fiber optic network one hundred percent phenomenal\nFive Seventy one ... five or six Bolton street New Bedford\n\nFirst station will be James ... that's\nOn ... and\nIn educational charity repeal tickets are available\nThe all day on a ...

Ninety now with that when they're Ninety I think Ninety nine Ninety eight in one if they have the leading the eighth inning after after the eighth inning had yeah\nUm yeah ... um my concern is that um let's say this out as they go like two or three innings than that I don't like the middle reliever you know that's one of my concern you know about the red Sox\nYeah it's and of course Houston doesn't have that problem they have a pretty good bullpen they're very good line up um I don't think they have the starting pitching we we have but they're not far behind their either as a ... this is a formidable defending champ here\n... um I think it's a gold southern games how about you\n[noise] I um I think the socks want insects\nYou'd think in the ...\nI think the Sox are going to win both of the games at home and I think that when I'm two or three in Houston hopefully\nYou know I I I don't know for sure but I feel I think the red Sox are very very confident going in here and a ... I Would hate to see the special season go for not because it what would you be disappointed if they do lose\nWell I'll be disappointed in one way and you know and and happy for them because they both you know they they want so many games over a hundred games you know so you can't be that can't be you know what I mean that there's a point you know 'cause they want a lot of games a hundred and eight hundred six\nHundred and they gave it a lot of people think because they got past the Yankees it's now a breeze it's not the case in Houston I I think he used to be the Yankees\nYeah used to ... ...\n... if they were very impressive yeah very impressed that they can score runs they can prevent you from scoring runs if both sides of the ball is a good defense in spite of the champions now what do you like in in the um on the national league\nUm dodges at 'em and Milwaukee yeah you know what let me tell you something I like to see more yeah I haven't been in that for so many years you know what I mean\nI'm smiling because I I feel the same way I think the Dodgers look come out of there but I Would love to see you know the city of Milwaukee finally get a good piece of the action\nTo right yeah because um they've been dry so I you know and they got a good team\nI used to like the boroughs back when Hank Aaron was on that team\nThat's how far back I go oh I remember what the Atlanta Braves yeah Hank\nAnd I think he I think he hit the the record for the Braves right now I think is um the when he finally be Ruth's record I think he was down there I'm not one hundred percent sure I Know what was it the British he was playing\nOh I think it was played ...\nMaybe it was a ... maybe it's the Mets they were playing against I'll have to go back and look at that it's a it's been so long\nThat's a long way yeah that's where I'm from way back to school\nYeah yeah okay they they ... thank you very much more thing yeah how do you like New England another she's [noise]\nAh ten days for Bella checked to prepare at home um the way the patriots applying right now I think you have to favor the patriots even though the Kansas City is five and ... and has a track team out there I I don't think they play the defense I'm very well and I expect if it's a if it's a matter of a a guy\nAnd between the quarterback Tom Brady usually comes out on top of those with clock management\nYep you're right mhm\nBut I think it should be the game\nYeah I think is I think that um believe it or not I told my brother said New England like\nDid you well you never know I'll tell you this do Kansas City seems to be able to punch in the mouth on nationally televised games especially when it's not the postage season but they during the regular season\nNow on um when was where the feature game as we are going to be Sunday night Kansas City has embarrassed the patriots I think at least three times mhm there was one somehow with one seven out of the last ten but really the three that we lost a were embarrassing once a home to ... well one of them was in Kansas City when\nA grapple all came in the game and that turned the and that was the year the the pages that Lana\n... was it a few thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen a lot of fire was was let because of that game but that was in Kansas City but they did a last year or the defending patriots so the super bowl defending patriots got embarrassed\nA cream humble the ball and then he just went you know it was looking at all world runner after that\nYeah but I I think no one that's got to get back at them I think by twenty\nWell I think Gilmore is going to stay on a Cherry Hill\nOr you never know about what's going to do he could he could put the second quarter row and then double 'em up with the safety but um you gotta you gotta stop hill and focus on hunt if you can if you can get a little passe rush go and you can't let my home's who's making it look really easy you can't let them sit back and be comfortable\nYeah you can't give them a lot of time in the pocket because you'll burn your\nHe's making it look easy I mean Andy Reid looks like a genius not only picking them up of getting rid of Alex Smith who did a a fairly decent job for Kansas City in the ... in other kids ... pretty much an unknown and who knows him better than any reading watches them in practice this kid is going to be for real for a number of years it looks like\nAnd it's going to be a good weekend\nYeah hope one let's hope it solve is all our goes all our way\nYeah All right my print thank you for the call yet W.

an easy thing to do but that line up just speaks for itself I mean this is a a a tall order to getting getting past I think the Sox are up to it though [noise] five only nine six over ... of course on Sunday night\nThe New England patriots hosts\nThe empress of Kansas City chiefs team at least offensively impressed that they are five and now\n\nA and it looks like their defense is not really a great defense although they're pass rush or a missed the Houston has always been a problem for Tom Brady that should be attract me that should be a very high scoring entertaining game or I haven't looked at the weather\n\nBut a ... a good bad weather quarterback was good in every category but um do you have a caller who calls my show up by the way I'm On the air from nine to noon every Saturday\nAnd I've got a guy who may want to call again on Saturday because he Drew Brees just broke the record is now the now throwing for more yards and the NFL's history\nIt did so a Monday Night against the Washington Redskins who really I think disappointed a lot of people I I thought the skins were better than that they got crushed by the saints who um you know they feel they've got a good team in a team that can\nGet out of the NFC and be in the super bowl possible that the FCC stacked right now there's a lot of good teams now and then a conference but uh Drew Brees\nYou know the caller makes the argument every once in a while a call my show and tell me that Drew Brees is the greatest quarterback in the NFL's history\n\nI think he's the head of Tom Brady I'm an all time yard edge a for a reason\n... number one or the saints played from behind an awful lot there weren't a lot of shootouts because of the lack of defense or the games construct was was what it was\nIt was a necessity to fire away at all times Brady had enjoyed a lot of good defenses over the years but he also played in either San Diego or dome ideal passing conditions his whole career even in his division right I mean that land as a dome\n\nYou you have to go to Tampa Bay usually good weather Caroline is not so bad\n\nThat I mean I feel good about saying Tom Brady is as good a pass or as anybody I've ever seen in my life breeze included ... manning included Marino included\n\nGuys like you lie manning\nAre performing the way they're supposed to perform just because of British forty one these guys are still you know thirty eight years old dirty nine thirty seven they're starting to lose\nAnd leave their physical peak there's supposed\nTo separate is an exception I mean I you know what maybe it's the regiment of diet and exercise is doing maybe it's just genetics but you know manning really the giants should have had\nA quarterback drafted I flew sacred say one broccoli is a great player but it was that\n\nSome good quarterback to pick up last year on the giants passed on them to pick up his running back believing in Eli, Eli is um he's almost like look Peyton Manning won the super bowl with the Denver Broncos but he was almost a negative for them\n\n... ... he wasn't lining up I mean his his arm was terrible he got it done I I'm not going to argue that it got to do with his mind and he will do it but he did not have the the army had years ago and I think Eli Manning is on his way out\n\nIt was pretty evident he's had a couple of good games that's going to happen but I mean you're just not who you were when you get you know late thirties it starts to\nBe a reality for almost everybody\nFive only nine six o five hundred so a very very big weekend in sports here
