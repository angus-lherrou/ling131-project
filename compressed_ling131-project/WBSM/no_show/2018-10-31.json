Harris a and a and Elizabeth Warren saying that they were out there in essence selling their votes are collecting donations from people in exchange for a vote against cabinet\nAnd in in ... she wants to see your tax returns I mean you're you're just working stiff like the rest of us out there and she's trying to make an issue out of your tax returns like your heightened billions of dollars out in the Caymans are women that Kennedys ah it does yeah\nWhat do you make of that well I mean\nI've been in the legislature for eight years every year we have to file an ethics form a and B can heal that outlines all that we uh our salaries what we own a for the Senate Ethics or to run the U.S Senate or you have to give a not just what you own or what your loans are outstanding things like that but also if you have a\nMutual fund or four one K. you have to lift every single stock\nThat is owned or or manage in that mutual fund so I mean they ask you everything everything about yourself I put that out there happily a because again it shows that in my case I think I owe a little more on my house and we we have an equity and I think I owe a little more on the business my wife and I owned together than we have equity and\nSo we are just trying to make it like everybody else out there in the world and here she is a never earning a million dollars until she became a U.S senator and yet taking deduction on her property taxes of three hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars a year for the last ten years so we're all paying more for our property taxes while she's paying less\nBut she wants to massively raise your taxes out there\nBecause she wants to make government run fully run health care uh basically have government run businesses she wants to have government take over our lives are and the cost of that it's gonna be tripling your taxes if she gets her way had their meanwhile she's looking for every loophole she can get she talks about a rigged system will she's the only one that's benefited from a Rick system that I see in this race\nRight and not just political rhetoric on your behalf I mean she states clearly on the record during these debates and elsewhere that she would repeal the Trump tax cuts that so many people have and and I enjoyed\nAnd we've seen a stimulate the economy she wants to repeal ... while she is trying to find tax loopholes for herself\nWell look or weve got record unemployment in Massachusetts lower than the national average in the national average is it a fifty year low she said that it's crumbs eighty percent of Massachusetts residents have received a tax cut because of that tax reform she voted against and his out to repeal but beyond that\nShe actually wants to like I said raise your taxes\nUm and I think the other thing too is she disputes the fact that our economy's doing well you can't dispute one point two billion dollars in New tax revenue in Massachusetts that the the legislature did not even anticipate coming in because businesses have taken their tax cut\nHire more people and given wage increases that's how it happened that you don't need government coming in and trying to fix what wages should be in in an industry when a when the free market does what it does best which is\nCompete in innovate then you get the success that delivers the uh the economic growth\nOf over four point one percent GDP last quarter um and then you see the uh the more people working the more money they're making is translating into providing the state the funds we need to fund or schools to make sure veterans have their services that they were promised and making sure that people can retire at the age that they were hoping to\nWrite and the other thing that she keeps trying to make an issue if he or she keeps insisting that you want to go to Washington\nAnd pass on the cost of those tax cuts onto the folks who were collecting Social Security by cutting Social Security so she's trying to paint his bogeyman who wants to give tax cuts to be wealthy businesses am at the expense of Social Security recipients that's a recurring theme in her a message is well\nWell she doesn't seem to understand that maybe she just doesn't want to admit that the increase the revenue increases the booming economy is actually replenishing Social Security right now the Social Security fund come from payroll taxes so when more people are working and GDP is up that is how our country is is\nFulfilling the promise of having Social Security dollars available so she really does have it backwards and she she manipulates or the truth out there to try to make it look like she's got a some sort of solution and that solution is more\nOur government and I'll tell you when you have government run health care when you have government uh basically ensuring student loans you're ensuring that costs will never go down or when the government's the guaranteed payer\nHealthcare will never go down and we'll just go up the cost and the same thing with student loans ill this colleges know that once they've got a guaranteed pay or in the federal government because the federal government\nIs who provides loans when before double CARE Act was passed\nThey twisted that pretzel in such a way that they actually took in student loans as part of the money and money out for the Affordable healthcare act that was just ridiculous but what basically happened was government again became the guaranteed payer now colleges have no incentive to be competitive with their cause they just keep driving it up and making it harder for families to afford to go\nNo you're and you're absolutely right Jeff when the government is paying the bills in putting the dose for all of his stuff this is when you get to twelve hundred dollar toilet seats in the end of the five hundred dollar aspirin and things like that that's exactly what what goes wrong because the government there is no really there's no oversight of that and these these companies just write would they want in in the government pays it\nWell when I uh led the two thousand fourteen repeal of index gas tax here in Massachusetts\nWe showed the government was spending a ridiculous amount of money to maintain our roads and money that was also being sent to the MBTA was not going where it was supposed to six billion dollars up to ... billion\nIn deferred maintenance at the MBTA over the years even though fifty percent of the gas is going to subsidize them and or the other thing too is that our roads in Massachusetts\nThen and now are costing six hundred Seventy five thousand dollars per year per mile to maintain versus the national average of a hundred and forty five thousand dollars over half a million dollars in waste per year per mile\nOn our roads government has the money to do what we need to get to get done but then they need to be more accountable and efficient with our dollars and when you ah have\nBureaucrats that basically want no accountability that's when a government just goes and spends beyond belief and then we end up having deficits um that are ridiculous so look our goal is to go to Washington had may be a strong voice not just for\nLetting letting people keep more of your own money but making sure that Washington just like I did on deacon hill is not wasting your dollars ... what you send to them\nWell I mean all of a sudden her favorite Republican in Washington is ... is President Trump I mean no one half of the debate she she not strong by Trump's no good we've got to get her ... he's ugly ugly ugly and and then when she ... her favorite Republican to working with President Trump and I just had a text from a listener who asked me to ask you about these\nTwelve bills lose a bit worn and Donald Trump and worked on personally together\nAnd are in passing I mean all of a sudden these bills come out of nowhere I have no recollection at all for working with Trump's gets well bills passed the you\nKnow these are co sponsored bill she she put herself down as a co sponsor to Republican I was\nActually a everything she's filed since President Trump took office has not passed\nA is not inside and by the president's what she's referring to is those\nShe added her name to the other people have filed Republicans had filed look it's a nice election year trick fact of the matter is as we get closer to election day the more bills I was with Warren has filed is well sixty percent of the bill she's filed have been within this last session or so where she'd been for six years she's been out there writing two books about herself\nFundraising perfectly for democratic candidates so that she can make a run for the White House and have a favors in the bank with states like Ohio in Nevada and Louisiana ah Pennsylvania Oklahoma that's where she spent a lot of time traveling just in the last six months not focused on the people of Massachusetts\nWell you know and I know you're on the campaign dress I'm only going to keep you know the second here but um I use a voter was insulted when questioned by Harding was supposed to her last night about whether or not she would pledge to survive or germ if elected and she laughed is no that's funny I mean there's means\nI think to the voters this means obviously something to you if you're not going to survive to try and get the hell out of the way let me go there because I Want to do this work do you what barely do not do as voter I was insulted by that the fact that she laughed at that question\nWell Barry I just to give people inside info I was at the debate of course and the room was filled up with an audience of about um I Want to say about Ninety people thirty from our campaign thirty from the Warren campaign in about thirty students uh when I said that I'm Elizabeth Warren and President Trump have to one thing in common\nNeither wants to be senator from Massachusetts but both want to be president the entire room actually let a chuckle so it seems to be an inside joke\nThat the everybody thinks it's funny that uh she she clearly is saying I don't want this job I don't think anybody that went to apply it is WBFO them\nA said that by the way after I get this job I'm hope you don't mind that I'm going to start interviewing for other jobs right away but that's what she's asking is that we elect her so she can immediately start running and ignoring our state for the next two years\nYeah well I think folks auto elect somebody who I seriously wants the job and is committed to doing it and not committing to a a committed to I representing the folks in in Washington and that would be you Jeff deal so what do you do between now and next Tuesday\nWell I'm going out everywhere I can I've been to a spur of this morning I'm Hopkins in Edinburgh now heading into New Bedford later in the day or an\nEveryday is going to be a all points across the state talking to voters\nI'm I'm hoping that listeners though who want to see change who want to see someone go for the next six years work every day for Massachusetts if they want to help me out they can do two things they can send an email at info at deal for Senate dot com\nA day I ... for Senate dot com info at the present dot com send an email and ask what you can do work at you an answer right away but even better call our office number because now we want to put people basically to work right away seven eight one four to eight thirty one Ninety and I'll just\nBarry I might need your help getting through this one because it's a it's a point that I might have difficulty making but it has to do with what you mentioned before\nAbout the inability of the media and especially the print media and the the state the TV and radio and everything else you mentioned the standard times is unable to pick up his story Mm [noise]\nUh and remind me what story that was it has to do with this war and being up on the accusations of campaign finance\nThat's correct yeah infraction right major stuff yes governor\nOf Connecticut or John Rowland went to prison not once twice for that\nAnd simply the real reason was he was a went up against marry an auto on her program of of a same sex marriage so when you go up against this is a lawyer in Maine but NATO and she'll go to prison okay if you're a good man\nUm but anyway here's my constructive criticism about how we why they can behave this way and get away with it and that is because talk radio has failed\nIn in Massachusetts if our if our talk radio mechanism was grew great\nOkay now at times it's good occasionally it's great but if it were great constantly then they wouldn't be allowed to to behave like this that or do you get my drift\nWell no because we're the only ones talking money ... do you see anybody on television or in the newspapers criticizing Warren on any of us we had this on Monday when it came out in the Washington Times and last night the television station refused to even raises as an issue you had two reporters from channel five and a reporter from the the Boston Globe\nI'm questioning her on the piano and they're asking ah what was the last book you read but nobody said did you try to buy votes\nLet me try this again okay\nTrump ran for office and we still wear red ... said make America great again and what we have to do is make talk radio great again because it's not great in other words they have no respect for us I wouldn't ban and you're\nAll right we're not going there five ... five hundred thank you for hours you always had a freaking wall and I'll tell you what you're hanging by a thread there should be banned on this show to 'em because I'm sick and tired of your being your whining little nap\nOkay I'm Still not you offer reason which is not going to go there and see it's not doing anything the audience cares about five or six o five hundred your next inevitably is I'm gonna have to know\nHow to get a very quick point on the television\nUh I'd say I mean yeah there are the ... I suspect that all the block that out what's wrong with the rest of the country broadcast I there have or how you can receive that brought about utilize\n... frequency right swap yesterday but yeah you need to do it by an editor right and and yeah varying degrees that\nThose are the over the year channels like channel five channel ten channels\nAnd that's why you're caught the original color we mentioned there what was that again at that point that's what that's what everybody's referring to the ...\nRight right but I mean you can't get one of these little like you know one remedy things over at Walmart for fourteen Ninety nine and get a get Nason or you know you\nCan't do that for I can only get broadcast but that's actually what they talk about if you're in a good location got\nQuite a bit in any way or the managers have a very safe you know people talk about the grid and that we have those are all put out that many primary than high definition right on the secondary there are a\nLittle lower definition but anyway it is a lock that want to ask you to a deck on maybe what the mayor and I don't know that he assured status\nUm because I'm frustrated with table well new five gee technology fifth generation\nYou're really going to be a transformative thing and and one of the uh concerned that locality a way to hide that area of the uh the companies like Comcast or arrive you bring up\nA the ... or ... or a track yeah next step would be a heck of a telephone pole\nAnd that but that's the kind of an ongoing thing I don't know how a familiar you are with it I\nYeah I mean I'm I'm really not a techno guy so I'm you know I I Know I Know we've got four G. capability in our TV and I know that Comcast offers a some forty program which really isn't a lot of the jobs they were at this point there's not much you can find some stuff on YouTube and\nUm you know ...

I'm sure it'll be offered at some point by the cable but\nI'm just not sure enough there's just not even enough used the fork at this point is there\nWell I think it's going to be transformative it and I know that it's been quite a bit written about it or if they had developed in this country is that it's all it yet but I think\nPeople the way people watch TV will be quite different three to four years from now and then\nYou know that I mean that'll be cool if they put it in in ...

then new fear you might be the ministry of the\nCome back to the front graphite all our today it's done quickly to old age is our time and down and welcome welcome welcome if you're just tuning in a lot of things happening\nNot the least of which is the a Senate Ethics committee is being asked to investigate or ethical of violations against Elizabeth Warren alleged violations of campaign funding laws uh Elizabeth Warren is accused of sending out an email\nTo supporters looking to fund raise off of her vote on the Kavanaugh nomination not after the vote but before the vote suggesting that she was looking to uh they're pretty much a sell her vote or the donors\nAnd this is unethical and perhaps illegal says a a watchdog group that has filed a complaint in the Senate Ethics committee\n'em all this stuff is out the media is not covering this why is the media not covering this is an important election coming up next week in Massachusetts and of course the Massachusetts media is not talking about this at all if Jeff deal this was actually out on Monday we mentioned it here on Monday a story in the Washington Times about this\nAnd uh the the you don't see that there was this in the standard times did you see in the standard times did you see it on Fort river and the Herald news now of course she didn't\nUm channel five they didn't report on this\nUh Boston Globe didn't have anything on it\nFunny we had it on Monday but none of the other media and the state had it and uh because they chose not to have it if it weren't for deal bringing this up during the debate last night it wouldn't have been in Boston Herald today a but it was and why was deal bringing it up during the debate\nMade those remarks in reference to the fatal shooting of two black people in ...\nThe bombs males political figures in the shooting them at a synagogue in Pittsburgh which killed eleven people\nI keep trying to point out to people and not to demonize any one group or anyone ethnicity but we keep thinking that the highest terrorists right is something else some people who are marching you know toward our border like it's the imminent\nAnd the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and you know most of them did get into the country most of them got a taco down before they even made it to the border so we have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men\nMost of the dumb radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them there is no ban on they had the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that that CNN okay\nBiggest terror threat in this country white men we need a travel ban on white men in this country that is what CNN is kind of like five or six o five hundred thanks for hanging on the next level to be a Sam\nHey\nIt a guy conveniently leaves out the wrong Kmart or not it states\nWhen a Chinese Man was born and it was denied citizenship and went to the court\nAnd there was a law on the books that denied naturalization Chinese people in\nThis case one because he was born in ... became\nA citizen by by birth like who's fully\nAnd leaving that out and not really being too honest with you\nBut I don't know if he left it out or not I didn't I didn't read to the entire article I read parts of the article a man I don't know whether he took that into consideration the strip pinion what was the what were the conditions of his parents\nThey were not I'm not sure if that were on\nOkay but were they here legally\nThere was a law written that they couldn't be naturalized how they got here I'm not sure what the Supreme Court but I Wish President Trump would have done with the vote House Senate and house representatives\nAnd just set a speech wag her baby summarize like massive illegal immigration [noise] good good at at you can write to speak [noise] would've put it that they\nWould have shown who the good\nPoliticians are in a bad policy is not there would have created controversy\nBecause to change that you have to ... it's an act of Congress Congress has the power\nFor the naturalization process\nI don't like presidents doing things by executive order on the court through what are they going to rule that that is exactly the water is unconstitutional\nNot what they're going to rule if if they rule in Trump's favor what they would rule was that the fourteenth amendment does not allow for birthright citizenship so the executive order becomes moot at that point\nBut I I Know they're not going to rule on this executive order was unconstitutional\nBut because it doesn't matter is moot at that point if the Supreme Court says that the fourteenth amendment does not allow for\nA birthright citizenship than the executive order to become smoke because you can't you can't hold on you can't have an executive order what Trump is basically saying and the executive order is that he wants to enforce the law\nAs as outlined in the constitution because they don't believe that the fourteenth amendment allows for birthright citizenship so if the Supreme Court says that\nA Trump is correct on that his executive order really becomes moot because the the law is low\nThere's been previous Supreme Court decisions\nThat that was the day that wants to change that we've done through Congress\nThe Congress is a part of changing the constitution but that also involves the citizens in the states and in several votes\nBut that Congress has the power on the natural\nIt nobody see this is where you keep getting hung up and you don't you're not getting it nobody is is is advocating changing the constitution here what what the people who support with Trump is saying\nAnd what Trump is saying is that the fourteenth amendment is being misinterpreted that the law all ... states this so nobody's advocating changing the constitution\nThat's my worst doesn't get involved in Congress has no right in this\nSince in the constitution that says\nThat they have the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization they do have the power and immigration and how somebody becomes a citizen [noise]\nThe law the fourteenth amendment to the constitution does not state that you can become an American citizen if you were born here doesn't say that\nThat is what it says that he said well no that's that's not what it says those\nBorn or naturalized in the United states subject to the ... the mayor of\nThat's another activity jurisdiction ... correct I'm\nOver here illegally new commit a crime you can go to prison\nAnd back then you were under the jurisdiction\nVenue or under the jurisdiction of the United states if you're not here legally you are not under the jurisdiction of the United states\nThat there was a court case that give illegal people that\nAre here that's what the constitution says people on the bill of rights and I never defined safely what a a citizen\nIs give equal protection from April\nAnd the Supreme Court cases\nThat have said that\nThe um that it is a birthright too slowly and you can become a citizen you want to change the law that's one thing but the president doesn't have the right to just make executive order\nThe president has a right to make executive orders all day long it's in the constitution that the president can make executive orders all day long he does have the authority but you were being stubborn here and you're not accepting what the what the issue is you're you're totally skirting the issue\nThe issue is the president and his supporters are saying the fourteenth amendment is being misinterpreted\nNobody's looking to change the law that is not what's occurring here\nThe president's not saying by the fourteenth amendment I mean by an executive order I'm going to change the fourteenth amendment he saying the fourteenth amendment doesn't save some by executive order I Want the fourteenth amendment to be enforced as written that's only saying they're not suggesting changing\nThe fourteenth amendment that with the court comes back and says the fourteenth amendment does in fact say on that you can become a an American citizen simply by being born here then you start the legislative process you know that but you keep skirting that for some reason and I'm not quite sure why\nBy the way down to six or five hundred your next the w._b. us up\nOn your ... or ... or ... or going with talk of all in my chest you off but I understand that Tony ... that's what they saw all rejected\nOr is this is Mike Mike says you also\nYeah okay I thought it was put your phone is your phone sounds kinda liked in Kansas right now what we have been what I had been told is that a Tony ... has refused to debate you and that he he ... he is going to appear here at nine thirty on friday morning and I've also been told that feel is trying to set up a separate time for you to command but ... refused individual\nYeah isn't that a shame I think it's a damn shame yeah you just ... on a responsibility to obey all the ...\nThe next spring to them what oh what he has\nI Know and he was just as soon as she like gay is ... ... in your twenties is January ... and I'm On the opposition here is I mean\nAre you having a rage we have an issue with term limits and he doesn't want to address from the ... and that was an H ... why ...\n... ... where you watch it 'cause hey ray Trump look it up if he were still want to do it all yeah so they all that stuff you park your shoe won't go into the uh\nThe people that he's supposed to represent ... and I'm\nLike you're breaking up all over the place you're not a very difficult time understanding you but I got your point and you're right at every two years Tony ... has it has an obligation to come forward and can find the voters he will argue that by coming on by himself on friday he's doing that\nUm I disagree with that and I think he has an obligation to debate his opponents in in you being his opponent I think that uh Tony ... chickening out and he's running away from a debate that he feels might hurt him at the polls\nAnd um I think that certainly Tony ... has a after twenty eight years in the house of representatives has it has a responsibility to debate his opponent on the air and um my I'll call them off of that all day long\nAppreciated that might sorry just your phone is just too bad I couldn't even understand what you're saying so I can only imagine the other listeners we're having a difficult time to let me take a quick break we're going to come right back he calls an exit fourteen when the w._b. ascent\nOn things wanting to leave them between filled Barry ... newsroom we're\nAll a bunch of ... here in New Bedford is news taxation way love\nGoing out the that's why we love seafood deal Doug Jones we bring you have the courage to the south goes way respond like mental illness go Republican freak those really grilled find the latest half price just cars now sees the deal does come and they'll let you be\nThe White House while holding on to the Senate see God just wants to get to Washington in January wants to eat the ground running I have no plans to run for the White House I Want to be your senator I Want to see from day one let him have a chance she doesn't want the job she wants to be president\nI it just doesn't even make sense to me how you could vote for anybody I don't care what politicians or what your political snipes you have if that person says the day you will like me I'm going to start running for another office I mean did you totally crazy finally ... hundred your next in Libya Sam\nHey how are you have\nA couple of points are well first thing is a good news after troops that arrived at Florida first contingents but that's the\n... or a bird I don't\nI don't think it's a terrible ... thanks to hurt anyway or the other thing on that same point while I'm On his\nLast year they the birthright of these illegal aliens are they\nBased on eleven million illegal aliens and now they're saying that almost twenty two million facial let them know you're a picket between three to four hundred thousand for\nAnd the train on the economy for those if you project forward it to point three billion dollars wow when they get what they get the welfare benefits right I think that's the killer yeah and then the second you're lucky there that\nCall before about um the birthright itself\nI saw three different caught a lawyer for programs on TV and they all agree with Trump or there is no right it's like if there's some ... with over here they cannot have a child is told us that it's for the country not ours and um the other thing is the other things but they started a part of the\nSituation I think it's a famous land that point to zero one and they would have been more detail about it and how does he work so that you're under the jurisdiction right and that's what\nPaul running it doesn't get what you call it didn't get the ... if he wants to go on line and looks at the constitution and goes deeper into the amendments you'll see all the different subsection says we'll see how it excludes all those people and I wonder if you've heard of the ... or you know what that is\nI'm Sorry to hear heard what the\nFor who or to you oh you are\nNo I haven't heard about that diverse tore it\nYeah there were reports they happen all the time in this country impact longer rated in New York\nRecently but um yeah someone\nThat Russia trying to say that a lot of different countries and I started Chinese uh got China wants to be talking about it or what they do is they offer these tours up to fifty\nThousand dollars will cost you and that's really ... you want but they have some others that are in you know like sentiments been they are\nAnd what happens is you come over you get a temporary visa to come over there you can have your baby over here you go to this place they take care of the baby\nFor a few maybe one or two and you can ... your own country now that may be unlike the illegal aliens coming across the border they don't grow up in America become part of America they they are and that other countries and people say well why would they do that well because that child before they go\nBack to their country they fight for a passport to get a passport then we go back to them\nAnd that way if you get like China or maybe a bowl of somewhere if something happens over there and you never know what's gonna happen they can use that word out of the country will be on the left car or on a lot of the and then in the same\nLike Bush and I think they can apply to get it fairly over here right\nSo it's a big scandal that goes on and and it happens all the time that they would tell me out of the year on year or that or and they just had a case in New York where it was you know it's a high rise and I definitely hit three Chinese babies\nAnd one of her work than thirty it went up there's not one night and stuff with a knife yourself to the workers coworkers and stuff\nSo if you're so basically if you're pregnant I heard the term birth tourism but not brought up tour so I think it's probably the same thing but um so so if you were pregnant and you can buy into this plan they bring you over here and you stay here until your baby is born and then you go back\nYeah they take care of your well your your baby and then once they get\nCaught then they go back to the [noise]\nWow it's amazing to think about that\nOh you know ... do we know this is bad and we know and that's why Harry Reid spoke out about it back in Nineteen Ninety three uh-huh but the Democrats were so disingenuous in the media so disingenuous in dishonest\nAnd in a you know this is why Trump rails against the media the media knows the stuff of course they yeah and and so they will they'll they're going to rail against Trump Trump's racist trumps the you know this that and the other thing a\nHe's a Xena fold in all of this when they were singing the same tune just a few years ago and um so I mean it is totally outrageous I think that people get it\nAnd I think that people are sick and tired of it and I think that people look at Paul Ryan\nAs Paul Ryan is the swap that's why Paul Ryan is not running for re ... do you know man like Paul Ryan just decided one day gee I Want to stay in a you know raise my children or you know he knew the writing was on the wall that he was going to have a very difficult time being reelected that's why he called it a career\nAnd so yeah he's part of the swamp and in So Paul Ryan comes out you want to let a week before the election and says well the president's wrong you can't do this to try to gin up controversy\nHe never Trump or east part of the the swamp and that's why he's going on in the ... the the Trump supporters have no uh you know loyalty to Paul Ryan Paul Ryan is he's he's found the president all the way\nThe ... million people in other countries want to come here and the worst way are we going to take all their no matter what we are now\nAbsolutely and we we don't have any obligation to do and it's not our obligation to do it\nFor
