supporter I voted for him I Would vote for him again but I totally agree with you have a quality or you can stream lean happy and proud\nThe other night when he at the F ... that will be an investigation and his\nTone and his voice was just perfect I thought well while he's really talking right that time and then last night\nThe weight I and he didn't say anything that wasn't that shows that I just did not think that it was necessary to taught the way he did in the manner the tone that he's broken\nAnd like I I Am a supporter then I'll vote again but sometimes his mouth is just not\nWell let me ask you this because I might have I might have seen it differently and that's why I have a different opinion ... the way that I view did it in terms of you and the caller prior to you or view to a different way um the way that I viewed it used what Trump was saying was more in defense of Kavanaugh\nAnd more of an attack on the Democrats like Patrick Leahy and a Blumenthal Bennett was an attack on her I I didn't read it that way but maybe maybe I saw it wrong maybe I didn't see it the right where\nWell you know and maybe maybe the Enron it it just it just seemed like it was not not necessary\nEspecially because the way he spoke the other night and agreed with the investigation and just talk for like the gentleman and then I don't know I just didn't agree with that either so that'll go online and say\nAll right ... thank you very much and again maybe I'm I'm I'm not seeing it right the way that I saw this thing go down last night was said that Trump was more angry\nAt the treatment of Kavanaugh at the hands of people like Patrick Leahy who has been known to go back I used to cover Leahy of Vermont and I work in there\nAnd uh you know has been ownership back a few to the hypocrisy of of of people like Blumenthal who who lied for what Fifteen Years about being in Vietnam and you never step foot there\nUm and so on and so forth I think that's where he was going he didn't tell any miss truths or or or ... what would Ford testify to but\nI think where he was the point that he was trying to make was I think any way at least the way I view it was that he was trying to say this is what they are hearing this guy we're\nSo I don't know how did you read it how did you see of five ... five hundred to Europe next next hanging on WB assume\nAre you an extra WB is I'm

want to go into an argument and I don't have to find a ship in it\nBut I Would ask for a couple of things to that you might not I don't know about an hour less than I Am not that looks a man I think 'cause they don't but I I only listen to the radio and I was looking at the Sunday paper as a librarian I caught a glimpse ever she looked pretty shook up in that brick trip\nAnd on the stand at times

don't want to miss quote in the press on this because I don't want to be accused of of doing that ex boyfriend and I'm an assistant\nOr she helped a friend or prepare for a polygraph test and I'm\nIn

about being afraid to be in small locations are never talked about being a sexually abused by anybody never talked about\nUm you know her her other fears about needing to rooms or two doors to a room and all of these different things he said when we were dating between Nineteen Ninety five and he was Nineteen Ninety eight um none of this ever came up uh\nAnd he said she he was a weird that I'm a

Kevin accuser\nI didn't see it that way is if it's if I'm wrong please please correct me but I didn't see it\nThat way at all and um I don't know maybe I'm just an insensitive a coup but I didn't see it I I think what Trump did last night was a was attacked\nThe people that were using ... Ford to attack Canada\nI think he was talking about the whole process I I don't think he was attacking her he didn't say anything about her\nAs a as Sanders a Huckabee Sanders said they do everything that he said was right there in the in in in her\nThey didn't take anything out of her testimony he didn't call her name's he didn't he wasn't disrespectful of you know it's it's ... you know the way the media worse this stuff uh but if you watched it live is I did and you saw it differently that's why I Love to hear from you are but the way that I saw it\nYou are in the front let me let me go to I Want to grab another one ... not six o five hundred your next to the w._b. us and good afternoon\nHello hello you're on the air\nYou know let's\nLet me try to clarify something for you but I think you know this already but I'm going to be here with us\nOr the Democrats are trying to get the cap be mature overlook\nThe thought about Kavanaugh's out of the drugs\nNo matter where you're writing a hundred percent right sure\nDo stuff here's here's the thing that really upsets me about you very much for your for your phone your commentator tried to get people to call\nBut the thing is the\nProblem is not a bad guy that a lot of good things for\nBut don't tell me I mean you're already tells you\nDon't sit there and telling me that you watch this yesterday said\nAnd and he's come off as an intelligent president of United States and I both sides of you know but but I did vote for him because I didn't want to be able to go there\nBut the point is we did last this late president of the United states is not come there and\nHe gave up yeah yeah I had to be\nAll right but I I look I stated I've stayed it four times now that I may have misread the situation but the way that I interrupted you what he was saying last night\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is a tough for the national emergency alert system the system was developed by broadcast and cable operators bones or cooperation with the federal emergency management agency the Federal Communications commission in ... to keep you informed India but uh\nThis has been an actual emergency an official message would have on the tone alert you heard it sort of this message is there more wireless emergency alert his message has been sent out to also phones in the nation from cell phones well received a message others will not no action is required\n\nFor him if he said exactly what she said but in the bigger picture he was saying this is what they're going after this guy with and then he went into Blumenthal being a liar and he went into a you know Patrick Leahy being a lush himself\nAnd he went into some of these other Democrats that's why when I saw the whole bigger picture ID and interpreted as an attack on her and so much as it was an attack on them\nAnd the defense of cabinet that's my honest interpretation of what I saw last night\nOkay well I'll give you that as far as that goes yes you're right but I'm Talking about a man who was the president of the United states of America\nWho's defending his Supreme Court nominee that he's trying to get through and and he said hold on any near ... and he's in Mississippi trying to get to Republicans elected to the Senate so I mean it all comes into play right\nYeah it does come into play but what I'm Talking about if you stand there and if you yell and scream out of here I mean the president doesn't do that he's\nThere's other ways to do with the intellectual ways of doing it [noise] and you cannot honestly ... you have to agree with me that this guy is not present that\nGuy I don't agree with that but I Do agree that I Do agree that based on the number because how do you define president you who whose definition do we use the presidential is\nThere's no definition but I'm just saying I mean I I'm a professional this certain times they'll turn around and say well this guy wait boom but when I'm working I don't do that I won't even though I may not like you in a great with you I'm not going to sit there in in in the way things happen in your life\nRight but she I don't think he was that's my point I don't think he was marking her so much as he was mocking them he was talking about lady being lost and he was talking about Blumenthal ties\nSometimes with the way of markets someone where you can just you know get right to the right to the to the the just the thing without the wait how you\nSay you got my point I get your point and and again I I'll say for like the seventh time now what may have seen is wrong I may have interpreted it wrong I may have interpreted around\nRight you're right I'm Talking about the way that it yeah [noise]\nOkay uh like a common guy on the record\nBut that's how we should do\nAnd that's how he is he talks that when you're not a common guy in the street but that's that's ... that he is he's way of communicating he speaks that way yeah okay\nWell I mean look if you look at the most important thing here is that if you weren't offended by it and the other folks that have called in were offended by it that's what matters and what matters is that\nOn he was not connecting with you guys the voters and that a problem that he's got that he's got to fix I didn't see the same way you guys did but you guys did and that's what matters\nWell it's not that I just start different uses you choose to believe the way you believe that's fine you know that's your choice I'm just saying that to be my president you know if that's the way he's got to talk to them\nYou know where to set state of affairs\nThan what you know what the but you you but your point is right on I mean look I'm already convinced I'm going to vote for Trump twenty twenty there's no problem there I think Trump suit a great job but you guys are the guys that he needs to convince and if he's offending you\nThen he's not doing very good job of of of of canoe communicating with you when you guys and so he needs to fix that obviously 'cause he's going to lose if he doesn't\nI I I don't think he's going to be an ex president again\nIf he is you know good luck to pursue\nI'm afraid I appreciate it good to be good discussion I appreciate it I see a little bit differently but that's that's me and I I accept the fact that I Am in the minority in this that most of using a different way already vibe going on six o five hundred Europe next to the w._b. some good afternoon\nAri a you know I see I agree with you on that ... from what I saw a with Trump and people can call them walking a locking her I think he had every right to deal with because basically what he was doing was pointing polite to\nBe a story that she can try bill with all the deep state to bring down Kavanaugh which in a which will effect Trump it's all about getting you know it's all about ruining Trump and ruining anyone that trunk tries to a point and it's all again the deep state and\nPeople just you know they don't like the truth\nAnd I don't understand why they don't like the truth of people who bring to light that he's not presidential where they have the big fat lie or Obama that all he did with the Y. and oh he's going to be so transparent and there was absolutely no transparency\nIn his administration whatsoever basically had appointed a couple of a ... and the CIA and the FBI and you know his father was a communist but that he's presidential because he was a big BS artist\nTrump I Love Trump I Love the fact that he sent to light his dad and he is honest up front totally trans parent and I think he's doing a fantastic job\nBut do you think he was attempting to mock her last night\nI hear what you know everybody gets on your high horse mocking okay the woman was lying if it was lying do I mean do you realize what was done here this was\nThe biggest share this with an absolute national disgrace to have a meal like Kavanaugh who has high credentials be disgraced or a bunch of lies\nWon't use the market right he's been mocked through this whole process\nTrump he's been ... to does everyone go either way oh no one cares when anyone walk strong that's OK\nCabinet and they've been they've been they've been mocking jumping off through the whole thing\nExactly and I am just so totally sick and tired of art um national news network these crappy newspapers the call themselves the newspapers that don't report the news are facts any longer they just report opinion and they have the death in and they have someone like Blumenthal a complete and utter liar\nWho has the you know who's um condemning Trump for what he said so you know I think they need to start investigating some of these centers and Congress people because\nThey have a lot of um ... you know a lot of ah what do I want to say secrets that a hit and then we ... that she'd be exposed to the public\nYeah and they started investigating start investigating him because they're all part of the problem they're part of the deep state in until people realize what is the state is all about\nIt they're not going to realize where all this baloney and all this deception is coming from\nRight and then then that's the point the Trump is trying to make I saw last night was all of these people that are sitting in judgment a cabinet or you know a leaky lazy\nOr who's got a reputation for leaking to the media or who's also got a reputation for being a boozer sitting there you know questioning Kavanaugh about how much he drinks right and Blumenthal talking about the you know whether or not a you know what\nI'm I'm a cabin also honest or not is a guy Who Lied for Fifteen Years about serving in Vietnam and he didn't so I think that was the point that Trump is trying to make home maybe I don't know maybe you should have mentioned her but I I tend to agree with you I mean the Kevin O's being mocked everybody else has been mocked why can't you be ... to\nBarry ... shield up high against the fundamental transformation of America\nIt's changing right they just because he's out does that mean it's over right all the\nSimple minded people running around thinking that Obama was the greatest thing since sliced bread right I've been told the truth never did anything positive for America as\nA whole and but any of the people out there that don't think the only way he taught sticks and stones break my bones big stinking deal right someone on their actions not on their words or the parents you know just it's just for ... maybe I'll send President Trump\nA battery costume and he can go where that around ... and the people that support Trump will laugh and the people that don't support Trump will think it's actually Obama\nYou know I got to be honest with you I've said this before I I you know I enjoy the way Trump's speech because I find it refreshing\nYou know he's on an average person he's speaking like you and I would speak at the bar and having a beer right you know when you're not supposed to have beer anymore right especially if you're a white guy you're not supposed to have their ... yeah yeah that's that's no good but you know maybe maybe a way having something else I don't know but I mean he he's like one of the guys\nYeah you know ... when he says something you know what's on his mind and he's not afraid to say and um I respect that in people when people have something to say I respect the you know hearing what they have to say I really do and then\nYou know that for a dentist in California were accused of sexy is\nI didn't know that they when they when they dug into it she's a liar liar so she's getting busted yeah\nBut it's not going to stop the movement no one's going to stop and say whoa wait a minute this getting out of control because like everybody you know everybody or anybody with a sensible mind knows that these ... and just doing this for the fact that\nWell let me ask you did ... have they overplayed this now because of what's happening here with cabinet or can they pull this routine on somebody else and get away with it now or has he just wanted to get worse\nThey will they will I can guarantee they will and it will yeah you know and the funniest thing is\nYou find all these people all these people are now like the old white man how they're horrible horrible you know suddenly you were younger white guys are eventually God willing I say God willing holy cow I couldn't believe I said that\nOne Mm yeah really on the radio I Am ... gonna be\nAn old white man when he got to pull out some Todd and said oh I I wanted Bernie Sanders oh don't pick on me now shut up you an all white guy obey\nYou know the other part about that house and you don't need you know the funny part about the white guy in the white guy that ah you know it doesn't want to relinquish power think for a second who ran this country for eight of the last ten years\nYeah a young black guy right to do with anything that could have anything I mean don't confuse people with the fact of the old angry white guys don't want to relinquish power look in the last ten years you had a young black guy running the country not an angry old white guy so [laughter] you know what the hell that she has other than\nThat of the short term memory long term memory they have no memory yeah who is it goes and it goes out\nRight yeah Brock Obama was elected to germs black guy young guy I didn't look like a an angry old white guy to me thanks my friend for the call I appreciate it by the way none of six o five hundred you're up next the w._b. assembled afternoon\nGoing after him hey I just I'm just\nWondering why they do give people a polygraph test um because\nIt's not admissible um is what the person believes it doesn't necessarily mean\nWhat happened and I'm really surprised that even mentioned that and and Kavanaugh said that\nWhen they gave her a polygraph test than the Democrats were hounding about it he says it started miserable so why even bring it up for a it makes no sense um uh so I I don't I don't know are there that the grasping at straws and um I mean if they want to do or what the ah\nWhy would they did with this fight and stuff like that they injected them with that Sarah Mm Mm hum and that that that made you tell the truth\nSodium ... All right so that uh maybe uh maybe she's willing to do I have to take that but um let's see I'm I'm\nAt this you know what it at this point I think unless they can come back they lost the FBI comes back with a report today that has a witness that has a you know people at this point they can do they're going to I don't even want to hear any more about it she energy and she came forward on her own\nI'm In and her friends through under the bus but I mean she came forward and and she offered up a story now the story had no details at all in terms of aware how you know none of that stuff and if if he gets confirmed or the Supreme Court because your story and a lot of holes in it well you know that's nobody's fault but hers\nAbsolutely so I mean I Know at this point I'm not even interested in detector test or whatever she's given her story she said the entire media court on her side she said all of the Democrats on her side what do we do we do at this point\nWell the point can be taking that at Monday past the lie detector test sure so and so in my world that means\nYou think people can actually or take a lie detector\nTest and and and proof positive that uh what what was in their mind is again not reality but something that\nWell the short tests can be manipulated I mean even examples um I ... I had a heart attack about eight years ago I was diagnosed as a as a diabetic as a result of that very very mild diabetic rights so they gave me I don't do it anymore but they gave me this you know going to put your finger everyday and in someone who spoke with the ... would you\nAnd you've got to keep track of another I stopped after two weeks and I can't live this way you're going to happen in the uh you know the the bill and blood level was so low anyway\nUm but I learned how to manipulate that test every day I manipulated it so I took it as the right time I hit the right foods before and waited and have the other foods that you can manipulate a test why I'm told that if you cry while you're taking a polygraph test that works in your favor I'm certainly as\nThey because they're showing emotion yeah and and and some people can\nPass it because uh actors and actresses um some half time have taken probably graphic because they're so good at what\nThey do that come in if you're like ... and again it's not the whole thing is it's it's not\nAdmissible in court right why why break it up you know what I'm saying yeah I Do it it it's not it's\nNot relevant yet yet they did they say she passed the test well yes you pass the test because\nThey were really knows for separate questions to ask her that that that she no I mean they they invaded I don't think it gave all the questions they asked her but\nUm she was very vague um and again they they were um you know trade gun questions that I Would have been interested in that if the Republicans have said they were let's\nLet's get or battery of questions and say what would happen\nWhether she would have passed and not so again it it it's just a big joke it really it is a big joke it's a\nBig waste of time um but it's a I Am sure though the networks are making some super money because\nUh that's what they like they like absolutely like\n... they like controversy and I'm sure their their stocks went up and I'm at the cost of a of a nice individual who who um you know hopefully this will all be in a\nBig profit off of people's misery no matter what it is whether it's race riots in Baltimore whether it's this kind of thing you know watching Kavanaugh as family or destroyed in public these people in the media profit off of people's misery and and you think about bad right five away not nesting so five hundred Europe next unable to be some good afternoon\nAt ... hey hey are\nYou doing real good show the mad though I think you'll you'll handle that conversation with him very judiciously or even handedly yeah you get to you get to some extent or what you want on um [noise] I wasn't the question you gave him to Elizabeth Warren and wonder she brought home and unfettered\nA boy [noise] somebody's clever and she is\nHe seems to be trucked wrestling with that one I think the best to get off the centrally was well it some stuff that you just don't know about\nRight yeah\nAnd why don't we know about it because politicians when they do things for you they send out press releases to tell you about everything\n[laughter] they grow all animal until late in life yeah yeah [noise]\nWell I mean you know I I Can't get over the ... you know the fact that um [noise] the mayor the city New Bedford who I happen to like I like John Mitchell on a personal level I think it's a good guy\nI think he's a good guy is a good dad I think he's done a good job I mean you look at the city New Bedford there's no way to argue that John Mitchell has been done a good job many fight he said well like fight in Washington alone sometimes I I Know he does he goes to Washington right through the city all the time and the reason he does that is\nAnd I don't have the congressional eh just a delegation doing that but I Wish that he would not be so partisan as to defend somebody who has done nothing for this city I Wish he would say you know look you write she hasn't done anything with the city why not give the other guy a chance to see what he can do\nThese probably looking at the end game and all when he retired from office which you know the little way down the road them not entirely FAA no to the good old and girls and the Democratic party and they get taken care of our time", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "03"}
