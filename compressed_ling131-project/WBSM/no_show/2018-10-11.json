duty detail is talking about or whether it's do you remember Tim although the way the guy was over there\n[noise] no I have no I Can't remember when I was yeah I remember being on there once uh yeah that was [laughter]\nAnd that's the efforts worth it and um you know if you have a job in which you can say that say that about um you know you probably the probably a pretty happy person\nBut there was a time in your in your career and a lot of people in your career say hey you know what I think I feel like a cheap one I can do here salmon little on to something different maybe give somebody else a chance to step in and\nThen that dry their hand added this this Washington interest you at all is that something you'd be I mean that's an nutty places that someplace you'd feel interest you know I used to I used to live\nThere and I worked at the Justice Department there I like the city I still I mean I still go back there for business reasons all the time and you know some of these families on in Washington is as well so I go I Do go down there I like Washington um but\nYou know a big New Bedford call me crazy but I Know it's you know we've I've been blessed\nAs a public official to have been able to attract a lot of really talented people to my administration and everybody's on the same page to run it gets up in the morning says how can we make this place better I mean that they've really work hard and people are really determined to\nTo do that and it's not easy I mean there's it's never been easy but we're we're really into it once\nYou've been an executive I Would imagine that it's difficult to move into a position like say in the house of representatives or I yeah\nI think a lot of folks you know I'm you know I Know I've known some errors who've run\n'em for Congress um and I've said she's am can't get anything done right now Michael cap you aren't we just lost that race in Boston I was a good example in front of what the mayor of Phoenix Greg Stanton who is running\nFor Congress now people have said why would you do that during the mayor of Phoenix Phoenix is like the Phoenix metro areas like the sixth largest in the country why would you go for a congressional seat\nI I think it's a fair question to ask 'em you know hopefully at some point Congress will change for the good for a photograph of all of us right and actually you know actually start getting more done\nUm you know my job my position my ... the office I occupy has a great deal of institutional already more than most marriages are it's a strong mare model of government rights on the as opposed to like the mayor of\nWest or or Cambridge ... or a number of other cities around the around the country that where the marriage just short of a figurehead right and and and in some cases just elected as\nI have a city council you know I'm I have in what's called a plan B form of government or a good deal of time administrate of authority and then you layer on top of that in Massachusetts\nThe mares strong measures are also happened to be the chairs of the\nSchool committee you know around the country only seven percent of marriages have any formal authority over their school district so that's kind of rare and then you know most marriages don't have control over how much water um uh utilities we do here right so the man does here and then\nYou know I'm also the the chair of the the Port Authority of the largest commercial fishing port in the United states so there is a great deal of institutional authority um yeah and the office of mayor of New Bedford and so it is I say to people\nYou know want to know what's what's appealing about it and ... that's the part of that has to be part of the answer you if you know if you've got to build you if you build a good team around you\nThat position has the institutional authority to allow you to get a lot done and so and I think the groups in the building we've been able to get a lot of stuff done that and you know difficult over the years for others to done and I'm you know there's something very attractive to me about you know just keeping out to work so it's not that is not an announcement\nSo is this just a just they were told to just between the two of us yeah but I Do yeah yeah yes yeah yeah yeah just\nBetween us um so anyway it's it's just something to say that his way of saying that I find a job gratifying it's not easy it's not fun all the time but it is it as crowded\nLike you're facing an interesting decision here because not only are you looking at whether or not you want to do and now they're hatch but that next pitch wouldn't be just simply two years he'd be committing to four years I ... I suppose that changes the dynamics right when you say through here\nUm\nI yeah I suppose um I suppose it does um you know you want that for your turn to go well because it's going to set the tone for future for your terms\nUm you know I I so yeah I mean it's not for me\nSo part of the things that they are all sorts of considerations including you know where my when my kids are doing and then I'll walk them and I think people know you know my wife is is you know has a you know the tremendous career and her own right and but it's sixty miles away in Boston when she's not you know flying so like [laughter]\nLike this weight she spent the last six days in a speaking at a conference in Switzerland and she goes to the AC on Saturday and then she goes to New York next week and then take us when it goes to Chicago after that and then just a new system this month or six trips right so I mean just to give you a window to rest and this is why like\nYou know got three kids in ... in school and one going to their games and all that stuff so\nYou know it's a little bit of a frenetic pace but um\nMy family is that the the middle of these decisions I don't bring it up all the time but\nUm you know so that that factors in as well\nBut you know in a business like yours there are certain windows that are opening claws and and I started this conversation by talking about Ed Markey and nobody knows what Ed Markey has got to do but there is a rumor that he's not going to seek re election in two years that's a window that opens now every six years I'm\nNot only does it open every six years but I mean this may be the first time that seat opens without any common yeah for a long on on the other things that you got to consider right I mean you gotta you gotta know when did jumping and opportunity and whether you're truly interested in and that's why I asked if he'd be interested in that particular position or at least giving it some thought\nYeah I don't know I mean I I'd be surprised if he retired anyway I think there was a there are those rumors but you know and I think he's you know he's up in age because you know this is about Seventy or so um but he's he's pretty much all he's done his entire adult\nLife and then you know why they have to go to a climate where he was uh maybe about Thirty years old or\nSo you know he's been he's been doing that thing for a while and um you know I'd be surprised if you just sort of stepped away\nWhat do you have any interest in being governor I mean there's an executive position right we don't have term limits your like they'd rather have a governor\nFrom ah from New of Massachusetts from New Bedford since the Eighteenth fifties a it was a that was governor Clifford you know from that you know it's even researching this no I it's a pretty well no that's that's a that's a known fact well I mean we haven't had\nWe haven't had any by so I think the last attorney general from New Bedford was I think he was one of the prosecutors on the Lizzie Borden case so that was right around the turn of the last century the last congressman from New Bedford was a guy named John Walsh\nWho lived on ... street he retired he stepped away from his congressional seat Nineteen twenty two to become a ... Massachusetts superior court judge which I don't think anybody these days which she would consider to be a promotion but um but yeah so we have in there hasn't been a congressman from\nNew Bedford since I guess it's been Ninety six years it's been a long time so\nThere was some few of your listeners who do we do in our schools I don't I don't know shouldn't we civics yeah I mean we need more civic center schools and if that's what you're asking\nYeah yeah well the New Bedford history you know people understand these I think there should\nThere's there is a role for more New Bedford history and our school system I think there was absolutely you know we tend to focus on wailing as we should just local history but there's a lot more than ... than than that\nI take a few calls sure got a whole bunch of people that are waiting there someone would do that and then we'll take a break 'em and we'll talk about some other stuff is well find a way not to excel five hundred let's go to the phones and now you are first of the mayor good afternoon\nGood out they don't I got some good news for you guys don't help the man juggle that memory of his [laughter] yes ...

there that I'm gonna hang up and less what seems to become a like a sanctuary city is the ... what's your thoughts on that like it\nWhen that's when we haven't had that was used to just don't want to ever so he's got a lot yeah yeah\nUm no it's well I'll just repeat what we've said in the past and we want to people for a new show which is you know we're not declared you bet for it to be a so called ...\nDoes you know we have not declared New Bedford to be a so called sanctuary city um you know I was that that's that term doesn't appear in the federal and the U.S code and there was there any generally accepted um\nDefinition um and\nAnd my feeling is that there are other ways to convey to people that New Bedford is a welcoming place for immigrants for any for anybody or that we're very open community without seizing on a label that's charged and just causes division and so that's the way we've done it and I think a lot of cities that\nDeclared themselves to be a sanctuary city that embrace that way of ... are starting to regret doing that now not because of you know an influx of immigrants but because it just ended up\nYou know I'm intensifying an already tense conversation or we just as you know to my mind you know at that didn't make it didn't make sense just you know to go with the herd of cities that were heading in that direction you know we we do our own thing in New Bedford we're ... we're a welcoming place\nWe have a great track record the support that and will continue to be there to have that sensibility and without having to embrace him label\nSo we don't we don't\nDeclare ourselves sufficiently an overly as a sanctuary city but there are there are illegal immigrants who are resigning here in those amongst the photos you're welcoming to the city\nIs there are undocumented or legal immigrants whenever you want to call them in every city in America there are some twelve million illegal immigrants in the United states they live they live everywhere their kids go to public school and ... in every city in Maryland and say you know almost in every city in the in the country\nAnd you know it's high time for Congress to\nActually get down to the business of of um\nComing up with some sensible immigration reform so that we can give people some clarity about where they stand\nEither illegals being employed in the city you know you can employ them ride minutes employed by the city got 'em out by the city but in the city\nOh I'm sure yeah I'm I'm sure there are better at it as I said not just in this city but in every city in the United states to there were people you know without immigration status who are\nLiving you know in the so called shadows who you know a on a part of the you know the cashier economy in in in America and it makes it hard for them to um\nYou know to to make the most of their lives ah I happen to think that there there can be a compromise in Congress that\nEstablishes better border security 'cause it's hard to frankly you know to be against better ... a border security and the main building up Fifteen billion dollar wall but you know there's there is to something be said for better security along the southern border while at the same time you know are you creating\nYou know easier opportunities for people to become citizens who've been here for a long time you know\nYou know who are American in every respect but\nYou know uh you know who wouldn't dare go to um\nIce officers immigration officers to start the citizenship process because of the fear of being arrested right on the spot that's a barrier to citizenship and in my view and then we have to have to deal with it\nAre they going to be strictly because we're out of time I I don't run public housing and soon and that's the housing authority for for starters but um yeah I mean what's what's the alternative um\nHere we are New Bedford you were an unwelcome in place you can pick and choose who we are we want to women I mean come on it's not it doesn't make any sense of legal versus illegal this is a big fan and I and that is a federal issue Mary and the federal government's gonna go six\nAre just very quickly October fest

comments delete Facebook said first grade\nAnd I'm here at home on his own at Johns I had a drought going back in the ad and I wanted them one by one and I find that when you\nBack to the\nProgram and his two O. seven on a Thursday Afternoon and we got some heavy rain coming in Kanye West and the president speaking about prison reform\nOver lunch at the White House and lots of other issues too affecting the the black community is amazing when you talk to people about Kanye West the number of people who say I'm immediately the cutting us doesn't\nCare about any of these issues like they know what's in his heart in what's in his brain right he doesn't care about any of this ... this is just this is just the Kanye West working for attention\nWhy do they do that when when when I'm I'm\nTaylor Swift can go out there and make a political statement or any of these other celebrities go out and make up a little I stayed there legitimate honest people hardworking thinking people that are fighting for the betterment of the country but Kanye West comes out and say something and I'm\nNow he doesn't care about any of this he's got mental issues he's gotten drug problems she's got a you know um\nBy the way Trump has filed or or maybe it hasn't been filed yeah but it's going to be vital to spoil a bipartisan bill\n\nPrison reform and um\nBecause minorities in this country are incarcerated at a much greater rate than\nNon minorities\nAnd so this is an issue that everybody in every side of the aisle admits his is a problem but you know here's here's one really totally piss me off is the Kanye West do something that none of these other people have the guts to do now calling ...\nYou know they've done it almost every one of them yeah they make them look like fools\nSure but just think of how ridiculous it is that you got to somebody like Kanye West that is being thrown under the bus by people in his own community or because he's breaking ranks with them and you don't have a single thought of your own um you know because if you were going to throw you under the bus and we're going to claim the token negro and not just that need to call you stupid noon and everything else\nAppreciate your call my friends thank you fight going on there to show five hundred you're up next the w._b. assembled afternoon\nAnd going up the pneumonia hey you know and I missed the baseball\nYeah [laughter] absolutely getting ready for Saturday Night\nYeah I'm I was going to do as well you don't want to you don't want to move on and on it you know what I mean\nYou're going to give me the what the\n... oh you do\n[noise] or national didn't hear that word I'm Sorry or you want to say you want to you on a speaker phone yeah yeah that's what it is you sound like you're in a speaker phone in your words are not a ... can you get off the speaker phone any chance to do and then yeah I got it okay\nWell yes speaker phone doesn't always sound good some sometimes it sounds like you're in a tuna can under the ocean when you're in a speaker phone hey go much better\nWay I'm I'm One of the big between New England patriots and um Kansas and and I'm going to give you the they used to them ...\nOkay what do you think's gonna win patriots going to win by how much\nPain to the little one by twenty\nPage is gonna win by twenty Kansas City I understand is is is is I you know I haven't followed football all that closely this year yet I'm In Kansas City doing pretty well the one thing at this point you\nKnow that's what they said well the last week that they killed them\nYeah next to this is true so what about the red Sox in the in the in Houston what do you think's going to happen there\nWell that's a I got a new ... they're not but I was delivered 'cause I don't go out on the ...\n[laughter] I think the red Sox are going to win but he's probably going to take about six games what do you think\nI think the goal seven seven as long as they don't go to the medical relief pitchers okay yeah they they see and the third on the opinion that they got to change that but\nI understand David Price is going to pitch now there'll be somebody had reported that he was going to pitch out of the bullpen and I guess she's going to start game to\nAn all let me tell you something that they they take them and they they ... I went to a good idea to to you know bring them out on the ball and you know why because he has experience\nYeah Oh absolutely and you know what I'm if if we can get the David Price the pitch the second half of the season out there in game ... will have a chance to win that game\nYeah as long as you don't miss up like you let the last night\nYeah you know a lot of these guys are under tremendous amount of pressure on there's a lot of nerves involved to win a you gotta ... factor that in and I think that was the thing with a Kimball Kimball the other night to oh I'm In a situation like that but I think the ... around her role we'll see where it goes pretty she had to my friend is always going to hold you there and your next and WBAI some good afternoon\nHello you're on the air yet how you doing good how are you oh good I Want to talk about\n... yeah and just the expression and kind of role in shaping the economy a little bit I'm not a fan but uh I think uh it's pretty you know it's great that he's going up and doing that with the the President Trump and the\nAnd all that stuff and I think his objective I don't know if he's highly since the uh you'd like solve it kind of like all the attention around him yeah he's an egomaniac like his life for the uh the\n... he's an ego maniac like Trump right\nYeah yeah you go [laughter] and then his ego there you're so they cut from the same cloth so maybe that's what brings them together who knows\nBut you know what somebody suggested to me early that this is all about drawing attention to himself to kind of just looking for attention you know what we've got a national dialogue going on now about some of these issues prison reform and everything else because Kanye West than Trump sat down at the table so if that's\nThe most we get out of this meeting at least we made some progress what are we getting out of Colin Kaepernick kneeling not agree\nWith this now agreed with this and I notice they're not showing it on TV the kneeling they're cutting cutting that off the TV [laughter] yeah you know that lately too which is good but I'm not going back to ... says ran in the in the past and that's kind of\nCrowd he brought this respect on him and uh but you know whatever he's\nDoing these doing like his his wife there comes a dashing that that\nWoman out of the weather was a drug charge on her and yeah that's a good thing and uh yeah I don't know that kind of what what do you have to say about ... you know\nAgain I'd never been a ... fan\nDon't have this music or there's like the last caller or the two callers ago the first time I was ever even exposed the ... was the nights\nThat's fun go for that that brings us back even further back than what we were before Trump took over\n... on ... on these people at a crime novel from not knowing anything from they're going to be in a shirt or America you know their brain wash thank you\nAppreciate it thank you very much you know I I just I sit here in total disbelief sometimes of what I'm hearing and what I'm reading from people and you know it is absolutely absurd for anybody to suggest that Kanye West um is\n\nAnything but\nTrying to uh trying to help if you want to see the cutting he was looking for attention okay fine that's fine you know what um what about mine was a Cain wasn't even looking for attention to\nOf course he was\nMine was a king had cause he had I Believe he had a message but he was looking for attention for that message because nobody knew he wouldn't delivering the message what good is it\nOf course ... looking for attention\nOtherwise you just call Trump on the telephone you wouldn't know about nobody would know about it of course he's looking for attention he's trying to smart up some damn people like to have more on lemon on CNN who's got it made by the way you know so funny that people there are some people you you grow up with in the neighborhood and they go on and they make it you never see him come back to the neighborhood Delia\nThey stopped caring once they've made it\n\nWhy even bothering people that that um Kanye West is is is trying to do something even if you just drawing attention to the issues again look Colin Kaepernick\nI Would I Would back Colin Kaepernick took a wall if Colin Kaepernick would say you know what okay we've nailed we've got your attention now I Want a meeting with President Trump and I want that meaning in downtown Chicago\nAnd I want to talk to them about these issues out and talk to them about you know prison reform understanding\nOf respect for him but he won't do that and when you got the president inviting the Philadelphia Eagles to the or to the to the White House perfect opportunity to sit down and talk to the president about the issue is what were you need about nice chance to talk to the president about it\nYou don't have to love Trump you don't have to love anything just you'll you'll have an opportunity to finally be the one to face to face with the president say Mr President these are the issues that we need to address and by the way I'm willing to sit down and work with you\nYou try and find some solutions they won't do that they won't do that\nYou won't see Don Lemon looking to go meet with the president to talk about issues he'll sit there and ridicule Kanye West\nFor trying to do it what are you afraid of what is it exactly that they're afraid of with Kanye West west isn't out there claiming to represent the black community not like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have claimed to do\nYou know when there's a shooting or there's some kind of a problem in the black community in Baltimore or or you know someplace like that Al Sharpton goes down they're claiming to be a representative of the black community I'm here speaking for the black community well who they are made you chief\nWho selected you I don't remember there being any balloting kind of watch this and trying to do that no one has he ever even send that\n\nCan't believe that even sitting here defending Kanye West that everyone a million years thought I was but here's somebody who is trying to make a difference through his actions not by kneeling and silence and resist\nYou can meet meet him over if you ask my opinion will come right back for your call\nI really really rely on\nYou know frozen in the first attempted to develop

folks that don't have a lot of education and this and that and then they can they're making very good money and not one person I haven't heard too many people say oh well then this could be a great idea\nAnd it's not my idea but I saw it on sixty minutes and then they can they're making millions of dollars\nOn how the tax paying what I don't hear anyone not not any one I've heard a lot of people say it's a good idea but I don't see anybody doing anything\nRight yeah well I mean there there are a lot of\nThings that we could do to uh to improve the prison system in and re entry back into society after that but you got to sit down and you get to have a conversation about it right for\nAll that I mean on one that will cause conversation I don't care what to do with Jesus per the bottom line is I think to myself that is a great idea that Arabs people because when they come out and they they have a wreck it told me how hot is going to be for them to get a job even at Burger King\nYeah no you're right it's absolutely you're absolutely correct that is very difficult for people who have or a prison record to come out in that\nAnd get straight back in society again is very difficult to reintegrate people in society you know I think a lot of the most and we see in prison today probably shouldn't even be in prison should be in some other type of a situation um [noise] yeah I agree\nThat the one thing about a hundred percent I feel the same way and we don't make changes I I Do see a lot of some changes if we don't come together as people and try to help the folks that are coming out of print and they're not going back some selling drugs and they're going to find a way to make a living\nThat said that your your one hundred percent right ... thank you very much energy issues absolutely a hundred percent right if we don't ah reintegrate people into society and the proper way they they are they going to repeat their behavior and uh they're gonna wind up back where they were um so certainly these are the things that need to be discussed\nAnd that's even more of a reason why it's ludicrous for\nUm people to criticize somebody who's sitting there trying to make a difference and trying to make a change and I I just you know what I have a difficult time", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "11"}
