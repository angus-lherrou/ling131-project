I I think probably Geoff Diehl her Republican opponent in that this November ... election was the least\nLikely to be surprised he's been calling for her for a while to sign a pledge to say hey look if I'm elected I'm going to serve out my full six year term because I think Jeff suspected this\nAnd thought that it was going to happen as well and here we are even the the Boston Herald today with an editorial saying look this is not fair to the voters are for you to get re elected on November ... if you do by the way um and then they'll November seventh throughout their job hunting again right so what Jeff deal is with us on the line right now\nPress conferences in the greater New Bedford area and are just so you're not surprised by Louis warrants announcement or you\nKnow very we've been saying this for the better part of the year the fact is she sent 'em you know over a quarter million dollars to state parties around the country a Democratic Party is trying to grease the skids for a presidential run she promised New Bedford she would send a staffer to work on the ground fishing sector nine issues that staffer never materialized as we learn from the\nThe fishing industry folks and then she ended up sending to reverse average to New Hampshire to work for the Democratic party up there to prep for a presidential run so we've known for a long time her focus has been off Massachusetts and it really\nTruthfully if you look at her voting record and um the lack of accomplishments first date she's never been focused on Massachusetts and now you know I guess the fact that she's been misleading\nPeople in our state for so long seeing she wasn't going to run for president ah I I it it just it goes along with her character but at the same time\nWe deserve someone who's going to be done in Washington focused on us and magic and if you owned a business and you hired somebody and they told you that if they got the job they're going to immediately and they want to start looking for another job you would never hire that person and so that's why I'm saying now at this point I think it was a good one\nThe best way to keep ... Warren out of the White House in twenty twenty is to defeat her here in November and we have an opportunity to do this regardless of what the poll say the ... say the drop was going to lose\nAnd they said that Hillary Clinton was going to win right and we have every reason to believe that the same thing could happen here if only people got out and voted you can't say she's going to win anyway I'm going to stay home the old\nYou win an election is if you get your voters out right if you go out and vote and more Geoff Diehl supporters go out to vote band Elizabeth Warren voters go out to both and guess who wins the election whoever churns devoted out wins the election\nSo there's every reason to the world to believe that we have the ability to make history here particularly since this woman now tells us that if she was elected on November ... she is going to start job hunting the November seventh\nWhy would you want to give your vote somebody who tells you that they're really not that interested in the job they wanted another job\nI just don't get that I'm All right Elizabeth Warren's phone number in Boston if you want to coal is with Warren and tell her\nThat she needs to

that was actually a charted song back in Nineteen sixty two is called the Alvin twist another twist came out in Nineteen\nSixty one and by Nineteen sixty two everybody had a twist song I just about anybody you can think of had a song with a name with the word choice than the name\nOf because the twist it was so popular he had the ... let's twist the game than just the everything just there no matter what the name of the song was just out of the word twist to it and everybody was twist than like crazy back then\nAnd they were also during the mashed potato back in Nineteen sixty to remember that and how about the Freddie anybody remember the friday yeah all those wonderful dance route [laughter]\nTeams from back in the early sixties Nineteen sixty do that's the Alvin twist\nWithout even and the chipmunks and David Seville\nAnd again I Apologize for that I should not have done that or I should have given you some warning anyway before I did that right you are a lot of things going on we've got a lot of information on the um\nUh on the confirmation of a cabinet oh we've got to lose Warren in the editorial in the Boston Herald today a calling on are basically to a a kind of ... I\nYou know how about all this talk about or angry white men anybody getting sick of bang being an angry white man you're getting sick of this apparently a white men are being attacked not apparently they are all white guys being attacked\nIsn't racism racism\nWhere we're angry white men or a bunch of old white men on the Senate did a Judiciary Committee um\nIsn't that racism\nOr we're not being kind of segregated and picked out and and uh picked on because we're white guys\nIsn't that racism\nI kinda think it is but you know what the white man vote is really pissed off right now and you know what they're not pitch the judge Kavanaugh they're not\nPiss that Donald Trump they are really really pissed off at the Democrats find a way not in that six o five hundred Europe next to the w._b. is some good afternoon\nMary how're you doing pretty good how are you sir\nWell out of supporting shaver that race I'm Wondering is that they invite him to the debate\n[noise] probably not he's got like about a I think the last poll I saw was a three to five percent and they generally don't unless you've got a you know a fairly good\nWhether they invite the guy even though he's qualified to run for the office from could possibly win the seat\n... there's no way he can win a seat I mean he's got he's got maybe three to five percent in ... and that's that's being generous in the latest polls that I've seen a\nShow the criteria is the polling done\nWhile the criteria and the criteria is the criteria is whether somebody is considered to be what they call a viable candidate\nNow who makes the decision about whether you're a viable candidate um it's not my call it's up to the people who are organized to debate whether all OK okay that that's OK so whoever whoever puts the debate you remember you remember of course you remember back in two thousand sixteen to presidential debate on the Republican side there were so many candidates I knew or Seventeen\nThey couldn't fit them all on stage they had to have two different sets of debates right um and they put on a viable candidates on Wednesday Janine not viable candidates on the other states but they made the decision that the sponsors of the debates\nAre easy if I lose your logic on on the Elizabeth Warren running for president guts you should give up her seat in the same thing like that lifted deal given up his seat since he's trying to run for Senate\nBut he's not seeking reelection\n... what do you mean he just won an election\nIf he knew he was going to run for the Senate why would why don't you give up that seat\n[noise] um Bush there was a house up in this past November last year or is it this year I think it's this year isn't it\nAh this coming election\nYeah he's not on the ballot to my knowledge not in the balance it out yeah he's not on the ballot this year or\nSo and so that gives more credence to it yeah I I honestly you know I listened to see ... and uh on your station and Chris out I'm On the guy was amazing I mean the only one that really address\nThe fishing industry you know whether the law and out of address and Jeff deal has addressed that he's done a cursory review of the people got right down to the nitty gritty I like the guy I I think you know this is the guy that that wrote the programming a flaw or email\nAnd when he was fourteen years old and he's got a bunch of companies are very wealthy a and it doesn't have the political baggage that are at a folks have to I I Would hope you know at some point or the media would give them a shot during the debates because I think he can hold zone\nYeah he's yeah and it's kinda late anyway I mean he's is absolutely no way he can catch at this point um but why do you think it is that he didn't catch\nWell he started out there trying to become a part of the Republican Party and and uh they shut 'em out whenever convention they have up there uh in terms because there was a child you brought up against the networks are false charge\nA domestic violence charge that was proven not guilty right uh and from that point you switch from the Republican Party to independent and uh you know he's the one that goes around with a bus I'm rarely\nBe sure yeah and it's kind of thing yeah I said I'm looking forward to that we spend\nA spending some money I mean I wouldn't count this guy out I mean this guy may be trying to time this thing so that\nUh his well we'll we'll help you get the notoriety that that it needs but if you listen to him the guy is very good I mean and and and I you know I leave for the left but this guy was like\nOkay this is the way it is and uh and why you is that what you honestly think he's got a shot yeah I Do\nI Do wish to support going to come from I mean why does that mean it's just Massachusetts is liberal Massachusetts and do a large degree people here votes um you know based on who to parents voting for so yeah who wants to make\nYou've never really saw when you get the the message out that that wasn't being reported in the newspaper or be do you remember he was a big guy fifty dollar bills ... and he used to write the messages on those on those bills would ever printed out\nHow I found out with with uh my city cable he loved it\nYeah yeah absolutely yeah I'm sure didn't they loved it yeah\nThe thing about Warren don't help deal out because there are a lot of people\nThat I Am not serious I got my nose to the ground I don't pay attention to what a half a dozen of people that have something in it for themselves say like like elected officials and so forth\nUm ... ... he got beat tiring because\n'cause there are all these years that\nThere's two things that I you know and I'm not a a professional but I Do know since I was a kid that elected officials are because they have the book vote bad weather and the low voter turnout that was a low voter turnout\nAnd he lost right that this was a bigger when there are people think because he had his book well he didn't have to come out and and ... and a and a campaign to watch he figured it was the same as it is the thing\nThat's that's right that that that's a good point I mean any time in a thirty year incumbent gets defeated in a primary exactly I'm In is is not only defeated but he's blind sided yep\nThat is a big win in and I'm not looking one show I'm not looking to take away anything from the the young man Hendricks who defeated him because he ran one hell of a campaign you take out somebody who is one forever ... virtually no opposition and you knock him out in the primary that's quite an accomplishment and then\nThat's that's one of the reasons why I'm always respected Sean ... taunted because she took Jim say you're going out\nAnd Jim Sagan was a you know one of the most infringe Democrats out there and then she took him out in in a shocker and the same thing with interesting he took out a a a guy who is entrenched for years and down in defeat him in a primary she got to give him right now is a big when\nIt was a big a window into people realize that this is an anti incumbent or a year and people people they're listening to talk to half a dozen people and and it's always been that way but I listen to people all over\nAnd you know and they all turn around and say the majority of them that I talked to some of them say that I cited some or all in the like I said from the oil heirs and so forth that that that that are involved with these campaigns and all that oh yeah there is Warren but\nThe ... the average Joe and Abbott's Larry out there that I talked\nTo a lot of them even turn around and say that there's going to be a big surprise because the the the ...\nIt this way ... here\nWell I Hope you're right and ... and I saw that coming out in the presidential race and I'm\nI'm feeling optimistic like you are as well and that will just have to see how it goes I appreciate my friend let me hold you there because some breaking news in just a short time ago I told you about\nA couple of packages are being received at the Pentagon with what is suspected to be rice and and now we've got breaking news that uh two people have been hospitalized after being exposed to white powdery substance that Senator Ted Cruz his office in Houston alright so something's going on here\nAnd um you know this is go within this is getting out of control people a rice and apparently to the Pentagon and now to people hospitalized Ted Cruz's office in Houston after being exposed to a white powdery substance there\nAnd we'll keep watching it for you will bring you what we know as a as it comes in but that's a new just breaking right here at fourteen twenty WBAI Sam find a way not not six o five hundred you're next on WB assembled afternoon or\nGood afternoon high biggest political upset in New Bedford politics as far as I'm concerned Chris ... beating Bob ... okay yeah I don't the only one I can think of going back as far as I can and I'm your age\nWould be maybe John Maki ... in charge Rogers for mayor in Seventy two\nMm well Roger said a lot of problems I mean he had no forget he had the riots and ah he had he was doing a lot of spending a lot of people were were upset with them about that but um\nI I you know the more I think about ... what what you just said and what the last caller said about the uh the cars zero thing I I think it was bigger probably the most people realize that I mean you take a ... you take an entrenched politician who's been in for Thirty years and you beat him in a primary yeah that's very very significant\nTrain was ... and Bob got blind sided he never saw the momentum that this kid\nPicked up and move with the kid went door to door yep three times in New Bedford end up pushing it and a half for the vote right no one has ever\nOn that they'll go ... should do it maybe once maybe do a ... foot drop wants to go and knock on your door three towns\nIncredible amount of steam that kid picked up and took off with Bob ... common and shocked the new political she\nI didn't bother you know I said this to a a I think Tom Kennedy earlier I think that Bob cars zero was looking for two more years\nThe legislature you have to pay raise last year and he's thinking if what if you know if I can get two more years in that will be three years I Would get my pension based on the new a pay raise 'em and then I can be sweet I can settle down and and not worry about a thing and I really don't think he expected\nAny real problem getting elected I think he thought he was gonna win pretty handily\n... absolutely wanted one more time yeah there was no doubt about it\nAnd I think he thought he had it in the bag and he really didn't try hard enough\nYou know that ... back to bite him that well that's it and I that's just proof right there the maybe the voters did the right thing now I have some questions about Chris uh\nUh Hendricks I'm a ... own agenda and I'll be honest with you I've been in touch with him trying to contact him for\nI don't know how many weeks now since the election to try to get them on the air and uh we go long periods where he doesn't respond to my emails so when he does respond he's like okay well set something up and I'll come in a but I've not been able to uh really uh get him to commit to anything at this point and I would love to have them come in because this is ...\nAnd then killed off a Goliath and he he you know I I think the public would like to hear from them\nWhile I'll end with this I'll ... I'll\nLet them know what you're told me we'll try to get them in there for you the thing is right now I Know that he is an attorney obviously yeah and he is trying to download his caseload before he steps in office\nSure which is understandable than there\nHas been extremely busy with his regular job that he has at this time\nSure no I get that I'm not looking for an hour and commence in the studio take some calls um you know he's somebody who did accomplish quite a feat with his with his win and I think the public would like to know a little bit more about him have a great\nDay actually called my friend ... six o five hundred so if you want to watch out to Elizabeth Warren I'm I'm asking folks to a call is Warren and and and ask her a first of all to vote for judge Kavanaugh\nI'm In

somebody for do we elect somebody who's to say I'm Sorry what you what you would you know what what you want doesn't matter or are they ... they tell me the answer when you\nCall it the politicians office like that's supposed to be what will take all of your opinions and now you know we'll compiling them in will think about what we're going to do a but they've already got your mind made up their list Warren had her mind made up from day one same thing with Ed Markey a call Ed Markey I've got their phone numbers right here\nBut also where you would like to have you called Elizabeth Warren give her a shot and say you know what you say you're going to run for president after your elected down the ... or re elected on November ... we don't think that's a good idea\nHow about if you pledge to stay in the office for six years now we're going to give you about this how rude is it for somebody to um except your your your offer a she's asking you she is asking you to reelect her\nSo you go out there and you reelect during the day after she's going to hit the campaign trail and totally blow us up for the next two years is that really a good use of your vote is that why is that what you really want not what I Want by the way in an ethics do five hundred let's get back to your calls your next the w._b. is ... not\nA barrier you know I I got a ... you know I think it was your last

early college age about the age the cabinet was when he was allegedly trying to grow but Dr Ford\nAnd I guess this this young man that I had an interest in this this young lady and uh so he uh he kissed or tried to cancer and apparently she wasn't interested so rather than just saying hey I'm not interested less be friends let's go have a you know\nScored the beer somewhere something she told her parents\nThat he tried to rape her\nFor what reason I don't know\n\nUm maybe something else happened to this young lady and\nThen this happened locally by the way and I get above according to what my friend told me this was in this was all over the news I wasn't around here then but this was all over television news so apparently the TV news shows up at this family's home\nThis was all over the news I wasn't around here then but this was all over television news so apparently\nThe TV news shows up at this family's home and I think it was in Westport so the TV news shows up there because this\nThis young man who tried to kiss a girl who didn't want to be cast and accused them instead of right now has the TV cameras chasing them around so this goes on TV the TV news is there you know putting it on TV and everything else\nAnd um some other girl came forward and also accused him of attempted rape and the mother said that he didn't do it but he didn't really matter because he was convicted through the press\nEventually the stories were recanted by the young ladies but he had to go way somewhere else to college because the news media doesn't care\nThat the charge gets recounted and your name is clear they don't they don't clear you well news media is going to do with one friday the FBI comes out and um\n\nBesides that uh there's nothing here to these charges and uh you know there's nothing or a no evidence whatsoever that the judge Kavanaugh did something wrong here what do you ever made is going to do do you think the media is going to apologize to judge Kavanaugh\nDo you think they're going to give him equal time all the media there's been out there and send you waiting but he's a rapist or pedophile like the u._s._a. today don't don't allow him on basketball courts with young girls or do you think they're going to apologize to him\n\nDo you think there's any way that judge Kavanaugh gets his reputation back after this is all done even if Dr Ford goes on T. V. tomorrow it says you know what\nI I just had the ... and he came back to me in in in a judge Kavanaugh didn't do this to me even if she recounts her story\nDoes he get his reputation back no he will spend the rest of his life\n\nBeing smeared at and laughed at and humiliated by people who believe that he's a ... a drunken\n\nSexual offender sexual predator because the allegation was made and the politicians simply use the allegations to advance a political agenda and the Democrats did as well\nThe Democrats need to pay for what they've done to Dr Kevin ... but do you think they will the best way to make them pay is to reject them at the polls in November seven\nThat will send a hell of a strong message to the Democrats if they get repudiated in rejected by the voters in November six that sends a strong message that we don't like their campaign tactics seeking destroy we don't like it we don't want it we don't accept\nIt it's not fair it's not American\nThat's one way to send a message to the Democrats this this is not acceptable the other message you just said is to shut off the media shut it off I Know a lot of you have already which got shut it off you got to disconnect from it\nFox News probably better\nIt's just I don't watch them anymore I ever watch Fox News in two years is this some breaking story and you've got to have the news on there might go to\n\nBut to go home and sit and watch brain mostly like I used to do this stuff you know I'd sit and watch O'Reilly then I'd watch you know I'd watch Brett Baer that I write is coming on and then uh you know a a stick it out through Sean and all I Can't do that anymore I just can't do it\nAnd I have a CNN gets fewer viewers didn't reruns of sponge Bob thing about that reruns of sponge Bob get more viewers than CNN that's how disrespected CNN is\n\nMSNBC NBC I Can't watch any of that stuff anymore because I Know you're lying to me\nAnd I know they are making money off of the misery of people like judge Kavanaugh on his family that's Canada's got two daughters one ten and one Thirteen they've been dragged into this story these kids have to have armed protection\nAt Thirteen Years old to go back and forth to school this is what we're doing to our society now\nThis is what we've come to\nIn order to win a political race or in order to keep a judge from being appointed because he may or may not rule in our favor on something this is what we've come to this is what it's about\n\nAgain the best way to send a message to the Democrats were doing this\nIs the refused to vote for him even if they have no competition on the ballot just don't vote don't vote in that race leave that one empty or write somebody else yeah right right Brett Kavanaugh was named out instead otherwise you are condoning\nThat type of behavior you're saying it's OK you're saying you're supported\n\nWhich is getting confirmation that those two envelopes they told you about earlier the two packages that were
