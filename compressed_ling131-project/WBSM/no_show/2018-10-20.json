Texas somewhere\nThat he's got a picture of them are driving bagel route I guess they don't ever got his license back after the drunk driving so he's driving around so that my cruise is a it was at a fundraiser in Houston but he says can you imagine that this is the first in history somebody asked a Kennedy to drive a car\nI mean you would you would think okay and I'm not saying I have that much\nAnd it's just more hate speech that's what that's what it's being portrayed as it is\nOh dear you just because just because my uncle killed a woman and just because my my father put a woman in a wheelchair for the rest of her life how dare you say the Kennedys drive\nBut how you're always saying okay like when you walk as there are certain things that you're not supposed to do if you're running for office like great funky hats right um what was the other one eating whatever so as a politician you probably are always thinking yourself like alright optics wise will just be a good shot\nIf I'm Joe Kennedy I'm saying when he gave that speech in response to Trump's day of the union\nI'm going to say maybe don't put the old car behind me I don't think the ... car if I'm NATO I'm like maybe don't take a picture Nina car because all everyone associates with is running away from a hit and run drunk driving seen it you know\nHave any grasp of what other people think of them they\nThey get a free ride these Democrats get a free ride so they think that one's going to call about just like the big no one's going to notice these corrections they run a fake news story and then they corrected hours later\nI Love the the Boston Globe's tweet on the uh Ted Cruz making the Chappaquiddick joke they said was Ted Cruz making reference to Chappaquiddick question mark\nA either or he could see you know to be to be charitable I mean he could have been making your reference to Joel's father Joe the second who again crippled Pam Kelly and the Nantucket accident\nBut if I had to guess I Would say was Chappaquiddick yeah I'd be more people tend to go with that crippling a woman for life as bad rounding a woman worse yeah\nI'm like oh and with the Elizabeth Warren thing it's like yeah between her coming out with this news the Kavanaugh saying which really rallied a lot of Republicans and Michael ... endorsing people left and right against their well it's\nLooking more and more doors thing I miss a he ah last week he endorsed I think it was beta Steve right he came out with like\nI said oh All right this is what he did I didn't know he was a drunk driver ... ... per nor

people and everyone kept losing like some people you just don't want their endorsement you know what I mean like oh I'm I can handle this myself think Michael ... so they're kind of the worst person the Democrat Party right now is\nIs that that is still the front runner in the Democratic party or as Elizabeth Warren up there with them now\nWell I Know Spartacus isn't at five percent which is
