Y. T. V. studio sent us public television out in ah in Springfield or the Springfield public forum in western Massachusetts media consortium\nAre apparently sponsoring this the debate will be broadcast live from seven pm to eight PM\nIt's only an hour on that W gene B. Y. T. V. again this is um [noise] October Twenty one and W. W. L. P. channel twenty two\nIn Springfield to Springfield TV station on National Public affiliate New England radio New England public radio eighty eight point five FM will ear the debate live and the debate will stream live online on ... dot com\nOkay I'm not sure if any of the Boston affiliates whether a channel two out of Boston for example will be will be carrying this as well\nUm it doesn't indicate but this is the the first debate\n\nAnd I think the debate is going to be very interesting in this race between um between them I'm\nElizabeth Warren and Jeff deal I I think Jeff deals got\nThe issues and I think he's got the presentation and it's going to be a matter of I think who how many people watch the debates\nWhether it motivates them to get out and vote so uh that's the story October twenty first is the first deal Warren debate from seven pm to eight PM\nAnd the best I can tell at this point in terms of television coverage is that it will be broadcast out in Springfield so I'll I'll Try to find out if there's going to be broadcast like maybe a W GBH Boston a channel to\n'em or some of the uh you know maybe some of the other broadcasting or public broadcasting stations whether or not we'll be able to get that but mark that on your calendar because worst comes to worst and get it on ... dot com and I'm\nStill a couple of weeks away I put in a call out to the the deal campaign see if we can find out a bit more about it so absentee ballots are available now if you want to or if you want to vote and you don't think you're going to be around or do you you don't think you're going to be able to get out to the polls on a November six\nAbsentee ballots are available\nAnd again the elections only thirty four days away [noise] excuse me about absentee ballots now available are all cities and towns and the ballots are available to voters\nWho expect to be out of town on November six who have a disability or religious belief which prevents them from voting as are polling places a written requests for absentee ballots may be submitted by voters to their local election officials by mail facts or email\nAs long as they're written signature is visible according to the secretary of state's office voters may also apply in person at the clerk's office in their community applications for absentee ballots must be received by noon\nOf the day before the election so that would be November fifth\nI'm In early voting period for all voters will begin on October twenty second which is the day after the first deal\nWarren debate and I just cannot even stress how important it is for people to get out and make sure you're registered I think the last day registration is\nSeventeen if I remember correctly she got to get it you got to get out if you haven't registered yet and you feel strongly about this um um ... you need to get registered and he got to vote you got to listen to these debates because it's going to be very important and or the other um election thing that I wanted to mention too was that um\n[noise] block Obama\nHas now in door St Jay Gonzales for governor of Massachusetts they're hoping this is going to make a difference right or guns Alice is the Democratic candidate running against a a a rhino Republican\nCharlie Baker and\nBaker the last time I saw had like Seventy two percent of the bone\nDisease that bad for for ... hoping that an endorsement by a brac Obama will help but Jay Gonzales has already twice called for taxes\nAnd tax increases and I mean you know people who are enjoying what eighty percent of the people in Massachusetts have gotten a tax break under Donald Trump you really want to go and vote for this guy is going to raise your taxes but he says you will\nAnd he wants to raise taxes to pay for investments and transportation and education\nHe's called for taxing college endowments now those college in ... what they are they are used largely for scholarships and reduce tuition for kids who need it\nBut Gonzales sees this as a windfall for Massachusetts a New Bedford mayor ed or John ah I'm actually yesterday endorsed the tax on these in Dallas right here in the program\nBy the way you can hear again will be broadcast on Sunday Morning on the best and Barry I think it runs or ten uh but the the mayor doesn't it doesn't Dorsey sees and do it\nIn straight party ticket and I'm\nSo Brock Obama has endorsed Jake Gonzales that are they tell you something people abroad Obama is with us in reading he has officially bacteria Gonzales with Governor\nBoom says a party chairman gusts Vicksburg\nIn in ah let's see it was an email that was released yesterday\nI'm\nJay Gonzales is a bold leader\nWho has the vision the experience and the heart to be a an outstanding governor for the people of Massachusetts Obama said in his endorsement at a time when too many working families are being left behind Jay is on afraid to stand up and fight for a government that works\nFor everybody\nJay Gonzales says the guy who will along with that uh he was the budget director for a Deval Patrick\nMissed the tax day together wrote the gas tax that they wanted to charge you know the automatic gas tax that would have or you would have been charged a every time you put gas in your car but it would have gone up\nEvery year\nWithout a vote of the legislature the way they wrote this thing was to protect their own asked us so that they would never have to vote on it again it was a attacks that each year we'd go up and Jeff deal and others are including a shot O'Connell and cake oral fought like hell and have this thing or\nA done away with it but if it weren't for ah for them J. Gonzales and Deval Patrick would have been taxing your gas or by more um\nAnd and this guy by the way is endorsed also by Elizabeth Warren she attends these rallies and cheers for 'em and everything else you know the ... in Washington right now leading rally of celebrities are against judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation\nIn his own fundraising email on Tuesday Gonzales teed off the Obama endorsement I promise to lead this state following his example I promise to be bold\nAnd Libra electrician\nAnd of course you could pass right here at fourteen twenty WB yourself alright find a way not as you know five hundred ... thanks for hanging on an extra WB or Sam\nHello hello Hi Hi you're getting and everything how about we get on the stand it kind of knew that that what's up with them what's up with them that rag they cut\nIn pay but rarely every time you open the paper that Donald Trump down on how\nMuch do you say that cartoon to be honest with you or not\nYeah I I don't even I don't I don't read the standard times I haven't in in like probably Twenty years\nI Know and they want to know what happened to their subscriptions everybody's dropping them nobody can get right to pressing paper every time you open the paper it down a\nWell you know you're not going to get a fair shake but you know the newspaper ... what\nI think everybody in this city and surrounding ... Democrat yeah don't understand the two parties yeah\nWell there's many different points of view out there and I'll tell you what I'm you know newspapers is a long time ago kind of be once the Internet and ah instant information began to take off through social media and all of that you know by the time you wait for a newspaper to come out in the morning the news is old you already got the day before online and you got it from the radio here WB assemble whatever you're\nTalking to somebody that got the wall Street Journal for\nAnd I I got rid of the Boston Globe after friday it because of the negativity yeah I mean this\nTime I get it just for the local no you can't read anything other than the front page the local news it's a rag and I call I make calls to [laughter] that's ...\nWell I you know what I Would suggest would you rather than you get all upset about the much just put on WB uh some news in the morning listening to tailor Carmen he's going to have everything today that they're going to have tomorrow I'll listen to the day I Will have\nTo have my radio on but we may have to I have W. B. M. F. on all the time you are my favorite\nUnless you've got ... back your mom\n[laughter] Fox News but I'm On this\nPope but don't they know that the city no that's not\nThe intelligent ... of the people I knew that that I think really high with the exception of twenty percent and every time they open the paper they say they bad that news about the show at the Trump never any good news and that paper\nRight let me tell you that I I think the intelligence lovers a bit higher than that though I think that's where people are pretty smart and pretty sharp\nUm but I agree with you I think that the local newspaper is uh is is is is not fear it doesn't present both sides uh we tried to present both sides and they look I Am ultra conservative there's no question about that I'm not going to try to pretend that I Am I'm the what we do is we open the phones and give you guys a chance to call in\nAnd our present the other point of view we try to have guests on that will present the other side of the story but I don't think you get that so much and how much of the media these days\nAnd uh I I I don't think that's really fair\nUm and and again I'm not going to apologize for my points of view but we try to provide an opportunity I mean I'm sitting here in front of a phone right now anybody wants to call in and disagree with any of the positions that I put forward you're more than welcome to do so\nAre we also right daily opinion pieces that are on our website and our Facebook page and Twitter and give you an ample opportunity to ah to respond to them so\nUm that's what it's all about 'em but um\nYou know the press has changed in a lot a lot of ways over the years\nOf the newspapers don't have the immediacy\nThat are today I mean you know we this is the problem with newspapers is that they do they they they kind of lost the relevance and you know a lot of people like to grab a newspaper maybe on a Sunday and just hang out and sit and read it from cover to cover and that's that's great there's a lot of other things inside of a newspaper than just the breaking news of the day\nUm but I mean in terms of their ability to deliver a the breaking news the important stuff that's going on if they're not on line and they don't have the ability to do that\nBecause on line is so quick it's so fast today you know something happens to you know in Oshkosh by gosh I've got it right here among many popping up on my cell phone so by the time the newspapers can get it out it's twins tomorrow morning I was twenty four hours from now and the uh it's old news by then rent\nAlright fiber wait another six or five hundred and thank you for hanging on your next the w._b. assume Hi Barry how you doing pretty good how are you my friend from when I\nGet really upset with what's going on with judge Kavanaugh yeah and I'm really upset with the Democrats you know\nSo what do you think of is going to translate into so if you're just going to be a movement of people angry enough they're going to get out to the polls are well\nI Hope people will go out and they'll vote the right way yeah you know what I'm saying you have just had a call from all\nThe candidates running um Dale his name as deal I Believe Jeff deal yeah yeah and\nI'm going to vote for him because I don't want I don't want to look at the foreign and so yeah she hasn't really done anything good you know but I feel bad for the family a gap in our family I really feel bad for them\nYeah I mean it's just that they're willing that they wouldn't that man's name anybody can\nCome forward and just drop us an allegation against you and you get no way to protect yourself from it I mean that's you know in the media is or the media is advancing than the Democrats are out there doing it I mean where where does she go to get his reputation back after all this is done\nI don't know but they got the report from the FBI today you know and they're still not happy you know I Know about what do you\nThink I mean really I think he should he should the U.S Supreme Court judge I really think that he's done his other judge ship right and why shouldn't he be\nWell I I I thought from day one that he should be confirmed so um I I think you should be confirmed I you know I was hesitant to support this delay for a week um you know everybody was jumping all over Jeff Flake at the end of last week and I said you know this could actually turn out to be a pause\nRight that you have all those who are protesting were in the elevator with him who are paid by they were paid by\nOh George Soros yeah yeah yeah so that's become the new one that's become the new normal now so so people that you disagree with you can't uh you know these people are camped go about their lives now without having a a protester jumped on their face in the elevator at the restaurant at the airport is the new normal rather\nThan going to a restaurant and eat and peace and quiet and what they do it at some of the people like

I don't believe ... lawyer either I don't believe she is I may be right and she's a college professor I Know that\nOh yeah baloney she's also Indian isn't she\nYeah she had to um I I don't think she's I ... I may be wrong which I don't think she's a lawyer I don't think she's a lawyer\nYeah I don't know maybe somebody will call that in with the truth there were no yeah and now speaking of ah attorneys\nThat you see attorney Clinton on the uh I don't know who show it was on and I recognize that first I always seem to tour\nIn late to things but she was talking about a President Trump how when he thinks he's always on the defensive and always talking to a very inconsistent don't find that with the president and\nUm I don't find them inconsistent in fact you know sometimes all when he's speaking it's funny because she goes off of these tangents sometimes right and I'm saying are you going to be able to find your way back\nAnd he always does you always managed he goes up and they'll be talking about what the next thing I Know is the way down and some other road and I'm saying come on dude you got to get back to the point you were on and he always managed to seem to do that right or somehow but I find it very entertaining when he speaks out but I think he's honest when he speaks and now he says was on his mind\nYou know a very uh we I I think that really kind of skip their own but like you just said he gets back to the subject he's not a politician right I'm I'm assuming after you know maybe we'll get in the second term he'll be he'll be perfect ... you know\nI Hope he stays the way he has to be honest with you I've I've noticed some changes in Trump ... over the last year and a half or so I mean you can't help but change right when you were in that position but\nUm it's I I I enjoy very much watching a Trump rally or listening to a ... he's got a sense of humor when he's when he's given the press conference he laughed and cracking jokes yeah and in in you know the the press gets all uptight about that and I don't understand why I mean he's he's trying to be human try and you are you know\nThat race shouldn't know why and that's and that this president does whether it's good weather is bad weather is\nGoing to make a lot of money all while they are not going to give him out of credit\nYou remember when Reagan was president I'm sure you do when Reagan used to have a press conference you get out there and you start telling these stories Hollywood stories in the shot with a joke and everything else and the press used to get really uptight with that too and I don't understand why you can't have a light moment or two\nA would depress you know why why does wife depressed that uptight and he can't enjoy I Would personally enjoy that you know the president's trying to be human and trying to connect in that way\nAnd let them have it too doesn't it when he's up this\nThat he does and I I Love that too because they are also self righteous stolen shovel [laughter] and he puts them right in your place you know [laughter] I have very thank you\nAppreciate it my friend back he was kind of like my wife very time my head gets a little bit too big you know my wife wants to be right back at my place do you need that and and and Trump you know uh he does that with the press and he puts them in their place and now I I think that's great five or six o five hundred your next the w._b. is some good afternoon or\nGood afternoon guys today I'm pretty good how are you I Can't complain you sure these the demonstrations are in Washington\nA yeah the one that I'm seeing on TV I'm they may be all over the country um yeah but the one I saw on TV that uh as you said the outside of the U.S a district court in Washington\nYou guys don't know where the ... radio station it's located it's\n...

B. S.\nUp to follow them they're just ... said ashamed of what took place\nI personally feel it's this or in the Democratic party in the equal our way of looking at dirty game yeah dirty be doing in this this of unjustified being a human being\nYeah well I you know I I I think I agree with you because I Know a lot I mean this is New Bedford you can't help but no a lot of Democrats it's a big democratic city right and I don't see a lot of folks out there really enjoying what's going on in Washington right now I think a lot of people are embarrassed by and I think a lot of Democrats even some who disagree with Trump\nUm want to see the Congress doing stuff getting things done that it's going to help them help the fishing industry or you know get some money here so we can get some things but I and and I think you're right I didn't get embarrassed there's a good word by by what's going on in Washington and I think people are pretty upset by it\nYeah I Know that I Am and that's just the embarrassment is a\nVery mean hit every moon people on the German and they're just bury them though though ... we will see what happens next month than it would be good\nYeah I mean you gotta ask yourself but these are the people that you really want to have the keys to the car [laughter] do you want to put these people in charge of the store\nAbsolutely not\nYeah well I mean I I I agree with you a hundred percent but I think you're right I think if you call my friend but I think you're right I think a lot of Democrats out there\nAre embarrassed I mean you know I I talk to Democrats do as a mentioned I mean obviously this is a Democrat area right a lot of people are Democrats here in New Bedford Fall River taunting there's a lot of Democrats out here are these people do not reflect\nThe values I think part of working local Democrats people who are um you know looking to Congress to lead and to get stuff done I don't think that people around here most people around here\nAre looking what's going on in Washington and saying these people are acting in my best interest I really don't see that by going on at six o five hundred you're next on WB a Sam Hi Gary hey how are ya\nI'm good would it be possible for someone that's really good at what they do to get out get him to the Y. and all those are Democrats that are passing all this junk around and post them cramp up on them\nWhile you know you know what I mean I Do after\nThem and pull all the crap out that they can get like oh my gosh I never flush the toilet when looked on public junk out\nYou know I I on one hand I get ya and I and and I I think that'd be a lot of fun on the other hand I don't know what it would accomplish in terms of getting we're getting the people's work done and making life any better you know what I mean\nLike any better but it might make them stop doing what they're doing and the best way to do that to me I got to stop this crap yeah the best way to do that is just the vote him out of office I plan on that\nYeah just just just if if everybody says you know what you people have so poorly represented by your party and office who you claim to represent the we we just don't want you anymore that's right um get rid of them and then and they gotta they will learn you know he would\nEarn everybody to change their party to an enrolled yeah everybody change their pride on enrolled and let them get at what we're going to do because if you're not registered Republican or Democrat everybody at the time I got I got to be good I I Want to get in you know it's it's not a sure thing\nYou know you would think that after the two thousand sixteen election um the way that I mean the last seven thousand seats under Brock Obama the Democrats they'd all across the country and various offices\nAnd in such a humiliating defeat and the president because everybody said that she was going to win it right and I'm Indian so now that they've lost control of the federal government you would think that they would go off into a corner\nSay okay what do we need to do to reconnect with Republican in represent the public in a way that we can connect with them the same way that Trump did but they didn't instead of doing that they went further to the left and and they this whole resistance thing yeah I don't understand how they think this brings voters back but they do\nBut I still say someone should go after the one the most the antagonist the ones that didn't tagging the most all this stuff and get him today alive and see what they can find [noise]\nYeah and in and out him for it right yeah and my friend where's your hands and\nPut them on the line and say well you did this how come you're in office and you did that we are in office\nYeah well we sell for years I mean you know Bill Clinton Ted Kennedy all of these people even though this guy out in Minnesota Alice in a you know would you uh Cory bookers written about is actually trying to grow up to a Fifteen year old\nGirls and that's where he is what about you what about Blumenthal [laughter] you know and all of these people and they're still sitting up there and not going after them yeah\nWell I everything about them is out in the pressure's not pushing it and pursuing it and uh but yet they go after Kavanaugh USA Today writing I got a thing the other day suggesting that a a cabinet as a pedophile and in in various things like that and I mean you know why don't they go after the other side\nThey said they had to have someone that knows what they're doing and I know somebody out there listening they can hear me that knows what they're doing and get right into their wives every tiny little things\nHere and go after them and they put out a report on them and say well this is what you did how come you're how can I Know\nI like your idea on the kettle black I like your idea if everybody went down to city hall the town hall where they live in in a change their party affiliation from Democrats when he wrote that would send a message and then if they voted that well\nEverybody be enrolled and pick a person and not a party\nYeah but that's the thing too I mean you have to think beyond your party and it really disappointed the yesterday when I had the mayor here and he's talking about while I go to vote I got to support Warren because she's my party I gotta support Jacobs all she's my party whatever I mean you can't do that I mean that's not what's best for the city New Bedford has not best for our country\nYou and I are running role we pick a person not a party\nRight right you got to do that thank you my friend ... recall actually I've got to take a break now cyber wait another six soap opera and by the way I Apologize to my friend Steve\nBy French Steve was trying to call
