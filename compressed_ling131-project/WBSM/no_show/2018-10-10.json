program and he's now seven minutes after one o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon gorgeous gorgeous day in progress around eighty degrees out there not too tough to take in October I\nAre a lot of things go down and get the hurricane of course they were keeping an eye on at this moment in now we've got Hillary Clinton's outrageous comments this week about ten\nOr civility and not on civility and that they're Democrats should not be expected to be civil at this point a while the Republicans were in control um essentially calling on people too\nWhen you tell somebody to be behave on civil a ride your\n\nI guess you're inviting the be confrontational right also um\n[noise] I mentioned the thing about uh uh the interview that you did with Christine Christine on them and poor as well they're talking about Bill Clinton in saying that uh you know all the the the allegations against Bill Clinton totally different stuff from Kavanaugh and from my accusations made against Trump because well that was the result of a along party scene investigation\nDidn't address the claims or the payout to Paula Jones and what about eight hundred thousand dollars anything like that right now that was just they the result of a long drawn out party scene investigation\nAnd um\n[noise] but yet the the charges against or the allegations against that Trump and against Kevin a totally different from that and the other day I just wanted to mention before we get back to your phone calls here the um Kanye West I mentioned that this yesterday Kanye West is going to meet tomorrow at noon time with that President Trump\nAnd you wouldn't believe the pushback that he's getting over this um that you plan to discuss manufacturing resurgence in America prison reform how to prevent gang violence and what can be done to reduce violence in Chicago Kanye West of course is a black entertainers rapper and\nSince his um friendship\nDeveloped with President Trump he has been pretty much thrown under the bus by his community and by fellow entertainers and laughed at and mocked and and everything else and I'm\nPaid as much attention of football as I might because of the the the phenomenal season the red Sox who had but you know kind of keep it in one I I think Sunday night they both games are opposite each other\nYeah the ... the yeah I think I think the red Sox are going to be on my main screen and the patriots were probably be on my iPhone and we'll see how that works out [laughter]\nAnd my friend again I give her a year to go Red Sox five or six o five hundred or no question about that um what about the treatment of Kanye West and what do you think about these people\nAre particularly something like gun loving who is you know\nI'm going to sit here right and he will doggone Trump called Trump racist and this that and the other thing Trump wants to sit down with a a kind of a west in India so he and he and ... in in ... dogs I don't get that and what are they all the people I don't think that they're better somehow than Kanye West\nYou know I Will take a Kanye West any day\nOver Colin Kaepernick no question I'll take a Kanye West any day over Don learning\nYou know again I'm not a huge Kanye West families not to my for the first time I ever even remember hearing of Kanye West I was watching these stupid dumb Music Awards\nShows and um I I'm almost positive who's Taylor Swift who was up on stage and she was getting an award and he came up and took the microphone I if I remember and he started who was one of his ramps and I was like who the hell is this guy\nAnd I've never been a big fan I'm not into rap and and and then that stuff so\n[noise] um I've never really followed him other than the fact that he's married to one of those ... car Daschle injects and um\nHe got my attention because the risk the wrath of his own community and his own industry and his fan base by meeting with Trump wants in two thousand sixteen and you say here's a\nGuy who at least wants to have a conversation so I Would rather take somebody like Kanye West over Colin Kaepernick who\nSit in bitch or kneeling bitch and do nothing you\nKnow writing checks that's not going to solve the problems in Chicago so big daily writes jak she's got to be a lot of money right to object that's not going to solve the problems solving the problems involves putting it all on the line putting some skin into the game which is what kind of he was doing\nBut just you know the game\n... Colin Kaepernick and Philadelphia Eagles and and Don Lemon who sits just on let me have a right to sit and laugh at Kanye West\nAnd to suggest that this is what happens when negroes don't read\nWow\nFight away nine six o five hundred Europe next actually hanging out I had it hey you know down I'm doing pretty good price going back that day that price yeah old David Price yeah\nToo damn inconsistent\nYeah yeah he got it\nBut it can't fight it half the crime\nDavid Price has never won a post season game he's old in nine in the postseason\nMighty inconsistent\nYeah we're paying this guy a lot of money that's paying him\nWhat's his contract with it but it is out of sight\nAnd it's it's a huge yeah he's got a huge huge contract and then you don't want he had a great second half of the season but boy you put them in a stressful situation like a you know pitching in a in a post game and he he exactly so he's done he's not going to start any more games are going to put him in the bullpen\nIncredible we've got an awful lot um oh I don't know what his contract\nIs your business properly covered in civil law has your policy been reviewed will likely to be sure you're getting the best ... golf links with insurance to get a new obligation second opinion and quote for your business\nDon't wait for your renewal cold today Blankenship leads the way with old vision service and the horrible sound in through solutions for your business ... nine Ninety four Ninety six eighty to flagship ins dot com or visit them and how one place six with the one ... one in New Bedford\nNine nine eleven eleven or visit ... company dot\nCoach employee W. B. U. S.\n\nFunny looking back at his now one twenty eight on a Wednesday five ... five hundred day if you tuned in today and wondering with the mayor was the mayor will be with us tomorrow at one solar mid week with the mayor tomorrow at one o'clock right here on fourteen twenty WB ascent let's get back to your calls ... on your next WB a sound\nVery hey why\nNot right and um I didn't have cable here in the games but David Price so when given an so how much you make\nA year okay uh thirty million dollar thirty million dollars a year oh yeah and uh he has a he can't play the Yankees are on a mission even play them and get the Yankees but\nI was wondering uh um well did you ... it's unbelievable the Yankee fans are going to be a Kansas the red Sox fans and yeah layers and all that that's that's what ...\nWhat a rivalry though yeah ... ... ...\nIt is it is but you you know the thing with the rivalry though is you got to be a good sport you know the ones that we will we win some and um\nYou know I mean you've got to be good sport about a day in and you can't be throwing beer cans at the other guys players ... remember a few years back they would throw batteries that Johnny Damon a auditor or Yankees right yeah I mean that that is not good sports Mahlia\nPleased with the ... is deal at any point and he was running for the Yankees in the series here ...\nAnd if that's happening remember Trump said after the election two or three million votes cast by illegal immigrants and everybody you know\nWhat a liar what pool what a jury and see what happens when a negro salaried remember all that when the\nTruth of the matter is that we are finding out more and more and more every day that Trump was telling the truth what Trump ordered an investigation right he did they took to find out I I suppose it's almost impossible to find out the full extent of this but we all know that people are voting illegally we know that people are getting driver's licenses\nThere shouldn't be getting them that are here illegally\nSo why would anybody doubt that people are voting illegally if they're being given identification\n\nSo I'm all for it now North Dakota where they are\n\nWith a boost from the Supreme Court on\nThe legality of his law which requires you to have a federally issued or not and it says government issued I suppose that could be state issued but a a government issued photo ID\nBy the way they used that as you know when when the criticizing Trump you'll hear the Trump once a national voter ID card\nIs though that there's something wrong with that\nI don't get what's wrong with that why why is that criticism that's one of the reasons why I voted for the guy yeah I'm all for that too I think that's a great idea when do we start\n\nSo I I just don't get it nobody's ever been able to make a case for me you hear it you'll hear oh that's racist you oh you can do that that's that's unfair to to John ... yeah I'm a grandson that's unfair to old people that's unfair to people that live out in the country\nNo oh I think it's fair to everybody if everybody is required to have an id to vote I don't see that too unfair to anybody to be perfectly honest with you one hundred per cent honest with you I don't see what was unfair I find it more fair and you know what is more fair for the candidates do\nBecause then the candidates don't have to worry about cheating in corruption\n\nThere's no later on saying well there were illegal votes cast or illegal immigrants voting other races and they shouldn't be voting or or you know I Know you know get rid of the electoral college because it's just not fair and all of it now the wife's all of that out\nWipes it all out\n\nHe has an ID card\nWorks for me I Wish we could get it done by November to make sure that all of these races or ah I was going to be fair\n\nBecause believe me there's a lot of a worry and concerned about that right there certainly is supposed to tell you something about\nThis a few minutes ago and I didn't get to it because he couldn't reach and so now I'm going to reach over there and do this very graceful and you write because I mentioned tell you that WBAI Sam has more to build family theme park passes on sale this Friday morning at nine o'clock\n\nOn sees the deal's dark on friday morning on the field show\nWe've got some more ... family theme park passes\nSees the deal to come get you ready to go rent or own chickens normally thirty seven bucks for just twenty five bucks\nTo savings of twelve bucks apiece and that matters have you taken a family of four or whatever that adds up right the big discount on all the seasonal family funded needed to get yours while they last starting friday morning and nine AM and sees the deal dot com\n... sees the deal and you're good buddies right here in fourteen twenty WBFO our inside the way down as a white hunting goes right\nBack over here now and you're up next the w._b. is I'm going after high very high\nI think it's a good idea and it's a must show you some kind of it they're not the case Neal license when you go vote [noise]\nWhile leaving your license I'm On your license I guess ah [noise] I guess that's a government id yeah so I guess that should be acceptable I\nPrefer to have a ... a special election issued card or something\nYou know but I suppose your driver's license works it's something that's got your picture on it and it's got your address on it\nYou know that's where you are when you cash a check yet or even when we were you withdraw money is going to show your ID yeah license usually well maybe a fingerprint when you go to vote if they can\nThat's interesting doing we might get to that point at some point with technology where you got to put your fingerprint or your finger into the\nInto the voting machine right\nYes and I don't see why anybody has a problem showing some kind of a case for\nLike you can't have fried Julian voting if it's if it's right so that's why I obviously that's what they're trying to do their ... trying to protect fraud yelling voting\nThat's what it looks like\nI mean if you're arguing against the system that guarantees or almost guarantees that you know fried free election you must be supporting Dylan loaning the only reason I can think of it\nIs I'm\nI'm sitting out here and joined this beautiful day and I I I

Bill Clinton did anything wrong and funny and then that would that would have with politics like that [noise]\nWell yeah because I didn't want to get I wanted it it's so easy to say well Trump did this in the end of this when did that and what about he was drinking and everything none of that has to do with that with with the uh whether or not this woman was a ... thought she was being raped you know it's a grey smoke screen\nIt was it was\nInappropriate contact you know the rate that we know there was no\nBut see that's that was deemed rate now where even calling it re oh yeah yeah he was accused of being a pedophile to buy a USA Today um [noise]\nBut this is a shame of this whole thing is that we allowed it to get so far out of hand you're right now we're not referring to it as a rape and it wasn't really a but here's the\nReally really honestly am I saying your [noise]\nI'd like somebody if somebody lied\nFor sure\nWe're not going to do that because of God Knows what you're thirty general or whatever\nThe federal side of it it is a big deal and any of them girls even the other one that was the end of the gang rape\nThey see like I don't know why that it was a federal offense because it was a federal yacht right at the federal court or anything that live in that our federal effect\nBut see here's the problem though not all of these women that legitimately do get molested are now going to be afraid to come forward because of what for it\nAnd I'm Renee arrests and this other clown did on won't because now they now they're definitely feel like they're not going to be believe they're going to be paraded around on television or whatever\nWell but then that will wake up on Thirty years ago that to me is\nThat you know we have a timeframe on like anything else because that's going\nTo be able to go back and well then that eating its own yeah where are you going to fight and\nYeah I mean listen I'm an old you my friend because your phone is really humming loud and it's a kind of going in and out but I got your point and I agree with you by the way I see so five hundred you're actually WBAI some good afternoon\nI Barry I'll be real quick I I don't know if you guys have a policy on on one place gets busted would you be able to give me the number of the Park Avenue address ...\nOh my God I don't let me see I don't have in front of me Jay you always got it uh you know if he's listening if he's listening maybe you can run over to the microphone enough given to me over the next minute or so here but I don't have it you might be in the story on the website\nYeah I don't use a computer to use computers and I haven't either I see on the sex easy okay yeah All right\nUh uh anyway uh yeah I think that the way the uh too many years ago when she tried ... drew was there were a barricade Yale University tested never the FBI I didn't go after that when she was waiting for them to show up she had a witnesses\nAnd they didn't show up and they were invited I think that if they want it showed up in Quidam they're clean slate no problem\nRight now until the next day in the next one came out\nWell I mean the thing that I mean the problem is to me they never addressed this type of issue and the committee that gives advice and consent\nThe Senate committee should have a provision and you can call the Anita Hill for provision that when people want to make an allegation they have to go through this new process\nTo protect everybody okay I'm going to be the nominee Spanish will be handled by the committee an FBI show that we don't as a nation to have to look at this crowd but he was just crazy and and and it it it ruins everybody I mean there is any winters are\nSo you're absolutely right and and but you know one isn't that what the Senate Judiciary committee is about each member of the Senate Judiciary committee has a staff and the committee itself as a staff that is supposed to be facts find all of this stuff so even if you look at\nLook how many minutes have British in July ... don't allow for the the last minute thing a poll whatever they created to say that\nYou don't want to come forward if they made it all that kind of stuff that would get water you no longer be that way you're going to time for him you want to make a charge against the nominee you thirty days or a bus sure paperwork and the committee will do it after that no no ...\nWell we got she got her Dianne Feinstein got this letter and why okay the woman didn't want the letter made publicly damaging that's right Diane\nAnd she would have all under the

the first thing that really she said it was this girl anybody from that's where he said well you know if I might add that letter under the law which they got to know what I'm saying that the weakest link to write a report that we've seen instead of wasn't anybody hindsight I even\nTalked about the leak at this point I'm Talking about Weinstein taken Atlanta in July when she got ate it over to rationally instead I perceive this as opposed to remain calm potential I wanted to Seattle to and that's the that's the one that should be allowed to read you this is why we\nShouldn't have throat grass or whatever the reason that up at that point that come out I I think that's a warrior so that I got that way because I'm a and then it became a political world there's higher standing\nYou better you're going through his last job I can also just as she says she's got two master's degrees and we're not going to train she's she must have been formed ... performing wise\nI I don't think
