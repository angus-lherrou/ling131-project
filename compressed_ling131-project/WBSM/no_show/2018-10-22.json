[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWhat it is the notion of Rocky Top Carla all morning ... coming up bottom of the hour a okay I'm\nSorry to report more a parade or in terms of Republicans trying to suppress the boat Ari Berman says go to\nSchool to serve that oh hey guess what the first thing a drug or a judge are drinking the great the anti environment\n... which I Can't remember which names\nWere using now written with perjury Young's your best guess he uh he uh certain Scalia on his first day of the court so that's how we know he's going to be completely nonpartisan yeah impartial SCOTUS just upheld\nA voter id law in North Dakota that can disenfranchise thousands of Native American voters and cost Heidi Heitkamp her Senate seat the risk of disenfranchisement is large RPG writes in dissent um\nIt's true but I think we're underestimating the number of voters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so who are fed up and and now's the time to rise up because again\nIf only women voted we'd have the most progressive country in the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party yeah this is so important for for women especially to get out and and change the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know and Bob I think I'm like I was saying it it is an interesting ... tweeted yes the electorate has was transformed this November we experienced the Nineteen Ninety two years a woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out at night and we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so voting early as ... keep saying voting by mail was a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right\nOr oh a lot of these machines broke who sell well\nYeah and and as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression voter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans what I mean we've got so many impediments that are passed ultimately in terms of winning back at least\nOne chamber of Congress and you know we've got all these things voter id as I said and and gerrymandering and the Russians and so on\nTiny a at a ... a habit that way but in fact I mean back in two thousand six when the Democrats swept the and\nThere were still gerrymandering there were still voter id there were still voter suppression voter purges at all these things that we were able to overcome\nYeah exactly make a change election and I just want to say\nYeah I mean Bobby ... you know you wrote a piece here's how Russia could attack the midterms but I you know we had a caller calling us think oh this is rigged already there and I'm like don't say that this is the that's what they want you to think to depress turn out that your votes not going to count so you wrote a piece you said so far there hasn't been any real proof Russians have hacked\nOr the vote totals two years ago well\nSo far we know for certain the Russian sent out the digital equipment as skirmishes to test our election systems Ramona ... ability twenty when states were infiltrated voter registration records were the very least some truth not altered perhaps just allowing democratic voters to cast ballots duty incorrect\nOr apps and registration above the point is you're right we are armed with more knowledge this time and people are finding this I mean we shouldn't have to\nThe people are checking and re checking that they're registered finding they've been knocked off and having to re register I mean it's it's\nUm but if you say however last time the Russians didn't really have to alter votes on election day since they were still actively change the minds of voters through malicious hacks and unprecedented unchecked psi ops on Facebook Twitter except for everything we know as well as compliant segments of the news media mines were changed before the fact why we're reaching servers on a day when everyone's attention will be focused\nUm yeah so you say however discussions on Twitter about voting against red state Democrats for their conservative leanings especially incumbents like Joe mansion had been stoked by obvious Russian trolls and bots encourages liberal liberal either stay home or vote against the Democrats yeah\nThis is a is a case where I've seen the most trolls are all year in fact in discussions after the cabinet vote and uh with Joanna everyone angry at Joe mansion\nFor casting a yes vote for cabinet which of course was was terrible and and you should've caucus with the rest of his party on that\nBut the reality is reality in West Virginia and and and we need every vote we can get in the Senate so that's all that being said you know their war they were so many trolls that were popping into those discussions\nAnd they were obvious roles to who would just jumping on the other hand all ... you know just a string of numbers yeah no profile thing and and I hadn't seen them any trolls in the area of discussion\nUp to that point and and so that that was a little concerning ... and ... and by the way I'm not trying to slow walk a possibility of a a continued Russian attack obviously\nThis is something that we all have to be tremendously concerned about but the reality is is that uh all of the hacking a has been or at least the reported hacking has just been attempted hacking and the efforts have been\nForwarded right time and I'm a huge or oh they try to spear phishing thing but we were on to them and do we stop them well they didn't get emails and so on\nThat's you know I mean not only do we not have the electoral college ball but as you say compared with twenty sixteen were more prepared to deal with trolls in Boston this time and the various media platforms obliged up a little blocking some of the more obvious efforts what we do know whoever's when the Russians will hit their attention on ... on an election day or sooner\nOr given early voting um\nYou know Bob again all we can do is ... ... ... says turn out in such numbers that we can overcome all this I mean you're right we see like the ... Russian boss when we see you we we seem to be getting involved in you know these are you know trying to ... now they're trying to divide among the sexes you know there was more like\nThe rolling the racial issues during the twenty sixteen rings right trying to get black voters to stay home or not\nOh yeah yeah well there's that and they're trying to get liberals to stay home where you know or ... or to vote for the Republican in West Virginia a in that case and certainly in\nTennessee you know we need a Phil Bredesen to win in Marsha Blackburn and Tennessee as well and and people are angry at filled bread is ending the trolls are\nAre seizing upon that a man named my real concern here seventies not not necessarily the trolls and the boss on Twitter and so on but ah with these\nClose races yep got so many tossup races\nAnd those are the ones that I Believe the Russians if they're going to alter vote totals or pull some sort of shenanigans on election day it's going to be with those close close races because what happens is if we're all talking about a blue wave but if the Republican candidates in these\nVarious tossup races and up winning just by a few votes\nThen it's really easy for the traditional pressed to say\nOh that was just because of of the energy from the cabinet confirmation of the younger the male vote after that\nThere and and everything that Trump has been say it's gonna be a red wave all this nonsense that he's been predicting about the election that's what happens it's not there they're not gonna go oh it's Russian hacking yeah nearly imminent fate is this innocuous thing\nYeah and you know the same thing I think I said yesterday basically you said um it's a highly unlikely conservatives will be energized by Kavanaugh's confirmation a month later on the other hand Democrats especially women will be out for blood and you say ... country to the bulls among a D.C perhaps the most energizing unified back into politics right now is the Democratic party\nAnd that's why you're right you keep seeing these repeated efforts to I think I'm hoping we are too smart to fall for the same like trying to divide in the left and right\nI yeah I I I Hope we're smarter [laughter] I I you know honestly I wasn't I was a little skeptical watching some of the reactions to Joe Manchin I have to go back to that ... for a second because again we're talking about electoral politics here we are talking about hard\nEnough and we need every Democrat we can get in the United States Senate because and then half two years\nWe may lose another Supreme Court justice and we're right back into the Brett Kavanaugh debate again yeah and in order to force that we need the United states\nAnd then half two years we may lose another Supreme Court justice and we're right back into the Brett Kavanaugh debate again yeah and in order to force that we need the United States Senate so we can\nHave a say so the Democrats can have a say in terms of who Donald Trump nominees to take over I mean we're talking about a roof better Ginsburg is eighty five Stephen ... eighty a Clarence Thomas is Seventy and Sam Alito sixty eight\nI mean these people are getting any younger and Donald Trump is still the president so how do we stop the next the Kavanaugh disaster from across the United States Senate and that includes well elect re electing Joe Manchin\nAnd we're getting people like our brothers in there too and Tennessee\nYeah and when you talk about um you know by these how these ... these tossup races do remember that the Russians micro targeted those three states those swing district he this election was decided by Seventy something thousand votes\nUm and you said Democrats have no choice but to send all time record turnout in the mid term we're talking presidents level turnout sent a levels in greater\nI'm particularly in these aforementioned tossup races um yeah\nThat's always the key with midterms it's turnout turnout turnout whoever it turns out that most voters when these midterms because it doesn't have you don't have the liberty at the top of the ticket to draw people into the voting now we just have\nA you know on the house side for them to thirty five different elections we've got state and local law that gap as well and those as you were saying earlier Seventy user\nSo important because what we're talking about what the state and local elections or things like trap laws and we're talking about gerrymandering and we're talking about a census that's coming up soon we're talking about\nMarijuana laws looking about ... being able to load yeah yeah yeah I mean these\nAre all things that are happening at the state level that I think very few people who are engaged in the daily shovel fights on Twitter or paying attention to but these are reasons we have to turn out and vote not to mention\nThe reality that were staring down the barrel of a possible a Republican a constitutional convention where they started proposing there liberty amendments\nNo event that were on the screw yeah a couple of great points on Twitter you made more damage courtesy of the Trump crisis any Republican doesn't screech bitch and wine in public is considered moderate regardless of policy positions\nAnd this one of 'em were warning shot across Carlos those rocky how Trump does a lot more skits in ... voices during his rallies he used to I blame the brain brain worms serious message Andy Kaufman who's still alive please rip off the orange latex the skies and let us off the hook or any president Tony Clifton isn't funny thank you yeah yeah yeah\nRight it is about thirty seconds away from the I'm going\nTo get into the newsroom and we will come back and chat with you a little bit later on again Jeff deal in New Bedford done now Wednesday\nOr we'll give you a more information on that or will remind you about it as it comes closer had data see Jeff a good guy great guy if you've never met him go down and meet

incompetence or\nFlawed because I was calling from Missoula, Montana what difference to make where I'm calling from ... from west board\nKnows that I Know one hell of a lot more about what's going on

people's flax\nYeah I'm In drawing you ...\nHave you gone on march to another country and it made that country I\nCome\nGo back your own place yeah ... well ...\nThanks a lot by the way not not just you know five hundred you're next on WB assumption\nAfternoon guy Barry how you doing good how are you good you know this Trump\nThing I you know you were talking about the overwhelming amount of people don't want to go to this uh you know things from tonight or today or whatever I don't find that\nThat on and I'm going to tell you while you're only a couple of years younger than me but many many years ago George Wallace was running for president and he came to Lincoln Park I don't know if you remember that you remember that\nI don't really I remember when he ran for president and I don't recall him becoming Lincoln Lincoln\nPark I when I was like probably for the navy\nAnd you couldn't get into place and it was because of the more so nobody in that place was going to vote for judge walls I mean very few but it was fascinating it was entertainment and I still think that's why Trump's ... drawing these crowds because I don't\nWell do you watch do you watch any of these rallies that he does that don't don't don't tell me do if you don't be honest I\nI I watch them I I Do I watch him\n'cause All right if you watched any Donald Trump rallies the people that go to these rallies are screaming and cheering and wearing Maggie a hatch in magic shirts and waving flags and everything else these hardcore supporters these are not just people that are the ... now I Will admit to you I'm sure that there is a percentage of the crowd that is there is a curiosity\nBut these are Suzie asked the base supporters to turn out for these rallies\nYeah no doubt about it I mean it's like a frenzy but I think that is part of it you're just a couple of the topics I Want the top I'm real quick Geoff deal I did watch the first debate\nBetween him and a warrant the thing I\nThink that he tripped up on is when she hit him with his statement about\nI got Trump's back one hundred percent and he didn't deny she hit him with it quite well why would he deny it no no no\nLet me go further what I'm saying is what is Geoff Diehl Elizabeth Warren that's not the kind of person I Want representing me because that's telling me I'm going strictly by the potty strictly by the president right or wrong and that\nThat that's not what I Want I watch some of it's going to do the right thing for the right\n... well that's what he said he explained that in the ...\nPercent he well he ...\nWell no he didn't he or she has shifted back a little bit he did say that I Am not going to have Donald Trump's back when everything was there were things were going to disagree on and on what war than when I grew up with them and I might expect that from anybody\nSo you're going to you're going to understand that people like me who support Trump and support deal we're looking for somebody to go to Washington that is going to back the Trump agenda this was a different election and we'd never seen before we elected an agenda more than ...\nMore than anything and again this guy came to us with an agenda say look I can get this done and we said okay fine you get this done um you know you're going to be a brawl forever and and he's getting it done that's why you support is growing with people so yes we want people to go down and and work with him that can get that agenda passed like\nBut like you know what I Know with this thing with the border which I agree with you I don't have a solution I don't know what I don't know what to do but he's not sending anybody anywhere he he's not offending anybody anywhere Congress will send people Congress will do it or the house will vote but he's not sending anybody anywhere\nCongresses and doing anything Congress has both Republicans and Democrats out on their hands\nThat's what I said when he got in I said to you I worry more about Congress and the Senate and that's what I'm saying now it's up\nTo them to prove that they never going to happen\nNow Congress doesn't have to prove that he can mobilize he can mobilize all day long I don't\nKnow I don't know I I still think they got to get on that thing to figure out how to pay for and all I don't think he can do maybe maybe you're right but I Want to see it happen I don't think it's\nGoing to the president can order an airstrike on another country this ... hot and I'll get off the phone to his ... my daughter was from San jose California this past week okay and right near her as a venue probably the eyes of the center there in Providence yep\nAnd Michelle Obama's covering all she'll pack 'em in listen I'm watching is Percy [noise] it's a lot\nThree hundred fifty dollars and they're sold out\nYeah she's doing that the TD Bank that garden yeah she's doing the TD Bank on Michelle Obama is um is an interesting character she will sell out she's got a book tour going and there's some speculation that she may run for president so\nBut three hundred fifty bucks yeah wow it's a lot of money on where in the wrong business fairy\nTale I Know I I'd Elton John ... at that price do in a

the life of a radio star huh\nThat you are welcome back have just having fun has lots of uh things going on today regret the caravan and ABC News is attacking President Trump because he calls it a national emergency one evidence does he have what they have\nBut when you look and you see that on Saturday\n\nSeventy seven thousand people had requested the tickets for tonight's rally with Trump and cruise Seventy seven thousand people\n\nBy yesterday one hundred thousand people had requested tickets they had to move this to a bigger stadium only Eighteen thousand are going to be able to get in as a Toyota Center but they're having a big amount on the outside for all of the other people and I've been watching a live streaming video\nIf you go to Breitbart Breitbart good live streaming video and don't want the press tells you what's going on\nGo to places like Breitbart and you can watch it with your own eyes go to Breitbart dot com they've gotta live streamed going on right now where you can actually watch the people that are filing into the stadium right now and then find them onto the property tens of thousands of people tens of thousands of people\nNow is that indicative in any way but blue wave to you you remember they were talking about taxes going blue or the first time at a hundred gazillion years in Sam Houston was around ... called blue\n\nBush\nSo we'll see we'll see what happens but a lot of people going to be able to jump around and I'm looking forward to listening to it and watching it and uh you know hearing what the president says my own my own eyes and ears and of course we've got the um uh the Caribbean or marching toward the Texas border\nAnd the Mexican Mexican us border and the president is saying it is a um it's a national emergency\nAnd he will activate that you ... what do you think five away nine six o five oh by the way Chuck Schumer just issued a statement this whole thing with the caravan yeah this is because the\nRepublicans are losing the debate over health care so they were talking about the Caribbean because these people smoked crack or they just that stupid naturally we shouldn't worry about the Caribbean this just a smokescreen because the the Republicans are losing the debate on healthcare\nWas Warren kept talking about health care to over the weekend in the debates right um the Republicans losing the debate over health care so we're we're using the caravan is a smokescreen gap\nFive away nine and six five hundred your next in Libya some actually hanging on\nTheir own driving one oh here how are you doing pretty good how are you Johnny one done\nPretty good so we gotta show I I've been getting bits and pieces of the show but I I've been busy mhm but begin to show you asked where it was there another place or a show\nYou know the place we're all in the pac ... place for Seventy something that was people I Believe that question anyway\nYeah I got there there are a hundred thousand people that request the tickets for tonight's a rally\nYeah but of course how much the same old\nEighteen thousand Eighteen Eighteen they had as Haiti amid held eight\nAnd then the response was so incredible they they made it got a bigger stadium in hose Eighteen thousand and but then one hundred thousand people as of last night they may have been more today but a hundred thousand as of last night had requested tickets\nAll right well so so yeah it's a song give you an answer OK\nRock Obama filled mile high stadium you remember that\nOr was that for the inaugural address ... no no no no well this was during his campaign okay before before the election okay how many ... mile high\nMile high stadium the capacity is Seventy eight thousand and one twenty five I Believe\nOne of them take on it yeah\nAnd I only did they feel that we see in mile high stadium they put um what do you call those big jumbo Tron ... are on the outside of the stadium because the parking lots in the streets\nWere full you know I wanted to get it and ... ...\nYeah that's kind of what they're going to have to do tonight I'm that didn't surprise me though is well Brock Obama drew some huge crowds when he was running for president no question first black or running for president and um he uh he really did drive a lot of excitement his his his followers were very loyal to him\nYeah let me ask you a question berry you think that um Elizabeth Warren will win or lose this race\nThe Senate race Yes sir I you know what I don't know I Can't tell you I I think that on paper she she went out and win big I just don't know I don't know I I'm yeah I'm not I mean on paper she should run in my head tells me she's going to win it but I don't know I don't know\nI think you know I think to me I think it's a fifty fifty chance yeah I agree that\nWrong but uh I don't know I don't know you you watch these elections because what happens is you know the one side will cross say oh you know man she's leading by a long shot and people just don't go\nYeah it can do better they've got it in you know what I mean there's no question about that in in that sense all the time it happens all the time most\nOf them that I think I think he's got a fifty fifty chance myself I've watched the first two debates I mean nothing surprising on either side I think Jeff deal so little soft a soft spoken I mean\nI think he's got a mind me a lot of Charlie Baker up on stage there you know right down to the mall owners Jake\nHe's not confrontational and you know sometimes that works for you sometimes it doesn't now because she is very kind of very confrontational it may work for for him especially where she keeps talking about Trump and he's trying to say look she's running for president let's talk about issues related to Massachusetts\nThat could work for them I don't know I really don't\nWell here's here's the thing and this is what I think just it will biggest problem is going to be is that he quotes the associates themselves from you know he had um places with our current uh\nOh I Can't think of a woman named ... ... troops you know I'm Talking about\nThe woman yeah the long on edge tall skinny women there what's her name\nThe retina or shut all okay I'm In culture\nIn colder yeah you know and it is right or good at it for him he's got to realize something this is oil hey ... you know what I mean and it can do one thing that can really hurt him it's close association with Trump\nOur car\nAnd cold to you know the people that I call the far right that's\nRight and actually he only met and culture a couple of weeks ago how he kind of thing I was with him when he met her for the first time a matter that yeah he didn't he wasn't a ... here's the thing about Jeff deal Geoff Diehl is probably the least um\nWhat's the word I'm trying to think he's he's not one of these guys it's like althea plugged in doing all the the circuit you know going around in a hanging out with the\nUh you know all the popular politicians and all that that's just not him I mean he was an average guy owns a small business he works in the legislature and uh he's pretty much a home body beyond that he's not somebody hangs out with a an colder and all of these guys who does the Fox news or routine and all of that [noise] um well\nI tell you what Barry I've seen around my area not that bad food they have and\nI've seen\nA few I could say a bunch of Jeff deal science I haven't seen one warrant signed anywhere\nI haven't seen one and I've traveled out to western mass maybe she's just not putting them out I don't know\nYeah I don't know because I've not seen one anywhere and up that surprises me a lot here's the thing with Elizabeth Warren now Elizabeth Warren normally a Democrat in Massachusetts you got to say they they're gonna wind is hands down the problem at all is a big one is there are a lot of Democrats the don't like earth to\nUm you know for a lot of different reasons and and the Democrats last week how he was talking about this about how the the uh Wellesley girls whatever a club or that we're supposed to be canvassing for her this past weekend pulled out because of this whole thing with the Native American\nHeritage thing so they they walked away from her um there's a lot of folks in in in Massachusetts that just feel that Elizabeth Warren has not represented this state well\nThat may walk away from her and and I just don't know how many of them there are if that's going to make a difference in ...\nWho who is back I'm sure to as he got money from the air and see that\nHe hasn't done a lot from the artsy now it's gotten so I I Would assume that some this coming to the states\nNot a lot there not point you notice that Trump has endorsed them a Mike Pence endorsed him the other day um but I didn't yeah he did but they haven't been here to campaign for him and generally they they go into the places where they know they got a fighting chance to win\nObviously they probably don't feel he's got a whole lot of if Jeff deal wins this thing is going to be because it's a grassroots effort just kind of like the Trump election is going to be a grassroots effort where where he didn't get a hold on Trump got support from like nobody right nobody supported Trump\nI'm eating at the media he didn't get to even members of his own party politicians they all through him onto the boss Mitt Romney\nYou know all of these people who reminded the bus and he won because he had grassroots support it deal wins this thing is going to be because he wins it with grass roots support and he's going to be a number of Democrats are going to have to walk away from one and I see that as a possibility\nYou do but I'm not I'm not going to put my mortgage on it more I wouldn't know\nBecause I mean you know traditionally Massachusetts again my brain tells me this thing is going to go to ... with Warren comfortably\nIs a computer program to count your vote for the other seven books or the other guy turning up is is is futile because your vote for your guy it's counter to six or the other guy it's all done through a computer\nRight thank you very ... very much that's a one call a day my friend he called I Love this guy he calls the disguises his voice he does all kinds of things to try to get through and you know she's got some stuff to contribute I appreciate that and uh is involved in and you know what you gotta you gotta love guys like ours because they\nAnd you know what you gotta you gotta love guys like first because they are involved in too many people that are not how many people you know and I'm sure you know a lot of them are not are engaged in any of this thing could care less about it anyway you could just to frustrate you anybody out there get mad at anybody does anybody have a spouse sent home that is not that into\nA political thing and uh you know what my wife could care less my wife will soon she'll watch or whatever she's watching it I'll sit tonight without my computer screen in my headphones on and watch the rally [noise] believe it or not you know I'm\nMaybe that's the balance I Need to my life has said somebody on the ... in my relationship just doesn't done you know not much into it ah I don't know maybe that\nKeeps me from going out of my mind [laughter] 'cause I don't talk about it much at home we talk about politics much at home I talk about it all day long right so I don't need to talk about in ten at home [laughter] find a way not as excel five hundred your next to the w._b. sound good afternoon\nMy with you I'm Sorry hello am I worth you\nKnow you are when you're on the air yeah\nWell I didn't know first of all I Know you know about it just got a couple of comments okay or above voting on it is important and no matter what people think it is important to get out their vote sure [noise] I I uh I've been an independent\nSince I was probably Eighteen well maybe Twenty years old okay go ahead and here's why I thought\nSo I'll I'll be voting for Charlie Baker\nIs a because Charlie Baker is a Republican he puts his or intelligence for front of his party that's very important in the state needs that I Will be voting for Elizabeth Warren and the reason I'll be doing that is\nI don't want the Republicans\nTaking over everything and if we can get her up in the Senate and here's what I like about a they say she doesn't do anything for the state and everything I'm fine with\nThat she is running around holding a tiger by the tail all the tar and she's been doing that I write their\nWhich which tigers you but do you mean she's pulling the tiger mother to\nWell what she does she's she never around she's always out doing things she's all in the Midwest\nShe's all on the west coast she's down south\nBut would you rather have her here in Massachusetts where she belongs\nTo what how many people get in their car and go to the office every day or two there are a lot tight and and wait for doing vote in the center well no no she's oh she's hustling she's being part of the things she's talking to people\nShe so she can to put any agenda that's\nGoing on but boy the hold on how does that help us though I don't care about the people out in ... Indiana that people out in Oklahoma or whatever I mean I care about him I Love 'em all but I mean we have issues here at home that we need a U.S senator to help us take care of like for example we\nActually she just said that that is sort of total owner too high but we're not talking about the president talking about the Senate race we're talking about no no but no but if she saw yeah but you're not answering my question my friend I'm asking you are I'm Sorry I Know ... the\nQuestion I'm asking you is why do you want a senator who's going to be out all over the place when we have issues here at home and we have no delegation in Washington fighting for example the mayor says you're on Wednesdays and will tell me repeatedly I Wish I wasn't I said sometimes I feel like the Lone Ranger down there in Washington\nBecause we don't have a delegation fighting for things white the fishing industry wouldn't you rather have\nAnd look I'm I'm\nI'm a ... year old um I've never been a fan of Ted Kennedy's Barney Frank ...\nAnd Barney Frank or an office the way they were fighting for our industry you wouldn't see the fishing industry going through when it's going through now if Ted Kennedy and Barney Frank were in office I mean I I like that is used in Oklahoma\nYou have to physically be there anymore technology has changed you can you can cast her influence on subjects not physically being\nThat we've got a city council that says it's written to her for time her Anwar in a hurry and Markey four times asking for help is never even got a response never even got a letter back\nYou know that's the only reason I mean that's reasonable\nWell no one is so what what I'm suggesting to you is that you know I don't care if she's a Democrat or whatever we need somebody who's going to be here that's going to help us with our problems national we elect these scandals going on thinking deal\nThat's my point okay well we'll get you took a a kind of a roundabout way to get there but uh but you think what what what can you point after Warren has done for us here\nWell who's well who's going to step up as it is a democratic senator and I don't want deal there\nBut ... you're still not answering my point my point is Warren has done nothing for the seating of African you can you pointed anything she's done to them to sit in your bedroom because I had\nA I'll tell you what\nI can answer that question my reasoning is is is pretty much what I said I got to tell you I'm not that tie on what everybody's story um I see I see Charlie Baker I see what he's throwing um no I see what Donald Trump is doing and\nI also see like people like Marty Walsh and and uh so either I don't you don't want it really comes around to whatever Elizabeth Warren comes up with it keeps on the Republican art or the or the ...\nYeah but see that is that is what's wrong with our political system you're being totally partisan and you're not you're saying well you know the electrodes have been why even though she's I Can't tell you anything she's done is to benefit our area but it keeps a Republican out of office how about if we elect the person\nAbout if we elect the person who is going to do something for our city regardless of whether the Democrat or Republican ... who's\nWho's who's going to step up and do that\nI Believe jak deal will do held a lot better job in the ... warrants ... been doing and besides which he already told us that if she gets elected on November six November seventh start your campaign for president which means she's going to be a while for two years running for president\n... she's she got ... I wouldn't vote for her for person I'm just trying to keep the Republicans and check it and I envy him by bipartisan right there on the on the partisan right there are so lonely and we'll go for I look\nAt all you would vote for some just while you understand what you're saying trying to wrap my brain around your logic you you're saying you would vote for somebody who's done nothing for us just to keep somebody out of office the might do something for us\nWho okay are you telling me you tell me at least in the Democratic party in my mind has some cohesion the\nWhole he what kind of cohesion you talking about can you give me an example of cohesion\nYeah yeah let's go right back to Obama and many Trump's come in and all these students and everything apart he eats various oh they don't go to swear but he but he sure as heck is going to turn things around me and said advocates would go back\nThe holy you speaking and very very broad generalities here you're not giving me any kind of specifics of what you're talking about it and it's making a very difficult to follow your logic sir with all due respect you I Do I Can't follow okay I Know for people from public office that I feel like going to do the best possible job they can for the city I live in the state I live in in the country\nNow you're not getting any examples of how\nIn pushing toward the party right now I really am I'll pushing high\nI Know you are in the Democratic party has lost like eleven twelve thousand seats in the last eight years because they're not delivering for the people that's the problem for the Democratic party that's why they're in ...\n... ... well he held a lot better than what the Democrats have done was that the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in him or fifty years of better a lot of the ...\nThe guy who's been around for two years terrorist things apart and then putting his label on it that I'm fixing things he's done absolutely nothing\nFine well that that I'm Sorry my friend but it got to get apartments near your time's up anyway but I mean you just totally uninformed tonight and I think that's unfortunate I really do I find a way not as five hundred your next the w._b. yourself good afternoon I'm\nGoing to have as much for your last caller a black man in the fall yeah\nAnd it doesn't matter at Republican Democrat or somebody's going to take care of the people they like you were saying before there's like a as Warren here what about your own fault with all the ... point we have one in seven states that have been windfall\nReturned to weed those out so you know ... almost half ...\nOkay and where did it help on that and he came up through one of the meetings over that you might have thought much about your recall yeah and he totally walk and I was brought up the ... ... ... and she's going to belong to think working\nThere wanted you know what's going on because you're going to genetic ... it could also hurting that's what they're saying what can you have also hurting ... printing where just want to seven states that have that ... that and we've written many many times because that was you know that the pet", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "22"}
