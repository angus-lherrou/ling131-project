I can tell you\nMy staff and I investigated more more cases of domestic violence and sexual abuse than I ever care to remember ... I've never seen anything a travesty this is an absolute disgrace with these Democrats have done and you know I'm a ... year old and I'm Sorry I got a lot of good democratic friends\nThis is nothing but one of the worst disgrace as in how this ever reach the Senate and how we're ever reach the Judiciary Committee is beyond anybody's rational ... understanding I couldn't be ... it's disgusting and you know do what they're doing to this man is one thing\nAnd you know what she's a victim too and I I Wonder why people that you know when when things like this are investigated they're investigated very carefully professional people\nThat know what they're doing this was just slipped slide them away get her in there before them they're going to throw her it under the bus as soon as they're done with her and one of the things that stood out for me and\nShe's been treated it's no wonder they didn't want to bring out any of her notes or any of the uh the information that might be available through the therapist because frankly if you look at it closely Barry she's been being treated for this little delusional disorder\nSo laid off the bat you got a problem and how her husband her family could allow her to be ... but then again she's extremist she's a political activist they grabbed a hold of her and that Feinstein she should be run out of Congress on a pole\nSo let me let me ask you this Jimmy ... how did she become a victim and all this I understand the Democrats have user but I mean she came forward first started I mean she's the one that took the initiative to contact Feinstein's office well actually she contacted a congresswoman for us um you know she came over to she kept trying to reach the press also\nOr her evaluation of what she thought of ah the the uh afford story versus what she thought of\nA Kavanaugh story and and how she process all that information um because when you're making instantaneous judgments right you take everything into account you taking the the behavior the of the appearance the uh\nUh the story that you're being pedals right and you have to take that and you have to decide who's coming in and who's a who I'm going to be a you know okay we're leaving behind here so interesting stuff but if you've never call before I Love to hear from you guys and and let me know what you think about all of this five away nine six o five hundred thank you for waiting an extra WB assume\nBuried hey a first time caller appreciate it\nI just want to tell you after forty eight years of being raised in the Democratic family I finally became I'm enrolled wow has I'm disgusted with the way that Democrats are acting and I'd just like to make two comments the gentleman that talked about Kavanaugh's mother\nShe was involved in a case where a missed Ford's\nMother and father lost their house and\nThe other thing and I don't know if\nA lot of people realize this I just finished reading a book called contempt by Ken Starr cabinet himself was heavily involved in the impeachment process of Mr Clinton\nThat's correct he was an attorney wasn't needed an attorney on a visit was already working for that committee and he was\nVery very involved in writing up the charges\nIn that case and I just you know that the Democrats have done so many lonely things it wouldn't put it past them to do something because of this wow\nI just like to say that to your audience and I well I think it's going to hurt the Democratic party very much\nWow well that's a somebody forty eight years is a Democrat and you finally had enough\nRight I've had enough [laughter] wow okay thanks to live thanks for the call appreciate it hey call me back again okay I Will I enjoyed talking\nTo you I Love smart people and I love people who ah who

I'll give you a second or two here\n[laughter] okay are you back yep I'm here yet\nThe mother actually a that was founded by ... and I did was among the the mortgage company okay I made a deal with the parents that they weren't going to foreclose on her okay\nThat they had come up with some deal that's what most of the\nSay uh she's not the one that ... made them lose the house ... okay or it's just probably a coincidence the thing that's the most important to me\nIs with us this country go winters this country go the only thing we're not doing now is assassinating\nEach other while physically yeah I mean this this such hatred when you listen to that woman scream into a\nA quake in the elevator you look at me when I'm Talking to this woman I don't care what happened to her she's absolutely wrong in talking to a government official the way she did as if she's more important than the rest of the world\nRight so what do you think happens from here but we lost you hello you their primary friend we lost\nYou there in that but you made your point is he points to solid in and I agree with you totally breakdown and civility is where we're at right now and I'm the level to which we have lost respect for each other which was totally on display last week absolutely no question about that five or six o five hundred Europe next in Libya some good afternoon\nI'm not a first time caller but I Will\nThat's all right we love our we love our regular stew\nI Will tell you that it was posted that she's already we saved over nine hundred thousand dollars in donations from her story um from\nFrom all different ah groups that are agreed with her thinking that she's a victim right how um how that plays into the picture I don't know but um what do you think those two envelopes that that woman handed that gentleman contained because it looked very very suspicious you start on\nYeah you're talking about the video was by Sheila Jackson Lee the Democratic congresswoman from Texas who are handed a um I saw an envelope I didn't see to see what you would they both together or\nI had in ... she handed one to another individual cocaine another video\nBut um what was that all about um why at that particular time um\nAnd she looked like they can ask the captain just need the canary I mean she's looking after she handed him the things she was looking all around right and that's certainly\nAn editor for that and there's and there's a ... you ever watched James Bond and yeah you always put it in for that the\n... pocket and your jacket yeah and and he didn't look at it so it wasn't like it was a surprise you wasn't like oh gee once this you know we're really picked it up and looked at it he took that right out of her hand and slid it right into his pocket without even looking at it so he knew what he was getting ... Amri was\nYeah very very suspicious why that and they're um cameras all around that was most bizarre but um\nAnyway um [noise] you know some something did happen to her whether she's got a feed the figures are the person's right is probably very debatable very sketchy but obviously you know something happened to her\nUm and it it is what it is but I think going forward that has to be more documentation to make these people you know be be more um you know fourth with\nWith information and I'm sure this happened to a lot of women find that there's got to be more documentation and you just can't say some years later this is what happened to me because\nWell you know what I mean this has to be an issue it never has to be an issue because well I get it I'm not a woman I don't I I'm married to a woman I've got two boys and I raised I don't have any daughters but look the bottom line is this being sexually\nIt's totally sucks and it screws around with your brain I get all of that but if you do not file a police report there was no way to thirty five years thirty six years from there is no DNA evidence there is no witnesses there's nothing\nFor you later on to come back on if you got to file that police report immediately\nWell and and now having this discussion with my wife because she says oh you know he probably did a lot of law and I'm saying what I said you know obviously she's had this and about her mind\nUm when he became an attorney\nOkay he had to go before the bar that would have been a a point in time where she could have said hey you know some he shouldn't be an attorney for what happened to me\nNo that happened then he goes to be a judge and again she could have said hey you know something he shouldn't be a judge because of X Y and Z and now only becomes the Supreme Court justice why all of a sudden because she had\nTwo opportunities before from all these complaints and stop them and now all of a sudden to me that's what looks bad that the timing of it just what's going on in the politics it's thanks ...\nBe even even more so than that and I get everything you said no you agree with you but the even more so than that she's got no sacks and that's the thing I mean all you know\nShe might have been able to come forward and say well look this one will you know cooperate my story on oil or you know I've got a picture of us in the place together or whatever you know where he happen on this date this is how I got there this is how we got home but with none of them that\nDoes any sane reasonable person expect us to punish him he says I didn't do it I wasn't there I don't know or\nAnd and and another week going by what the FBI they're going to do their investigation and as everybody said that they don't come to conclusions they they interview people they put the facts of forward and all this is going is just postponing a week\nAnd if it comes back which I I feel it's going to come back with with exactly what happened with all these hearings\nThe Democrats still aren't going to accept that and says now um it was it was it was not done to our satisfaction um I mean that grasping at straws right now ah and I don't really think I'm that they've got to find out any more information\nAnd it's still not but this is all to see this is all part of the plan this is all the ... it's all about stalling because the Democrats figure if they can stall this long enough\nThen they take control of the Senate in November because they actually think this is helping them they actually think there's going to be a great big blue wave as a result of all of this\nUm they just I don't know I understand how they think bad but they think this is going to benefit them they're going to get control of the Senate and in the new study in Canada and they've succeeded um so I mean this is all about stalling it long enough to they can get control of the Senate and then as a moot point anyway and then they become\nThis goes this is not just another\nUh this is not just another race you this is an issue that a lot of people feel very strongly about and if you've never called the talk show before and you want to weigh on this I Would love to hear from you I Would love to get your thoughts on what you think about this the cabin a case where it goes from here where do we go from here\nAnd ... who pays for this November is going to be the Republicans are the Democrats are nobody what what are you going\nTo get your thoughts five away now six o five hundred and we've got to one more hour to go after the news we're here we're ... car from three angel seven to nine again thanks ...

five hundred leaders loves them don't leave your comments unbelievable you assumes police said first dog\n[noise]\n\n\nWriting welcome back to the program seven minutes after two o'clock on a Monday afternoon I understand there's some light rain in Rhode Island right now my wife's\nIn Rhode Island she just actually music raining where you are and I said no it's cloudy here she was raining here so\nUh she's up in northern Rhode Island so if you're heading in northern Rhode Island bring the umbrella right maybe some showers as you just heard there from the ABC six weather center forecast a um overnight into the overnight hours will I have the forecasts of course updated throughout the day for you right here\nOn a fourteen twenty WBAI Sam so we're talking about what else we're talking about the\nUm [noise] we're talking about the the Kavanaugh story\nAnd kind of tying it into the lives Warren story I'm not quite sure if you've heard but to lose Warren has finally confirmed that she is in fact uh thinking about running for president\nAnd she'll let us know the day after election day what she's going to do in November of course was warned he's up for re election in November and um\nI got to tell you she's talking to somebody out in the hallway here and now you can't think of a ... in my opinion a bigger campaign blunder than than what lives weren't just did it\nUm I don't know whether it's going to hurt her tremendously because she had at least according to the poll such a a a big lead over Jeff deal\nWhich blows my mind to begin with but here you've got a woman\nA senator who has done absolutely nothing I mean the biggest rapidly Warren is that she's done nothing\nFor New Bedford ... nothing for Massachusetts and she has been serving in the Senate and it is so now she's like weeks before what six weeks before the election she said well you know what I'm going to run for president after you are re elect me\nA ... well you know what I've been saying right the best way to keep all this with Warren from being elected president in the twenty twenty to defeat her here in two thousand and Eighteen she's ... she's lied to you folks she has wide to your right to your face about not ...\nBecause while she's telling you about one ... well I'm not even thinking about running for president she's been running all around the country campaigning\nTrying to grow up me but that that evolved very quickly from trying to grow me too well I think he would have raped me\n... I think he would have raped me\nHe never got her clothes off prefer according to the allegations so how do we so so that's kind of progressing this thing rather quickly right it's not as though she was naked on the bed and he was\nSo how do we go from he was pulling at my clothes to try to rape me attempted rape this is a big difference between groping an attempted rape 'cause they're not\nAnd then we go from that while he was drunk oh well you know we hear yours falling down drunk all the time this guy this guy who\nHas achieved more you know heart rate all of these different things top of his class and he was falling down drunk all the time how they how did he get his homework done if he is falling down drunk all the time and not only that he was belligerent angry anger issues\n[noise] by the time this hearing was done Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told us that he actually ... in school he was in the air ... and then he Ralph in school this guy's got to be\nSo their media advances this rise through the course of this hearing is all of this he's no longer\nSeventeen year old guy\nWho wrote this girl on the bed now he's a rapist it's being reported is that was factual he's a rapist right on the usa can't even stop their USA Today has to say do not let this guy on the basketball court but young girls\nSuggesting edition pedophile to hang on and on and goes and it will continue to go on\nThis is what we've done to this man and his family was not one single shred of evidence not not one find a way not now six hundred thanks for hanging on your next thing that will be a Sam\nHi so high I you know when you you brought up some interesting things because as far as um you know woman saying that all they're going to do is call the cops he did this and that that he's gone he'll go yet is the case I Know from personal experience yeah because my wife used to be a dispatch\nFor the duck with the police department and she was an alcoholic\nIt every time we got into an argument she'd call the cops and all she used to say was he did this and he did that boom the handcuffs Rami I Want to do finally the judge got tired of seeing me and I ended up doing almost a year in a house or correction because of her accusations\nNow I had pictures on my cell phone that I took of the damage she did to me when she was drunk I had my whole um was all invented would fingernail prints and everything else but that didn't matter\nThat didn't matter you know she was a girl she worked for the ... uh the police department at one time so I was I was you know I was as good as going\nWell so your reputation was shot him a shot to hell when I'd be based on ... and she was never even asked to prove that they would end time every time\nWhen she was supposed to show up in court for the charges that were allegedly against me she would never show up\nWell\nAnd then finally one day the judge said you know I'm going to tell you something I was\nWondering the last time it happened I I uh I was in the hospital I forget what the hell was I went to the hospital for they check for something\nI was handcuffed in the hospital to the hospital that I had two police officers wondering side and I was a ring the judge\nThe the ... and the the the the ... somebody from the da's office came to the hospital and I was a rain right there in the hospital and I learned from the hospital ... and correction\nAnd you didn't you didn't put your hands on her no\nWell I did too to get away from me right she used to come at me like would would would [laughter] I like I said she was she was a lot colic and she was she got pretty violent so yes I pushed her away from me you know get away from me\nSelf defense yeah you know you\nKnow I mean I just push throw away just get away from me yeah and I one time I went out\nWith the burden is on or you see that that's what's so unfair here now the burden of proof falls on you which is exactly what's happening to Kavanaugh yeah rather than having to prove that said that he did this he's having to prove that he didn't do it in the same thing when I'm Out here to prove\nThat I didn't do it right now I go to prove that you can't I mean especially if you both good marks on your right yeah\nI had I had a I had fingernail imprint on ... on on my own and I took pictures of of the of what she said to me but that didn't matter because she used to work for the dot with police department and she was a female I was I was automatically gone I was automatically guilty I had no\nCan chance excuse my language I had no chance\nRight\nAnd as far as the big thing the girl that got raped at the time was my mother's boyfriends granddaughter\nAnd I was in big big dance the night after it happened\nI went there with a friend was sitting at the bar and all of a sudden the door opens in about ten at least ten guys come walk then I'll go baseball bats and they said who is here last night\nRecording it was like I was like not me [laughter] so they just sat in Boston\nThe place up they they they rip the phone out so the guy couldn't call the cops and they just started to Boston everybody up rip them fossils off the wall me and my buddy we made we made it out the back door we were gone I was I was gone yeah\nThis one of the night after that that it happened I hadn't even heard that wow yeah oh I was there you know yeah\nBut you know what the the girls the girls the victim of that big a big dance rape case love\nYou ended up getting she ended up getting killed and foreign yeah she got in a car accident or something yeah but I mean you know one of the ... granddaughter\nSo it doesn't matter why she was in the bar it does is she said she was a Sunday night she stopped by to get some cigarettes or whatever out of the vending machine or a\nYeah but you said you I heard you say well why couldn't she'd go to a store or whatever\nYou know that's what some people see I I didn't say that at least she has every right in the world Walking Dead bar um but but some people said well she brought it on herself because uh you know she didn't have to go to that bar for cigarettes you could have gone to bottom in a store like a jelly is Hassan\nGoes no you know and I know all the guys that were involved in the ... I Know all the guys ... years ago were going back like in the early eighties now right [noise] yeah I'm ... years ago I used to hang around the ... are used to go I used to frequent ... so I'm not French treat called the pope yeah\nAnd all the guys that were involved in a gang rape they used to hang it up I Know every single one of them ... for Julio and the other guys I Know every single one of them\nRight right right there are a lot with the other night that it happened but I was the the the night after I did when you went there hum I'm Sorry I said it's a damn good thing you weren't there no\nOne does not the place you want to be hey appreciate it my friend thank you very much for the call 'em but no no no my point was my point was that our attitudes in society and there were these people I can remember talking to them saying well she deserved what she got because she shouldn't have been in that bar in the first place\nAnd you say well why not I mean it was Nineteen eighty one eighty one somewhere in there\nWhy not wasn't Nineteen twenty\nI mean but you know so why wasn't she's not a place that I Would advise suggested my wife or my daughter or somebody go hang around it but she had every right to walk into that bart\nTo get cigarettes and you know what do you even if she was making out with the guys maybe it's making out with that does not give you the right to rape somebody there's a big difference there\nAnd if a person says no woman says no\nThat means no simple as that it means no um\nI certainly understand certainly understand\nMentality that many not just men but women because I have them they call me here when we talk about rape so we talk about you know very thinks well you know she was dressed the way she was dressed you brought it on herself or she shouldn't have been in that place anyway what did you expect there's going to happen there were then\nShe shouldn't be walking the street that time and I wonder what do you think's gonna happen walking the street that kind of so I mean I've never subscribe to that but by the same time\nI've never subscribe to the theory that just because a woman comes for us as he did this to me\n\nThat you have to take her side and believe for you certainly got to hear her you're going to listen to her and you got to give her an opportunity and you certainly go to investigate what she says but you damn well gotta have some evidence because if you don't have the evidence society is not obliged to take somebody down\nBased solely on your word because she has rights too\n\nBut what we're doing in this country right now is so many people are just saying all she said it happened and if you don't believe for when you're no good he's a rapist and you're taking his side but no\nYou remember the ... a great movie a few good men when they're on trial on a a carnival is on trial\nAnd when he won a diminished got herself or when he had a exposed himself the first one is a yeah after a little bit of it it exposed himself he said you're on the witness housed writes\nWright Patt line you know dramatic as it might have been I think applies here\nYeah absolutely that's that's the debate anyway that's my two sons thanks for less than other than ... thanks for presenting a Great Britain or show\nSpending a part of it I appreciate very much I'm pleased costs more five ... not six because everybody makes a contribution to the show and they really do have some basic fundamental was makes it interesting to find a way not as six or five hundred and you're next on WB assembled afternoon\nHow are you doing very good how are you sir good and very you know you're\nYou know the reason why shoveling White House is a show vote on a a national TV because he's up for election in November\nRight yeah yeah he's got the ads all over TV yeah he should have no problem getting reelected I mean it's Rhode Island and I you know it's a Democrat Democrat and he really doesn't have a whole lot of competition yeah\nYou noticed Kevin Orr thing very you know how to make you a ... gun shy let me give you a little example I'm In ocean state job last week in Fall River near nice store long aisles\nUm and now I'm looking for body wash I'd go in there and I look around it's a long while it's pretty it's not that ... there's a woman in their right\nShe's looking for ... for soap and I'm ... so you know\nWhat would happen if she turned around and started screaming oh he touched me country\nRight now right did I turn around went right out of that I'll while and then later on when I\nWhen I hear I noticed that it was a couple of guys and then I went in in ... no ... I don't know if they have cameras in every aisle or not but can you imagine it would cost me thousands of dollars to prove my innocence yeah it's it's scary you\nKnow it is scary and you know it's unfortunate um I I've I've done um\nIn my lifetime I've I've had a second job in retail I haven't I haven't done a second job in a while but I used to all the years the kids were growing up so that we are you know a little bit of extra money for\nFor the holidays and all that kind of stuff that I work a day or you know maybe day here in day there in retail\nAnd I can I can tell you honestly this the first started to occurred to me you remember when like the little league teams first started to have girls on on the teams they made a little league teams for girls on the team and then there was all of this stuff about the coaches are touching the touching the kids\nAnd everything on a on a Monday yeah on on a rump\nSo then it got to be very scary uh that that coaches would not want to be alone with ah with any little girls or anybody on the team and I started thinking about just exactly what you did in the store and I'm Alone in a store in a little kid comes in you know\nYou know parents would ask parents actually do this right and this will blow your mind I work at one point I was working on a couple of times I worked in toy stores\nAnd parents would bring their kids in\nAnd tell the kid here you see here and play I'm just going to go down the hall the Sears and I'll be back\nAnd I was looking at a kid is like six or seven years old and I'm like whoa time out no you're not first of all I'm not you baby center\nI'm second of all you ... what parent leaves their kid alone in that age in a in a store while they go somewhere else and shop get out of here but what's in the back of my mind is if anything happened to that kid would that kid turns around and says I touched him or her whatever new I'm not going to be alone in the store with your kid just isn't gonna happen\nIt's always on your mind it isn't it has to be a new agent to proven innocent\nBut you know the same is true as you just said we're going to do the same thing can happen with an adult if if if you're in an idol with somebody or in a store alone with somebody wants to say they're not going to yell and I'm not\nTaking any chances under these conditions believe me\nWow and you can you imagine that we've actually gotten to that point in our in our society ad it said there yeah it really is yeah so this is obviously had an impact on you and your in your way of thinking yeah wow\nThank you my friend okay thank you appreciate it\nThat's that's scary anybody singing along these lines\nAnd I were becoming afraid to be alone with somebody\nWho are being alone in a store or you know who knows alone in a car with somebody that you've never you know really been maybe a first date or whatever then they still do that I mean I can remember going out on a first date\nBack years ago right you pick the young lady up or a ... when you were younger maybe her father drove or your father drove or whatever when you get your own wheels and you go and pick somebody up for the first time you're alone in the car\nHe dads can you just think today's day and age I mean you know anything that can happen to you\nOr because somebody else and screams oh he touched me she you know whatever I'm this has got to be having a dramatic impact on relationships between men and women in this country it really has has got to be scaring the bejesus out of people and I I Wonder how this impacts young people\nAre both of my kids are in committed relationships at this point but I I you know I I don't know I mean if you've got young if you got a young son out there any parents out there listening to me right now they have has a son maybe sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old or the dating\nAnybody or give your kid advice about just this thing I Love to know what you tell your kids at this point in this day and age with with all of this craziness going on is there anybody out there who is going through this right now and they're scared to death for your kids oh did they might be accused of something\nUm again my kids are grown but they're they're both in committed relationships and have been for a while um I I just wonder what it must be like as a parent and what advice he gave me a kids' book guys and girls for that matter\nBecause of what's going on right now in the in our society or a day and age I mean this is crazy stuff what about grownups any grownups within the sound of my voice you or maybe recently divorced\nOr widowed or whatever and you'd love to be out playing field or or whatever what's it like out there being a guy today come on guys I Want to hear from you what is it like out there being a guy today out on the uh you know playing the field\nWhat is it like come on what is it like being out there a guy Plainfield these days maybe you've been in a committed relationship for a while and you no longer and you'd love to find somebody\nBut you're afraid of what might happen to you\nWomen too I mean I I you know this isn't [noise] isn't entirely\nAbout men but men seems to be right now especially in this whole meet two day and age are are the guys are the ones right there on on the on the front line that face\nThese allegations in
