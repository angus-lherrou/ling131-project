the city council meeting last night we had to switch gears in at the moment and we're going to talk about another\nUm migrant caravan or this one from Honduras making its way through Central America and they hope eventually to get through Mexico went up to the U.S border and then cross I into our country\nA zero is some concern that this group of maybe three thousand migrants are his splintered into various a smaller groups\nHow to make it easier for them to gain access to the country's President Trump has put his foot down in ah who's been backed up by vice president Pence in inviting these folks not to try to make it to the U.S as a matter of fact the president has sent out a number of tweets are suggesting that he's willing to stop foreign aid\nOr to any country whose people may be involved in this in any country who do not act to stop this a caravan from moving forward Denver still kind of share of Tom ... is with me on the line right now sure if they actually time pre she and it's\nSo so this is nothing new and I worry that you know they'll get put in\nAfter the election suddenly we run into the same thing again ... ... you know they start making demands leveraging one says All right we'll give you this because then they created demand is unacceptable to the other side and here we are we're going to you're Twenty one and meanwhile we got more angel moms and dads are being put on the list of people\nTheir loved one here from all illegal aliens coming through this\nShow and they not only is that a concern in India of course the concern of the drugs in the end of the gangs and all the bad but we heard from mom and you should probably made this uh this this slim\nOr the other day but the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia indicated that these races are going to be one and by um by illegal immigrants did she sent straight out do you know ... you immigrants including documented the Indian undocumented so she's telling us right now there are illegal immigrants voting in our elections\n... very right now I can tell you there are thousands and thousands of people in this country who are operating under a couple of gentlemen driver's license that are fraudulent that you will not be able to tell unless you did query in and checked every one of what happened is that the the\nDominican cartels have been selling these you could have a very Richards id in Washington state and a very Richards exact id exact same identity in Massachusetts that's what's going on in some cases you may have for some for five\n... being used by five people all all the same thing the different states\nWe have got to get this under control working right now to a homeland security work if your eyes were were working on this imposter stuff which has to do with ... identifications is a felony understand well\nI'm encouraging sheriff across the country to start wearing your databases I just finished a will be here in Washington to try to get 'em\n... access to a database in Puerto Rico that all law enforcement be able to access immediately threw a fusion centers which would immediately identify somebody that's\nYou know you ... you have a victim in Puerto Rico right and we have criminals have you're using their identity or so we need we need to get a handle on that we have thousands in our prisons across the country to come in under under a name\nThey're right back out on the street because we don't know that unless we really you know\nWhere you're going to be databases and look deeper into the ... which I I've already done I've I've got to find one of my people fulltime do just that and we're we've already found a in our first where\nHe's twenty people in our on our database\nOf people in our facility we found to read it right off the bat that has a false identification one person after that as a lemon different I'd identification I'm so this is this is a big problem but one that we know we can we can hone in on and you know sort of thinking the system more accurate\nThis is something that the average citizen Abby and probably doesn't doesn't even realize is going on but it's something they can wrap their brain around you got Maria Susan who lives on north front street in New Bedford ... may be born in Nineteen fifty eight or whatever [noise]\nUm and somebody is using her name potentially or Social Security number to Ryan in in all of her information on me at least one other person is using them out there in the country that you have to\nBe back to what's going on but it's going it's out of control that that's how bad it is very but you can imagine when the voting absolutely\nAnd you would never even notice how would you how would the average citizen know that this was happening to somebody had taken the writing that way\nYou're what until the person got caught or do they use it for something that came back on them like which which they're not using it using it to get into how you can get to get into a it gets dry you know of course driver's licenses and all these things so so it's it's a real it's a huge huge problem I I spoke to the Washington if that's the idea of\nTrying to find the Senate to train the registry of motor vehicles that um\nYou know or is it different states so that when somebody\nAnd then that's the fault but at this age group here today and they can't they don't have enough information to you and they're suspicious that there's a number they called right away for the first doesn't walk out go to another registry somewhere else in another city or town and get off I view that way so it's um\nWe we got we got cut it off a new new approach their child but if you're ...\nOr ... making your way back from Washington DC right\nYeah\nAnd I appreciate you taking a few minutes with is why you're on the road and uh and chatting about this which after you get when you get back you have a safe trip back\nLike alright sheriff Jim Hodge in now on the uh [noise] movement\nOf this a human caravan or from\nGuatemala and Honduras um\nSome three thousand people making the way to the to the U.S border I and there's some indication that these this group is splintering a way it does not the first time that we've seen this this has happened to a couple of times now right there and many times and they're making the way here and the President Trump has a\nA really a put these countries that are eating or at least not stopping this caravan from making it through their countries through their territory\nIf you allow this to go on new allowed to you don't really you know bring your people home and if you allow these people to pass through your country we're going to immediately stop the foreign aid to you\nSo there's some incentive to get them to stop right um\nSee

used to say but it might have a because it was pretty good uh well I was working third shift at stop and show it was going through all my personal stuff\nYou hand the phone was in line and I didn't realize what was going on until I got a two thousand dollar phone bill wow okay [laughter]\nAnd I for the phone company I said I didn't do it and I ain't paying it they said well you'll have to go seven years without a phone and I said okay and that's when they started coming out with the first phone got myself a cellphone\nRight but that didn't help boat too much either because he reinstated before with mining and uh when I Move though and changed all my bank account for everything he got into those thank God for the whoa it was real good yeah well so what\nThis era was saying you know buried it could be somebody out there you and your ID\nWell you know today in today's day and age it's so much easier to rip off somebody's identity because everybody's got credit cards everybody's on line you've got all the way you said you know you're putting your information out there in ways that we never did before\nRight you know back in the day you write a bill uh you don't want to check where you would uh paying cash or whatever but today everything's done online or what's your debit cards and credit cards and that kind of thing so you put your every time you do that you're putting all your personal information at risk\nUm but it's scary to think about the share of is talking about any one of us probably has a four or five people using her idea out there and they're not necessarily for credit card purposes but for um identification purposes they may have a duplicate driver's license to ours the only thing different is their pictures on it instead of yours\nI'll tell you what though I disagree with you I remember growing up in the sixties in the in the seventies and there are a lot of folks that were illegally here from Portugal um ... you know as many as now\nWell may I add and I didn't do a head count but I mean we certainly did have a lot of folks that that came here illegally from Portugal and then melted into our society and now they've been good citizens they've they own houses in businesses and the kids would the schools and everything else [noise]\nUm you don't mind it so much if people are going to contribute to this ... you know when you're coming in here and you're saying okay which way's the welfare office then then that's a whole different story\nWell I myself growing up in the fifties and sixties I was young yeah yes there was a lot of Portuguese people but uh in those days they were sponsored\nWell OK yeah to some degree but if there were a lot of illegals too I mean they were coming in um in in the sixties in the seventies yeah the Salazar situation over porch with a lot of folks that are coming here legally I'm Out now I'm going to get all kinds of hate mail like I usually do all you have Portuguese people Portuguese people at all that's not the point in the early fifties\nAnd I would say uh no most of the ... I think was sponsored but do you write later on in the sixties yeah they were coming in from Canada to work and Chamberlain I Know that for\nThan they were they were coming in from over the border in a in a lot of them will come in here illegally and um\nYou know I mean ... yeah [noise] but you know the difference between that and what we're seeing today is a lot of the folks who come here illegally uh we're not coming here saying okay this is Portugal\nYou know and then we're going to live the way we want will gonna do you know they came here to work and they had a work ethic and there are a lot of ... property and a lot of them are you know they put their kids through school of they didn't have to the welfare office in ... and that's the problem that we have a lot of the immigrants who come here illegally today I think coming here to get the benefits\nWell I I Wish I Wish politicians like we used to have them go back the moderate Democrats the socialist Democrats we have now in the city\nWhile you know we can do that simply by not voting for any of the socialist Democrats just vote him out of office in ah in in that's the end of that story hey great call my friend I appreciated five away not nesting so five hundred your next the w._b. is em thanks for hanging on\nAnd Barry first read checking in from Missoula, Montana what's up in Montana how when you're done with Rob Rob watch the rally how the red hats for Trump dot com [laughter] I'll be the one in the red hats they okay it's tonight to rally in Montana or no tomorrow tomorrow night okay yeah well we got advanced\nWork to do out here you know you have no idea what a work involved before a a\nA a somebody as great as Trump or comes to an area like Missoula, Montana which is filled with pen ads and liberals and people like the mayor of New Bedford a you know the caller called up and said\nYou know he's ... this is ... theater the mayor tells us one thing he lives ...

I Believe right\nThe only whining he complained that we've heard about hurricane relief came from I'm\nFrom Puerto Rico last year if you remember\nWatch had been sued by this teacher in Berkeley because they wanted her records [noise] um I Can't believe these teachers I Can't I keep asking myself what is these people doing in our school system you know this woman's in middle school right\nAnd she's a she has this augmentation called I guess is bam or whatever you want to\nSay it has to be A M and by any means necessary\nOkay they got her on tape punch calling somebody and not see him punching them in the stomach wow oh yeah and then a she caused a ride and it was a riot she was in it and like twelve people got stabbed jeez yeah and there was\nThousands of dollars I don't know if this was around the Berkeley time oh what what you know where this\nHappened but she's a teacher you soon\nI'm Sorry did you say she was a teacher\nYeah she's a middle school teacher belief in middle school right oh my God yeah and um\nShe was on it any way to pay something like eleven thousand dollars in legal fees I was reading this article about her and I'm than myself and now this guy was talking about south funding these and I I had read another article about him in the groups that he was paying and I couldn't find up but um you can bet he's connected\nHe's connected to all those left groups\nYeah we're talking to us and those who might be just tuning in they weren't listening in the last hour China's caravan this human how are the people that it's moving up rice a to Honduras Guatemala Guatemalan on some\n... they're hoping to get to to the Mexican border but Trump is saying look if you don't stop these people and turn them around if they make it to our border we're going to stop you from Lucia foreign aid you guys\nAnd you know when this guy was talking to you know the other caller was talking about all those poor people move and I said to myself you know what I never really\nThought about that you know if they're not buses are they're just walking\nYeah you know I Would assume that a lot of wire and then a lot\nOf people and I thought to myself you know what I I Can't fathom that I don't know if that's true I have you seen any of this\nWhat we've seen videos yeah you can see videos back I've got a photograph here in the group of the group um and they are walking and they're on their on for at least in this photograph of but I don't know whether the walk in the entire time or is it but if you do something about it for a moment do if you're going to take three thousand people by bus you can feel what about forty people on the bottom of\nThe F. I. sixty maybe the most yeah\nYeah so I mean I Would stick out like a sore thumb you would think the media would see those buses if there were buses because they have to be nearby\nUm I ... I really believe they are walking at least most of them are um\nIt doesn't make sense to me that when that when that guy said that I said to myself no I never thought about them walk\nAll the food thing makes perfect sense in that somebody's got to be buying these people food because I mean if you're walking through a Honduras or who's got the wherewithal to be able to feed three thousand people walking through there I didn't know that clean my covered out I Know I Know about your covered but\nUm so I mean somebody is providing money and resources in order to feed these small enough and it's\nGot to be here like I couldn't find that article way he had supplied money to all these different groups but you know I keep asking myself\nWhat what's behind his mind you know he's thinking\nUm what is he doing to our country you know I can remember having a speech he made one time saying how easy it was to take over a country\nYou know and and how you can turn people against each other whether it's with color or religion or whatever that it was so easy and I thought to myself is this what you doing\nNow is what he's doing him I mean he wants to change us to be more like Europe you know he wants to\nGo to rule ... can you get what I'm saying I mean the the other side\nOf doing this when things got there's gotta be somebody behind this wouldn't you think\nWell I think I think the ultimate plan of these these global as soon as a um a he's a born in this world of the world uh born in this world than it was yeah that that you know and run by\nPeople who um I don't think they'd be electing people but they would be people that would be um all working on maybe like a committee who knows the world's committee [laughter] yards\nTerrorists I don't know I mean but I mean globalism when you think about globalism new knocked on the borders and everybody's like Europe when they have the the they did they still have the European Union\nAll I can think of when they knock down the borders and let everybody come sure no one is I mean you know ... what do you get out and\nSo you have nothing nothing so you go to central economy or you know when did sharing a currency and ah you know sharing everything\nAnd becoming one one big global back on the euro [laughter] miserable nuts as far as I can see there\nYou know having a rule of law there is no broad as you look in and tell them am as far as I'm concerned it's a free for all that's how I look at it\nYou know no yeah it's scary out there\nI mean that's where the left in this country is going and then you know with a lot of these folks on the left\nUm are being a run from behind the scenes by people like Soros in in the likes of him or they believe in this world new world order and I believe in is globalism\nAnd um you know these these folks lie dormant for a while they never go away they they lie dormant the line you know they're not well then you don't want this is really the first time they haven't been lying dorm and usually when you get a a because the pendulum swings swings back and forth so you get you know conservative\nA thought in the country and in these groups kind of go underground for a little while\nThe game is one the wealth that too he's done what he's caught up in his father's father wanted to change the world and he believed it was through communism right um so he's doing he's doing what he wants to do and he talks about his messianic fantasies and sometimes he thinks he's dangerous because he thinks he's God\nHe says things that he said he even said it on sixty minutes\nUm he treats and by the way\nHe treats truth you know you heard a Cory Booker say that oh that's your truth in that truth well that wasn't a surprise to me because for years he had been writing about truth truth to a Korean is a\nDifferent is the truth to Christian so he's treating truth as ... ... ... troops as an absolute\nYou know there's only one ... one way right one not two thirds truth but he treats truth is a variable and and that gives them a lot of leeway I'm with the rest of the stories\nHe creates the people to play that he creates the media do this we report um it's important to know the agenda that he won and it's no God no guns no religion at any time\nNo good government because you don't really have representation you have bought and paid for politicians\nYou're going to get through my question here you're kind of answer my questions use objective is a\nGlobal warning to water I'm like okay does he want to be part of a governing that global warming world order ...
