I just thought good reporting was coming I didn't think he'd actually dive into what is going on in the dynamic here I Want to go back to ... and ... yeah I've only met Jared what's up for about five seconds are introduced by Lighthizer somewhere I don't have any field for him I don't know how smart he is\nI don't know I gather is very smart I don't know how he uses this ambiguity\nBut what do you think he is advising about ... because the the the Congress in the Magnitsky yesterday and that's not an option I mean that's not we can't break off relations with the Saudis\nNo we can't it's a very difficult situation and I don't know\nWhat happened we don't know what happened but no one feels good about it and each and every passing day we all feel worse about what probably happened and one of the things I point out in the book is that the Trump Administration signals during the transition and the administration itself\nGave very strong signals to the Saudis that\nThey were as long as they were allied with us and reliably so and lots of issues Yemen financing for refugee relocation both in Jordan and in Syria\nAre not picking up the cause of the Palestinians letting them know that look you're not the longer you wait the deal that you're going to get what the Trump administrators only gonna get worse so don't wait and don't expect us to save you all those issues gave them a lot of latitude that latitude lead to a miscalculation here\nI don't know that is the deep fear within the administration that there was a sense that they could do something like this and not suffer repercussions and that has got to be dealt with if you're\nNot in ... I'm going to be talking later today with a senior administration official about this\nYou're going to want to go back to your book or the White House\nPress corps now divided pretty clearly down the line and I put into the people who read and think and those who simply shine who want to be on TV you're a reader and a thinker\nMind not saying that 'cause you said nice things about the radio show I appreciate that I didn't expect that when I read Mr Trump's wild ride but thank you but I'm Wondering if the White House is going to he's going to be able to map\nThe serious people in the press corps and work with them to communicate or not to propagandize but to communicate\nUh I'm certainly open to that uh I haven't seen a lot of evidence of that um but every everything falls in politics and even with this administration which though because of the president because of his innate sense of confidence about himself approach things in a\nPretty ritualized fashion but\nAh if they're open I'm I'm always I'm literally always there and what I what I Hope from the from the book is that people will make exactly the conclusion you did that this is a serious assessment of things that have actually happened and there's some thought and some deep reporting there and it's believable and\nIt's therefore of used to everyone who was curious about this story is one where he's a big story you know what\nI hear it's huge and the north Korea side of it uh let me can cook this way or you quote Madison as being the key player Derrick Christian or the key player we've also got secretary of state Pompeo and in ...\n... of course at the CIA Gina Haspel affair agent and then cook hits the strongest national security team are they working together major Garrett or are they all pursuing different agendas and occasionally overlap\nNo I think in the main they're working together because the president's directives are very clear their unambiguous there are times when the president says things or imagine things or throws things into the mix sometimes simply\nTo provoke a reaction or to see what people say or to think outside the box trust me he did that a lot and I think he still does with Afghanistan I think he's been devil about what to do in Afghanistan\nBecause it just continues on and this sort of grinding way but in the main America First means America First a national security strategy was put together in rapid fashion it was direct it was comprehensive it covered a lot of things previous national security documents didn't and that reflects\nThe core beliefs and the core approach to this president and in that sense the signals are clear are there are times when the president sort of\nPut ... in the universe with is Rick and traits yes for sure\nFor sure [laughter] assert Trump's wild ride is just must reading the thrill chose scream and occasional blackouts of an extraordinary president ...
