motivated\nUm don't forget Rand Paul being tackled six ribs broken\nUm windows in New York or Republican office smashed and a warning was left there\nUm so I mean this goes on and on and on I mean plus the threats a\nHarassing people gas stations in restaurants and in that type of thing or you had the dock sing incident uh [noise] of Republicans\nA Ted Cruz other prominent Republicans harassed the a home address another personal information of Republican such a a Senator Lindsey Graham ah Mike Lee Orrin Hatch all posted a Wikipedia\nA Colorado senator or Cory Gardner of Colorado his family was also docks and someone said gardeners wife of graft\nThe all of them by adding um so I mean this this goes on and on and again you've had the physical threats against President Trump\nWere Maxine Waters who said that he should be a you know we're going to take care of him and he's had to narrow threatened to punch him out or Joe Biden wants to take them behind the woodshed on behind the school or whatever the hell it was a\nYou had a Florida Man who is charged ... threatening to shoot members of Congress who voted against Kavanaugh a sixteen months ago you had a left wing Bernie Bro\n\nAttempting to mass disaster nation of Republican congressmen including us Stevens college who was a badly injured in that shooting a gym so you know for the um for the Democrats to stand out there and claim by you know this is a\nThis is all Trump's falls I mean come on let's get real about it right by the way I think so five hundred thanks for hanging on your next to Sam\nHey Barry how are you pretty good how are you oh not bad um you know it's a when I heard all this science today and yesterday about about the the bombing issue or a you know first thing I thought was um okay it is not out there the second thing I thought was\nIs this saying you know tail wagging the dog I'm just like the movie wag the dog where something is created as a distraction because the ... the current narrative prior to the\nUh bombs being put out there I was was not favorable to Democrats um so you know when I'm yeah there there's the typical thing everyone was saying that Clinton or for instance was to distract from Monica Lewinsky started it you know firing cruise missiles into the middle east\nUm which was a you know again a wag the dog scenario so I mean if there if you know depending on who the says ... whoever it is is that not either way but um you know we're not we're not going to find the name or the person or the motive until\nA while after the election because I'm a list that said that this will continue to fit a narrative even if they know absolutely tomorrow who the person is unless it's a Republican\nIf it happens to be a Democrat then you're never going to hear about it\nSo well my my guess is that Trump called sessions first thing yesterday and said I Want a name on my desk before the weeks out\nRight yeah well that would be great I think that if if you got if the deep state isn't are still deep stating\nAlong yeah I'm a ... you know I I mean there's a lot of rats and that program unfortunately that he inherited\n'em and I are but but anyway a good\nThing is that you pointed out um is that uh you know first thing is um they immediately press immediately went to attack Trump so they actually ruin their own narrative because uh if they try to attack this the Trump\nPeople that are hardcore Trump supporters are going to go here we go again so it doesn't matter you know ... first thing is no one's been injured which is great um but so now it becomes a obviously you're not is not the type of a\nUm you know brave threat but at the end of the day is that uh if if um you know you ... if the press goes out and blames Trump off the bat and tries to tie everything in as an example is a you know deniro was the one that actually went after Trump or you know and obviously Trump responded but\nBut I didn't hear it was the one that was violent and I want to beat him up and I want to you know Mr tough guy plays tough guys and movies but in reality is like five foot\nFour need I'd probably get knocked on the ground by Trump's view tried anything right and and you've got other other people\nThe way and the ones that I think or you know have have really created this scenario where we're at today I'm In the two that remind me the most is Hillary Clinton because civility on ... on any level as a as a it's like the waters are still you know but she doesn't want the waters to be still she said look suspense\nAnd the till after the election so you know whether that means a verbal attacks are attacking someone in a restaurant or sending a bond with somebody or or you know trying to shoot them or ...\nWell I think think about this for a second thing about this for a second now four years ago the public might have fallen for this and said oh my God look at these nasty Republicans they want to kill the Democrats we got to vote democratic because he's Republicans out of there but people have gotten a little bit smarter a little bit wiser now\nI think everybody's been waiting for an October surprise so here comes in October surprise um\nWhat would the Republicans have to gain by doing this what would the Republicans have the game because what you're doing is what Republicans\nDefinitely that are part of the the you know there's no way that Republicans that are part of Trump's um team or whatever you wanna call it are involved\nIs it possible for a Republican or a person that is a hardcore right that a is upset with all these constant attacks on doing something I think there's ... there's plenty of nuts out there that could easily raise their hand and say they're conservative or there they could that could be um um you know neo Nazi they there's a lot of\nBut then again think about it do anybody who is thinking politically\nThat has a half a brain on their shoulders knows that something like this has great potential harming Trump in harming the Republicans in the mid term so that's what I mean why would a Republican do this now you know what I'm saying anybody who's a sympathized with the Republican Party\nYou're counting on someone is thinking logically that is willing to let the system\nRun um uh this is someone that's obviously a field that they have to step in front of everything including whatever the system is an election process whatever and you know create fear or you know it's obviously be one of the bombs to go off and it's kind of shocking none\nAnd an older woman who seek the company of the younger man is called a cougar\nYes yeah that's that's all I got\nA guy in a guy that she's a pretty girl go down the street goes [noise] he's a wolf he's a wall right\nYou're absolutely racking my brain trying to think of it off\nAnd then when the girl the girl doesn't like it and she goes she calls him a pig\n[laughter]\nSo I mean I guess we all I mean yeah we just slap myself in the face for that sound the fact that that was [laughter]\nAd on the floor [laughter]\nYou know you're doing it cracks me up and he would would you talk to your your on one of your uh like one of the earlier caller said when you're ...\nYeah yeah and you know [laughter]\nMe tell you I Know she is a blow out but\nThat's usually that's usually in Indiana it's usually an indication that not too much coffee generic\nOn these people you inform the people that are listed and then I Hope I Hope we get a younger audience you know I I really do I know a lot of people listen to your show\nAnd I'll tell you what I get stopped I go for my walk every now and I get stopped every day by people that listen to the program and it's\nAll ages it's young people is middle aged so folks\nAnd do we do we yeah we do appreciate it very very much in and I love it when the young\nCarry on brother you're doing a hell of it you\nKnow I Am also a lot of my face any more than ... than her and so I won't do that anymore I appreciated by friends by the way down that takes no five hundred your next to the w._b. is every afternoon\nThat afternoon Barry hey you're a busy guy today\nUh the influx of a news coming in anything else on the bottom of deal\nUm I've heard nothing uh\nYou know other than what I'm seeing like a little bit of a you know ... and a line across the the bottom of the TV but I've heard nothing not a new uh ditch really bring him on it then I'm\nOkay I got some thing I'm from I'm a nice come from two forensic uh I forget the names they're they're very well known okay\nSaid between twenty four when forty eight hours\nThey think they tend to have somebody okay and and on top of that the surveillance videos that were mounted at CNN and other places that they have so they're not telling you everything that keep it under wraps right but\nI'm finding out bits and pieces here and there and are just so come to a conclusion very very shortly\nI think it will I think the caller earlier said he thinks it's going to last until ...\nThat the matrix they want this thing they want to resolve before the midterms\nOr yeah that's it it's like he said you said the next between the next twenty four forty eight hours they're going to have somebody yeah\nBecause uh according to the forensic people too much that they can they can work off um and don't ask me why because I'm not a forensic expert\nI guess there are a lot of ... I heard generally signatures what they call signature\nHands on some excellent surveillance video\nThat's good absolutely well you know what I mean or whoever did this whether it's a some kind of a right wing or some kind of electric a mate you know what we go to a ... there's another possibility here too\nIt could be somebody who really doesn't care right away for the the the politics of it but just looking to make a name for himself and now look to get some attention and certainly has gotten that writes the country's attention here so we really don't know who did it but whoever did it is looking to influence\nThe public opinion just prior to the veterans so they want this everybody I Would think would want this resolved before the midterms\nAll right my friend let's stay tuned in and you have a great day\nBrings you to my friend is always thank you sir five or six o five hundred I got to take a very quick breaks down the line because the next\nTwenty W.

the Three Stooges\n[laughter] yeah yeah yeah I got my Three Stooges coffee mugs right here I have every day in the studio with me now that that's what you know [laughter]\nUm I just wanted to give you might take on those on the bombs that that first of all I think it's more of a a scare tactic than anything\nUm so who's doing the scare him well that's the question that I that I haven't come up with ... but first of all you don't put a bomb\nIn a manila envelope because general generally bombs are inboxes so that when you open up the boxer triggering device\nI mean ... if you think about it and what they showed on TV so you rip the thing open you say oh my God I got a bomb but there's no accusation device it's not like you know why is on the lid um and so he opened up the bar\nAll right so you just made a good point something I hadn't even thought about social disease whoever did this is obviously ... trying to trying to help people find these things right away because you're right if I'm going to send a bomb to you I'm going to put it in an Amazon box and I'm going to put it on your front doorstep\nAnd it's going to have a device because you're going to come home from work and you say oh my God my scene from Amazon cheating on her at the box or when it's going to blow up these guys were trying to make it very obvious and we're trying to have these things get detected really quickly\nAt a scare tactic I'm ... and again with all the handling at a post office and all the and I know they don't have held at that uh you know you put you put fragile on it and they drop it from six feet and if they can hear it there it shattered so I'm now there has to be some triggering mechanism and you can't do that and then blow\nUp I've never heard of a bomb going in and that will off I mean obviously you can put a anthrax and things of that nature in an a a an envelope or something but uh this is to send a message out there that somebody is not happy with the Democratic party or if that's\nFictitious names of the Mueller investigation including one which has the secret service and the Russians assassinating Trump\nSure that doesn't lend to the hatred and that doesn't lend to you know people getting big ideas this is why I think\nThese bombs may have been sent\nBy people who are very very different from who you think they might have sent them right five and six so five hundred

[noise]\nYeah that's me on child in the city or the eight minutes after two o'clock on a Thursday Afternoon he [noise]\nYeah okay and that we are happy to have you here today we're having some fun and now we're talking about some serious issues as\nWell or by the way Jeff deal or the or a Republican are looking to dethrone Queen Elizabeth from uh the U.S Senate here in Massachusetts has announced the endorsement of the New Bedford police union now\nAnd ... veteran police union has now endorsed the Jeff deal a and that adds to a growing list Boston police patrol means association Boston police superior officers federation every police patrol means local Ninety four every police\nA superior officers local Ninety five the association of Marshfield police New Bedford police union Weymouth police ...\nThere is Whitman Police Association uh Worcester police patrol in Norfolk county corrections Plymouth county corrections Massachusetts Police Association Massachusetts municipal police coalition to women benevolent Police Association Massachusetts coalition of police\nUh immigration and Customs Enforcement ... these real labor unions are generally go Democrat right by the way sharp Tom Harkin has also endorsed uh the I'm a candidate sea of ah I'm\nJeff deal as has former mayor in state representative above ... were you would hurt delivering that endorsement right here on this very program several weeks back right [noise]\n'em going on in the hands of the of the of the left wing so\nI mean we don't pick up we we don't pick up stories from day to day of a of of Trump supporters going off the meeting people or or a throwing bricks through windows are burning things we just don't find those stories out there but you do here with the left constantly and if\nThey say it is a Republican for the conservative they find out a whole life\nMade it up [noise] in my watch me they\nDo it to the south and say we did\nSo Hulu to use these behind do you think you think this is actually somebody that's from the left or from the right\nThat's really hard to say yeah whenever there and it's terrible yeah ...\nCompletely wrong and I hope they catch whoever it is and have them\nYeah absolutely I'm with you on that no question thank you my friend ... five hundred your next to the w._b. is Sam\nGood how are you where do I get through scenarios that might be unique in some ways okay if you if you consider who gets the advantage of all of these bombs going off frame the Democrats right sure\nSo if you want to take migration of immigration train that's coming up you pick it up the front page\nMake Republicans look terrible that is to say let's blame Republicans for setting these things these bombs out where hopefully none of them could be activated being bombed or just let's say they're all fake\nSo you've got Democrats let's say\nA group of wackos say we're going to send it to other people that make the most noise against the republic so then we can blame the public and say and they're going after the people that don't like Trump\nRight that's one issue so yup that if they find out that it's really a democratic what okay that's going to take back the Democrats a hundred years the second scenario because you had the Russians interfering with our elections\nYou know on the Internet and things like that but what would be so hard for a group of Russian editor infiltrated in the United states doing this\nYou know to to the\nUm Trump because we know that I'm\nMore than ... like the Democrats words to all the other countries who the Obama years you know and not standing up for America we we we we find that the Russians did it would be to to make it more difficult for Republicans and Democrats to vote Republican\nAnd ... you know what I'm hearing today is we're up to fourteen thousand or in a convoy coming up here\nWhen it makes sense though if the Russians are going to do something like this to have a real bomb that explodes\nNo because if they catch the Russian or he would be charged and gone to jail but it wouldn't be such a bad target the United states against Russian government that you know I'm you know just the two instances there you go\nRogue Russians that are not supposed to be working for the you know the Russian government itself but just real people that took this upon himself um\nI have a great deal of confidence in the FBI working class not the executives trying to you know the FBI today in them you know the top of a you know laws\nAre just as a fill with hiring and um you know\nOh yeah somebody suggested earlier this could be a deep state thing and then and that wouldn't surprise me at all I'm not sure I buy into this theory on the Russian show because I mean the Russians you know the Russians are a little bit better than that look what they did lunging right they go up and they they they poisoned people and kill him\nI mean I I think if the Russians were trying to affect the election that way you might have seen uh one of these people actually get hurt or killed\nOr that received some of this fake stuff so I'm not sure I'm going with the Russians I think I I can buy into this theory I mean it just looks so obvious to me in in you know sometimes things that are very obvious are not as obvious as they appear at all but it seems to me that it is it is obvious that somebody is trying to set up\nAll the Republicans would this and it just it just you don't want it in the media gets up on his fiancee high horse there and oh my God this is oh Trump's well in how many times did they do that and then have to eat it later on because turns out that they're wrong\nUm and I just had a feeling of gut feeling deep down inside I'm not saying the Democrats necessarily sanctioned this\nAh but somehow or another somebody out there I think did this in order to try to pin on the Republican so that's that's what I'm getting I don't know whether it's the Democrats where they had in knowledge or any involvement in this at all uh but somebody out they were trying to make a Trump and and the Republicans are bad\nBy the way nine six or five hundred your next in Libya Sam\nI very high did anybody ever think that it's a possibility that that the Democrats were found out real wide that they've been be asked all these years just to find a drain the swamp\nThat's entirely possible but I mean [noise] some of the people that were selected the why would they send something to De Niro you know what I mean\nIf if if that's the case in and I agree that anything's on the table at this point but if if you're a Democrat and you feel like your party has screwed you over and uh they walked away from you wouldn't just send it to somebody I mean why would you pick the Niro or why would you pick a\nYou know Debbie Wasserman Schultz or you don't even have a cold or I mean there there are more prominent Democrat sort of scrutiny over than those Chuck Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi there would be more logical targets ...\nJaneiro kind of a a a big rig in Hollywood yeah and he's kind of outspoken against George strong\nBut I mean I Would never if I if I was going to target the Democrats writes a media they were my party and I'd say boy you guys really screwed up your losses the election you lost this Congress on but we don't like the way your party you know the you do what you do one of my party I'm On my party back\nThere were Democrats that I Would pick to get even with that could affect the change I I did the last person on my list would be Janeiro\nI don't see where that would affect anything\nRight but that that right there could also be something to throw it to make you think that it's a Republican\nYeah well I think some of these definitely try to make make it appear as though the Republicans are doing this\nSend it to somebody who would be the obvious to make of what you're trying to do\nYeah well that that's why they chose the Niro that's why they chose to see that's why I don't think it's somebody that legitimately is a Democrat that legitimately has beef against the party I think it's somebody that's trying to make this look\nLike the Republicans is because they went to Wasserman Schultz they went to De Niro CNN all of the the people that as there are things that soundbite said you know all of the people in Trump's Twitter list it just looks too obvious to be late for me\nBut if it's a Democrat door now you're actually there were two birds with one stone\nYeah well I think it's some of these I think it definitely is I think see I don't think it's somebody this pitch to the Democrats I think that somebody who supports the Democrats that are trying to frame the Republicans here\nWell that that's what I mean I I don't mean it's it's a politician somebody over in an office that's doing it right and voted on the outside with a supporter yeah and realize hey I read the story was shot down time\nYeah yeah certainly so they're trying to frame the Republicans right yeah\nThere's a lot of theories out there there's no question pre she Joyce thank you very much five or six or five hundred what do you think you can actually Namibia Sam\n... will be coming in from the um you know during the Kavanaugh here were paid for by sorrow it'll get Michael on the grand a year\nAnd\nI think some of the organizations out there by and large funded by George so most people tend to get pretty much wrapped up among themselves and as I said before they're they're pretty much of a impervious to a objective thought\nBut don't you think somebody that is radical like that that is seriously radical end you know we've seen some radical people I mean we've got antifa we've got a you know a lot of these people that have plotted against\nDo you think they would set a dummy bombs to try to frame somebody or do you think they go out and kill somebody or really try to hurt somebody\nI think if they if they generally have the uh interest of the cause quote unquote at at heart and then they want to influence public attention\nBut can you imagine the thing about this for a second what would be more of an influence on public opinion sending fake bombs dude ten Democrats or actually killing somebody\nEven if you want to pin it on the Republican see you kill a Democrat wouldn't it wouldn't that get your message across a little bit stronger if you're a professional and are killed every one\nBut I think you'd have to the ... things in between two kinds of people here want an activist trying to promote a garden and to an actor is trying to promote it costs is willing to go to that extreme right killing somebody you actually undertake the devil it killed somebody I think there's there's a there's a red line that you have to ...\nOh there's no question but I mean we're talking about different levels of commitment to the cost right I mean we're talking about people who go out and wear pink cat and jump up and down and yell hey hey ho ho and you're talking about\nReal an ark and it's like the like antifa that will set buildings on fire well my lows inside and that type of thing so they would go to that extreme so that's what I'm thinking if it's a serious in ...\nI was hearing about the bombs today earlier wrong on WB as um as a challenge for me like they're very primitive the pipe bombs\nExperts making these things are and I don't think they were all on journey wars from what I've been airing apparently\nNone of them were now from what I've been reading in fact CNN had a story earlier I guess that the thing that gets into their place was a was a facsimile of a pipe bomb a name was not operative\nYeah so I don't know I ... I Would be as a gosh judgment I I don't think the Democrats are that\nWould banking that would\nDo this because we want to create sympathy or on candidates\nI Know what I'm not on board with\nGod no I agree I don't think that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer sat down and said okay we got to save this mid term what are we going to do I know let's send some bombs\nI don't think they had anything to do with it to be perfectly honest with you but they may be somebody out there you know we saw this this kid that was dark sing recently right I don't think he was doc seeing because Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer told them ducks I think he was dachshund because he thought it was going to help his cause the closet he believed in\nSo there's this screwball out there who sent these things around thinking it was going to help his cause that he's involved in whether it be a Republican school ball or a Democrat screwball or just somebody in the middle looking to have fun we don't know at this point\nBut I don't think this has the fingerprints are in there has been sanctioned by higher ups in either organization\nI don't either I agree with you\nI my friend I appreciate it thanks very much for your call ... let me take a very quick break stay with us at your thoughts on next and not only be asked them\nOne of America's most passionate talk radio Tony Smith is he's fourteen wanting to leave them\nPlenty of every time you went out you can catch you know the capital in the ... you are in four percent cash back on dining entertainment like celebrating every year the cruise missiles [noise]\nWhen you and your crew report signed during the time [noise]\nFor going out now you have four more introducing new favorite card from capital and four percent on mining and four percent I mean you can send your wallet terms apply capital one bank usa in a [noise]\nRight now with the Home Depot was selected special order Anderson windows and patio doors are very easy to get into their Fifteen Percent off ...\nQuality and if these low prices neither you nor your home and have to wait for an upgrade so now's the time to get into the Home Depot because this could be the opening you've been waiting for me to let the Anderson windows in patio doors Fifteen Percent off only the Home Depot\nOr saving ...\nTo ... just\nThe greater new bed for community health entertain knows them I can get busy and having to travel for medical services category and stress that is why there where him location is ideal for your care whether it's a checkup with your primary care provider an urgent concern more specialists visit their team is they're\nProviding high quality care where you live to learn more called five zero eight nine\nNine to sixty five fifty three more visit gee NBC ABC dot or\nFirefighter wrap up oriented firehouse subs introducing the new firehouse pub steaks up with savory steak crispy fried onions in a rich Belgian beers cheese sauce on top for limited time more than yours firehouse ... dot com and remember fortunate every subject by helps provide lifesaving equipment first response\nOurselves each or more substance save more lives somebody's I'm only ... which is pretty location by herself with only minimum one million dollars to doesn't seem to borrow some public safety foundation the only point one percent every person\nThat ... is it then I hit him brush veterinary dot com W. B. S.\nI Do forty three on a Thursday Afternoon you know just that just takes a step further to I'd have to follow up on my Johnny one note saying that when I was saying to him\nLook you know I'm antifa has every right\nTo um expressions point of view in this country as well as we don't like it but he does not have a right to um become violent you know what I'm a right to swing clubs and he had people in burning buildings ...\nThat's wrong that's against the law okay that's inciting violence that's being invited that's the threatening people you can't do that but ... has every right to wrap their stupid face cloth around their head and walk around the streets if they want you\nAnd they have every right to stand on a a soap box a town square and and you know denounce the Republicans all day long they can do that\nUm that's protecting free speech in this country\nAs he is a black lives matter black lives matter can march up and down the streets all day long personally when you threatened police officers were these speech by saying things in a blanket frame like bacon you're advocating violence or inciting violence and that should be a criminal offense but apparently the law sees it differently\nUm black lives matter can march all day long hair protests and rallies\nAs they did through the streets of Chicago and not all the other major cities are back about a year or so ago don't hear from those characters anymore much do you\nUm you know the other folks from or what was the other group that started in ... by taking over the city squares and all of that can't think of the name of that you have a right to free expression you do not have a right to be violent and you do not have a right to hurt anybody we don't have to light your speech but you have\nA right to it under the constitution fiber waiting on that six o five hundred and thanks for hanging on your next in Libya Sam\nHey I Know real quick I called earlier I Would ... listening and thinking and seen the fact that so many of these devices whatever they are not at ... also or as actors like we're talking about those diagrams you know the more importantly\nWhat about Bernie sympathizers who are so pissed off that the Democrats set them up lows the fix was in and they don't even like anything that\nThe Republican side have been doing it professionally Donald Trump\nSo you so you think of somebody maybe just trying to set up the right yeah no I think I think you're a hundred percent right I got to hold you though because you're only allowed one today and I don't want everybody has caused NATO second call either but um no and that's something that's it's it's certainly\nWorth considering you got to consider that I'll find the way down to sixty five hundred you're up next the w._b. assume high very high because a lot of theories out there right now everybody's got a theory right there were there were about a nickel\nOr the other morning it was funny\nI was listening or joining left and it was called then Johnny ready I call them journey writing out from Westport back to back\nYeah right job Johnny left in ... county right there you go\nWell anyway uh this morning I

this is a ... years ago or ... or back a while ago he says if you don't like on your vote him out you know if it was a Democrat you don't like your vote him out that's true but we had an election and the problem is with the less they\nWon't accept Trump\nThey won't accept the results of the election you're right yes and that goes for Johnny ...\nOh they don't accept them and they was elected by the people\nWell you know elections have consequences and one of those consequences are that if your candidate cannot convince enough voters a darn enough counties as the case was in this election to to support your candidates and then they lose\nAnd who's going around attacking the uh independence and the Republicans yeah that's the left is absolutely right yeah and you're down the street you know and that's what happened in buddy\nThat's what's happening no question about a thank you my friend five ... five hundred your next in Libya some good afternoon\nHi Barry hey question it might be
