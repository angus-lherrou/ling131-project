Know you have to we all are are eight to another of absurdity or that I wanted to mention to you by the way the media is on that right now speculating\nOn both the timing of the Nikki Haley announcement what should we take away from the top I mean love Nikki Haley announcement that she will can you retire from while at the end of the year what should we take away from the timing of all of this\nUm\nThese people was too stupid for words sometimes I Swear to God [noise] [noise] well let's take another woman you know she she's making sense it's time for her to move in make room for somebody else\nHow about that for a refreshing thought maybe you don't and should not own a position for your whole life you know what are the politicians going to understand that that you should not\nOwn a position in the government for your whole life and getting filthy rich off of it\n\nBy the way I I'm wanting to mention what did I Want to mention Chris subjects I rented a Chris Hendricks at the um\nChowder fast on Sunday Chris Hendricks uh is is that the guy that of course some seated or a representative Bob Gibbs era who'd been in for Thirty years and of course Hendricks defeated him in a primary\nAnd uh\nPaige could not get off the mound fast enough I mean it was slow ...\nCentury wanted and knocked on the winning run that was little Boudreau\nThat later became the manager show the the point I'm making is some of these guys are they ... you don't see them\nMaking ... ... but when they do it's a significant move and sharing last night to the move to change their line up much to work because when do you score that many runs against a top notch team like the\nI got to tell you something to things you may to excellent points there I I Am a huge ... fan and I always have been and I didn't understand why ... wasn't in the starting lineup I Would have put him there\nSo I was so happy to see black holes in the starting line up last night and boy it paid off shifts at the big time he said history with his uh you know hitting for the cycle and everything else and\nI was reading some quotes from him this morning about how he said you never you never really a guy hit a home run because you're trying to home runs often happen you know just kind of on an accident but\nUm he said I was really really trying to that home run because I knew I Would hit cycle you said I was out there trying to hit a home run an idea and you gotta love that spirit and and and holder so talented but I think you're right I think Alex scores of great strategic will manage and that's something that was missing was the last guy that we have there\nAnd um you know he he has his he he plays a game strategically\nAnd um he's exciting he's young and he brings ... an awful lot to the team\nUm the other point that you made about you know the a team like the Yankees people forget we've got what do we have like a hundred\nTen wins or a hundred and eight when the seasons something like that the Yankees won over a hundred games too sure so I mean this they ... if it weren't for the a phenomenal season that we had ... we'd all be talking about the phenomenal season at the Yankees hat\nI mean this is a top notch team and anybody who thought we were going to go in and just bulldozed these guys you know you are you kidding yourself so last night's win was very very significant for the socks to do that on the road after just losing game too at home\nI'd go in and and and and really you know steak ownership why we're here to make a statement and they made that statement last night and they boss game five either so keeping\nIn mind that a lot of the red Sox wins we're due to the other teams urge that there was a great number of games that they pulled out because the other team's fault\nBut that needs to sign of good team to win you can take advantage of somebody else's mistakes and turn them to your advantage that that's part of the strategy um I mean we've got great bass running we've got a you know all of the little things that that uh\nUh they make a team top notch we've got 'em and die but we're playing a team that stop not they do the very same thing\nWith the airline judge you know my dad who wouldn't want to pitch to that kid right so\nTry you know I mean they've got some killer hitters up there too so I mean I always I said from day one this was going to be five game series um my yeah yeah I'd love to see him win tonight in New York\nUh but I think it's gonna it's gonna come down to a game five um the ask those who've they've already wrapped it up so they're getting a few days off in wrestling so you know I don't want him to get to rest it up but uh you know most\n... don't bother me\nAnd do you you asked them for it is we're above the W.

getting ready for the red Sox Yankees game tonight in game three number four Red Sox could wrap it up if we lose tonight we play a game five at Fenway Park on Thursday nine ... right here on WB a semi live\nCoverage that begins with a pre game is a a J are just totally with seven oh five first pitch at eight oh seven and who they excited right oh excited raise your hand I can see you out there I think everybody's excited about this right be you know what's interesting around here is you have a lot of Red Sox fans obviously because this is Red Sox nation\nBut you know the Yankees fans around here too you know those guys that when the red Sox weren't doing so good jump ship\n... you know those guys who walk around with the Yankee jackets in Yankee hats on thinking they're all ... you know but the red Sox I never win a World Series well yeah we we won a few now and uh but they still walking around with your Yankees garb on thinking they're pretty cool\nUm so game tonight right a lot of folks around this area because the two teams of people root for the most around here are the red Sox and the Yankees obviously so this makes for a lot of fun on many interesting relationship issues at your house or your wife or your husband maybe a Yankee fan and you root for the red Sox\nAre ... that could posting problems I've got some friends like that I Know a couple that are are he's a Yankees fan and she's a Red Sox fan\nAnd he's a Dallas Cowboys fan and she's a Washington Redskins fans so things get a little bit interesting you know [noise] um anyway\nWelcome back to the program and I wanted to what just kind of briefly revive something that we talked about a little bit in the first hour and that is the ballot question number three is a is going to be very interesting and we'll get a little bit more into all of the ballot questions as we move a little bit closer to the election\nI bet you most of the people had no idea that it happened although you probably suspected it would\nBut the mayor will sit here and the mayor will tell us that he's down in Washington sometimes I feel like the Lone Ranger down there I'm fighting all by myself\nAnd he's right here is because we have a congressional delegation that could give a ... less about the city quite frankly about the commonwealth in general but about the city because they know that the people here are going to vote for them and they know that the mayor is going to endorse them doesn't matter what they do or what they don't do that they're going to get endorsed right\nI'm going to win the lemmings have New Bedford will follow the mayor right to the polling all they'll do I vote for Liz won\n\nDespite the fact that lose Warren is completing a term she's asking for a second term has already said that ... a day one upon winning a second term she's going to start a campaign for the presidency which means she will be accent from the state for two years\nWe we've got some fishing licenses here that we're really battling for you know a whole bunch of fishing licenses that were taken away from Carlos ... when he went to prison\nI'm Still hanging the balance nowhere has not decided what to do with those licenses yet\nThey couldn't be and our viciously being fought where they can be taken away from us they can be given to Maine that can be given to any other place these people have applied for them and they're fighting to get them out of New Bedford and we have environmentalists who are fighting to get those license is just so they can rip them up and throw 'em in the garbage and nobody has some\nThis would cost the city of New Bedford a tremendous amount of money but we can't get loose Warren or Ed Markey to fight\nSince the spores can't get them to do it they are funded by the environmentalists who want to throw those licenses and the garbage\n\nSo yesterday happened to mention that fairly recently\nWe had the\nImportant people from the waterfront on the program always had city council is on the program talking about how they have tried over and over and over again\nTo communicate with Liz Warren and Ed Markey about this stuff\nAnd to get our delegation in Washington to fight help us do fight to get these licenses to cure for the city New Bedford so they stay here and they don't go to Maine or they don't go in the garbage care\nBut every time our city council has passed a resolution\nTo send a letter to Liz warranted Ed Markey those letters have gone unanswered three times now three times or city how the least three times or city council has sent a letter to lose one into Ed Markey saying please join us in the fight for this please help us\nAnd we have not even gotten an acknowledgement from them that they receive the letters\nYou know not even a and a tweet or an email saying yes we got your letters will take it under consideration nothing no response at all\nAnd somehow or another the politicians in the city think that's okay\nWhy is that acceptable when we're paying the salary of these people to go to Washington and fight for us that they would ignore us and blow us off not even answering our damn correspondence why is that acceptable\nIt's not acceptable but yet the mayor will sit here in the studio and he will say Liz ... is a Democrat I'm a Democrat and therefore I'm a party guy I'm going to I'm going to endorse her\nHow was that putting your city in the interest of your city I had to politics it's not it's putting politics I had all your city your people and your fishing industry so yesterday afternoon I was talking\nAbout this I got a letter from a an email from a council the gums Brian gums you've been around for a long time right brands but on the city council for a long time\nAnd he sent me a attacks saying he's going to try fray last time on Thursday night at the meeting to get the council tobacco sending a letter to Warren and to Markey advocating asking\n\nThat they help the city on this matter\n\nThat they held the city we need to the he's asking for quote immediate assistance and convincing nowhere to quote release and re issued those fishing licenses\nYou meaning of the systems that means we need your help now\nSo three previous letters have gone unanswered so going to send a fourth one when does\n\nThe elected body in the city of New Bedford have enough how many unanswered letters does it take before you stand up on the front steps of city hall and say you know what this isn't working anymore we need to go on a new direction\n\nWhen somebody is it I I don't know who's going to be we need somebody to have a Susan Collins moment\nAs Susan Collins moment is a profile in courage moment\nHe's receiving death threats in other threats on friday stored in the Senate well and she said I'm voting for\nJudge Kavanaugh's nomination because\nThese are the rulings these are the facts and this is this is a completely and he took a forty five minutes to run it all down of how he stands on the positions his positions on on the on the various issues facing us end because no American is supposed to be\nIn a position where they are guilty until proven innocent that is wrong that as an American I Am not seen any evidence to convict this judge I'm voting for him that was just using columns moment to moment of coverage\n\nWhen is somebody in our city going to have a moment of courage and stand up and say Elizabeth Warren is not doing it for us we need change\nJeff deal has appointed and has a long time ago appointed a special commission on the fishing industry which includes members all the fishing industry and advisory panel that evening of itself is more than Warren and mark you've done combined in their time in office to assist New Bedford especially in a district\n\nWhen is somebody going to send a message to warring and who's going to be who is going to have that profile in courage moment who's going to be the first one to do it\nIs anybody going to do it does anybody have the guts to do it\nIt's going to be Bryan it's going to be they broke\nWhat about council President Lyndon more ad on AOL me Carney Joe lobes\nDebbie ... somebody somebody's got to do this Scott\nWho has the courage to stand up and have a Susan's calling us Susan Collins moment\nTake the heat and say you know what I'm breaking party affiliation here because the party has done nothing to help my city and my industry nothing who's got the guts to do it and who's got the leadership\n\nMooney Bedford politicians have the courage and the conviction to put the city's interesting they had a party affiliation will they just continue to go along to get along leadership takes courage who has the courage to lead\n\nDoes anybody\nFind a way no no six o five hundred thanks thing and I didn't actually nobody BSO\nOr you're trying to make me laugh [laughter] was that funny of course it's funny why isn't funny on they're not going to go against their party yeah\nWell okay I got mad at you mean you mean funny in a sarcastic kind of way I got you okay\nYeah the former mayor that President Trump was the worst president we've ever seen rain early us\nWhen will it all thought it'll never thought the last the the former mayor or\nA ... ... talk down your ... every Democrat is come on Fox down about your cabinet because they want to toe the party line\nI could I can easily if I was a they could easily just send a message by going independent propose that five thousand times but they'll come on and say we sent the letter there's nothing we can do well send another one\nBut that got you got nobody would any frying or any backbone and they really don't see the uh you know why because they had read it but it hurt you Don\nWhat I Do get here is how did they benefit\nNot bucking the system does New Bedford somehow get more if they don't well I'm a little bit more do we get well\nVery you know permit you to a um you know different things happen in municipalities so you know as long as you stay in power to make money and uh you\nWell most most nurses that I Know\nDo not support it and the mass nurses association does not support it one of their one of the Irvine officials does in was one of the ... the virus of it but the the mass nurses association doesn't and there was a couple of other different I don't have it in front of me ... the couple of other medical organizations in Massachusetts and opposing it\nAre they said that it is going to strictly limit care it's going to drive along yeah\nIf they don't have any more than ever since we've gotta limit K yeah and what happened is Barry is those hospitals that don't get the new hire raised go down the block all\nI mean they're they're saying that that that's a hospitals that are that are being forced to increased asked was going to go down the black hole\nI I don't I don't think that's true uh and and the reason is because some of the other ... on the other side I really believe although this is I talked to her in favor of it and ah I think people better take a look at this one uh because the under staffing that's going on right now\nIs only to do with the bottom line\nOf the ... the nonprofit\nHospitals ought to be more of a for profit hospitals and that we used to be this way\nI mean hospitals would make a profit if they had a good year they may lose a little if they had a bad year and then there was always supplements to to support them from the local community this isn't happening anymore\nA matter of fact the cutbacks are from the state have a lot to do with it and I'm neck of the world's also we're we're paying a dollar for dollar oh show was that the business\nAnd do a a store for that was okay we're not going to serve their park which are the more and all your doctors for example that that are delivering babies you are joined a good business profile cut out all those people that oh ...\n... ... a ... and don't have a for the\nCo pays or your business more will turn give you a profit but you have to eliminate them for sure this is what's happened and and I don't believe that I I think they should get back\nTo a point where there's enough staffing and registered nurses to work this shift rather than just given them instead of eight patients uh a shift sixteen patience to shift on behalf of the bottom line\nYou know the Boston Globe came out against it right the editorial board of the Boston Globe came out against it doesn't mean that the community I\nShould I'm just I'm just stating a fact but also um the nurses association says there are fears government\nUh dictating\nWhat they're staffing levels should be local hospitals to have a better handle on that they also fear that hospitals could or could actually close or there's some fear that hospice care would be a would be unavailable to some patients\nUh there's also concern about municipalities that have to pay a premium spoke for workers and those premiums will go sky high in through the roof so there's a lot of concerns on both sides want to try to do I'm going to try to do I get both sides and so we can have a conversation actually I think it's a very important question Oh absolutely yeah we'll we'll talk about all of them\n... she had very much my friend let me take a quick break we'll come right back after this stay with us for gene
