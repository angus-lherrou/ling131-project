that they might be saved up for this cause God's will send them strong delusion that they should believe ally\nNot people will hate you if you don't buy into the illusion\nAnd your job will set in times of universal deceit telling the truth\nIs a revolutionary act and that's where we are real people they on a skepticism toward the dog was they despise and despise skepticism toward the dog was they on and I did not make that up I\nI read that on line can't remember who was the exact author was basically they love to believe things that they want to believe right and then if you come in at them with something that may be truthful but they don't want to believe it they'll have to\nYeah pretty much where where we are right now they totally jak you yeah\nWhat an upset on world I don't know what this this guy as you could it could just be\nA crazy operation mend it just totally confused us and totally get us\nDivided against each other could just be a black operation I don't know I pretty much don't believe much what's going on right now 'cause I I Believe we're\nWhen times of universal deceit where if you're just do some basic research you can knock down so much stuff that the government is trying to force feed you we'll do want to they don't want to do that they'd rather believe this perfect little lives that they could get on a soapbox and preach against\nThat let me ask you this do you believe that we are in revolution right now\nRevolution no we're in a confusion confusion Lucian is when um [noise] if there was a real revolution to start reducing martial law thrown down on this country so fast you headed spin\nNever went out maybe we're not at that level yet and think about this for a moment now we've got on on one side of the spectrum you've got people out in the streets that are beating and bullying candidates yeah and what a woman candidate out no amount of this week I can question I just saw went on line this morning as I was coming into the studio another one or\nA Republican candidate her democratic opponent grabbed her and started shaking her on the stage of the debate in uh\nUm yeah I mean we've got people think cats in the street marching and we've got any teeth out there in the streets are burning buildings were Milo speaking and now we've got this guy in the right who's sending fake bombs out to people\nI I since this is the the early stages of revolution\nI'm I'm going to disagree with you on the revolution part say maybe like a um\nCivil war type of yeah yeah maybe a sibling or it could\nBe contrived they want to create a civil war amongst us so that way they can drop down marshal law honest so fast our heads Will Smith and all these people that are saying all fight this fight that will calm down like little kittens\nStraight up ... calm down like little kittens\nYeah maybe seven or is it better yeah I think it's even worse better description for and I think you know back when Obama was president in the in the on the right was um in in the average middle class people were rebelling against a lot of what was going on I think that might have been a little bit closer to a revolution but I think you're right and I think this is more of a civil war\nThe people around each other I mean they're they're out in the streets and um I don't know where it goes from the from the spoils\nShe'll change is being put on a massive or social change massive war endless war overseas it makes no sense yeah and massive hatred amongst the people people don't want to hear truth man 'cause it tastes too sour so they'd rather have a sweet little lie the can make them go to sleep at night better 'cause then it can concoct\nThese enemies system basically is creating for you\nIn the media the media pushes it as a matter\nHow bad the truth hurts people need to open their eyes truth but few people are doing that\nAppreciate it makes a lot ... five hundred your next to the w._b. assume\nI don't have a couple of things ah earlier when the president had as a news conference on the bombing you know catching the suspect that CNN or Clinton news\nNetwork and also and that's left you see they both both commentators I switched over\nThey're mad at Trump because he hasn't reached out to Hillary and Obama and Booker and all these people look at the bombs and I thought well why would you reach out to them the ones that are telling people to get in the face and check them when the low\nAnd they're the ones that are promoting the violence on the other side\nRight so it wouldn't a hung on ... where are you telling me CNN and MSNBC are suggesting that Trump is not done proper outreach to the people who oh yeah\nOh they wanted to have all come to the White House recalling by yeah oh yeah what they want to Clinton Obama should be called every one of them by the White House and uniting with each other to show unity and all this other stuff\nYeah and it's so it's so loaded\nWith all the way has has Obama called a Trump and and said hey do you know like you get your butt kicked all around town here let's come let's you know lead to unify let ya as she Hillary I'm actually remember just last week when we were sitting there saying we cannot be civil until we take control\nThat doesn't sound like a unification to me\nThat Obama is the guy that said when they bring a knife you bring a gun right\nRight on that Eric Holder go to a bomb in ... in what did he say just last week and when when when they go low we can't come right so this sounds like people that really want to unify ... yeah\nYeah it's what it says ... like I said that they don't have double standard they don't go to and that that all\nRight and then he got to you Robert De Niro saying he wants to punch jump in the face you magazine water saying go out of hand in their face\n... um so yeah these guys sound like they're really trying to make nice\nThat Johnny Depp are one gal that sign of accurate says the president you know something like that crazy yeah but uh\nThe second thing is I Wonder which left operatives and how they did it so quickly I'll be put all the stickers on this guy's a van\n[laughter] stuck they have all these ... I'm a gift you see it on TV yeah with being sick is all over the ...\nYeah I've got a good picture right here somebody said to me on my phone and I've got a picture of it yeah where's\nThis guy let this guy looked at southern South Park so two points first of all the sun shines a little bit down so you wouldn't have these pristine stickers after or you know period of time and the second thing is\nIs a man if you down there with all the liberal without swastikas painted the yeah I mean you can't try that packet and you know supermarket not come out and see some kind of\nDamage Stewart or ... or whatever\nPainted on it I Can't see those liberal don't let that ban right around without being touched\nWill tell you what here's here's what I'm going to do um the evidence appears to indicate this guy is a strong supporter of Trump I get I get a sense that this guy suits and listens to Sean Hannity every night and get some self so worked up in a a bunch of things because a lot of people do\nA lot of people that shouldn't have CNN and get out get worked up and listen to Don Lebanon ain't gonna work I mean that's why they go out in the streets and not and do what they do I get a sense of this guy is caught up in this media made friends you know we are now living in and um he acted on that unless I'm showing something otherwise\nYeah I think this is what's what's the story is here uh well\nIt's um his is his name as I say the New York and uh he appears to be and I'm not I'm not sure what it is to be a an immigrant so I don't know maybe you got caught up in it but the other thing CNN and and the other one thing too is um\nThat the the a fan of the pro Trump should back off from the rhetoric because he's caused this guy to act like this and I thought well I didn't hear them say that about Bernie Sanders cotton genes or what you're going to go out and shoot the lease and all of Congress\nGradually support I didn't hear them coming up and then the other thing is that a back off because your rhetoric cars and it's like you can't blame her candidate was some not that goes out next on whatever you know we have\nWith Trump is never I I watch most of Trump's rallies when Trump goes on does these rallies I watch most of them for entertainment value I think they're I think he's I happen to think that Trump's hilarious I Love as of humor and I love to watch his his rallies for entertainment purposes\nA Trump speaks very similar to the way that I speak and um we look at life a lot of the you know the same which I enjoy listening to a job so\nI Am never heard Trump\nSay go out and attack anybody never\nNever ever I Know last week that he would have voted early\nThat somebody in up to your point yeah\nA lot of those agitated at rallies where we're at the Trump the only way they came in ... like the guy that hit someone\nOut there when the burning of it or to again the Bernie broke several causing a lot of the trouble they let me tell you my friend I appreciate a good call I've got to take a break by the way nine six o five hundred to stay on the line we're going to get you in just a couple of moments right here on WB is [noise]\nFourteenth ... him when he speaks for listen hoarding\nToo blurry Clinton senior advisor at the state department between a coughing may not be quite ready to throw in the house it's not the first time we've heard this but still I Can't help but get excited every time I hear this a former first lady may try for the White House a third Sarah Huckabee Sanders pointed out when she heard the news Christmas come early\nGood afternoon to you know why yet oh All right how are you making a ... it's friday [laughter] ... anybody can do about that one\nNow Red Sox around tonight patriots around this weekend where else said money is going to be lousy so I can I don't feel guilty being in watching watching sports if the weather's lousy if it's it's nice out then I feel guilty about it\n[laughter] I agree to a especially this time of year well baseball's still on yeah I just can't sit in the house at one o'clock in the afternoon and Sunday and launched about now I Can't do that a couple of\nQuick comments about ... I'm a you know these pipe bombs that finding for water it's worth my two cents um I got out of work about forty five minutes ago and I've been listening to your show since I got out\nAnd it's something I've been thinking about as well but I was I was glad to hear one of your previous callers you guys were bringing up the fact of the you know maybe it's not illusion maybe a civil war was but it is a better term\nRight man and and I know that's one of the things I was thinking about what this I I Know that\nThis guy is probably not the brightest guy in the world and not a serious threat to mankind\nBut I Can't I couldn't help but think that\nYou know for years now at least a few years now people have been saying you know what we're gonna have a revolution there's going to be a revolution and\nAnd uh yeah these apps are despicable but I Would I Would suggest that a brace yourself I don't think there's going to be less of them I think there's going to be more than I and I think that somebody eventually will take it a little bit more seriously than this guy did\nYeah and when you go out and and it's not by accident you know you were right to point out that most of these bad things and bad suggestions and\nAnd what have you are coming from the left they are so I mean if you wanted to call it a revolution than I guess the liberals would be the revolutionaries well\nYou know what I I I think the revolution now that I'm I'm thinking of it in in in a different perspective I think I think the revolution has kind of happened it was it was a revolution when the public stood up and said uh nothing to be asked were sick and tired of the uh\nThe bomb is the Clintons the Bush is um you know the business as usual this new world order this guy globalism and I think when they elected Trump I think that was the revolution and I think the revolution is leading into potentially a civil war now\nYou could be right but I think the only way there's one way that you could consider what's going on a revolution is that a lot of the actions taken in a lot of the ... the behavior and the beliefs\nOf coming from the left are largely\nInfluenced by people from other countries you know illegal people from other countries\nAnd and that might be worth taking into consideration but I think there's going to I think it's going to get worse and I don't think people should be surprised by it when you have politicians like the one I Believe it's up in Maine when you have people running on a platform telling you\nThat they want insurance to be available everywhere Lee through the government\nAnd insurance like mine from my employer employer would become illegal and\nDeep Fong that's going to take a lot of people off\nWhen you have to have the ... when the insurance is is run by the government and you have to have and who you will be penalize\nThey're going to bring it on themselves so they keep doing that I mean right now they don't have the power to do that but if they ever get it they probably\nWill well that's basically on Obamacare will how that's when all else was going to break loose I Believe\nThat's that's basically what Obamacare was Obamacare was designed to put the private health insurance industry out of business um unfortunately didn't get that far but it came down near or close yeah\nBut putting it out of business and making it illegal is true different sects right and and that's that's what it when that happens when the government gets so full of it so that it starts doing things like that goes by alarms are going to become real and I are going to go off\nI I I think I agree with you I I I don't think we've seen uh the last this I think this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better appreciate you coming from thank you very much by the way nine six o five hundred your next unable to be some good afternoon\n[laughter] how you doing my love how do I get what's going on [laughter] well\nThat lady that called up I got a kick out of it yeah when she said somebody popped up all the political question in a store or something like that at Macy's Russia's painter bill yeah\nThat was a little strange you

passionate and they every time we mentioned as we reconsider races and hate group and everything is okay fine\nI Want those people are starting with the politicians on the list list I was thinking the

going to jump is expected according to the press today that Trump is expected to sign some kind of an executive order today on this what you are permitted anybody crossing the border Paul I'm going to look into that story I can find it all up without the source appreciate your call my friend ... five hundred your next to the w._b. assembled afternoon or\nGood afternoon and say hey I'm\nNobody seemed to answer your question the other day about what's the endgame would the sorrow since we're we're talking about that now and it seems like\nIt's it's it's an interesting theory that this gentleman has um obviously he wants to change the world order and what did you watch the do he wants to create almost like United Nations but it would be far investment only\nBecause his theory is that right now he's said globally that it's very difficult for our country\nOur our us I mean right now because of political\nUm environment um Venezuela or as one of them I mean you know they're under siege there um\nTo to me that's got to be more intervention because these these wars go on for such a long time there's no there's no beginning there's no end thing um you know the middle east\nSo you want you want to get involved in that you want to get involved in Venezuela as a civil crisis right now\nNot as the eye that's where I think that the un falls hot um I think they're very weak I think that no one should go and do anything to another country without the UN when when we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan and all those\nThat first time we went in and we had a unified nation a unified you know uh you know nations and we had the Arabs and some you know on our side but as far as going in independently absolutely not that we shouldn't be we shouldn't be the world's police we shouldn't be supporting\nWell no but I Want to trade with Venezuela but right now Venezuela doesn't have a whole lot to offer to us except perhaps soil right and uh in Venezuela wants to straighten out its internal strife and then come to the table and\nAnd negotiate with us I don't care necessarily what goes on in and this is something that we're we're kinda morphing into now is a country will Baptist saying what goes on inside your country's your business we're not going to come into your country and like do you want to human rights were not going to come into your country and what you want what you should be doing\nUm you want to trade fine let's come up with a trade deal as fair for both of us\nAnd it and then we'll move on and we maintain that kind of relationship at arm's length it's not our business to be telling everybody else in the world to do what to do but it appears as though the the Venezuelan government is so unstable at this point they can't even get toilet paper for their people\nAnd I knew that and it but how do you train into the country like that\nWhile I'm again I'm I think the whole thing comes with intervention I think it's got to a point where\nUm the I I watch the special the other day of ah of North Korea the lifestyle there is incredibly bad people are are left in the dark I mean you have some Arab nations and uh we're not the world's\nPolice and that's why I think that there should be more emphasis in the end for the un and um they should be the world's police and every next and find it and go in as a a operational force because I just feel sorry for Venezuelan\nNorth Korea or some of the Arab states um it it's out of control and you say well why should we get involved because it's a small world and and what happens overseas now um affects the facts\nThat well the middle east there was a perfect example of what happens when we get involved and we start to try to tell other countries what to do right I mean you were looking to look at Iraq I mean there's a perfect example of us going over there and saying hey yeah you know we're going to get rid of you dictator for you and this is what you're going to do and got to be\nKind of democracy and they don't even know what that means they don't even know and and and that's where the problem comes in because ... our lifestyle is unique and and for\nFor an Arab country that's been in existence for two thousand years and all of a sudden you want to and that is tribal and you want to make it into a democracy it doesn't work that way and it just makes things worse and that's why you know this whole world order ... and again not getting for the financial end to that\nBut not that it it it makes sense to to get more emphasis in the un\nAh politics and things like that and\nWe we took what two hundred and forty years ago we took on the the the the biggest military force in the world the British navy in the world right and we didn't have any guns we didn't have any you know one of them went ah you know you maybe hunting rifles or whatever and we took them on a one because we\nDecided that we didn't like the form of government that was being forced on us at that point and we said you know what we're not going to deal with this anymore and we went out we struck her own deals with the with the doctrine we struck deals with the French in awe and various other people to assist us\nUm in in Winning Our freedom and maintaining our freedom you don't want a lot of these other countries have to take on these kind of responsibilities to we cannot go in and fight everybody's fights for them as much as ... as much as we'd like to\nUh we can work with you we can sport to remind you money maybe sell you arms or or you know it ... but we cannot continue to get involved in civil wars around the globe and Venezuela's a perfect example of why don't why other people in Honduras\nA soccer bananas [laughter]\nNo I agree and and you don't get the point about it is a big role in all of this to be just the media feeds off the gas and and they try to provoke the politicians not the politicians\nOn didn't have the media to go on and in it and put out a lot of the crap that they put out on the situation my top down but for example do go one Hillary or whatever any and then we'll go on a CNN\nAnd they'll see all kinds of nasty things about tropical go on MSNBC see all kinds of nasty things about Trump\nIt later on in the box news is just money and not on hand he's he's screaming at work yeah\nYou know snap to win over the edge\nYeah you know I mean it's just like I said before you know you know if you sold adventure undergrad and all because you know it's just you know we are good for your yeah but I\nI thought well you know saying that bad things I'm like wow I'm like you know it's like a ... your fruit for her garden you you're not let an outlet and we'd be freed among\n... are good for her to you know and it just goes to show that that I Believe there's more behind and a lot of the stuff than than what we see\nOh no question yeah well let me ask you because that was my next question to you is going to be do you think something like this now will kind of change things and it will see people behave better do you think it's going to make it worse\nWell you know America's burns hats are you know our ... and ... and you're like a lot of times we don't want to believe that we don't want to see that but I Believe our this is like a spiritual\nRoom that it didn't\nHave to force her and then try to ruin our country unless we pick or ... ... you know it's going to happen just like a lot of things in that regard like years ago when it happened and now the here and we're like oh I never ... that would happen I don't know about this would happen would have ... men do nothing\nEvil were running\nWell our parents are always said it started with that damn rock and roll Elvis Presley went on TV in ... I was in the world went to ... right\nYeah it's [laughter] you know it's just too bad at all because you know everybody has ... I mean for the you know at the end there you know\nNo I agree with you a hundred percent in but you know the thing is though it has to be condemned roundly and it has to be condemned by both sides now to his credit I'm a Trump guy but I mean to his credit Trump has been on this week he has been condemning\nThis behavior all week long even today had another a statement out of the White House he was on TV earlier you know this is despicable this guy's going to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and this is what we need to hear from our leaders and unfortunately we don't always hear it when\nWhen you saw my low for example in in the end of the UC Berkeley building and and it's set in the building on fire and trying to crash through the windows and everything you didn't hear the other side come out and say this is despicable and we got to condemn this and we have to you don't hear that\nIn it but it has to be that kind of behavior has to be roundly rejected and denounced when it happens by everybody involved both sides it has a\nCertain I mean a personal preference nice dependable cars because\nYes across that if there was no price to pay people just keep going\nWell see that's the other point to now we saw all the damage that was done with the uh door on an occupation day right with the pain cats down and Washington and then the finish smashing Carson settings on fire most of those people walk away scot free\nYeah that's you know I mean people you know if you do damage you need to be made an example because\nOf the law will just keep happening and I am ... that you know as far as the fire the there's no consequences anymore\nAnd exactly that's exactly right and we saw that in Baltimore too I mean after the uh you know when they write it in Baltimore they set the CBS on fire people looting and everything else the police are standing down on the orders in the mayor letting it happen in how many people were prosecuted in Baltimore for looting that CBS do I bet you like none of them\nYeah and that sort of sad because because I mean like I said we're all have yours but we have to respect each other's\nQuestion that I respect us thanks for your for your call appreciate it very much earning five ... five hundred dollars but that's exactly true I mean the caller is right on that there were no consequences\nThe the behavior that you do and when your political leaders do not condemn that kind of behavior\nYou know when you when you got a situation like guys you know a Brock Obama goes out there um and you have a a Jesus the names of the ... gave me at the moment a senior moment here uh when you had the uh uh what was his what's his name now a George um [noise]\nWhat's the uh the the uh I'm a guy that shouldn't have even gone down this road because my brain cells are are not uh intact right now I'm the er what was it the the the kid that was in Florida um\nThe kid that was um was trying to Trayvon Martin and I can't remember the the the guy that to kill him but he was a a he was acquitted\nYou'd want to say George Foreman it's not George Foreman he was a fighter who's Georgia somebody rather I don't recall his name out some of my head but he\nWas um you know you have a situation where a somebody died\nIn a confrontation and you've got the president um comes out on TV\nAnd start saying well Trayvon Martin if I had a kid he'd look like Trayvon Martin and now you're infusing the situation with race rather than condemning the violence and condemning the behavior this is this is why you know this is why it gets so angry when I hear people talking about Charlottesville\nBecause last year he had the situation in Charlottesville ride where you had a um people who I find to be very despicable and their points of view I'm not a white supremacist I don't support white supremacy but these people have petitioned for the right to have a march in Charlottesville and they were granted a permit\nAnd then you have the antifa people show up on buses with weapons and everything else and engage them and um got bloody somebody died somebody died was a horrible situation\nTo hate groups meeting together and they clashed in somebody died as a result in online poker somebody had gone there and uh George Zimmerman thank you very much Patrick for that or just a [laughter]\n[noise] I Am the greatest greatest listeners in the world because they always ... me or or tax me when when my mind goes off the rail here George Zimmerman was the guy was trying to think of I'm not George rate wasn't George Foreman take that to the bank or isn't judge Mormons George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin um [noise]\nBut you know in Charlottesville last year you need to have um what happened was the president came out and he condemned it he said on both sides were both ...\nBoth sides are at fault those white supremacist\nWho do you yeah the other guys maybe more white supremacist but they were itching for a fight that was antifa\nAnd they engage day permitted march that was going on there and these guys had every right to be there whether you like them to that they had every right to be there and TV shows up with weapons engage them in a riot somebody died of course both sides were responsible for that of course both sides of the president\nCalls that oh he's a racist either white supremacist remembered Charlottesville\nWhen you have to gangs of people both of them with even with\nTens both of them are armed and they go at each other yeah they're both responsible\nFor that and the community of Charlottesville didn't deserve that and the young woman who died certainly didn't deserve it both parties with Iraq and the president was one hundred percent right to say that by the way not as excel five hundred your next to the w._b. us and I'm good afternoon\nHow are ya good way to go to if you don't mind baseball and the Sox yep yes\nI Would like to say to her to run and\nSo we're looking forward to a good game tonight\n[noise] so what did you move Simon's you line up yet but they were talking about putting ... that's on second base\nMistake well actually that may not want to keep a I'm a martini as I Know they want to keep all that and the game yeah but he's got a slight injury to the ankle yeah he may not even start tonight\nI think they should give them ... ... ... ... if they got a ... a lefty if they got a right handed pitcher put ... ... ... and give my teen is a day off and I don't think those anything\nYeah I think that's a good idea or at least have them on standby if you need him to come in late in a pinch it I I think that makes perfect sense ... feel put the holes that second in ... and not let the J. D. rest that than ankle I mean boy you know I mean there's only potentially two more games to go in the season but you want everybody operating at full soldiers you know they\nSeem to do pretty good one this one of the one of the top his role they seem to do pretty good yeah and we think that for so long going tonight is usually on the ball yeah and I think I think there'll be alright if they do that\nLooking forward to looking forward to getting my yeah ...\nIt should be should be um open they can do it and for I'd like to see him win at all but ... if you can do it in for Jordan for\nAbsolutely do it yeah I Do do it when you can do I get it done All right my friend are going to hold you there for ... five or six or five hundred let me take a break it appears as though the Justice Department people gathering now uh for the press conference which is about to\nBegin a hopefully we'll get some new information on what's happening down in this situation with the the mailings I I don't want to see male bombings because they weren't bombs I don't want to say no bombings is all being ... that's it I mean these are basically toys", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "New Bedford", "day": "26"}
