he said was evidence to prove that he is telling the truth\nAnd that the charges against him are bogus probably in my opinion anyway and I'm not a lawyer I didn't even play it on the radio but um I may not have tipped my case but that's me I don't know this is all strategic one of the best lawyers Kevin reading can write corruption lawyer I'm\nIn Massachusetts best corruption or the money can buy so I don't know maybe ready for reading tend approved of it than now maybe ah ah they think it's okay but the case doesn't go to trial for more than a year from now [noise] so\nWhy does he all the press conference this morning he held a press conference to first of all a try to challenge some of the evidence against them I don't think he's trying to case\nAt this point I think what he was doing by doing that in addition to saying look I'm not going anywhere I'm going to stay on the job\nBook is called the charge in charge indicted he hasn't had a they for which there is nothing could be done at this point in that\nNot like it because I really liked the in the program give me the people that wasn't the main let's see if but even\nEven in great I mean what what Warren's sure wiring scheduling a recall election even if you signed up\nOn anyone can can launch allegation against\nPoint and so he must one term he gets kicked out of their uh will Flanagan comes along well Flanagan did what will Flanagan did\nUm then I he was there for a short time he's recalled then you've got Sam shutter he's there for a short time he's out Jason Korea comes and inherits a huge deficit and is

we've ever had down here mhm yeah I mean he he was the man but I'm Sorry with all due respect it missed the cut his people are listening he was like a deer in headlights as a male and I'm Sorry he was just\nThe strength which just being pope and he couldn't he couldn't and\nSo one question that was put forth in him unless he could get back to you and that's that's bad is in there and that and he turned around and he took credit for things\nThat change let's done that yeah they might have been ideas of yours but there was nothing financially that with him for it and I pray to God you're gonna you gonna run or he's going to run again I pray to God that that the citizens of Fall River or don't go back to somewhere like\nSam I Am not really don't think he will Steve I don't think so too well you know to be honest with you and I I base this on not much except gut instinct I don't think so I don't want us to be mayor ... but I think he was kind of pushed into it\nAnd he was a there he was kind of a straw guy you know and I really don't think he was interested in it he had to look like Seventy percent approval rating as district attorney when he decided to run for mayor I said to him\nWhat would you want to get this for you know you've got ... percent approval rating ... and I told him this and I sent it on the air at the time I said whoever wins this special election to replace\nWill Flanagan will not win reelection and sure enough it happened nine months later he was out the door ran down and you know you're\nVery yesterday your gas you out on a Jimmy mental yeah um I don't care what anyone says I don't believe for a minute that isn't the one who's starting who's doing this anti rally that he's not the one started it\nUm in in my eyes ... definitely the one I'm we all know can I say who he's been ... at the back row for the longest time is I mean someone you like Linda per hour he's been in her camp um since the beginning\nWhere he just knows that during the interview yesterday he did say that he voted to her and was a very active with her campaign yeah\nRight I I may have missed that but he um we're with all due respect Jimmy is ah Jimmy's very well entrenched in ah in local politics being a union union representative and um I was just from that you didn't talk a little more about was warm and on your intro\nBefore you went to him yeah we're going to be that would have been floated\nHow I'm going to try to get into this war and a little bit when I get out and I give me a couple of seconds if you want to comment on that but I'm going to get into that a little bit too early to round up because this is an amazing story\nAbs absolutely I Can't believe in all my years of watching politics I cannot believe how much this may be one of the biggest ... I've ever seen and the mainstream media make sure that they went to bat for her and they've got egg on their face\nThey looked at doing what she said you\nCame out very I never thought the Cherokee Nation was going to come out with a statement I never did honest to God because now she's been proven to be a liar because everything she said about her paw paw and the generations going back don't even match up half for six generations before she said\nThat they sit there where are the people were the ones who are being persecuted right it's just so and\nAnd her parents yeah I I just wonder Steve what the hell was she thinking when she put the south because she had this done right and she could have easily crumble it up and throw it in the garbage nobody would've ever known as she had it on why she puts his\nI'll be honest about it I have I have personal friends who are working on her campaign and someday you and I are going to have a coffee and you won't believe how that campaign works the network that they have 'em but I digress um\nThey said that that was one of the things he's my friend told me that that's one of the things that they worried about with her running for president they're already looking path\nI Know but you don't want to see if we if she had a month ago two months ago came out and said you know what like most people I grew up\nListening to my grandparents stories in the folklore of our family\nAnd it was always passed around at Thanksgiving dinner that we were descendants of the charities you know I've done a little research I found out maybe the stories were a little bit exaggerated I Apologize I didn't mean to mislead anybody as a result of that I'm going to write a nice little check to the uh you know to the kids to the Cherokee foundation or whatever let's move on and it would have been a little while\nAgo I I think that she was in so deep find if there was no thinking out she could have done that two years ago\nShe could've done that yesterday instead of using this thing they have to hurt or political suicide\nYeah I don't see I don't think she could have done that yesterday I think he was stuck between a rock in an odd place\nBut this is worse I oh this is absolutely worst than I'm waiting to see what the Boston Globe going to put out now because ah this is an absolute joke talk about having egg on their face\nThey two times they had to run corrections yesterday\nSo it's so sad that you know what are we teaching our kids about journalism livable majors\nIn there right now and I have to tell you that's one thing that really bugs me about these kids going into the school is what what are we what are these journalism majors being taught in these university\nPeruvian Mexican or Colombia\nAnd of course the media ran with a big story that Warren was indeed correct that she did have Native American ancestry\nWhich is amazing considering that even the most racist groups on earth do not consider you to be a member of a minority group if you have a minority ancestor three hundred years ago nonetheless CNN reported Elizabeth Warren released DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry\nAnd the Daily Beast headline was similarly friendly Elizabeth Warren fights comes Pocahontas font with DNA test proving\nNative American roots Elizabeth one at a meltdown last night\n[noise] and um\nWeeded out some some rather bizarre stuff will get into that a little bit of a good chance later on but she has been sharply criticized by Cherokee Nation a which blasted her a DNA test as a mockery and inappropriate\nAnd I'm also a a\nI mentioned ... President Trump today called her phony called the test bogus and said that when he promised to give the million dollars to charity it had to prove the test had to prove that she was\nAh in fact Native Americans he says she wants to do another one in a way to look forward to being there but ah I'm I have to be there and a half a supervised this um\n[noise] by the way Cherokee Nation now reports the Warren has refused to meet with representatives of the Cherokees okay that's it that's what the Cherokee Nation is reporting they've attempted to meet with ... she's refused to meet\nA number of Democrats are freaking out wondering what the hell was she thinking about when she started this controversy just twenty two days before the um the mid term elections and a number of commentators have even a criticized there too including CNN and MSNBC fighter waiting and I think so five hundred thanks for hanging on your next the w._b. SM\nLibrary river calm you there in the ... time location I dont\nPretty good phone wherever you want and would you like to seek refugee here in ... in New Bedford we can put ya find you some housing for [laughter]\nA law at all I I Do think they should have a special election let the people decide regarding the man\nBefore or after the trial because the color and you know get a caller about an hour ago they said look even if you have a special election and remove him from office that way what has he done at this point other than be accused\nRight absolutely because if they they presume he's you know they try to\nGet among now was assuming that you know with all his rhetoric that he\nHe's probably done something well you know by\nRemoving him early that makes that makes for about ... bad yeah there you know it's like beating you know step up and do the right thing I I just think they should be an election what the people decide and if they choose\nYou know to have them removed you know the people choose to do that then the people spoke I mean they shouldn't they shouldn't do it\nAll river I just got attacks from Seventy says I Would question his integrity if he was to stay in office when there was smoke there's fire stepped down\n[noise] wow\nAnd I'll tell you that's being judged Jorja accuser and everything and hang man all in all at once right\nWell if this smoke I mean and all the parents who have the lighter\nYeah yeah exactly started the fire yeah I mean we know some of these people behind the scenes have been fairly missed by right absolutely\nYeah again you know I I hate to keep bringing in this case backup but remember the Duke lacrosse case in La Crosse the to the members of the the Duke University La Crosse team that uh were accused of ... main rate than I recall\nIt you just mentioned it earlier on the air but I I don't\nMean this was a case about ten years ago where where I think it was five or six members of the Duke university lacrosse team are accused of gang raping the woman okay they were destroyed they were kicked out of school they were tried these poor kids weren't wearing tears you know a demanding\nOr did they were innocent people listen to them the whole country just seemed to everybody and of course the the woman that claimed as she was rape was African American you had a you know Jesse Jackson you had a\nA remedy now everybody's all over the place and then the woman we can't do the story said he never happened\nI didn't eat well did you hear the nightly news last night I don't know if you watch the nightly news six thirty they had a gentleman I guess it was a upscale apartment loving and this white woman was at the door and this last gentleman who happen to live there was trying to get insurance\nBlock in the doorway asking them well well what are you doing here what a poverty you trying to get into he's like well it's not a businessman what apartment I live and I but I Do but yeah she said well I'm protecting my building he says well it's not your Golding\nYou're not security it's the people who rent this this apartment complex it's their building and I'm also a tenant she\nSays well what what you know what do you what do you go on trying to get and he says man but certainly a business you know so the lady looked stupid she ended up calling the cops and she ended up looking stupid\nYeah as usually people do when they try to you know when people mind everybody else's business they generally do tend to look stupid but yeah so she's accusing this guy trying to break into a building when in reality he lived there in in in probably she was doing that because of the color of their skin right\nRight she followed them right up upstairs right up to his arm and he says the look on putting the tea in the door and he finally had enough you're waiting for the police the shark and yeah you know she looked totally stupid\nSo we can make allegations all day long but allegations do not necessarily make a conviction right\nExactly like I said hey if if the man is proven wrong after trial then then have them removed but up until then\nLet them serve I think up until now like I said whether he he done anything illegal or not until up until that point I think he's been doing a decent job as well\nSo you know despite everything that you're hearing yeah so just like truck\nAlready sort of appreciating my friend five ... five hundred you're next on WB some good afternoon\nHello Hi Hi how you doing good how are you\nI'm a very good we have to believe Elizabeth Warren why because because she's a woman\n[laughter] oh okay that's right [laughter] oh what is that for us\nBelieve women that's right I'm ... I Wish everybody with their sides believe women right\nAt all she is she says racial I ... I can think he's a girl and get away with it and play girls' sports why can't she gets the transracial she's a ... year\nYeah she's a drain the trans indeed [laughter] is that any like a trans fat I don't know [laughter] so what do you make of this though I mean that was probably the dumbest political move anybody can make why did she do that\nI have\nNo idea why anybody would want to do that\nMean she didn't have to do it in because she just didn't have to do it it's\nAnd I [noise] I'm not I I mean like absolutely stupid fight over the fact that she just committed political suicide while she did\nYes you did I mean who's going to vote for a no won a national level she may when Massachusetts again in in in a Twenty one days but um I I Can't imagine anybody voting for her for president\nI ...\nUnbelievable I and my friend ... six o five hundred you're up next the w._b. is some good afternoon Hi Barry how you doing pretty good how are you\nOkay I Will a couple of points um has the woman I Know we always believe all the women have a link to it that that other guy to end the call I thought that was kind of funny\nYeah he was being funny yeah I I kind of realize that I thought it was kinda funny but as far as Elizabeth Warren goes I think she does have jumped deal get get a few more votes\nI I think she did yeah absolutely\nBecause this is totally ridiculous but then I got a question on to the days of career because I read this story on line one I don't know your particular WBFO Sam about him get any victims from his residence\nHe got elected from that and I'm like yeah he could have been there for him he's right well I hold on I he got infected from a building I'm not entirely certain that that was his residence\nBecause I think he could have been living up here because there are some apartments that are from businesses yeah I I don't\nI I was like I thought that was a little thing that I mean on top of everything that's going on for him in Fall River and that's all of a sudden that comes out of us like yeah he didn't he wasn't paying as renting you know what I'm saying his money for other things with that thought it's pretty silly yeah or or if he was a very bad neighbor\nWell you know what I'm not going to pass judgment on that 'cause I have no idea I anything I said would be speculation at this point I'm not sure that he lived there that was in ... that was a formal um address\nUh but that doesn't always mean anything I mean we had a state representative here in town or gave an address and your bedroom and lived in Freetown forever I'm okay you know what I mean and yeah\nUm 'cause I thought that was the little I dunno weird off you know what I mean just like one on top of everything else I mean Victor dies as a kind of felt bad for him but if this is like maybe a second address\nFor him but um since between him and Elizabeth Warren for you guys are you guys having fun on on the radio the last couple of days\nWell you know I mean it's it's it's like\nNight and day here were these two stories I mean you can hear you got a young guy who's been accused of something and and you don't want baby I wouldn't feel I of course I Would I Would like to think I Would feel strongly about this that you are innocent until proven guilty\nBut I mean if we had not just gone through this a couple of weeks ago with Kavanaugh remember cabinet are being accused of doing something and it everybody's ready to hang the guy knew no proof that he did anything wrong at least at this time there's no proof that Jesuit Korea's done anything wrong he has not had a trial yet\nYou'll do combined the department of labor and education about preschool committee member John Barrow voted against following the M A S C recommendation telling WBFO some news the federal government should have much less per view in education that are currently does federal\nGovernment mandates way too many things should be the jurisdictions the parents in the local communities to get the federal government out of education I think would be a Rand idea because our education system is not improved under the department of education committee\nPassed a motion to follow the recommendation although there are also opposed a recommendation to provide accommodations for transgender students like gender neutral locker rooms are private shower stalls\nSaying it would impose an undue burden the tax payers\nThat we've been some news time as two oh five sports the American league championship series shifts to Houston pregame three

goodness right\nWell welcome back to the program ... had some very interesting comment today from folks on the ... story as well as the alleged Warren story both or a really hot stories around this part of the country\nAnd I just wonder if anybody out there who may be I was thinking about endorsing aren't voting for a Elizabeth Warren might be impacted in any way by this out by this whole fiasco of her with her DNA tests to yesterday\nUm and and the question about Korea if you're just tune again and haven't been listening or the mayor says that he will not resign even though he's been indicted\nBy a federal grand jury and faces a Thirteen count in a federal corruption I indictment then died today and held a news conference to point out what he says are holes in the prosecution store\nAnd also says that if he is going to be removed from office that it should be as a result of a special recall election and not at the hands of the city council that could happen tonight\nFrom getting down but they're the city's gonna go nuts I'll call you\nYou just gave me two stories to talk to them ever done [laughter] she's Oh thank you my friend ... very much already five but we know Ninety five hundred is a number of you and makes the w._b. assume thanks man in a\nHigh high who got some hot topics going on yeah busy busy time of year you\nDizzy well what I wanted to say about Warren wise I haven't been able to catch the whole show all day but I've been in and out so I don't know if other people mentioned\nThat by the fact that she puts out there that her parents had to allow the call her grandparents whatever how low because you know somebody was so racist yeah that sounds like it's much more recent in her history\nIn her blood line yeah the racist rather than the native so I Wonder why that would be brought up as confirmation\nThat she's Indian that I have racist in my family you know so that seems more recent\nAnd values you'd be brought up with more than ... you know suppose it um ancestry [noise]\nWell then you that that is I Believe it was her parents if I recall her parents are supposedly had to\nI had to low because her mother on was not accepted by her father's family because for Native American uh uh heritage um so you're you're right I mean that's that's I mean that's putting a very close to today right\nRight and not only that it seems like those would\nBe the morals and values and you know what you're ... you know close relatives hold dear I see nothing that she's even claimed that she follows any native\nAmerican customs traditions or what they hold dear to their tribes [laughter] you know so it sounds like she's you know justifying checking\nA box to have an advantage for herself but I don't know say how many people she's hired or um advocated for getting jobs\nIn and around to where she's worked does she have any Native American Indians or was it just to benefit her but she doesn't really look back and try to um given advantage to the rest of her try [laughter]\nThose serving according to the statement right here from the folks in the end the Cherokee tribe they've attempted to meet with her and she refuses to meet that's what I'm saying so\nIt sounds to me from what I've seen a room or in in general is it's all about me it's\nWhat works for me it's what benefits may I don't really care about you know who comes in my ancestry who my constituents or anything she's got a forward agenda\nAnd it's really a hundred percent used to her advantage but I really don't see it as you know her advocating for her constituents or anybody else you know I find it very self serving I don't find that she\nClaims to be you know serving the people I I really can't look through a lot of uh examples of that\nAnd I many blows me away that she would even released this and I can't get over that I mean this is something that if I had gotten these results back I Would have toss it in the garbage I don't think she stupid um I think she's very intelligent woman she graduated from law school she's US Senator so she's got to hit on her shoulders there's no question about it\nUm so what made her think this was a good idea to release this report it goes way\nWell this was what I think I think um you know I Believe Hilary clinton thinks she's you know brilliant and everybody else is stupid and I think this shows in some ways that's what she believes it's going to be like you know hey everybody\nToo stupid nobody can do math I'll just say yeah that show's on Native American it doesn't even show that she's Indian native to this country\nIt's unreal and the ... over does it up to nobody know Clinton you know tried is going to claim you\nKnow I don't think she knew very dense and stupid I don't think she knew that going ended on west stupid do do you think she knew all that going in I don't think she knew that going into but he announced\nHey I'm going to take a test on Tuesday the ... you know I don't think anybody knew about it until\nAfter no but what I'm what I'm saying is you don't want to hear some on his land late here's something that I honestly believe I honestly believe that growing up Elizabeth Warren had been told all of this stuff because here I never\nChecked my answer and you're close to what my parents\nTell their stories get carried down over the years and everything else and sometimes they get embellish show I think she honestly believe this job but I you know what don't point back in the eighties she pulled it out and she said hey you know what I'm I I'm going to I'm going to try to make this work for me and so she put down on your application so she was Native American\nI think when she went to get this DNA tests done she had no idea what it was going to what it was going to show and correct\nAnd that's why she didn't I don't think she announced ahead of time until she thought it was\nLittle short of proof of what she was\nSaying this is actually going to take the test on such and such a day we didn't I didn't oh no no no no she didn't she did she would have to the fat she\nAnd I think in that instance she was thinking was seriously\nPeople enjoy it but yeah but my my point here is that she could yeah when she found out when she got the results back she could have said holy crap I really don't have any ancestry and I've been saying that I Am if by releasing those people are gonna know I'm a fraud I'm going to throw it in the garbage so why didn't she told me the garbage why did she really saying\nI Believe she actually thinks it's going to say one little ... you know and heroin or had one little cell in our body shows that there is a possibility and she's trying to justify that what she believed it is true and she does think people are too stupid\nTo do the math to check to find out what you know real tribes think of\nA counselor and she could have just hit the evidence you would have probably look even more suspicious if she's like oh let's just talk that under it was going to be brought up\nWhat are we going to be brought a book to me when I Would have done if I was in her position I Would have got those test results back and I would like holy crap I'm I was wrong this doesn't die a show that I'm a Native American I Would have just throwing the garbage and I'm going to come out with a statement and I'm going to say hey you know want all of these stories on my grandma mall my top part all this ...\nThis is what I believed I honestly just with all my heart that it was true I Am heartbroken to find out that it wasn't true\nAnd um you know as a result of that I Hope it didn't offend any Native Americans and I'm going to write a check to the little orphans of the uh the Cherokees and so on and so forth and die and
