tossing a cornfield\nRemember that Elizabeth Warren's statement was what I feel bad for her family but the problem here is on the babies of their arms to like when you're watching the debate I and and the caller is absolutely correct\nAll that is a big issue um it is amazing how the uh you know the president has been talking about the last\nIn this country which you know look I don't know whether you're a Democrat when you've been a Democrat your whole life or whether you walk away and your independence now or whatever the Democratic party did you see being I'm I'm a\nYou know carrying out into stocks on the streets right now there's got to the Democratic party you came from\nA generation ago or even less than that this is this is something totally different it's a radicalized\nA Democratic Party has been taken over you know why because it's leaders got complacent\nOr Schumer and Pelosi in a gang just really get out of touch with the American people were talking about yesterday's both parties\nAre people are sick and tired of being sick and tired of both parties okay that's my Trump won on the Republican side because you want and really a Republican and um people are just sick and tired of ah\nBut you know Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Maxine Waters and the whole gang um the Democratic party has become a mob and angry mob\nAnd it's true I mean think about the last couple of years three years right all the people that would that would a beat up Trump's supporters before his rallies a prior to the election in during you know before the debates think about that about the people that were beaten\nUp think about people that you've seen videos of of an old woman in Boston remember that being dragged across the ground because she had a ... and was carrying an American flag and pick up the antifa\nAre encounters with ah with folks\nAre out there that they disagree with them think about my low being unable to speak as a conservative and uh\nUh the protesters antifa protesters out in California these are things that the Democrats don't speak out against as a matter of fact the Democrats encourage this kind of behavior continuously they can they they they encourage it I mean you go about Hillary Clinton Tim Kaine Eric Holder and others that are sending messages from the sidelines\nBasically saying yeah beer in civil\nFairly you know don't be civilized be out there you know do do what you got to do on the streets mix it up in order to uh you know in order to resist\nAnd um it is a mob mentality or the mafia has been called on to harass opponents in public places such as airports in restaurants and and so on and so forth so when the president talks about a mob mentality is absolutely right and you see the video on\nLine of the

me calling later if you want to show us yep\nOkay so you know like you're talking about this issue with the ah\nThe left but you know ... the left and and how the Democrats have been sitting idle Levi you and I know a lot of good Democrats I mean we live in the state of Massachusetts correct sure I mean the most some of 'em are our friends and family yep I and I had this conversation\nLast night with one of them and I'm almost to the point where they said to me you know and I I'll be honest with you there related to me and they said to me you know see I'm loyal to your party I said I Am what\nI said I'm not loyal to I'm not loyal to a Republican who goes out and beat somebody I'm not loyal to I'm not loyal to the KKK I said we got rid of the KKK long ago they've been extradited\nI think there are small they are such a small minority compared to and people I think the ... the Republican absolutely this about the radical\nAbortion it from the from the eighties and nineties they've been sold so marginalized ... they're not even around any more they have they've had to go underground with the left doesn't seem to just I just didn't want to do that\nI could say you're going to tell me are you going to sit there and vote for someone like Rick Warren who you might agree with that these instead of what she does because she's a Democrat\n[laughter] well I mean you know there's no way that anybody regardless of what part of your man should be civil quoting I'm a party that is althea beating women now if you've got soldiers on the streets that are trying to intimidate women from voting for Republican candidates\nOr working for Republican candidates throughout the beating these women to be on a candidate out in Minnesota who suffered a concussion after being beaten\nUm that is wrong and that has to be denounced and that has to be on those people have to be eliminated from the party the party has to distance himself from those people in in so far nobody in the Democratic party has done that\nWell you you've seen that you you mentioned that you mentioned the guy from George Soros they asked was a\n... a paid a person for drugs or they get hired him yeah only because the police department told them you guys are cops on they told you got to do something about the guys out of control and you're going down with a great\nSo that's how my dark I think right my stark he's had several ah several uh run ins with with that a lot of violence against done a lot of people in the opposite party yeah us\nEspecially since Trump's importing his record as long as long as distinguished but\nUm you know ... that that woman the the one who got it from the Ted Cruz the one that was out there with campaign signs that you see that guy yeah I did yeah\nI knew that that is my wife biggest fear\nIs that that some day that's going to happen I mean she's paranoid about that she thinks this even though she wanted me to put my money when my mom 'cause she said to me you know that's my biggest fear when you walk outside because that's the way they are out there Saturday that was me I'd have been arrested that guy would have got plugged either dropped him in two seconds\nHe that was absolutely uncalled for and out of control and I have I have issues with people who do that because I was bullied as a child and I think that's what's the find me on why I have\nThe problem with some of the stuff that goes on it and that's that's that's exactly what that is\nWell yeah you got to wonder what's up in a person's brain anyway I mean the the I did a blog today it's up on WB of summed up comments on Facebook us on Twitter and I I wrote all about this stuff that we're talking about here the or the Democrat a mob mentality in what some of the things that they're doing\nAnd I included a couple of videos in at I'm In one of the video says uh from Tucker's program last night and he went through a lot of this stuff too\nAnd he had some of the Ted Cruz tape in there and when Cruz was being harassed at the airport\nBut he also had the the tape when when Cruz and his wife or trying to eat and the people came in the restaurant and they were yelling at him shame shame and all of that stuff and um you know what\nKind of person standing in front of somebody while they're trying to eat in a republic restaurant and yells at them anyway I mean you you got some serious mental issues if that's what you're doing\nWhat about you know they have that because the woman the nine eleven widow yeah that that I found that I found that to be one of the most of the things I ever seen in all my years of being involved in politics I've never I've never seen anything like\nThat I have this idea that tape is on the block to people can go and watch that too that's up there\nI mean I think that I think that's the one that shocked me the most was that one and how he was talking through no respect it all you know what can you tell me now that's on fire oh okay can you tell me where where the me too movement is with that\nWell that's a problem to meet you mow movement is never where they're supposed to be there never with a you know why people like I'm\nA ... what's your name the or the woman that was raped by Bill Clinton I'm\nI'm Juanita Broderick joined with no they they never with her\nUh they're never way that the woman remember the woman during the Trump campaign when she was in California\nAnd uh they've that the guys are forced to rent to the corner of the ... and it was pushing eggs interface and everything else wish to meet you movement on that stuff that's going on there there are always sign and you never hear Gloria Steinem you never hear rosy you never hear any of these people right\nYeah you know it cracks me up the two of the biggest ones who are on the left around me could present and and the Cold War with the form of communication person for George W. Bush I can tell you she ... into a little inside baseball you gotta you gotta make it a career at MSNBC because she's going to be basically hopes\nAre if and when Trump done because you'll have no Korea she will never be ... that woman will never be welcome in the Republican Party ever again but some of the stuff that you owe ... and you know what they ... they had been virtually silent\nWell when I you know what I I don't get is when all of this stuff became acceptable behavior because I'll tell you what over the course of my sixty years I worked on campaigns before\nAnd you know what you go to the polls in your ... your your opposition is there and you're holding signs you may be taunting each other new teasing each other it's on a good natured\nBut I mean to go out and actually split somebody's goal or from the other side I'm you know want to give them a concussion or whatever I mean that that is absolutely gone beyond the pale and I I just can't believe we're seeing that kind of thing happened in our country [noise]\nAnd and it's happening it's happening more and more every day yeah and that's and then there's so many ... and I again I asked the question some of our democratic friends where are you on this is your plan on stopping it yeah man on stepping in and asking yourself is it worth it\nOr even say something about it publicly say something you know Hillary Clinton will go on TV and then uh [noise] you know have all kinds of comments about everybody else to go on Twitter but why doesn't she put a statement out there she thinks she so influential same enough you're saying knock it off this isn't how we behave\nShe's in ... she definitely probably because it's\nAll unfortunately with that one it's all about her yeah it it's just I don't know I just think that I think that it's going to get worse before it gets better oh no quieter yeah I don't know where\nYou're going to go ... if we win if we weren't on November sick\nEither way it is going to get back to the free she had to my friend thank you find the way nine six o five hundred your next to the w._b. assembled afternoon but after the ... Hi I'm\nA ... to ... lying on the radio spawning\nAnd I'm I'm Kennedy who is always something good food yeah um\nOr something interesting at least he um actually ashamed Democrat and he's an independent now are you never know by referring to him\nIs independent in lying of leaning that way you can you imagine\nWell you know something you don't have to see this is this is what's interesting is that you don't have to change your views on issues and um to denounce the behavior of the Democratic party um you can still have your beliefs\nAre as a Democrat but not condoning they're violent behavior\nYou know what I you know what I mean I mean you you it doesn't change your views on on how you feel things out to be done um but certainly we are I think all of us should be denouncing the violence there's no rule for that in our system\nTo know that was coming it it's a strategy that Gonzales is used throughout the campaign\nLinking a Baker to deal with dust to Trump so uh but bigger is totally caught off guard didn't know what to say\nAnd um when he was asked\nWhether or not he was going to vote for deal it ... the bagels I don't\nEven know how you get when you want to ask that girl out oh he's supposed to do that these days I don't know but the guys used to get off the tongue tied sometimes they wanted us to that grill out you know well that's how big are got when he was asked the question about whether he's going to vote for deal earlier in the middle\n\nI don't know I haven't decided yet haven't thought about the moderator even said to him governor you endorse this guy you don't know what you're going to vote for him\nAfter the debate was over is that chicken ... he was running out of the place the press grabbed him and said what the hell is that all about it oh yeah yeah yeah I just misspoke well let's not misspoke ... speaking when you say I don't know whether I'm going to vote for the guy indoors that's not miss speaking\n\nSo anyway Baker had to address it are all day yesterday and he's probably going to have to address it all the way up to the veterans right and a bakery yesterday I reiterated his intend to vote for for Jeff deal\n\nYou simply says he misspoke simply misspoke in the back and forth\nAnd plan to vote for deal and the rest of the Republican ticket in Massachusetts look I've supported candidate over the years that I didn't agree with on everything Democrats and Republicans ... percent on a on Thursday according to ... live\nWhen asked about his support for deal with whom he differs on issues including women's reproductive rights\nAnd support for President Trump why did they say women's reproductive rights why did they call it what it is abortion I Know abortion is one of those ugly words that they don't like to use like illegal immigrant they don't like to do that so it's on documented immigrant right\nNow it's illegal immigrant it's not women's reproductive rights is the Martian here have plain and simple\nIf you're a garbage man you're a garbage man sanitation engineer I don't know about that you get an engineering degree and an engineer salary I don't think so if I'm an engineer if I'm if I'm a sanitation engineer I Want the pay of an engineer right\n\nOff the name of an area where he agrees with deal Baker pointed to deal successful push for years ago for a voter repeal of a plan to index the gas tax to inflation issue than Baker advocated for when he ran for governor of two thousand four\nSo just another flip flop basically Baker does not agree with much of what deal says\nHe doesn't agree with much of what Trump says Baker is a Democrat and Republican clothing and I didn't know why he ran as a Republican to begin with because he's not a Republican he's a Democrat so it was kinda dumb for him to run as a Republican\nBecause he is and why so Baker says well gee you know\nEven though I advocated for indexing the gas tax in other words allowing the gas tax to go up every year automatically without the legislature having to vote on it or the governor of having\nTo sign that by letting it go up by a virus\nWas for that when he ran for governor of the first time\n\nBut now he's opposed to it\nBut Baker says I think it's interesting that my opponent continues to wants to talk about the Senate race instead of what's going on here in Massachusetts and that that certainly is a valid point and the governor should have said that\nWhen he was asked about going to go you're going to vote for do you have to that's what it should have said why don't have the Senate race where they set up new running Massachusetts but he said he went to go\nAnd now he's got a whole lot of problems as a result of it\nBut Baker says I think it's because Massachusetts in large part things are going well and um\n[noise] [noise] stuff for gun sellers to get any traction on any issues Gonzales says we all know he didn't misspeak\n\nYou said multiple times that he hadn't decided whether he would be voting for Jeff deal during the debate this is exactly the type of behavior from politicians that turns people off governor bakers playing politics with our values and with people's rights and that's one thing I agree with Jake ... I agree with him a hundred percent on that\nYou why there is you're wasting you endorse the guy you must be planning to vote for him right why why shouldn't be any second guessing on that at all just say yes\n\nJust say yes I was interested to hear and and and I like well you know we had to of course Hendricks on in the first hour talking about the uh\nUh the tax situation because when I had when I had him because they're in here for the debate back in September I guess it was September just before the primary right\nUm [noise] we talked about a tax revenue and we were talking about revenue in general and both he and cause era expressed disappointment\nThat the gas and that the gas tax the millionaires tax than we do too many taxes in the state of stuff the most straight but the millionaires tax which the court ruled base it with the court Supreme Court said it was unconstitutional\nI mean how do you\nPick a select group of residents and say well we're going to raise your taxes but not everybody else's\nIt was a farce anyway because uh it really wasn't based on a million years income first of all it was based on a you know profits from your business and uh\nYou know money that could be even if they weren't profits money that your business to again and I didn't matter how much that you actually kept or expenses for the business or whatever it didn't matter you are you are considered a millionaire and they were going to they were going to tax you on it\nOr would it kill the economy in this state would have driven business people out of here with a closed businesses and um take an investment capital and moved it elsewhere so it was a horrible idea of the Supreme Court said you can't do it\nI'm Kevin Baker knew that he was advised that the legislative leadership our entire delegation because era [noise]\nUm I take me or all of them are ... they all knew what was illegal but they voted for it anyway they were told by their lawyers are open beacon hailed as this is in legal taxi can't do it but they all supported it and the secretary of state\nA bill Galvin approved it for the ballot even though\nHe knew that it was illegal because he was told by legal people and um so I mean it's it's a bunch of crap\nBut we had them on the debate anyway and as the discussion was about well you know ... [laughter] so what do you do and and then they both indicated that they would need to find new revenue source new revenue need to get new revenue we're counting on that millionaires\nActs you know that's a nice way to sell as easy to sell right now we're going to raise the taxes on the rich people even though the rich people the richest two percent in this country pay most the taxes\nAlmost all of the tax\nBut we've got to raise taxes for those bastards right because they're rich they got something we don't have so we're going to take it away from them\nSo both\nHendricks and cause the earth felt that we needed a new source of revenue to replace that so I was I was kind of answers to talk to him he did state here on the program that he does not support any new new broad based taxes or increasing\n\nAny existing broad base tax gas tax or ah you know like the soda tax the candy tax you know all of that stuff that the J Gonzales supported under\nDeval Patrick all those taxes that Jay Gonzales wrote the legislation for for the ball Patrick how to raise your taxes gas tax sugar tax or a sugary drink tax the booze tax all of these things they proposed under Patrick that Gonzalez wants to do as a governor\nI'm Hendricks says he doesn't support that\nAnd he says he sees no need now for any kind of broad base tax increases 'em and needs to study further and see the impact of a tax revenue that comes in through a marijuana sales and licensing and the same thing with that the casinos\nSo we'll see if that just position and that stays true to form then then I Want to have too much to fight with them about a but if he talks about broad based taxes in order to uh you know a pay for more programs and we're going to have some big disagreements let me take a break fiber wait another six o five hundred is the phone number we'll be right back after this\nFood being twenty W.
