didn't say that and the press is insisting that he did just by\nTheir own logic they're the ones who are inspiring violence not him because they're the ones who are insisting that he called them the enemy of the people when he called fake news the enemy of the people\nSo the prices are responsible and if you really want to go that far and have that argument which all argument should be based in truth that's the reality of the situation\nThis new defense and this is how the media is reacting to if you want to search for answers as to why this happened because it does seem\nWeird doesn't it like seriously the crown prince is going to go after them do who wrote for the Washington Post to was a legal American resident he wasn't a citizen who is a legal American resident who lived in Turkey or who lived in London in Istanbul\nWhy in the world was the crown prince going to go out for that guy so he was critical of the crown prince that seems weird because there are other people who have been dissidents but they you know I mean are walking around a live\nSo in searching for questions as to why this happened\nAnytime you ask a question anytime you try to get into maybe the back story like was there some sort of did he was there something between these two in the past like what's up I'm well this is how the media handles it quote headline conservatives mount a whisper campaigns to marry in ... and defensive Trump\nSo that's how they treat it if you are if you ask questions and you try to get in his background that's how they treat it because again nuances dead and these people are ethic more on you\nKnow I'm not using any nicer words because these people don't merit the energy of a more creative way to say more on their moron it's\nIt's insane people one ... in order to figure out what happened you kinda have to go back into someone's pass to figure out if there's something else other than him just writing hurt feelings words in Washington Post that triggered the crown prince so\nThat's the big question and so that's what a lot of people have been doing a lot of people have been looking back into his previous political uh associations et cetera\nThere is the story of him being associated with the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd apparently he was associated and this is according to a couple of other he was associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and he was and it was through that perspective that he was apparently critical of uh the crown prince\nAnd a Patrick pool who is a terrorism correspondent for PJ Media said that ... was a friendly and associated with\nFighters in Afghanistan that oppose the Soviet Union in Nineteen eighty eight he was one of notes pool a number of a journalist who had interviewed bin Laden and the eighties and nineties and he himself had to had had apparently treated stuff previously or had written stuff about uh the Muslim Brotherhood prior\nAnd the federalist have noted that as well\n[noise] um the well Shawn Davis over the federalist to tweeted it's almost like reality is quite different than the evidence free narratives pedal by the media with a long history of cooperating with or getting duped by Iran echo chamber architects\nAnd\nFor the media to say that this was a whisper campaign to try to whatever Trump I don't think people give that much of a crap about his reputation in this as opposed to well how is it that this is again you're a columnist for the Washington Post is targeted by Saudi Arabia how the hell does this happen\nWell there's more to the story as there is with every story and I do think that Shawn Davis has a huge point you're talking about the same people whose\nDallas Lee defended Brock Obama's insane stupid non deal with Iran these people are ... are apologist for Iran so if you immediately don't go with whatever narrative\nAbsent any evidence is best for Iran than anything the opposite of that is a smear campaign a whisper campaign what have you\nBut there's hard evidence that he was he was actually friendly to their particular ideology and political Islam Islamic has them more so than\nBut the soft reformation that people have seen trying to get started in the Arab world so there's something to that\nI mean there's there's there's there's something to this this isn't a whisper campaign this is what you do so I guess any time somebody tries to go and find evidence in a case that's a whisper campaign\nThis is called trying to ascertain what had happened asking questions to receive answers but it's not it's not as cut and dry and I'm Sorry but I really don't feel like taking the word\nOf a bunch of reporters who were duped by a romance writer in the previous administration who sold them a line of crap about Iran because they like to be an apologist for Iran\nWe're going to talk more about this coming up um additionally we will talk to Louie Gohmert later on in the program a about the latest concerning the caravan that's coming up from Honduras

crown prince the NBS in Saudi Arabia and the prince that may have acted on that kind of one of the people that he took action against\nMr ... soldiers are getting too and they're not that we don't have I just want to be there for viewers we do not have that reporting I'm not sure where you're getting\nThrough my backside I mean [laughter]\nThat's walking Castro the male version of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nHis twin brother bully on Castro he and his twin brother did which are real several years ago at the San Antonio river walk parade\nThe Joaquin was mayor and who Leon was something else and now one of the U.S rather than the others in hut or to or does some medical ... political parents right yeah and and they did they totally Lindsay Lowell hand that river barge\nAnd they didn't tell anybody and then afterwards when they were like well why you know the the guy they said well we can help it that we look alike uh-huh\n[laughter] that was their whole that's literally what they said I'm just I'm fascinated by this whole thing and absolutely fascinated by it so I don't he there's they're cookie already a and I'm not I'm not surprised at that ... says that he wants to run for president\nTwenty twenty which is slightly terrifying but you know there it is\nBut yeah walking Castro says his twin brother says yeah you know I mean you know because ... a Jew and un Jews totally can tell Middle Eastern arid to kill people because that's how it works\nWow does that sound lightly anti Semitic anybody else\nIn the\nAnti Semitic\nLike maybe one one thousand twenty four the anti Semitic you think golly I Can't believe he did that with a straight face that\nWow and\nThe way a puppy Harlow which job and it's probably Harlow who was talking to and then she said well we we don't have that reporting we shoot we we don't know where we don't know where he got that we don't we don't have their forty but you're always said that they'll like everything was may have in the may be in there\nWhich is so stupid\nI mean I'm Glad that she just you know shut it down immediately I don't know what he's I don't I have no idea\nI mean it's just crazy it's just this this crazy\nYou want to talk about but yet you know it's conservatives that are doing whisper conspiracy theories it's conservatives that are doing a whisper campaign meanwhile walking Castro's as well because a judge\nHero he got some people killed that's really what he's saying little one man must thought out their golly Joaquin\nI mean that's pretty that's like some that's like beyond the frogs are gay you know what I mean like if you like really far out\nThere that's really far out there [noise]\nBut to her credit probably ... says yeah we we don't that's we don't have we don't have that she's she says she was unfamiliar decided to make that up you know\nYeah we haven't decided to know his bro is not the dictator that's a different Castro Steve there are more than one pastor's more than one cause or a family from my reporting I Know Ira I've inside report it oh do do do you do you have inside versus one is walking cash right\n[noise] well then ... afterwards when Daily Beast Daily Beast published a story well then Joaquin Castro issued a statement saying that he did not intend to use your Christian or orchestrating the killing of democracy do you I mean but I did\nHow did not intend when you say Well Jerry cushion are gaining the hit list and said these people I didn't mean to imply that he gave him ... kill these people\nBut you said it but I didn't apply it no you you literally said it yeah this is the exact words but I didn't play it was an implied literally it was more than that you set it goes that's harder than an implication [noise]\nOh my God he was and him can you imagine him and his brother their mom founded ... she was a co founder of La Raza\nThey're crazy oh my gosh I don't even know if they do we know if it was never fully on I don't even know [noise] maybe that's why they got\nGood night no the ah who early on was the one who gave the twenty twelve keynote and that's one room and I had said even then I said they're going to try to groom them watch it I said it years ago I've always had my I had my eye on them for years\nSo I'm telling you and his brother's us rap Leon Castro is the former\nMayor and it was at that than Antonio river walk that they switched him out I still since my favorite one of my favorite stories out of politics\nAnd walking like arguing or would that we look alike and people were going and they were screaming at what they thought was really on Castro but he had gone to a fundraiser he ducked out he hosted um what is it goes scene if you put your identical twin and your place maybe not and then he put why king there to wave at everybody and act like he was his twin brother\nAnd then he he was walking Castro said well they were yelling at me and I was going back no it's well keen\nFor that nobody really that [laughter]\n[noise] oh man who would've thought I was there as a foreign policy analysis oh my word but yeah that he is they are legit the they are the uh uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez equivalent\nOf who they are [noise] man\nSo that's the thing if you if you ask questions and apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign\nAnd then you have the story a you have what ... since he was spending a death and\nThere are some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about and I think it's worth asking why I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions\nSo power line had a great\n... a rite of of this and I think that\nAgain it's not a whisper campaign when you're trying to find out information\nFor instance there was a there's German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or or this operative\nAnd that he was a because of his association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was reporting via PJ Media that uh and he was in Islam is that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islam is totalitarian state\nAnd that he was bitterly opposed to their uh approach to the state of Israel\nAnd he backed out he backed Palestinian and transient intransigence which we know it back Palestinian cause he tweeted wants to your America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nSo we know that that's not even up for debate that came I actually have the tweet saved so he uh that was from his Twitter account so\nWider San Antonio Georgia

participating in a whisper campaign\nWith which has saved Trump and discredit this individual but there's more to it than just that I'm joining us right now Dr Judy Jasper who just as his wheelhouse of course\nUh who knows all about this just to give us some perspective on this end Dr ... the president of the American Islamic forum for democracy and he's also the author of a battle for the soul

on this because you know I I find it hard to believe that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nWould decide to because he had hurt feelings over something that a ... you wrote about in his columns that he would carry out an assassination in broad daylight ah where his people and his inner circle would be caught on closed circuit TV entering the consulate\nAnd uh just over over the column I mean there seems to be a lot more here I'm ... is that an accurate way to kind of view the situation\nAlthough certainly a lot more there and it is is just baffling to me to see the\nGyrations that the left media the legacy media is doing in this story which is all of a sudden they've taken a guy\nWho you know under any other planets or would be I'm surprised even had a resident visa ear and out of the Washington Post this line I think him and making them into a hero and they haven't really looked at is writing then we'll get to that in a second what are the Saudis are concerned they're charity their their Middle East dictatorship and\nAnd yet the President Trump was left with the\nObama disaster that had been so one sided to the Iranians that he's trying to resurrect sort of the twentieth century model of foreign policy which was a balance between Sunni and Shia so at the end of the day us are becoming unhinged about what happened to Mr ...\nIs going to end up benefiting the Iranians the Qataris and the Turks\nNow that doesn't mean that an ally has free will to assassinate the\nA columnist an activist but we should not be a glossy glassy eyed on exactly what this guy was all about and what was the about well I'll remind your three or four months ago the Saudis put into sort of an extension of the Ritz Carlton all of the the royal family that was involved with the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo they took basically a trillion dollars that had been used globally for the last fifty years were the Saudis had been funding Muslim Brotherhood operations around the planet the last six months they put a stop to that part of the lead of that will allow them will lead\nWho owns a center at Georgetown has owned the ... center at Harvard et cetera which has been radicalized Muslims in the west well one of the close friends that will lead is ...\n... came to America a year ago there's no doubt that the princes folks want it to bring to show the end for interrogation and another thing so odds are that went sour odds are like many other dictatorships on my only knows the Syrian one pretty well\nThey're pretty ruthless bugs and they may have just gone out with the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American\nVery anti Israel the Saudis shifted than the ... month decided to become more pro Israel isn't real reforms it's more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million we're starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably want it to contain him\nWell that and the and that would make sense for the New York times had a piece a just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post that it was\nConservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign because I looked at the New York times piece and they said you know show these friends were even saying that whenever they would talk with him he very much expressed out anti western sentiments and he\nWas a very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than some of what was being promoted and the charm offensive\nBy the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors Yasser you just touched on\nA one of the other point I was going to ask you is whether or not that charm offensive\nAnd and all of this reform that we hear being discussed with the Saudi royal family and with Saudi leadership and policy if it was real reform or if it was more just sort of um a way to to survive politically and you answered that for me\nYeah I mean NBS is no more real reform or the ... according to the Washington Post contrary to what the Washington Post said two months ago 'cause she'll get was writing about how the caliphate\nIs real the Muslim Brotherhood should be a given time the ball in the bottom line it's a majority of credit ... approach to the ... if you will and that's not liberal\nDemocracy and I have to tell you I did my cat's uh that'll air this weekend's on ... a reform but this is the name of it and I basically talk about how much this service and how much it breaks my heart\nThat they are lying I think a gentleman who yes we should speak out our allies should not be taking a abusing or or violating human rights of people that are American residence or alone and I said what the Saudis should do they really want the ... for what they did that this man\nReleased rape better we relieve release the ... the attorney that has been in jail for defending rape but do we have called for the release of tons of prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia or secularists\nWho are Christians who are other minorities that have been abused and nobody cared until somebody who was in the inner circles of the Islam This lobby in Washington\nAh got assassinated and now all of a sudden they care what the Yemeni too are being massacred whether Saudi now all of a sudden the elites in Washington care about the human rights abuses of the ... going for eight years we couldn't get Obama dimension once the name of a dissident in Saudi Arabia that we've been working to help\nSo this is just ... I mean the reality is is that\nUh we should change the way we're approaching hold them accountable we should not end arms deals but actually start to hold them accountable and the reason we shouldn't and the arms deal is that the balance against the Iranians there's nothing more\nBackslapping that's happening now than between the ministers of foreign affairs in Syria and Iran and turkey that are cheering on ah the the decrease in the ... ability between the American and Saudi relationship\nYes and and and that would explain why all of a sudden as you mentioned how that nobody really said anything about the president's silence the previous presidents silence and all of these dissidents and uh and individuals that you named who are wrongly imprisoned\nOr they haven't really said anything about them the or the the previous administrations silence on that\nBut this ... and ... those are all the same people that were attacked everyone else that wanted to end that safe to deal with Iran they seem to the apologist for Iran and I see them sneezing and exploiting the situation as a way to try to position I ran a little bit better do you see the same\nBrought here by Feeding

know why or and I\nShared with your story after story after story of this or where you have the presumption of guilt as opposed to innocence these are huge teams that are cornerstones of our republic it's due process and they're very serious issues and there\nA cultural war against that and so the ad bring that up\nAnd I I mean those are those are things that a lot of people have have discussed the problem comes in when it's well everybody's going to get lunch I'm just that completely undermined and just robbed all of the other point of any attention when that happened there just was not going to do\nI I mean I heard this the first time and I went oh my gosh what what I just and I don't and I know from what I understand because it's black Americans for the Trump agenda\nI don't know how that plays in the black community even if it's done by a a black organization\nI don't know how that I mean I just think regardless it robs the ... the more important points that were being made at the beginning\nThe fact that due process is under attack due process is being undermined our Fourth Amendment rights are being undermined and there is absolutely and I have talked about this I've mentioned it in my books a cultural war on boys\nAnd it just missed all of that because they went from talking about this to\nWhom genes I just it's it's\nA problem that the left has when they talk about skin color to like it's not\nWe all know that that's not it right the it's someone's character that makes them who they are has nothing to do with their skin color so I think you're right to

white girl calling rape or whatever\nIt loses it loses me you know what I mean it that message is lost on me completely and\nI always identifying with them or ... at first like oh these are boy moms and I'm listening to boy I'm like I Know and then when they went to the ... I'm like oh\nYou're they care about their husbands their sons their their grand pose the care about those ... yeah I get that but then when you went right into that left the tactic of saying it's um you know what I mean that's what it's all left the tactic that turns people off and we saw it in twenty six and\n... and people need to realize that didn't work for them just as you said it did it work for Democrats and twenty sixteen so why would we use it ... why would anybody on the right use it\nYou're like you said it takes the focus of what really is the solid messaging spot and just focus was on the frivolous empty left detector\nYeah that's a that was enforced because I think it was you know you have boy moms talking and it's a powerful testimony bug from boy moms I'm not saying anything of this girl minds but you know ... moms are boys you know you all know and to hear them discuss but then right and then they took it they use that identity politics that that\nAh ah\nThat identity politics that tactic that we have seen the left are you so often and that's when never ever adopt of an unsuccessful tactic from the left\nNever because it will if it's it's not that it never has gone to work it's not going to work if it doesn't work then it's not going to work with you and it just as even I just don't like any of that I hold on I long\nFor the road with them all the way through even the part where they were talking about you know hey the presumption of innocence until guilty is now becoming the presumption of guilt or innocence\nLike I'm I was all the way with them and the commercials up to them and they talk about white Dems lynching it's like come on yeah no Democrat and don't really like him yeah that's a little bit of do that\nYeah goodness anyway so that has a\nYup that was kind of problematic we have a Louie Gohmert congressman Louie Gohmert is going to join us at the bottom of the hour to discuss that migrant care of and that is winding its way I guess they think that they're gonna have a border standoff right before midterms that's just a gift for\nRepublican voter turnout honestly I don't know what I don't know we're going to talk more about it uh we have that and then we have today and stupidity and we're going to try to get some hate mail it to some hate mail as well in the meantime you know you can vote with your dollars by switching to patriot mobile it's more than a cell phone company they stand up against progressive is among the government's agenda every day\nBy donating to limited government conservative causes and patriot mobile provides nationwide reliable service with unlimited talking taxed for less money and no hidden fees and patriot mobile automatically donates a portion of your bill to the conservative causes for which you vote to protect\nKeep your number bring your own device elect a new one for a limited time get select Android an iPhone starting to just four dollars a month this has been my cellphone provider for over four years they made it easy to switch they'll do the same for you with their us base members services team they provide excellent customer service\nTo stop supporting big mobile and progressive as him and switch today visit patriot mobile dot com slash Dana or call one eight hundred a patriot as one eight hundred a patriot patriot mobile dot com slash Dana\nOutdoor limited as your one spot stop for all your ammunition needs outdoor limited dot com has one of the largest stocking inventory selections of the best run fire hand gun and rifle ammunition every item listed in stock on their website is on hand at their warehouse no third party drop shipping and no back orders\nFeaturing great brands from federal ammunition like federal premium\nFusion an American eagle outdoor limited as a family\nOwned business this husband and wife team started the company in their garage four years ago and they believe in selling good products at a fair price they carry not just ... but also key accessories such as magazines cleaning supplies and targets outdoor limited is my personal go to for all of my ammunition and shooting needs great prices fast\nShipping visit outdoor limited dot com right now receive five dollars off your first purchase of one hundred dollars or more with code Dana check out their great prices that outdoor limited dot com and used promoted Dana that's outdoor limited dot com\nBoom in the morning Michele my God I've been ... late for work misinformed and now we can see your ... well one one is headed up on a border wall and I want to put more deadly but to the good news is it's entirely\nTrue now did you drive here uh-huh perfect go I'm sitting in your car and listen to the TSA for the most dependable news trafficking weather in San Antonio void gravy or a toaster so stay connected with five fifty K.

president of Honduras that if that large caravan of people heading to the U.S is not stop and brought back to Honduras no more money or a will be given to Honduras effective immediately\nWell now we hear that Mexico is moving to stop the migrants caravan and the outgoing Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto\nUm they have any trade deal with the United states and so obviously I think he's looking to score some points and it looks like they're trying to do whatever they can to stop and joining us right now on this issue\nIs our good representative from the beautiful Republican Texas congressman Louie Gohmert who are of course obviously has been watching us as that are coming up to the widow of the southern Texas border congressmen good to have you as always\nAlways good to talk to your data you bet well it's been at this thing isn't it yeah yeah and thank God that Trump is the president literally thank you know I get tired of\nPeople calling us names haters and all these things because we want to do what will be best\nNot only for America even if you don't care about the Seventy thousand Americans that died from a drugs mostly from Mexico or if you cared about the Mexican people and the people in general America you would say yeah let's stop\nThe secure the border which don't encourage these kind of caravans there have been projections maybe one in four or more other girls that come up your right along the way\nThere are people that die every time that there is this big assault and I think our department of justice\nAnd are in jail or be looking at whether or not there were any Americans that were helping plunging helping with funding on this assault on our sovereignty but the best thing we can do from Mexico is secure the border build a wall where we need it and so it cuts\nSolved that eighty billion project you're gone from the U.S in the Mexico drug cartels for drugs they're projections that may be that much or more was made all human trafficking and sex trafficking by the drug cartels but you've got those tens of\nBillions or maybe hundreds of billions of dollars\nOff that go into drug cartels and the corruption slow store crawl and Mexico becomes one of the doubt and economies in the world and brings El Salvador\nGuatemala and Honduras along with it but a\nTrump is taking a strong stance and I'm so grateful years it despite what\nThe haters the ... the laughter mainstream whatever you want to call me do whatever they say it's still the most compassionate thing we can do is not continue to encourage what Obama did people get hurt doing that and killed\nYeah no that's that's for sure the uh one of the ... the guy I guess who is one of the other or one of the organizers of this had been detained by Guatemalan police officers they said he wouldn't comply with Guatemalan immigration role so\nThey arrested him and deported him back to Honduras are we seeing more cooperation as a result of Trump saying look will will will end a weren't will close the will close the border are are are they now it seems like they're they've been incentivized to to maybe perhaps cooperate a little bit more\nWell yeah you're exactly right says what's happening and they also know there's just not Obama this is a man that will do what he says\nAnd so ah they know we Syria's they noted serious when he says the workout ... tariffs on or where and when he says look we'll put the military on the border if necessary and and I talked with the\nThen candidate Donald Trump two years ago about this uh and and the fact that actually\nWoodrow Wilson one of my least favorite presidents he actually did one thing right after some punch over his day came across into the United states and killed a bunch of families are age that general pushing down or they get they put military\nIn this new thing go National Guard a and I asked the the\n... a political nonpartisan congressional Research Service\nFor report on that and they said we can't say for sure but in essence a probably Seventy five thousand ...\nUS military National Guard were put on our border I could have been as many as a hundred and fifty thousand and then pushing led some actually into Mexico chasing the bad guys\nBut you know what when he put the military on the border nobody nobody Jamie and we did not want to come in\nAnd uh you know they this president knows that and he's willing to do what's necessary to not only protect America but it protects others who might be tempted to\nTake a caravan and lose their lives are being raped or be subjected to sex trafficking human trafficking uh it's it's the best thing we can do for both sides of the border it really is and thank goodness Trump\nIs going to do that\nYeah I definitely and I mean I wouldn't I think they're going to have the same problem even if they may get than they do end up making it all the way to Mexico because from what I understand Mexico told them well if you're I mean you can't just enter legally you can apply for asylum well then they're going to have the same problem that we would have\nAnd I would think that they would want that word before these people got their border\nWell and and actually Mexico in the past uh with Obama a they would let people like that come through\nKnowing that when they ... they say you come through Mexico as long as you don't stop here so in other words they just wouldn't enforce Mexican law and okay you can pass through just you know make sure you go at it\nIn the United states but they knew the law that if they come into the United states from Central America come through Mexico and then get into the United states you don't they don't have and it's a legitimate asylum claim because your right hand and I\nCome to the states from Honduras or El Salvador Wildwood a wild ... and say\nI Need to claim asylum because our country was jak right out which of them it just I just object to the poverty because that's in every country [noise] but uh to say I was being\nTortured her purse Katie well if that's true and you needed asylum from your Central American country\nThen you should have claimed that women in the next\nCountry who came Thor so right he got to the United states you already gone through so you could attack claimed to style of bear so he legitimately cannot claim asylum in the United states 'cause you could have stayed in
