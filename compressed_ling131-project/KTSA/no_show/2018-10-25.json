videos they're a great website would be a part of the community at team run smart dot com by freight minor\n[noise] ah by the way this this uh just the keeps a growing overnight and then I'm Amazed that we have gotten an email sided may rise we addressed it to start the\nThe the the show a off with but a National Review and it's being picked up by you know a a social media uh uh some different a conservative Web sites have have picked it up and this is where National Review a wrote the article that said the pipe bomb\nOr and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out a at nine o nine PM from jak crow at National Review\nAnd the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right into a link to that right they link is to write so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our pre show meeting when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read in the second time I said well no it's not saying it\nBecause what it says is a law enforcement official such tests have determined that eight holder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nRoute out your harmless referring to the power that it that the indication as the it refers to the powder not the pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stated to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw act applied bombs that could have gone off ... we have seen what but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean\nWe have seen suspicious packages I'm looking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though actually\nGood calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linking to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not we don't know if the the uh the\nThe suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that right and that's\nWhat National Review has referenced front and their headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites are picking that up we don't know\nOutside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the said yeah that's that's the point is that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case\nAnd maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those ... from the a P right\nYou know so it it's just because\nThe problem is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction\nIf you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so you know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah there's ... where's that oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here just about and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the setting\nWas the Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with ... you know a along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it and that's what I told us an earth are saying the bomb was harmless but this was in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb not again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask\nAnd the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off a ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we uh when we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the facts they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the little\nBeing [noise]\n\n... radio he's aren't currently and I'm going back there are eight six six Ninety brought I let's go to Jim in Ontario, California assuming Ontario, Canada a gym welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show high\nAll right Kevin Windsor, Ontario\nScope of habits Kevin okay Hi Kevin welcome to the show high\nRight here in ... I I'm ... said told me if you think of them are all ... and you were talking about their double talking Democrats\nSaying not to do something than doing it immediately afterwards and I see so you think they know what they're doing you didn't say they were aware that they were doing that and I disagree I think they know what they're doing always and they just know that people listen to whatever the last Sunday\nNo but no I I honestly don't think at times and I get this by the way from not my opinion it actually it was\nBut Bernard Goldberg book by us\nAnd he said they were in the media they really don't know they really don't think that they're biased they really don't and and he was in the end he wouldn't go right he'd worked for Denver he just thinks that they're right on everything but they never even missed the obvious things\nLike the obvious irony that as they are calling for the end the divisiveness they are putting out the most divisive statement that they themselves are not conscious that they're doing it that they don't even believe that they just think they're they are so\nJust driven by tunnel vision that they don't even know that they're doing it and I so that really that that really didn't tell me that came from Bernard Goldberg who worked for Dan Rather and wrote the book biased and talked about the media at large and the mindset that they actually have they don't walk around thinking\nThat were Democrats and Republicans are thinking there's Democrats or Republicans on his way that we think and we're always right and they never questioned the way that they think they actually don't analyze what they're saying that the time that they're doing it\nAnd I just believe and again we don't know because you know ... whether it's soccer or whatever I Can't read his mind ... but it's such an obvious it's such an obvious divisive statement that once you explain that people go oh yeah they claim they're against divisiveness but they're actually\nObviously for divisiveness well especially if\nYou're in a news organization where's the fear of being wrong\nWhere is that it's not there anymore\nNo you saw the New York times when the New York times to the editor of the editorial staff on the you know they you know the the the butcher job on Sarah Palin right\nWhere's the fear of being wrong there isn't one because they believe they're right right\nThere's no fear of being wrong I Can't be wrong I write yeah you're you're you're making the point there that they were analyzing that statement and knew the hypocrisy was there and but nobody will notice it no I don't think they knew the hypocrisy was there they just they are so tunnel vision this is our statement we're right right [noise]\nI mean why don't we know who the targets were of these devices that were sent what if they learn from our or in the next few days that it was a person trying to make the Republicans look bad and it was someone on the left [noise]\nNot the right [noise] well in that case they wouldn't be wrong while this is the risk you take when you make statements face on not half happening all the information\nIs Cesar ... radio on Westwood One\nRight now at the ... and Petro stuffing centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill triple extreme sea fishing is on sale burly sixty four Ninety seven\nTo keep you trucking cc are tires to serve\nDedicated providing high speed tires cutting edge to\nThousands of devoted to service\nHundred service trial five minute alignment you\nSo let's just say we're upset at all or sixty\nFor eighty years Detroit Diesel has been the legendary driving forces side many of the best known sunny summer of our latest destroy technology Tony ... says he earned a reputation of\nBeing a business solution dedicated enough time and also the bottom line and we're committed to continuing on legacy for another eight years and beyond what he demanded off the mandatory\nYears of innovation dedication and recognition [noise]\nAttention owner operators how you tired of chasing empty promises are I think he is looking for you to join the routine offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for ... drivers or two dollars per mile for teams are asked me Pete based on miles that hadn't back\nHome or not in their vocabulary they're no training rentals meaning no hidden secrets how our I think he today an eight eight eight RSVP three six five that's a A R S P three six five or play on line ...

link yet if sources are telling these news organizations different things the powder isn't there why isn't anybody asking the question\nWhere the bombs live where they have gone off with a on a timer is there an investigative reason why they would not do that but they would be leaking out other information yeah right I don't know the answer and I I I\nThere's no sense of ... a suspicion there is no conspiracy theory here these are just questions that I hadn't because it ... it gets to the heart of wanting to you of of I think everybody wanting to know what the motivation of the person\nOr persons who did this what the motivation is and you don't know until you know you you can't even start to to come to a a a path of possibly a path to go down to figure out why this happened unless you know whether the bombs were actually bombs or they were fake bombs mhm\n\nBecause the motivation then can be completely different right\nWhile you're looking to send a message to the people uh the the the would be recipients you're also looking to send a message to the country and the world knowing full well that this would make the news\nOr the interesting thing is when you actually go through it and you look we were when you look at Fox News and others are and I did mention at the wall Street Journal said called them pipe bombs and I said but nowhere in their did I see a quote in the wall Street Journal\nThat said pipe bombs that referred to the FBI or investigators talking about it and so I've seen that in many different articles and human I've gone through a ton of different uh uh uh you know news reports overnight to try to find out\nYou know of anybody of it you know throughout the night if anybody is leaking whether these were actually working live bombs that had explosive material and the detonator and a timer or whatever you would use\nIn what they claim or crude devices right 'cause we were been told they were you know pipe pipe like bombs crude devices potentially explosive devices I don't know what potentially means\n[noise] well that's the question of you use the word potentially does that mean it wasn't armed wasn't triggered wasn't ready to be triggered\n\nThat potentially had it been armed it would have been explosive\nI don't know\nBut the phrasing the phrasing is is is a is key by the media because we don't we haven't heard and this is why we're looking for quotes from people actually doing the investigation well within fighting the FBI\nI I I'm I may be taking the liberty here but within\nThirty seconds mhm of looking at those bombs mhm an FBI bomb expert would be able to tell you whether it was legitimately a bomb or not mhm\n\nAnd whether it was a working or lied bar so if it's three days old why don't we know\nRight\nAnd I'm asking from an investigative point of view is there a reason that they wouldn't tell you because it would tip off something to the possible suspects I don't know I I but it's very strange for three days have gone by and other things to Blake\nLike the the image of the the parity image of the ISIS flag the other picture to get her done that stuff's leaking we still don't know whether it was a lie bummer lied bomb or not or lied moms live bomb in that case for CNN or whatever we don't know why don't we know\n\nSo because they know mhm you know the FBI knows right yes and certainly the person responsible knows now that the FBI knows right\nIf you want to get and we do have a line open eight six six Ninety red eye the following disclaimer about that week is provided by kit winter of

middle of the show I looked at you and I said\nWow\nBoston supper the Dodgers to nothing oh yeah I didn't really old ladies do like the world go based here like yeah I thought I saw that somewhere the other day like already already to the world series someone tweeted something the other day and I'm ... ... oh baseball's [laughter]\nOh have ya okay All right well [laughter]\nI should've known as a after I did my early voting yesterday when I did some shopping like two guys come walking out of the store and I wasn't sure what it was where I was for a moment ... number one it's raining and it's cool and then I look in these two guys can watch it on store both for the red Sox jerseys item like\nWhat does that for a second I went\nWhere am I Am I in the northeast to summer ... and I've since I've lived so many different places in the country that that's happened to be more than watch I'll be driving down a road\nOr am I my New York where am I right now right oh\nThat's all right I'm Still in Texas [laughter] but for a moment in your are you ready for audio part of the day\nThis is a good one All right this is one of US Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri Democrat incumbent one of her final ads but the twenty Eighteen campaign and what it is meant to do is just set the well known Democrat apart from\nThose crazy Democrats in her party quote crazy Democrats in her party or you should know that this is her ad yeah this is the ad of her campaign uh-huh approved by her so even though it is to men\nTalking about Claire McCaskill is her message\nTo the people of Missouri that she is not one of those crazy Democrats I'm going to play the ads are from the the beginning because I Want you to hear that you know she says she approves of this ... so you know it's a campaign ad in and not of a pack had\nA you know or just to a general ed from an outside group in Rio\nAnd then I'm capital ... left and I approved this message what do you know about this job highly guy well no holiday year lawyer who worked in any support those what does he do now\nWell I think we just elected him to attorney general he's a man and are rescue them fewer criminals\nAnd it never even tried to ... having hall even caught hanging at the gym and now buying and wind during work our [laughter]\nDo that is the one thing how he did do is use our tax dollars are filed a lawsuit and protections for preexisting medical conditions totally health insurance company and not I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill buttons work hard\nFighting against those terrorists doing all those town halls record of how to read to stand up against her own party and Claire not one of those crazy Democrat and she works right in the middle [noise]\n... yeah all\nWorks right in the middle and finds compromise did she do that on Kevin\n... now what what ... what's interesting is is the ... the fact that it gives if I'm a political consultant I'm looking at this and again I I could not if I'm a political consultant I might be able to tell you a nationally what to do I would still have problems\nFiguring out Missouri 'cause I don't know what Missouri's problems are when you're inside Missouri when you're inside of a time limit of town you know more of what their their or state you know more what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time\nBut it was interesting too so I understand uh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we got to hit that she knew that was going to be the messaging\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the tariffs\nNow I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat that the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you've you've you've mentioned it\nYou know twice okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe us we had we inside this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd said this when when the uh way before that we said this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been\nSo you've got that and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it twice in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terrorist message\nThat Trump has been so loud on mhm why are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time commercial\nAbout when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly\nYou know you're you're you're you're really you're on your ever on the work you're never All right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong or the stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of\nThe during the day when best time to go or you know but but that's it they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have mentioned the crazy Democrat twice\nAnd by the way I was just thinking the law and order ... uh uh you know didn't didn't ah I Can't think of his name uh didn't he ended up running for da\nJack yeah jak ran for Diego he was he became ... now that the opposition ever used the fact that they they ring ring or are in their office the whole time that we've always talked a lot of them on TV [laughter] they drink all died after every case win or lose try to run their drinking at the end of the day and they're often\nNot wine like I ... it was hard liquor they're always drinking [laughter] we thought and so when I heard that I went come on a hey come on they're\n[laughter] they're prosecutors they all drank a [laughter] but but yet\nWhen we get getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term extremist Democrat yes or the leadership of the Democrat rush\nRight there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola the in their internal were showing that this was the day you know this was a way a hot button\nThat they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "25"}
