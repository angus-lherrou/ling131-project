{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "What's going on I I Love\n\nKnow I see stories everyone always act like they don't exist but they do and\nWhenever you know we we have discussions about um toxic masculinity or something to that effect there's always these ... there's a ton of these stories friend let me just share this with you this was just last week says in October fifth\nHighschool click a five mean girls are sued for targeting a boy with false sexual assault allegations because they just don't like him\nHis parents are now suing the girls and ... valley for damages the unnamed boy was fired from his job and forced to serve time in juvenile detention the girls later admitted to make you know the allegations just because they quote don't like him\nNow twenty six page federal students been filed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the eve of October third the boy's parents said the girls are ... a click of mean girls who conspired in person and be electronic communications devices to falsely accused the boy of sexual assault on two occasions\nHe is now home schooled and has psychological trauma because the girls bullied him and then later admitted to line about their claims\nAnd then they said that the sun experience or gender bias by school officials who did not take any action at all against the females involved\nNone none he\nUh after the girls falsely accused him he accused and he was charged in juvenile court with indecent assault two kinds of harassment he pled not guilty but they put them on probation um and it ruined his life they took him out of high school and he was put in lake and ...\nAnd he uh was a identified as a threat to the community he spent nine days in a detention center he was sent home on house arrest\nBut finally the girls admitted that they had lied about him\nThey said they had lied now he's got to deal with us now he's going to go to visit a psychologist because they ruined his life absolutely ruined his life and they weren't punished at all\nNone\nThere was they were not punished by the school they were not charged with false reporting\nNothing\nAnd the lawsuit and apparently there was evidence where one of the girls told classmate in October of last year that quote she would do anything to get him expelled so she made up a story about him assaulting her at the pool\n[noise] wow I feel so bad for this kid he um right I mean he was oh my gosh just ruined his life\nAnd the school district the school district oh my gosh schools definitely do participate in gender bias they absolutely do they do against boys\nAnd the district\nYou know it it's it's they said that the lawsuit has been filed without merit because they're named now and parents are seeking damages because they've helped ruin this kid's life so of course now the school's going to defend itself because they're\nMore ons unreal and by the way\nThese girls had been reported apparently previously for bowling bully and the school turned a blind eye\nBefore they even made these claims no punishment to these girls Adel whatsoever and this is the problem\nAnd there are so many I there are a lot of stories like this um I it just infuriates me no punishment for these girls there is no deterrent I think that they should have the book thrown at him and I think that they should have I think that they should uh be expelled from school I think they should be sent to ...\nAnd I think that they should be considered dangerous to their communities where there are legal measurable damages here I Hope these parents get them for everything they got views are absolute measurable damages to this kid's life ruined his life\nIt ruined his life because of false accusations\nIt's infuriating to me this is why honestly I eat I don't think teenage boys I think it's too dangerous because they can be falsely accused and social justice warriors they clearly hate boys\nAnd they're going to take out all of their grievances on men against boys I don't think it's safe for them to I mean goodness we make rings chaperones back\n'cause you know who nevertheless we're such Puritans and horrible uh

I I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to be a little bit of rain and it just poured here so yeah we had in fact we had to some some flooding just based on on rain right I'm In our area so you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then turn that\nThen you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows in what areas how much rain\nOr you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the updates are here at uh one am central uh two am eastern time a hurricane Michael now a category for yeah strangely dangerous\nA hurricane now headed are really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to me the meteorologist John trout but right you know heading towards Panama City\nYeah when you when you when you look back on the I guess the history of\nThe major hurricanes\nOr there will be names that that that the rise to the top there is no doubt based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael as one of those again historic storms\nAre based on the size of it and and the amount of damage it caused a so we'll be following this and we'll talk to meteorologist John trout are later this hour\nA day and get his take on this and and the latest information that he has\nAnd of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis in and one of the things now just a\nLittle less than four weeks before election day is after the Kavanaugh hearings you know one of the poll doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing polls from the actual\nConfirmation a vote and Collins speech and and how does that affect certain races out there uh we do have a a a few new polls out there are ... and again it just\nIt we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling but it does can give you an idea or at least a snapshot as to what's going on up looking at the Nevada Senate race\nA Jacky Rosen the Democrat against a Dean Heller of the ... Republican\nWhere a in of all the previous polls that were done in September\nA Rosen was up ah early ah one poll done in in the early September a she was up by one that grabs poll a mid September she was up by two or by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls\nAre from nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ... well the latest NBC News ... poll done nine thirty ten three\nSo you're really through all the hearings at that point\nA again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters\nA Heller is no up by two now all of these really are in the margin of error even when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling\nCan be different but you ... what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error\nBut still we ... what we're looking for is any type of momentum or any type of uh I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote right we're likely voter\nIn these polls would say you know a likely voter who said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time where it's I'm going out and I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls are moving at\nA in another uh a direction so ah that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of uh other polls\nAre out there um\nWhat what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott and if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls at the ... the average showing a Nelson up\nAh a to point for\nBut it really has been a if you look at it or just say a really a tie because it's well within the margin of error\nA on a number of polls with the exception of one of the Quinnipiac poll that had Nelson a plus seven but you look at ah other polls here a Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven\nAnd Nelson up by one a W C. T. V. poll that was\nTaken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing\nUm they would that has Nelson up by one\nAll within the margin of boom way and the margin of error because I'm an air bubbles poses is three and a half\nAway and so it it really is\nA it really is a dead heat there in Florida and I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch uh where where the where that goes um I I just think that the\nThe polls between over the next few weeks everything from Kavanaugh the Capitol hearing\nA and the vote this is going to settle in\nAnd we don't know which side it motivates more doesn't motivate the Democrats to get out more to to try and hold the line on the on the Senate race and and ah in in in order to make an attempt to block Trump or down the road for a possible third\nA nominee for ...\nAnd so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point five percent or and now they have there are three of a different candidates\nAre in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a you know Donald with the lead but uh again ... ... with the the lead the Democrats\nIn there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri and uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied now that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before calling speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for\nThe polls coming out of it may be here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer\nTo see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are a statistical tie with even in the statistical tie\nDemocrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched and again when you go into and we're not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances in it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in\nA you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans right and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races\nThat are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the cabin on hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's a rare right now looking at some of the the the Senate races on a you\nYou look into the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane Michael a and how it's handled will be part of that discussion in campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily\nUm ... like a governor ... during an emergency situation\nHow he handles it will be closely watched over the next few days because\nIt's going to be it's going to be a very politically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his capital tell you well we're not focused on that right now nor should they be but people outside that a camp heart focused on that and will\nBe on alert the reality is that if Florence wasn't handled properly by the Trump Administration Democrats would be using ... yes and and you end up being that is used in political races yes and and as you and I talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more\nOf the of of Florence are coming in than I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch on the weather channel you came across with the great opinion of the federal government and how they were how they were handling the s it'll be interesting to see at the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no doubt eight six six Ninety red eye\nOne million

we talked about on CNN yesterday and it was it was just a useless conversation about defining the word Martin and and all that but but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being civil you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker\nMachine get up in the face of congresspeople and Rand Paul and his wife remember last week\nOr a running a letter and and and state or an op ed piece in stating you know she sleeps with a gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked yup I'm actually in his in his yard by by a neighbor and what they're saying what you know and it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now of of complete and total instability in the end the beautiful part is ... you know just ... are we a month past\nThe the uh uh a funeral John McCain right when they were talking about stability in you and I got this isn't gonna last Hillary decided to get involved in it you're ready for this very elegant Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary\nIs back not liberal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's been civility can start again\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right now we we [laughter] we know that ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant or whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate\nPeople mhm do they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be my point to ... to begin with\nThat they believe now Hillary of course when it's well established that the instability in mob mentality now exists then she jumps on board oh yeah I'm going to drink I don't really know how many months later right yeah uh and\nShe's going back to the modern but I like [laughter] so ... this this again is what we we talk about that they believe that that they believe it's going to be affected either they believe there's one or two things either they believe it's going to be effective\nOr they're just so so enraged they have nothing less nothing left of substance to offer the people so they just that's the natural I guess outlet is range and get in people's face wherever\nThey are in their own private time whatever ... and what they believe that's going to win timid eight Republicans or conservatives really believe that you really believe if you're on the left you honestly believe oh if we do this then there'll be scared of no back\nWhere do you do do they believe that it's going to change the supporters of Ted Cruz\nNo oh wait wait wait wait it is it's going to further motivate them it's going to take people who might have decided or maybe just to have been sitting on the fence maybe haven't been enthusiastic about getting out and voting\nI mean conservatives or Republicans it is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually a online and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about early voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which site is motivated more and historically where is that greater turnout did did you see the NBC\nReporter who went to the college in California ... and there was like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people ... and all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting there and then my term not one person raised their hand price finally they found eventually they found one person ... are they found to people that should be our going to vote but what's your concern\nWell you know college and costs to college\nOr what about the rational things and the Russian busted ah we don't even know what's going on we don't know tension of that stuff it out I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but\nI I guess the point think about this now because Hillary now coming to board\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democratic party\nThinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump aboard and say a civility now it's gone till we take over ... not to be civil vogue and civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to be civil and and think about what it's about now you're not civil because you believe in what\nDue process and a presumption of innocence mhm that you look at any case a political case a civil case or a criminal case and you judge it by what the evidence that exist\nBecause you believe that and that's where it's all coalescing now it's ... it's it's getting right to that point now that you believe that you may never be treated civil again\nWe will find you wherever you are you've heard that caller ready wind or wherever you are will stock you wherever you are at your restaurant at your home nothing is off limits why\nBecause you believe in due process and you believe that's going to change people that believe and due process under the law that people that believe in the constitution of people that believe in fairness are going to be intimidated because you attempt to get in their face\nYou actually believe that you're a bunch of idiots in you believe that's going to change the opposition best it's going to do the exact opposite your stupid people for thinking that yes you\nAre and by the way please keep it up and thank you Hillary who by the way her version of due process is to\nGive money to hire lawyers Perkins ... so they can hire fusion GPS so they can hire Christopher Steele should go get salacious and unverified information on her opposition her opponents in twenty sixteen and then have her friends and the Justice Department use it\nTo get a warrant on somebody in her opponent's campaign that's due process for Hillary Clinton by the way how did that work out for her\nIt did there was always a twenty percent chance she was going to die but I mean that's that's a really has come\nOut out of all ... ... is the defense now I've been civility for those two to attack and go after those people or whatever where they are in their personal lives because they believe in due process under the law and that thoughts but in my head since last week thinking\nWater soften or simply the best and that's saying something 'cause there's some really good water soften it was on the market today but ... is the best it's hassle free and like I said made

president coming out really uh yesterday in ... and Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay mhm uh you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then the story comes out the two senior FBI official told\nThe bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious\nWhen he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation\nAnd an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others that the comments were either inaccurate reported or made in jest\nOr this is again former FBI general counsel a James Baker more information coming out about his testimony are told congressional investigators behind a closed door deposition last\nWeek that then FBI acting director Andrew McCabe an FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to Baker after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and may have twenty Seventeen Baker said page and McCabe relate details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments\nThough he wasn't personally in that meeting Baker told congressional investigators he took ... pages word\nA seriously the sources said further Baker troll congressional investigators\nHe suspected that Rosenstein was cooperating with two people in the administration to evoke the twenty Fifth Amendment a source said wow the testimony would appear at odds with other accounts of those discussions Baker who's testimony was described\nAs deliberate and sober added he had not done a legal analysis and was not on sure whether it was unethical or illegal the source at it\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm really this is the story that we've talked about the one that is\nHas been completely

just got easier [noise]\nMost shows [noise] and\nI'm hearing McNamara long with Aaron hardly a thick thick Ninety run I let's get caught up\nOn the latest on hurricane Michael as we go to a meteorologist Tom hale good morning Tom good morning alright what ... what do we know about a hurricane Michael at this point and when we expect another uptick\nOkay we should expect an update in one hour from now I actually we should expect an update and a half an hour after hour yeah mhm yeah and uh and then the second question\nAnd so what is I I guess like give us the latest on that uh what do we know about what's the status of Michael right now and when do we expect Michael to hit the shore in the panhandle of Florida\nOkay well the first thing is you know normally the national weather service can be kind of conservative in regards to its own language but the national weather service or the national Hurricane Center in this case describes Michael as an extremely dangerous category for hurricane life threatening storm surge\nHurricane force winds heavy rain expected along\nThe northeastern Gulf Coast and it's located a hundred and eighty miles to the southwest of Panama City\nAnd it is one it is a one hundred and Seventy miles to the southwest of Appalachia cola then of course when Spain's or a hundred and thirty miles an hour and it's moving to the north\nHad twelve miles an hour now taking a look at that some of the radar I'm a indications it's a if you've been watching any of the TV stations with their radar indications that shows a little bit of ... to it\nUm and it actually looks like it may be starting to make a little bit of a turn maybe one or two degrees\nAh in the direction of Panama City um and and so it's most likely going to come ashore right in between Panama City beach and down to Appalachia cola\nCallaway is a town along their port saint Joe is also along that same areas a category for and this is the official definition of a category for\nA category for hurricanes have sustained winds of a hundred and thirty up to a hundred and fifty six miles an hour obviously Puerto Rico so the higher end of that scale\nBut well built framed homes can will uh sustain severe damage and loss of most of their roof and and possibly some exterior walls while trees will be snapped or uprooted and power lines down\nFalling trees and power lines will isolate residents\nAnd power outages will last for potentially a several weeks a and they haven't here or possibly months now they're writing it for the worst case scenario here but ah several months was Puerto Rico's case\nUm and most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months while now that's the definition of a category four\nYeah that's a while um and so you know what can I tell you I'm ... I worked for a company that has a group of television stations all around the country a fairly large company called grey TV and the company I work for has a TV station\nAnd that's in Panama City\nAnd I'm In a in a short time from now\nA a W. J. H. G. channel seven down there is going to be on Wall to wall coverage [noise]\nUh and uh and they are twenty feet I called and talk to him just a minute ago uh therefore their team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage\nAnd they are twenty feet above sea level now they're optimistic that they won't see a storm surge\nUm that will get up to the station right and they're also optimistic that the generators or continue the pound power generator or work in the station as fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until\nA later this afternoon right um but obviously I tomorrow if we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them hands on us after it is passed by right um but I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are up and down that coastline\nThat are there because they realize that even though the majority of people have a vacuum wait it out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds get up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins\nUm but that being said\nEven though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's over with they're going to be in there and force I Know are surrounding a Panama City they've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards are guardsmen or guards\nA [laughter] and uh the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask this because you did or you had predicted\nA before the last ah advisory that showed it went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of ... of a of of more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right you expected to get any stronger or do you see it weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening as gets closer to shore in this particular case um the uh the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature\nUm the other thing that's going on is that unlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air\nThere is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near this and so [noise]\nUh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the Midwest and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area head of the cold front\nMhm that warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture\nAnd and the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down or whatever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to\nDegenerate a little bit\nSo Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm eighty two maybe a little more than that mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachian coal a and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds\nBrain power if you will say Oh Mary is the season for severe weather early always afraid that it's not going to\nAgain and now here we are strong\nForecasters are saying this hurricane season could be one of the worst of everything\nThat we rarely sinus areas they connected I share some and handle already have enough on San Antonio's\nSevere weather station any any real resources are people live fifty gay G s

fully prepared we've been through these things before\nBut uh you know we really don't know what's gonna happen until it happens and hopefully a will not be as bad as we think it's got to be but I'm afraid it may be\nA that's a Great Britain Nicky who is the ... a mayor of Panama City Florida on a hurricane Michael that has been upgraded in the last uh last advisory to a category for a hurricane extremely dangerous we'll get to that a ... a more that coming up on top of\nThe hour and a Nikki Haley resigning a biggest mystery right now\nAh everybody's thinking nothing links on this\nIn twenty four hours not being linked while maybe she just was only going to serve two years well she's not leaving immediately not till the end of the year well that would be a full two years well okay uh\nAnd now everybody's wondering okay what's the conspiracy theory behind that issue running for president that she comes out soon as I hear that conspiracy theory she comes out I'm not running for president [laughter] well wait a minute she said she's not running and twenty twenty\nOh yes yes twenty mhm mhm mhm which would you know that's which of course was the joke because of course you would not

and as it at it comes to shore ah and on a bigger scale that means that those damaging wins while they may diminish are still going to be damaging the even inland uh and and that's the point\nUh we're still talking about hurricane force winds well inland after Michael comes ashore so you you look at the also the\nPotential of and and I think this kind of spells it out if you need a visual in your in your in your mind or you picture a well built home well built structure\nAnd you can expect in it in a hundred and forty\nMile an hour wind the roof coming right off of that structure and it may be again one that's built up to code or even greater or that may lose that that roof in a second and again it becomes dangerous\nNot only are the flooding that we've talked about the ... which would be the rainfall and the storm surge but the debris\nFlying debris in a storm like this\nOr is extremely dangerous anybody with family or friends that may be in the path of hurricane Michael ah reach out to them or make sure that they are doing everything possible\nTo get out of the way of the storm and again we'll talk with Tom hill coming up after the bottom of the hour get caught up on this as he issues his last report for us this morning before\nAh Michael is expected to uh come inland are there in the panhandle and and Big Bend area therefore to near Panama City\nSometime this afternoon between three and six they will narrow that down the closer we get\nBut it is still in that timeframe and as Tom pointed out those dangerous uh wins and and conditions with rain and and storm surge will start to begin the situation will start to deteriorate rapidly sometime around noon today in that area some of those stories\nWant to make sure that we are getting because we do a lot of hurricane coverage of this hour uh Nikki Haley resigning a as a un UN ambassador I guess caught a lot of people off guard you and I talked about how the I I woke up to it as soon as I woke up to it\nAnd then everybody speculating what it might be and everything to the point of on social media she's resigning because she had enough of this administration with Kavanaugh where I was like no I\n[laughter] I don't think there was any indication that that was a the the case and ah you know they uh they they spoke together she was a highly complementary you know you and I have talked about this that you know about Nikki Haley in and others in the administration\nWhen the media comes up to them and says well how was that you must disagree with this president at times and she said she will of course I Do but I'm the UN ambassador I I'm I'm not president I don't I don't projected inside out and create ... it's like when John when John Bolton was asked to national security advisor\nWealth or does he does he always do what you say well no because we have different opinions on things and I'm an advisor I grabbed him his vice right I tell them that that's my role I give them advice doesn't mean he always follows my advice I don't expect him to ... he wants me to analyze the situation and then I give him\nA the advice and once he decides to do something uh I you know I Will support what the administration wants to do it because he's the president she had to do the same thing it's almost as if they're trying to find dissension anywhere well oh you're just a great but there isn't any one in that's ever served any president Democrat or Republican\nThat doesn't agree that that doesn't disagree with something that the president is doing right happens all the time it seems so the only that they make it a huge case or a big case when it's a Republican and especially when it's when it's Trump but\nUh we'll see uh what her you know future plans are ah she said she has no plans to run for the presidency and twenty twenty will see\nOr whether she doesn't twenty twenty four and then she could have the motto\nMaking America great again again\nYes she could uh seriously if you if the president's served two terms [laughter] what is your slogan if you're a Republican after that I'm ... it's my turn now [laughter]\nI don't know it I don't know I'm Sorry it's my turn has already been you all that's right right it was on speaking\nAbout her term in in other news and got to go to the news quickly just didn't get back to the hurricane coverage but a Tom Cotton remembers that urge to me that Senator Tom cotton believes that it was Chuck Schumer behind Ford's\nLeaked letter Dr forge leak the letter he says I Believe Schumer's political operation was behind this from the very beginning\nA when he was on a huge deal with show ... credit few for um uh that uh the other thing is Rand Paul Kelly not Cory bookers\nRhetoric insane this rhetoric has got to stop it's coming from the Democrats and coming from mainstream Democrats\nIt's got to stop somebody is going to get killed yeah that that this this tone of of incivility is unacceptable and he brought out the fact that he was attacked and brought out the whole you know skull east\nBut as a nation attempt and as you brought up earlier this was an attempt to assassinate just one person no it was an attempt to assassinate\nMembers of Congress yes it was a multiple uh assassination attempt and that's where again I I Know a lot of people will try and and uh uh say that the Rand Paul is just this is hyperbole and\nFear mongering it's very real on that day the shooter was out to kill multiple members of Congress there is no doubt there is no debating that\nSo if you look at what has happened since then now where we have mainstream the radical behavior the instability in fact the calls\nFor civility coming from Hillary Clinton Cory Booker Maxine Waters and I don't know anyone on the left who's saying we cannot call from the for this and that we must stop this in fact and that would\nBe I I don't care who who it is a Chuck Schumer or anyone else they're not stepping up and saying\nNeed to and there's another says enough is enough is enough and melt that and that that's why I wanted to bring it up here because as you mentioned Hillary Clinton she piled on again yesterday in a CNN interview ears\nPart of that you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the format that twin civility can start again [noise]\nSo we're not going to be several until we get our way\nAnd that the instability right now if you look at the uh the level of it it is about them not getting their way they're not winning ... and we said this I don't know there was a couple of months ago and we've said All right imagine that that there's not a blue wave imagined that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate\nNow the polls are you know all over the place and we're not making productions were just saying for the sake of the conversation imagined that happens you know how insane it's going to be imagined that Trump wins again in twenty twenty\nThere there's no sign of letting up in fact what you just heard by their former candidate for president of the United states is we will not be civil\nOr and look you I I I a\nCompliment her for being honest [laughter] well well look I can I read it disagree arrowhead around enough the [laughter]\n\nEven on that why you got me on that you know I I\nI guess my point is they really think this is going to work and they really believe they're ... they if you're a Democrat you really believe\nThat by intimidating and in in a a mob rule because you won't do it individually well I don't do that you won't you won't do it individually in a place where there aren't TV cameras right you're not going to confront anybody you only do it when you've got a group of people behind you and you find a singular source there when you get when you have\nWhen you've got the crowd power over someone\nWhich again is cowardice in in in in my book\nAnd when we saw you know the whole Ted Cruz thing and CNN was talking about the whole ... well it's not my ... it's not as if they were discussing what what the definition of mob is and but the fact is we know what we know what they're trying to do when they're being much more clear about what they're trying to do\nMy point is they think they're gonna win over the American people are that they think they're going to intimidate conservatives or Republicans on this I'm Sorry\nI got a failed policy that is just not going to work it's a wrong policy but the factors are doing this why because they can't win the debate right six six Ninety right I\n... my clothes forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida

currently eight six six Ninety red eye\nHurricane Michael now a category for a hundred and forty mile an hour\nSustained wins off the coast of Florida and heading for the panhandle and Big Bend area of Florida and let's get back with no meteorologist Tom hale who joins us once again\nA Tom a again a reminder of the timeline here when the strong wins a ... and overall I guess the conditions there\nAre in the path of Michael will start to deteriorate\nWell the fastest deterioration will be at a point that you won't have time to evacuate and that's going to be anytime from ten o'clock to noon and on as we get into the last four hours of it approaching\nAt that point it's going to probably be fifty miles offshore maybe a little bit further up maybe Seventy five miles offshore assuming it picks up in speed from the Thirteen miles an hour it's traveling right now\n[noise] so what are we going to expect as that I come to the shore what kind of conditions are we looking at\n[noise] um well we're looking at water rising like you're filling a bath tub and except instead of inches it's going to be rising and feet nine to Thirteen feet\nWeather services estimate is that we'll be looking at nine to Thirteen feet from Kendall Airforce base base to keep the beach\nUm and that pretty much takes you to to the almost uh almost over toward a Fort Walton from Keith in it goes over to Fort Walton that's going to be six to nine feet and the same thing from a\nFrom Keith in beach the other way to to cedar key uh will be six to nine feet so if you started cedar key and you had on all the way over to as far as Fort Walton Beach\nYou're going to be looking at a minimum of six to nine foot rise and in the heart of this action Pensacola or a Panama City beach\nAnd now the Appalachian cola\nAnd south of Tallahassee you're looking at possibly nine to Thirteen feet now remember ... wind driven waves on top of that could be additional four five six whatever feed\n'em which will drive it and basically be a battering ram on top of this elevated sea surface as it comes rolling on it that's actually going to happen in the last the rise will take place in the last three hours\nBut the Windsor already got to be increasing and let me give me an idea tropical storm winds now extend out a hundred and eighty five miles out from the storm that's forty mile an hour winds now if you've ever tried to stand in a forty mile an hour wind you notice it's it's a little bit difficult you know\nUh and so that extends out a hundred and eighty five miles and Michael is a hundred and forty miles away from Panama City and a hundred and thirty miles away from a Appalachian coal ... so they're already starting to feel these wins from by the time we get to shut up\nWe're going to probably start seeing reports of\nThese wins increasing now initially they'll start is Gus then they will become steady\nAnd then from there they'll start rising the water so the first two or three feet of water rice um it is going to start inundating any of the roads that you would have otherwise driven to get out of here right so\nYeah the time is of the time is is of the essence and uh I share this at the top of the hour\nAnd I I Can't resist sharing at again [noise] um the national weather service uh Tallahassee now mind you these are the professionals who are sitting here\nKing in all the data yeah and they are responsible for the safety of the people who are with in their coverage area in Tallahassee\nAnd and that covers the panhandle and the big band and so they put this little thing together and if you want to see it you can just Google Tom hale news twelve just Tom male news to Google that I posted it on my Facebook page\nAnd I invite you to share it you can share it with any of your friends in Florida you can share with anyone you know somebody who might be in Florida because they need to hear this message the ban are heading says unprecedented event unfolding\nAnd then it
