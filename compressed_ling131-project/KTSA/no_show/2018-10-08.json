Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats there or was in a conversation with them over the weekend\nAnd I explained I said well\nKnow what the Democrats did here as soon as I said that they just started going off and just said I Can't believe that I Can't believe they've gone to this to this point and it's the mainstream of the Democrats it's not some right wing and and he told me he said you know I always I always like it that you know I agree mostly what the Republicans but it's always good to have an opposition party\nBut he said what good is that opposition party 'cause you know the Republicans don't always do the right thing\nIt's sudden sometimes they need to be kept in check he said that who keeps them and check the Democrats ... ... the mainstream of the Democrats have gone crazy and I think that is the key here so when I look at a couple of weeks from now for weeks from now\nAnd and the election or\nI look at history and history shows the vast majority of times when you get to this point and you've got a Republican president you've got a Republican House you've got a Republican Senate\nIn all likelihood the Republicans should lose seats yeah\nUh that's what history shows it's almost the same as when people called us up and and the one general number forget you remember the call to about a month before the election of ... he said you guys going to be surprised when Trump wins and said no we're not because\nHistory shows he should win based on the economy\nBecause the economy actually has been so bad and people have felt it and they view that there's a need for change so\nYou look at history and you think yeah now the Democrats should take now should they take enough seats to actually take over the house I don't know but then you see the big huge on oh and that is the cabinet nominations I have\nI I still can't come up in my mind\nWhen the Republicans have been so United the only thing that comes to my mind is Nineteen Ninety four uh I'd only been in talk radio for five years and I remember Ninety four caught everybody off guard except for ... members oddly had her death threats as a result we became a poster yeah he ... he he came closest\nTo to catching what was actually happening now that was the United GOP at that point [laughter] it just nobody knew that they were United [laughter] right off to all go out go out and vote and were motivated at that point I had not seen\nA Republican Party that was as fractured as is Republican Party has bad\n\nAnd with in a period of two weeks is a completely United party not because they love the leader or necessarily of the the party who would be the president\nNot because they all of them a majority do\nBut it it it\nIt's because they had seen what the other party is\nAnd they look at the guy that they hate it just a little while ago and said [noise] you know something he was not that bad I I I Wish you wouldn't say this I Wish you wouldn't tweet this but these people when you see what they actually want\nYou know they called Trump a fascist and at times I didn't like it ... times I I'm speaking for me I'm speaking for never Trump hers you know ... ... per se but you know he he talks with ... even if he is and and sometimes he sounds intolerant even if even if he isn't well then you see what the Democrats do when you say well actually this is what they mean\nRight there's no new launched nuanced opinions here to what they mean they don't believe in due process they don't believe in a presumption of innocence they stereotype they say what you know and they stereotype to fit their particular narrative at the moment and we'll change a day later\nYeah it it's ... if you look at the I I think um where the Republicans have come together over two weeks over the last couple of weeks it's not even just the cabinet nomination ended up itself or protecting the process\nDuring the Supreme Court nomination\nEven it's not just Lindsey Graham and no and and and the things he said I mean part of it ah it it's it's all of those and more it is but the bigger picture is including by the way columns you know and and her speech which got a lot of praise on on friday\nBut it really is you know the\nFact that I it it seems as if the party are saying yeah it's time to build a wall\nTo wall\nAround the party and what it really ... and four and a wall around the constitution to protect it each time that the party joined hands here and not that everybody has to agree on everything but there there has to be\nA greater respect and I think campaigning to go out and show what the and demonstrate clearly over and over again what the what the other side is doing and saying look we can all have our discussions on those issues within our house\nBut on the outside you need to know where the danger lies to you every single day and it is from this kind of behavior\nYou know the interesting thing is for all the accusations of being a fascist an authoritarian that have been leveled at Trump then maybe some never Trump ... bought into\n... a\nMajority Republican was ridiculous because he wasn't if you see if you see what he's about if you see the things that he loves if you see the legislation that he's put into effect if you see his executive orders\nAnd what comes out of the White House about separation of powers and what they believe you know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief\nThat the Democrats truly are and it really hit when you realized it was the main stream it was those in the Senate Judiciary committee it is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party\nThat the mindset of authoritarianism and fascism that mindset that they were throwing a Trump\nActually belongs to their parties and they don't get shredded officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared some Republicans who didn't want to be a part of you know the ... of supporting the Republican Party\nI think it scared them strays right I really do I really thought that when I went I went whoa we well never thought they'd do this\nAnd and you know the last motivator that we could even come close the ... I guess in ... during the the\nTrump presidency or should to pair allowing this was\nWhen Roy Moore last they realized they need to get tax has done yeah you know they ... they weren't getting it done they weren't getting it done and it was well known where the ... and then all of a sudden right after Roy Moore's last they got it done\nWhat happened over the last couple of weeks or be a greater motivator on all legislative and procedural issues that and it should be for the foreseeable future but\nThat tax policy did not unite the actual parties know that they know and it didn't it and I mean was it was the ... it was the effect of the Roy Moore last right that got them motivated and that is\nMiniscule compared to what you see and I was the last two ... and not just United of the ... of the Republican Party I'm I'm Talking about the members of Congress so yeah and and the politicians I'm Talking about the rank and file no nine eleven even the ... where it comes from where the motivating comes from because if you if you look at what drives the legislative process\nWell if we were all still shouting away with Obamacare it would've been gone\nThe first several months that Trump was in office right so no that's I I think you you point out the base of it but that's really where I was going with all of this is that the party itself which of course is driven by the rank and file so the the things that are important to get done\nThere has to be greater pressure to keep all of those on Capitol Hill and the president motivated to get them done and maintain the process defend the process and the constitution\nLine open if you'd like to get in eight six six Ninety red eye\nA food product from the sales of cattle is obese is it even meat is it safe what agency should decide those issues the egg department that regulates in insects livestock products will FDA that handles other processed foods the other day agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue gave an audience his take on it\nWe believe that FDA has some equity at the beginning of this process in the laboratory and making sure they're safe products that could be commercialized when they become to the commercials stage we think that us to have a responsibility to regulate and to inspect those products and that's what we will work toward\nThat would cut industry confusion in this complex matter and produce that\nWe can go a long way between FDA and USDA in resolving how we move forward quickly\nSome companies say they're going to be ready to market should meet in a year or two so produce as moving quickly is vital\nWe don't want this new technology to feel like they've got to go off shore outside of the United states to get a fair regulatory protocol\nUSC gay and FDA withholding today joint meeting on this whole issue later this month Gary Crawford for the U.S department of agriculture Washington\nThis age Gigi keeping you connected coast it goes from a comfort of your guests have find out more distributed drug John ... from my truck dot Gov\nThere's no doubt increasing productivity and efficiently as important to you make sure you're illegals of his problem is not just compliant civil\nOn the track dot com or rent a radio show dot com forward slash we'll be back for\nLong\nRead I radio and our sponsors are devoted to trucking safety that's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for twenty seven years we've been saluting drivers will surpass the million mile mark with preventable accident free driving\nBy reaching this milestone you can be a part of an elite club of drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving with outer preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's run I radio show dot com\nThe run I radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... the family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fund cats scale and ... we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most rent wrecking newsman\nNow every week and watch me and my co host younger grows as we bring you the only weekly news show greet adjustment runners and joined us brawl the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile\nIn front of the dot com is the one from not you're not going to want to have them be you traveled down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel my going to the ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOh shoot for everyone living you know do\nA radio and\nHe's earned hunting I'm Gary ... eight six six Ninety right eyeball or audio cut of the day was Lindsey Graham on Fox\nNews Sunday alright that's all we can and that's all we have to say or not you're going to get here as part of the interview\nWhat has gotten so much on New Year's get I Want to take a look at at Lindsey Graham over the last couple of weeks here you are this is the most and Ethel\nSince I've been in politics I thought she was handles we're ... ... was treated like crash [noise]\nYeah [laughter]\nSo why are you well now you're using them happy but why are you will ever have you been on the happy warrior these couple of weeks I'm happy because\nThe airport day nearly eight and railroad man I've known for Twenty years has never been banned from a mall unlike Roy Moore failed\nI'm happy that those who tried to destroy his life fell short\nI'm Glad those who tried to overturn the rule of law and replace it with a mob rule last\nI've never been more tests than my life I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan our never done this to them this this character assassination to says warning power too much and to the extent that I came to the age of this good man and helped defeat this debacle I'm happy as a class All right\nWell let me tell you something that may not make you happier bring it up\nBecause it appears the capital confirmation is not going to end this fight that democratic congressman Jared ... yeah a a New York who would if the Democrats take the house but come the house judiciary chairman has already talked\nAbout launching an investigation into alleged misconduct by Capitol Nancy Pelosi says she wants to see the FBI\nInterviews in the second background check it it doesn't sound like this was going to ask\nWell is a while now and November at that makes sense I Hope everybody running for the house in these purple districts\nBlasted will be asked a question do sport in teaching judge Kavanaugh\nBased on five allegations none of which could be cooperative and he won an outcome so badly that you would basically turned the law upside down a all I can say is that this is going to the streets at the ballot box or I'm going to have never campaigned against their colleagues in my life\nThat's about to change I'm going to go throughout this country and let people in these at you know purple states are red states where Trump won you know what I thought you know what I think about this process\nNow we were talking before we came out they are now I see that you have a list of ... the all the people that the president has that are on the list for potential nominees\nMath but your point where's my point this is a list of compiling November but he actually put it out or during the campaign they're twenty something people on this list I'm asking Chuck Schumer name five nine three name one that would be okay with the\nThreat Kevin I was a mainstream judge I Would have chosen to five and ... a Bush supporter then everybody running for president on our side believed that Brett Kavanaugh and ... were outstanding conservative jurists the other side wants to cancel the election so Chuck\nYou want somebody new look at this list and see if there's anybody of great too but what you want to do is Senator Schumer is overturned the election you pick the judges were not going to let you pick the judges if you want to paint judges then you need to win the White House\nOr you haven't I I I mean that's the process but I think he spells out in that in and also on that day a week ago last Thursday a it in his speech at the hearing it it was spelling out how the process had\nBeen completely bulldozed by the left and not the protesters knocked the media but members of that committee the the leaders of the party\nAnd that should be motivating to every Republican I I I Believe it is but I think\nUh in in hearing or the Lindsey Graham talk about the the campaigning you'll do and some of those purple states over the next few weeks to remind people that kind of campaigning has to be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm\nBeyond the Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on his program need to do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public what the left as doing it'd be factual you don't have to there you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing your demonstrated\nAs one caller said you know just ... just play some of you know their antics in their own words as we've been saying for years of that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that over and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it has to this country or\nFor about the last ... who\nI'm going to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying that it's never been easier to defend the\nConservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier to\nRun a negative ad campaign with\nWithout having to be crude or rude yourself\nAll you have to do is play the audio of your opposition and that accomplishes that in itself you don't have to add on to any thing from what we've seen the last\nTwo weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any untrue right all you have to do is point out the truth of where now and this is very very important\nWhere the main stream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe\nBut the main stream and I think that one of the things that I have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know but the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they looked at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God what in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness\nThere is no sense of civility for they don't ... they don't care\nAbout it you know are taking ... taking somebody and destroying their life and and I mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides and that they destroyed for his life by not keeping it secret then it went on to try to ... to destroy\nA habit all his life on both sides you said it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's live we destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity\nWe just want to win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Antonio", "day":
