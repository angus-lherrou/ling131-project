right at the two week mark which means uh early voting will be starting in places and yeah you know you ... and by the way a our friend Rick Roberts will be here all week next week to uh have great conversations with you\nAnd then we'll be back a week from Monday but the\nThe polls if you start looking at the polls are and you know that the numbers in the house I mean I'm I'm ... it's\nIt really really really really I mean you know going up over you know hundreds of polls there are some that are going to be blue with no doubt a there are some that are going to be read the thirty to our sci fi has thirty to\nEssentially\nA you know that that are in the middle undecided basically just yet it doesn't show the polls are neck and neck\nAnd does and did you see some of the amounts of the undecided you're talking ten eleven ... percent and that's a big deal it is and and the\nPollsters um aren't\nAs active in the house seats as as they are for the Senate ... um they will start seeing that but we haven't seen any polls post capital\nWell we don't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them on on our cp that's thirty two uh\nThe the polls in those areas but you know it in those thirty two districts\nAre really going to start juggling things are showing something here probably by the time you and I get back a week from Monday\nAh when when I started thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows but all I'm thinking is that if you got ten to twelve percent that are undecided it means they're not driven by Trump hatred or Trump bluff right\nIt's not either of that that's driving them so what is it that is what is it that is driving the you know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that lets pull the independence ... congressional district to find out why they are undecided\nAnd what would change their vote right would it be in their local congressman came out and said everything is free but by this time they've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge to build a certain way especially if they're likely voters\nWhich means in all likelihood they're going to vote ... but they're still undecided at this moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yep and watch the huge ... issue over the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks will be ... I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody Kanye West ah\n[laughter] I'm Sorry just throw that out I I I just I don't know uh you know the the the president the president tweeting and the president coming out with outrageous comments to me doesn't drive anything anymore\nI don't I don't think it it I don't think it\nIn flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to and playing the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he when he does that still love him but it's not going to change what's it think about it who can in this day and age\nHow can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicator it's\nA small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sci fi and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two already too yes\nI Would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority\nRight so right now only Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls\nAre and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be the I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens\nAnd what is the impact\nOf the capital and the entire thing\nAnd really me and my ... the our CPA for example I mean Montana isn't a tossup state right with tester you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two\nWhich had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was tester up just to why isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah ... right and and ... my point is though yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe our CPA average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are\nA lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... and\nI guess historically kenner shift happened ah with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOut of the recent polls that were done in that race ah the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven so that you know that right there could be neck and neck or they'd call like a toss up\nBecause of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up\nThat's my point my point is that it's our cp has it has definitely blew", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "12"}
