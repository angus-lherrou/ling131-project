seven seven to six B. I. B. L. E.\nThen I ... I think ... ... and then of course the political discussions and that information I think is also key we've heard from a number of people over the years have talked about how you know they've they've listened and\nAh they have become I guess more thoughtful in their in their political views\nAnd I think that's a good thing that's oh yeah that that's that's the left starts moving toward violence and and shouting and and what was it that Eric Holder said if you know if they go oh you're in a low well you know kick them yeah right and and\nYou know when they when that happens again I don't know what it at at what point they come back if they ever do\nTo a civil discussion Hillary saying recently that it's the other days well when we when will return to a civil discussion that's basically what her message and her statement\nI I think those with the debate or with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win\nWhen they go low we kick 'em you know when you were talking about the ... when ... you know what things that might interest you and uh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was\nI don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio I ... that was dominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio ... thank God I did because I I couldn't sit and\nTalk about a star is born\nAnd Lady Gaga has wonderful performance every day and and abide by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for music station I Would have to do that from what a wonderful performance and the music was just wonderful not that looked talking entertainment and we'll talk about entertainment once in a while but to do that every single day\nAnd have have to be positive about what comes out of Bollywood and do that every single day would everybody knows it would kill me to be able to do this and articulate ideas\nAnd and uh there's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have wonderful thing\nThe other wonderful thing and people are saying might think well you can't really mean that I Do is when people call you with extreme passion of how they disagree\nWith you because I'm always amazed wow they really\nCare what I think [laughter] yeah [laughter] I really I I always get that really\n... somebody's really ticked off at me for something I said you're kidding really wow that that's interesting and so I said to me that and I know it's gonna happen but you know when we talk about the Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm dirt during the campaign\nBecause of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows we don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat enough and you know we're we're conservative you know slash libertarian has a lot of liberal friends right and and and I don't know if they called me friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care that the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is\nIf we're agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that I mean even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years and not starting with Trump when we disagreed with him we've respectively disagreed with a a ... when I first got to talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush\n... read my lips\nNo new taxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back there with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and uh I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we disagree with Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to economic things are and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I eat what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward and\nThe executive orders that that he puts forward when you actually read into it on his foreign policy uh I've been one hundred percent agreement wet but uh\nYou know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just have you know the freedom and creativity oh I Know the point I wanted to make\nThat as it seems that everything is getting on civil law out there ... and things are going crazy I don't know what it is but it's like and I know would you agree with me we've never had this discussion\nSeems like I'm getting less flak yeah because I'm\nNot really getting there are no I mean I there was more ... anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get from the things that I Would say ... very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the uh while the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they go the direct route as they call it and they became they become a ... it's it's beyond a protester\nIt's someone who is going to be in your face\nAnd when that happens\nThey don't have because why do they go there because they don't have a debate anymore they don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case where everyone on the left in fact I think there\nAre plenty plenty of Democrats out there right now they can't stand what's going on on the left and can't stand a first of all had no need for Hillary Clinton uh or if\nThey did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago highly disagree with that kind of tactic and won't use it but the problem is is that\nThat's squeaky\nCrybaby whining wheel is always going to get the grease\nAnd that's where the cameras are\nThat's where the social media is I I I look at it and I think to myself that the reason and Benin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now\nFor is insane as it seems\nTo be out there I Know the flack that I get is extremely light I think probably people are taking it to social media but I really believe that the point is\nIs not that are that are arguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should be called talk show host you learn\nHow to debate better and put your points up for the better\nI think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane I mean right now they're just insane and so people and they look and they say okay\nYou know ... what's what's McNamara saying today okay I disagree with that but uh he's not insane like they are over there I really think that's worth a when you you know you if you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too\nAnd when you see that the opposition isn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion that\nI think more people are just open then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to a an opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred\nPercent but they see that there's rational thought and critical thinking to it mhm\nRight well and and they were and we do hear that from time to time but I don't agree with everything but I yeah I understand how you get there a sense right mhm and we've had over the years we've had plenty of great discussions with Democrats liberals\nWho call and want to have a singing discussion on the issues\nBut no\nThey're few and far between if they exist at All right now because I don't know what they're looking at their party\nAnd asking well how do we actually win something and then move forward you think about the word progressive\nOh that's the whole idea right of taking the country to its next step that's a great point where they're still using progressive down things a little while you know that there's no way you can when they're saying get in your face and shot him out of the building that's progress\n\nThe answer is it's not it's the opposite of progress\nI think the key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks\nAnd then what is just come to this week with the proclamation that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we know till we win an until we win shows that they have come to the realization that they cannot defend their own arguments on the substance of the ideas\nThey are lost and it's just pure range an emotion over what I don't know I Can't figure out a I tend to believe that we think in a in a critic of the critical thinking way and they're just pure rage and emotion and there's no way to even have a debate right eight six six Ninety right on\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service does your

point drop it's really\nThe percentages we all know by a but still a a shock to some a un I talked about this for a while that you know and will there be a correction and when we're there'll be a correction because there's a variety of variables that\nEverybody was looking at number one you know the tech stocks or took a hit but they're worried about regulation\nYou know we've talked about Google we've talked about Amazon a you know Netflix a ... foot ...\n... was was down you saw that the companies that were involved in international trade\nA caterpillar and other companies are we're down because of trade worries you have the president last night at the rally in Pennsylvania are you know talking about the fed and you know what is the the fed doing that they're raising interest rates\nIs is complain I'm sure as are raising interest rates to quickly but then you have\nA in the the the bond market if you look at you know government bonds and treasury bills\nOr that their interest rates keep going up and up and up and up and we have sent when you combine all those together when you combine still the uncertainty of the trade agreements formerly known as NAFTA or if you look at the Chinese tariffs which I an hour in effect\nAnd will hit a now as we enter the uh the the Christmas season we have you know always asked and [noise]\nAnd for the longest time I I think in a lot of good times we've all off and said\nNo matter whether it's this good time or other good times it's the market overvalued [laughter] right well it began with yeah it is the is the optimism too great even when the economy's doing good at times ... right right and and so uh we are the experts were not the experts at predicting but\nLooking at what the futures are doing overnight they expect it can be a couple of hundred points\nMaybe even as high as three hundred point\nA drop or when the market opens\nThis morning [noise] interesting that one of the points that I uh going through a some comments made by Jim Kramer a CNBC and the street dot com about some of the indicators or or some of the signs I guess that the market was looking at one of them being\nPacking materials and you don't think of that on a you know for us lame and we don't we don't look at that but of course right if there is a drop in the in the cost of packing materials that means\nA that there is a demand there was a glut of those materials on the market semi conductors the same thing on the technology side\nBecause of things going on with China China's slowing down a a a terrorist and everything else but their economy and and trying to slowing down as well but the so when demand slows down you know of course in that sector where the price starts to drop in those sectors of those types of materials\nOr we looked at uh the than the ... G A effect they lost ten percent\nOr as a result of and this is a company that's roughly what a hundred and Thirty years old\nUh and they talk about the raw materials and what they do and the and the and the coating is used in the automotive market and everything else\nUm those raw material costs going up\nSo they lose money and that has to do with a with terrorists and and a number of other things but when there's a glut on the market that's a bad sign because those that that means that the demand has slowed\nA when they're when the costs go up especially as a matter of policy that's a bad sign when especially when you don't know how long that's going to be around that or that effect that policy is going to be in place\nA regulation and you and I as we were discussing this last hour the hour before we both with us we're talking about it and went wow okay regulation or that the uh tech companies are are worried about what's that\nOh government policy when we talk about the fed 'em government policy when we talk about the increase\nIn in a in the interest rate in government bonds that's because of massive\nBorrowing oh again government policy when we talked about terrorists irrespective of what do you think they're justified or not raising the cost of doing a a a you know business all those regulation increase in interest rates\nAre\nAre terrorists all are doing what increasing the cost of business no matter what when you increase the cost of business the economy will hurt not an opinion that is fact\nYou know there is that they have yeah ... ... and one of the elements are that the that basically what that was being assessed as the rise of the U.S dollar which is I yes I saw you know if you if you look at that the rise of the u._s. dollar based on what that is a growing often\nIt is the growing economy are and what happens is our trade partners when the dollar starts a two to drop a little bit\nThen they can because of the exchange rates it makes it\nCheaper for them or to buy from the U.S okay so they go shopping in the U.S when it goes up and when it goes up and it's quite the opposite so you see manufacturing down when manufacturing is down trucking is down transportation went through you know a slow down between a twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen and in there\nAnd it was one that people really had not looked at I guess we hadn't been watching closely enough but that is the effect of a you know of of a a rising dollar and that is the fact that again it that makes it a\nYou know it it it changes how people are our trade partners do business with us so that means manufacturers here and then the ... the sectors that will support them like transportation\nAnd that's why the by the way the freight um was one of the items that TV gee listed along with uh the the materials cost oil and freight costs rising again that that goes against or nix\nSo all of this is the the market assessing a what is happening there are there are things that are an adjustment as as an expansion of\nWell by the way that the the cost of oil whether you agree with that or or or not right and it's also based on on the government policy of foreign of foreign policy of saying okay we need to put the sanctions on against Iran which does what means there's\nLess soil and again this isn't a judgment on whether you agree with it or not it's just the reality of supply and demand right of regulation of making things more expensive for whatever reason will hurt in an\nEconomy well and and and I think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia and and talk about what they have been able to because they basically\nAre now that I mean they and they have been for a long time they are OPEC if you if you talk about the you know the controller inside the OPEC member nations hit Saudis and so\nWe're talking about them increasing you know and and uh or in their case they have been up to now decreasing their output 'em and they do that because they know the rising a production rate here in the U.S is threatening to them\nAnd so they want to ah basically slow production\nTo control the cost they do that and the global cross start to rise by the way another benefit to greater domestic production because when when we get to the point that we are producing as much as we consume every day as a nation\nThan you ... you will look at the dynamics of a market and the Saudis and Iran and anyone else but I don't have that behind it but at the store and we brought you last week because of President Trump mhm uh they're opening up the spigot yes and exactly in Saudi Arabia yes ed ... which is what he wanted them to do and and and that's\nYou know for right now because the way what we're producing and how much we're producing a we're not at that rate of Eighteen to Nineteen billion barrels a day in production when we get there that's another case to be made for wrapping up that production and more on our way\nEven though in the last three weeks we become the ... the world's leading the producer of crude oil right um but but at a vote that that didn't really get publicized did it no no not at all but again that's that every little bit helps in that effort will continue eight six six Ninety read I\nAct secretary Sonny Perdue says USDA is prepared to help the agricultural community recover from hurricane Michael\nWay

been told through a couple of reports that they have been in contact with rescuers their lives they were alive\nAnd described as in good condition so as we'll we'll follow the story anything that gets to us\nBefore we get out of here this morning or we we will bring to you right now\nLet's get with meteorologist Tom hale get the latest on tropical storm Michael as an update a little over\nHalf hour ago says sustained wins at roughly fifty miles an hour I was writing a Tom you were right on that we asked you about an hour ago where you expected that report to put those sustained winds and it it it was fifty miles an hour\nAnd a and one mile increase in northeast forward movement to yeah and uh and and your check is in the mail [laughter]\nIf you look at this uh again and think in terms of fifty mile\nAn hour straight wins that is still a very dangerous storm [laughter] yes I'm Sorry no question stained with\nWinds yeah that's right doesn't include ... throughout the evening when we started this evening we're looking at eighty to eighty five mile an hour winds above the deck at about four thousand feet\nAnd so any good thunder storm could translate that down now the heaviest rain is south of Greenwood and moving into Colombia and Orangeburg right now spinning its way out of\nOut of a Columbia and a Athens\nAnd and so the ah the storm itself has feeder bands and those feeder bans are moving their way in North Carolina and those are the ones I have the greatest concern about\nA kicking off tornadoes and so between Augusta and Colombia is where the heaviest rain is falling right now and so that's between north of twenty\nA highway twenty and south of three eighty five and so that rain and we need to talk about this flooding thing flash flooding is going to be a major issue it's going to stretch all the way from Charlotte all the way up the Raleigh Durham\nAnd from there it's going to go up through Newport and probably\nJust in to Ocean City in Delaware and that area all the way up the coast\nIs going to be a threat for ... flash flooding because a parcel of air doesn't matter what a partial is just call it a pencil okay straight up into the atmosphere if you squeeze the moisture out of that you would get over two inches of rain and so this atmosphere is rich with moisture and prime\nAnd so this is the kind of system a tropical systems that are real good at bringing out the sponge and bringing down that moisture and so that's what I'm concerned about because two to three inches of rain\nFalling in the areas near Fayette fill up the Raleigh up the Wilson that area that whole area from Florence up the Fayetteville is is low lying area and easily uh because of Florence\nItself could top more trees more flooding and then the flash flooding is going to be more line in line with Raleigh and um and back right where you're at the base of the foothills that that take you back up at the ...\nAnd that's where you're going to have water that's falling and it's got to be coming down from Anderson and Greenwood Spartanburg\n[noise] uh Greenville North Carolina all of that's going to be draining down into those lower areas um between Raleigh in Fayetteville and that's that's the big concern that I have and and that's going to be a broad area now inch rice a lot of areas are going to get\nA on the west side of Ninety five back up to eighty five which comes out of Charlotte and around by forty that's up near term that area it could be picking up five inches of rain there'll be some isolated spots running up through Raleigh and so forth could pick up as much as eight inches of rain\nBut we've already had a few places pick up two to four to five inches of rain Atlanta or you wouldn't think but Elana is already over a two point eight inches of rain from this round so and they're they're out of the targets on\nAnd so when you start to come into to Charlotte and the the path of this storm what we're looking at is going to take it from where it is now between Augusta and Colombia\nAnd by the time we make it to the middle of the day it'll be south of Charlotte and in between Charlotte and ah Wilmington ... then it'll be between Raleigh by afternoon and tonight this thing is going to be near a north folk and the Hamptons\nOr Hampton Roads in Virginia Beach and uh as I pointed out before um Hampton Roads is sea level or in some places below sea level ah it's kind of like the New Orleans of ah the east coast and and that area there's neighborhoods there that just\nAre borderline flooding all the time\nAnd so when this hits that area they're going to have some very serious flooding issues as well and so this is a this is a big storm I mean you can throw in on the side or the the strong winds forty mile an hour winds let's say forty five mile an hour\nA wins sustained or gusts either way the can be toppling trees because the ground is saturated\nYou could throw in a few tornadoes just for fun and um with even stronger isolated wins and um but this is a storm to be reckoned with a even including a sea rise along the outer banks not counting or\nA high tide of two to four feet right from okra coke to duck ... so while it all points to flooding and power outages are the major two issues that we have to deal with with a few isolated scary moments from tornadoes\nRight or were they are in high tide there in Florida uh as as Michael came ashore yesterday\n[noise] you know I'm not sure I didn't check that\nI heard that but I did not follow up on that someone had said that it it it makes it worse than it was in uh that that it was high tide at that at that point but I I don't know about that timing is that how that was kind of early in the day and and I don't know I I'm not sure if that was the ...",
