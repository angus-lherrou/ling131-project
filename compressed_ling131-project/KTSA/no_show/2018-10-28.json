things first wasn't a good thing it wasn't very good schools and the story\nWas never a good fit she didn't get it in to the in crowd over there a lot of the other talents and people behind the scenes were thrilled by her she came over with tons of fanfare and a lot of money\nAnd the oral why on the investment wasn't very good and they said to themselves\nEven if that were making some money which I hear they were making some money there was a lot more money that we're leaving out there he\nJust didn't really work and they would rather get rid of her now and pay your off a portion of everything

and it was not a good fit and I don't know what she's going to do next and all kinds of things you can use the money there she can go start her own thing and I and you're seeing more and more people

things that I'd like to talk about a ... ah well I'm I'm very glad that it caused this person a [noise] and I believe it's the very beginning of the investigation I don't think it's\nOver yet but my main comment is the rhetoric that has been going on primarily from the left since they lost a trade or been in for the last thirty eight years one of the things that you\nDo is you look for a root cause in failures\nAnd I truly believe that there has been several contributory factors in terms of first of all Saudi ... expectation you had a whole segment a very large segment of the U.S population was told by other media Bob polls and everything that they said\nHillary Clinton was going to win Hillary Clinton was going to wear Hillary Clinton's going to win and all of a sudden guess what she didn't win and the expectation from that that group they just couldn't take it some of those people I Believe and\nWe're taught to lose they never knew how to handle losing ... and because of that because they were so low they couldn't handle it it becomes acts the damn sure when you go and look at the media the liberal media because they were wrong\nHow do they save face they're on television they're on radio they are broadcast the everyday yet they were wrong so where do they do\nThey bash and they continuously bashed if CNN was prohibited from speaking are saying the word Trump will one day put on their ... or on their spring that have nothing to talk about\nI think that\nPat last dog has taken place here\nIt's been conditioning of the population and you keep hearing

him out back when I was leaders are talking to their base to their group who lost you can't understand while they lost then fire which of course and I'm not going to do that if the wrong thing to do you should never get into a fight because of politics you should argue those things out like you're supposed\nTo do so those are my comments for today and I think that the public needs to relax a

Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut by then I I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today a threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working\nShoulder to shoulder at today's arrest is a testament to the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nThat

various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory for these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing ... that had been sent to Congress will and Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\n\nFrom harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now and other packages on\nYou the
