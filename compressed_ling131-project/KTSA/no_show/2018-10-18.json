you'd actually go up because they've got like a yeah like a thousand changes the tax code sorry I asked when you add them all together you pay lord out a which is not what we wanted and that with President Lincoln was and got he set up because we talked about asked if I'd run it I said yes it's good\nI I'd rather than the national taxed version is before a good stuff [noise] and uh so the pledge is a written you know what's that what's the problem is\nA if a if elected or I Will never raise taxes no taxes increased hearing before taxes you know reduce rates than they\nAre paid less than that but no net tax increase if he added all the other no tax increase and\nRight now about Ninety percent of Republicans now's the Senate nationally taken a pledge kept it uh it sweat allowed us to a state\nObama's effort to raise about one point four trillion dollars in taxes uh back a little too that was eleven he should have said oh to the ... the economy's going to collapse of the government will collapse but nothing but work if we don't raise taxes\nAnd the Republicans held allies had no listen we're not raise your taxes credit we have to reduce the growth of spending ... ... ... to as whether it was spending twenty four percent federal government started twenty four percent of the housing and that tells the twenty percent or over a couple\nA years and played by limiting the growth of spending it while the economy to grow up and said there's nothing radical about reducing taxes just got to\nNot spend quite so much and hold that\nFor a number of years you can find the

ah when they're public and it's one of the house the Senate there were two Democrats in the Senate and five Democrats in the house who had taken the pledge and they tend to keep it and I'll switch parties after the election or\nJust ... I was going to guess that I was gonna say yeah the ones who are the Democrats decided we're switching or retiring I just had that funny feeling that that is what it was yeah yeah I didn't want to be cynical but you're right\nIt's the biggest difference between the two parties there are Democrats who\nWon't spend money on that particular project that's possible uh but there are that the Democrats in Washington DC who will not raise your taxes when there's a chance and\nThere and that's why I ask you go ahead\nOh there are ... Republicans a yeah there are a couple of Republicans eight or nine who didn't vote for the Trump a tax cut 'em there's not a single Democrat who voted for uh almost ... Republicans voted for uh and the ones who did vote\nAgainst it knew it was going to pass it just was decided that I Wish that there probably are so that it's the central difference between the parties da da da da\nDa da da da da da di ... the two parties most completely\nAnd I was and that's why I was asking I wanted to say that's got to be one of the definitional things that the Republicans in general want limited government certainly as part of that is lower taxes and and it defines the two parties and it's important for people to know that\n... been a ... a kind enough to stay with us for another segment and you can call in if you have any questions and I have more questions for him let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven three three three nine mark I start feeling in on red eye Rio\nDespite monthly adjustments down when it comes to us meat production year over year\nOverall we're still looking at a big increase in meat production from Eighteen to Nineteen\nWorld agricultural outlook board chair Seth Meyers says some of the changes involved timing production\nSo when you look at beef we reduced some reduction in late two thousand and Eighteen and move that into some additional production in two thousand and Nineteen\nAnd in terms of pork production\nAnd we look at slaughter pace and slaughter numbers and animal weights we actually made some not huge but notable production changes\nBy like beep reducing two thousand eighty pork production\nWhich is expected to carry over into the following year after meat prices other than a one dollar increase for hogs from the previous month prices were steers boilers turkey remain unchanged in October total meat exports year over year a made up including an increase in Port exports from September we did increase our exports\nThis month and a good sized increased year over year as well\nA rod ... reporting for the U.S department of agriculture in Washington DC\nThe USDA report is sponsored by ... wrote master XL premium highway diesel fuel and shell road Tyler\nGeorge with what I told ... ... ...

tax reform and if you have any questions about the tax code or anything related to that age six six Ninety red eye and I have a question for him and uh you know and I think you have a feeling it's going to know my friend\nMy friend is Bruce ... years ago even before he ran for the Senate\nHe proposed that we should do our taxes we should be able to do it on a postcard and yeah I think you find them of course he was from a flat tax and you feel about that just one flat tax and you do it on a postcard\nWell before I moved to the United states I Lived in Massachusetts and that's where I grew up we have in Massachusetts a flat rate income tax about five and a quarter percent\nOr it's in the constitution a number of states have flat rates Illinois that's a nine states have the flat ribs Iraq\nAnd uh what we find is if you are at a flat rate people think it's fair and they don't want to move away from it I was always told as a kid everybody agrees we should have a progressive graduated income tax\nOr some people pay ten percent two percent state taxes a federal taxes you know go away Fifteen to almost forty percent or\nIf you tax everyone at the same way it keeps the tax rates low for everybody in Massachusetts five times the Democrats liberals have said let's go to a graduated tax and divide people into five or ten groups in tax with different light and there's a very sophisticated discussion that went on on TALK radio but it was a ...\nYear one they'll raise taxes on the candidate gets near to the outcome for me at a cafe kids without your on your own soccer it's because\nI've already had my rights raised and now it's your turn and they would\nOvertime McGee is one of the time and a everyone's rights would end up higher and I think that is exactly what does happen or in in American history and other countries show the best way to keep taxes low stab one single rate\nAh and then when the government says I've got a great idea and you're all going to pay for it\nAnd people said you know what now were all listening tell us about this great idea where he's both\nA Obama President Obama and President Clinton\nGot elected promising I Will never raise your taxes now I'm only going to raise taxes on down the top wanted it took ... said a pledge in one shot said Obama of course within the first year they raise gasoline taxes are everyone [noise]\nAh so the promises that somebody else has got to pay the taxes doesn't really last\nShow the safest thing to do is to have a single rate to taxes people one time that one right it is the toughest tax to raise [noise]\nI was thinking of another one of his ideas he Bruce or something you said that if this idea that they take it out slowly prevents revolution if someone had to write a check for five thousand dollars in the end of the year or whatever it is if they really knew what they are paying you to be an up or do you agree with that assessment\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper like freshman year at Harvard and they like to me that they said you know this does come from a conversation I had with the IRS I called the bottom fell out\nAnd said if they did if he does withhold taxes I didn't have to pay check every\nTwo weeks but his dad once a month you said send the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year ... is the IRS perched I was talking to it interviewed for the the ... he said there'd be a revolution it's\nA their way out I think if someone had to write you know checked five ... ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or\nAny of these days with Barry yeah it make it clear to actually pay\nLet's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque\nA New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist [noise]\nThink ... I'll tell you what you just took the words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax and it's seven percent a\nCross support it don't matter whether you're right a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there McDonalds seven percent you'll eliminate every deep Doug seem that there is\nAs far as a a tech fuel eliminate\nAll federal tax is whether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security\nIncome tax you name it fits all federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the\nSixteenth a bad bet and then\nIn order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means you have to have a super majority of both the house and the Senate to foot the bill on the president's desk for him to sign up\nFor it be for it to become a ballot\nOr the election of on every two years that's when they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all registered\nVoters in order for the taxes to be re and I think you know and as you just mentioned are it does it come out of your pay check you write the check\nEvery month or every quarter\nAnd believe me when people realized how much they're paying out taxes they would they would there\nWould be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter I couldn't believe how much I was having to pay out ... Jackson's\nInteresting Grover what do you think of that is I Do\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions uh in California and Nevada or if you if the government wants to raise taxes steak but wants to raise taxes\nIt's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds\nOr to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes\nReally slows the tax and spend down doesn't stop them completely but it really slow it down\nIt has to be a really good idea it has to have rod support a to an AK ... and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes uh would dramatically change our policy curious", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "18"}
