by your vote\nThat was your confirmation that you're okay with that kind of behavior and so that's the message you sent to the people in Missouri\n[noise] ah and ah to the caller that we had last portion of last hour that was talking about the you know our our conversation\nWhen you know yesterday was on the political divide in in this country\nAnd then we got talking about you know the debate because we hear that we need to have civility in the debates and we said nobody actually really wants to debate and they really don't write a we have stated this for the longest time if you've been a long time listener the show\nThat that's the biggest thing that has changed in talk radio people actually do not wish to debate or they'll get on and argue with you but they don't wish to debate the actual issues\nAt hand and the substance of\nThe actual issues we have dealt with this for the longest time we have not we become more fact checkers than than we like to be we would like to discuss the the issues out there and the substance of the issues\nYou know you and I have a just a special affinity we always ... bad the the show's history goes back to the you know the transportation and and trucking history and so that's always been a part of what we have you know discussed on this show going back decades upon decades\nAnd so we're fascinated by how economies work\nBut as we said before economics is actually outside politics it's not opinion\nAnd since people believe that economics his opinion they believe that their opinion or if they're guy or gal is dating a certain thing that the print credibility of economics comes from the person stating that\nNot from the reality of economics like one thing that you and I both I think would agree upon and that is just massively frustrating that people believe that economics is opinion based and as we've said before economics doesn't care about your opinion doesn't care about my opinion\nEconomics is the way that the masses\nThe billions of people in the world and the hundreds of millions of people in the United states respond when set it that's it yeah I Can't change that you can change that no president can change that it gets frustrating when people believe\nThat they can bend economics and I'm Talking about\nUh on on the left and some in the populist portion knocked conservatives but the populist conservative out there that believes that economics is what their opinion wishes it to be that's very frustrating because it shows that people actually don't care they really don't care about finding out\nHow things work and and to me that I got that from my father my father cares about how things work\nHe's an engineer how things work that's not an opinion no things work a certain way physics works a certain way chemistry works a certain way economics works a certain way it's outside of the core of opinion\nAnd and so to me that's been especially you know I Know for us who's been other issues but ah you know economics science you know we we talked about global warming that has come from the left for such a long time\nGlobal warming destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet Al Gore back again it's destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet\nAnd we have asked since this has been going on for Thirty years ah where's the debate between the scientists right you would think that the left would want if the world was truly being destroyed\nBy what we weren't doing that they would insist that scientists debate it and as we've said tell us one federal veto one national debate that's ever been held ever on global warming scientist who believe that men\nManmade uh you know ... you know man made up of a ... you know the\nManmade global warming scientists aren't shore and scientists believe that it is not and have them all debate it had the scientists debate it but we don't do that we're how politicians that debate it and all you're getting his political rhetoric\nAnd and slogans behind it and doomsday scenarios\nIs is what we're getting and then we see as a nation year after year after year from the doomsday prognosticators and that their predictions never come true so they then ... uh expand out when doomsday is coming okay it's on the other ten years what are we now twenty thirty\n[noise] yeah but I forgot what you are is a word in ours are well well some were saying you know we have a hundred years or you know the late Stephen Hawking a was a hundred years to get off the planet a because Bob guild off I mean you know\nOne of the forefathers [laughter] [laughter]\nOr do lord ... I I I guess if you know\nIs still have an audience for you know the global warming thing but you know it's all going to be over by twenty thirty I guess I guess this is Al Gore can still have an audience Bob guild off Ken yeah yeah I I don't know where we're Bob guild off has come out and interviewing admit that he lives\nAnd about anything when it comes to what he believes about global warming\nBut but then they moved back to the point now it's back to twenty thirty\nNow for those that aren't counting uh that gives us you know roughly eleven years is a little over ... over the years to get this all wrapped up a might there be a debate between the people who are the scientists who believe it is manmade and those who don't\nSo then we go from not wanting to have the debate to what we see more on the left and the right even though it does exist and the populist right but we see it more on the left and and that is just to demonize if you can't argue demonize\nAnd that's it yeah name call label or it's much worse on the left\nOr the right if they disagree with you might call you a global as you said to find a global is when they can't [laughter]\nOr they may call you a liberal even if you're conservative\nBut the the ... are left is just insane you're a you're a racist you're Hitler you ... you name it they don't even have a semblance of wanting to have any type of debate on the left these days\nAnd so yeah it's frustrating someone ... when you hear all these\nUm I don't know sociologist and and media people say we need stability in our debate we can of civility in our in our debate the left doesn't want to debate no how can you of civility in a debate when one side doesn't want to debate\n\nTheirs and and there's no they don't ever want to get to the debate no they don't want to sit down at the table right filled the room with smoke that's what it is that's the tactic\nThat has been for a while I mean you and I talked about having to you know coming here and have the discussion on on the issues but no we have to Wade through the pile of BS\nBefore you can get to the discussion because [laughter] because there's so much of it there was an ocean of this information and and smoke frankly\nAnd so we're not going to have stability in our debate when we don't wanna wish to have as a country we we just don't have it\nHalf the country doesn't wish to have any type of debate whatsoever it's impossible to have civility in a debate what you're going to have those people name calling each other and that's what it's come down to go to social media you'll see what that's about eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service getting pulled over for an inspection by law enforcement personnel is not a moment that drivers look forward to not only can an inspection set a driver back in their schedule\nThe results of the inspection could mean serious issues for both the driver and the company the potential for a truck being stopped to undergo an inspection always exists\nHere are some tips to help ensure the process goes more smoothly remain visible and cooperative don't give the inspector a reason to be suspicious have the required documents like your commercial driver's license your medical card your vehicles registration your hours of service in low details\nAnd had them all organized and readily available be professional remember that the inspectors are simply doing their jobs drivers who are courteous and respectful help the process move along faster this tip was brought to you by Jay Jay coloring associates incorporated visit us on Jay Jay Keller dot com\nThis has been the marriage or drive a report brought to you by pilot flying J shell road jello and merits war after market run with a bowl\nOf yours was very much and regardless it's radio [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell row tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine right on the radio and shovel tell us what matters is inside and\nI'm here with a unit royal truck tires engineer to talk about the unit royal LD can drive time\nYes the long lasting L.

but I I Do recall this um [noise]\nIf we look in the Bible after the story of the flood and Noah\nGod regretfully says to Noah I'm I've learned that man from his youth is prone to evil\nWhich is you would think a horrific thing for God to tell us on the message I get from that is yes there is the possibility of hate and all people but there's also the possibility of good\nAnd good will always win out over hate if we let it in each of us and I have seen so much good on these past two days the emails the tax\nWhen I went home last night I I think I finally cleared out from my photo my emails I woke up this morning ... emails these are strangers people I've never met from around the world\nJew Christian and Muslim sick every religion people just pouring out their hearts and giving support

such a tragedy\nThey themselves are being divisive\nIn in all I don't know I don't I I think a lot of them are driven by by their debt own definition of hate\nThat's what I mean there that's on full display is it not\nBecause define hate for me\nBut use hate all the time somebody defined because I don't know what we're member we change the definition of boards all the time mhm so I don't know what the definition of the word hate is now from the the mainstream media\nWhat's what's what's the definition mhm well and I I think that that right now it's it is clear attempt to position time and time again this\nPresident or Republicans are and they've been doing it for I don't know how many years now as people who are evil and and filled with hay\n\nBut did it from from from day one with

great again\nLower my taxes\n[laughter]\nSo ah but\nHere if this isn't hate what is it\nBy the way here's somebody who's trying to save their job or save the whatever money they get for being on CNN\nBecause she means it in her heart\nAnd think about this I think about how delusional you have to be how outside of reality you have to be you couldn't look like the president for some of the things he's done that's fine and dandy\nWe can talk about that in the arena of ideas for her to come pair the president and safe sees worst than ISIS\nAnd that his followers\nAre like the the followers of ISIS the members of ISIS that will kill innocent men women and children is just as reprehensible and hate filled more than anything that I Know any Republican\nIn recent memory has ever said yes\nAnd and that is too because what again when we talk about the the ... what is it that you're trying to portray how is it that you're trying to label the president has a major and in this case immediate threat\n\nThat he is radicalized that it's not just him that he was radicalized a great number of people that are also a threat to you\n\nThat they would attack you the way that ISIS would attack you\n\nI I haven't seen now\nCorrect me if I'm wrong and maybe someone else has seen I haven't seen a group of Trump supporters shouting people out of a restaurant or even have you\nPeople wearing making ah America that great again hats shouting people out of a restaurant there there was some group that followed polo see\nOr that was a couple of weeks ago ... okay\nAnd and by the way immediately condemned by all by almost every Republican out there saying don't do that yeah don't do the tactics that they do don't do it\nYeah and I guess that's the only instance WW thing yeah okay\nWell you certainly get while whether that at at the rallies but I mean where is where is the same kind of behavior I'm Talking about on the level that the left has behaved in which the lenses behave well chasing them down at airports chasing them out of restaurants well the behaving like that and they'll send it to the the thing that\nOne of the things they've got that comes up every time one of the major points has brought up every single time and has for a while the Trump is creating instability by stadium you know by being part of the chant lock her up lock her up lock her up as we said before though\nThat's not an uncivil comment that's a comment based on the fact is we have said before of many people believe in that Hillary Clinton should legitimately be in jail\nWell it is based on the fact that she broke the law that is recognized I don't know who doesn't recognize that fact right she just wasn't prosecuted for breaking\nThe law hope the SP espionage law and the or trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting the server in her home\n\nAnd we have gone through this ... the actual law and even told me he said well it yet but no reasonable prosecutor would\nDo it because we never fought an instance like this yeah because you'd never had a secretary of state that put a private server in their home to avoid the freedom of Information Act and to allow\nForeign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know that our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured mhm but thinking and believing though that's okay we know what the intent was Ian ... everybody knows with the intent was\nI Want to keep stuff private I don't want it to be\nDocument or by the government as is law to be archived by the government right now they're lower for subject to freedom of Information Act right\nThat's what like lock her up about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump son about locking up because she's married to bill ... it's not locking up because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in front of you for political office\nWell it's not it's not based on rhetoric it's based on a fat right that she broke the law\nAnd that she is not above the law now you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree with the fact that back up what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they used that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying well let's see what you're saying that the lock her up lock her up that's on civil that's I Know it's not meant to be in it it actually it's meant to promote stability that you locked up people that have committed crimes but you believe in committed crime right\nI mean\nThat's something that his provable by the way that fact that basis is not debatable right\nThe actual facts in the case nobody has debate it no she hasn't gone to trial or shouldn't go on to ... you're right but nobody debate facts\nRight and nobody debates what the law states right it's simply call me who hated Trump they didn't want a prosecutor now\n\nWe know the whole story when we've been through it before we've gone through the law specifically we went through the first draft of as we know the first draft of analyzing Hillary Clinton what she did and how they changed the language of it because the language that they originally had was the exact context of the law that she broke\nRight that she was not prosecuted for she broke a lot this is the fact\nShe broke the law but was not prosecuted more ... ... and that's why they state lock her up it's not a hateful comments know\nYou want to get in we do have a line

rude and\nHe is or coming I'm Gary Mac um our eight six six Ninety\nRow die let us go to John in Washington DC John welcome you're on red eye Radio Welcome to the show\nThank you that's why I was glad that Trump doubled down on the fake news because this is a very definition of fake news\nAnd you guys have been making a lot of good points because when you accuse someone else or something usually you're doing the same thing they have so much hate in their heart when you compare sitting president and his followers or his supporters\nTo Hitler and Nazis because they won't do what you want them to do\nYou normalize Hitler no nobody should be compared to that sort of a monster and it should be outraged for that\nNow that what Obama was in office this this other point I wanted to make\nThey look at him as he was the opposite of Trump in terms of civility but you know how many cops were cute remember all the cops that we're getting killed Newtown you had so many ... killings and shooting taking place under Obama\nSo it was not a matter of what the president is saying is a matter of when someone makes up their mind to commit a crime or do something like that they're going to do it on their own and the news media this last point I Want to make they are trying to control how people think instead of reporting the news\nI didn't realize Obama's middle name was ... and two months later you know what I mean and also there was a picture with him what are called that I Know the news media left new about I don't know if you've seen that picture if you Google it'll come up now but it's a picture of him or her car\nAnd I I was shocked that was like wow I didn't know that exists here it is that it is eight years later now the picture comes out they know about that if it was a picture of truck with David do from fifty years ago\nThey would be plastered all over the place so I mean they they just this is why Trump keeps winning because they just don't get it and they're still with hate the very eight that they're trying to convince other the they hate truck so much\nThey hate him there and they hate him more than they love the country they have more than all the success that he's having a it's just amazing\nA ... percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June forty four percent consider his performance poor but the cab yet here just six percent right national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're long as we're not out of the war you know new a new war people don't care right or the me see uh a survey this is what does this year the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties of for most days in recent months speaking at a high a fifty one percent\nTwo weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the presidency on the Rasmussen poll predictably eighty eight percent of Republicans think Trump is doing a good or excellent job handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the GOP voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending an update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen uh that uh he released just a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back and fifty percent black voter approval at record high\nWell so we're talking about the economic can inform but overall they say Trump's black approval right now I'm at a record", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "30"}
