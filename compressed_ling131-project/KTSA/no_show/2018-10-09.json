fifty one thirty seven\nThat is the strategy that I've found is calling a Washington these past couple of months so of the two parties who's more energized frying going into the midterms [noise]\nI think we have a horse race I think it's neck and neck I I think that's a real question uh for November is going to be more to these independents fall so what's really interesting is that the polling shows the independents are leaning adverse Los ever so slightly rather to uh to Trump and to the Republicans\nAre this is especially true of man a white man Hispanic man and those folks who do not have a college education\nAnd other words that has the Trump coalition and so it's the fact that continues to happen that's that's really the phone coalition coming home for November So really fencing strategy if that that they are Democrats employed or has backfired\nYou know the ... and here's another thing that the women and\nAnd I've talked about there's five or six women that I Know that I've been close to for a long long time ... all of them at least over a decade all professional women when I first met them ... you\nKnow and and I was ten to Fifteen Years ago not that political the majority I think one in the mid to late thirties the other in their forties and fifties early fifties ... and\nAll professionals okay\nAll executives and professionals and when I first met them none of them really\nPolitical and they knew that when I first met them that I was a talk show host and it was ... now when I talk to them total interest in what's going on in politics all of them over the course of ten to Fifteen Years not because of my influence\nUh want to make that clear ah are extremely conservative\nThey are all hold not at the Republicans there appalled at the Democrats\nAnd so there is this mainstream media narrative that women naturally\nUh are attracted to the side of Dr Ford\nAnd feel sympathy and hate the Republicans for what has happened well the woman that I've talked to and again uh you know I've ... I've explain you know what what their background is\nEvery one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could've kept a secret they look at it and they said the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could have kept quiet\nThey could have kept that she was she claimed she wanted now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe\nDr Ford and that she really truly wish to keep it quiet then the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her\nBecause as he just said and he's a democratic strategist\nThe Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet to fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted\nAnd wishes to have her anonymity we are going to use her as a political football we stated that earlier\nAnd I'm sure there were Democrats dating down on a there is a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing that's what will hurt the Democrats is because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have done\nWell and that's the damage that's his job is to assess the centrally damage what works for them what doesn't\nWork for them and it is not it did not work for them on any level that not only did you have that the situation where they clearly leaked it to the media\nThen beyond that you had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coughing in that\nThe sweating the allegation that came across from her by their hands through her lawyer ... that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abu ... who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard it okay\nWe're going to you know where you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach\nAnd I thought that would die out because I thought to myself but that's a pretty bread a bad strategy you have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you\nSo why would you go out and attempt to motivate the right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach them you're not going to he's not going to leave\nYou know it'd be his Supreme Court seat you would need to go to\nThe Senate now ... and this is a question I was asking does the house\nOr the Democrats who believe that they would be part of the house leadership and that would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee\nA you know under under you know uh what would go on it if if the Democrats won a the the the house um\nAre they saying that because they believe that the people to both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can take them off the seat or do they believe that this will just motivate their base and then they'll completely drop it if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment\nInto him they'll scream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises that is definitely going to fall short\nTo outlook in this if they had the if they had the the the majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation of ... will not an investigation\nThe investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing it's the promise ultimately what that you'll remove him from the bench\nAnd that and not only what happened that that's not going to have and what are you gonna do Dr Ford said she didn't she done or he doesn't want to be part of it are you going to subpoena all these women and bring them back again right so that would be my question\nIs democratic strategist are out there stating you've done damage to your own party drop this well ... and then because here's a question when you start moving in that direction\nHow did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning who leaked to the media is not going to tell you because they don't have to reveal their source\nBut the investigation if you look at an investigation where would go and it will be public\nI mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material that is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation how do you do that without revealing who leaked it and we know who leaked it so the problem is\nThey don't want that on ... the Democrats who leaked it don't want it on record because\nThat has to be a part of the process and just below sea as you said just she really want to see the second background check from the FBI ... by the way you would a bunch of Republicans who saw it and said release it release it released it and they do it because they don't want to break protocol\nRight for the next judge right right at the Republicans are saying we wish we could release this thing yeah it's an empty it this was an empty promise that isn't going to happen\nUm they could hold their investigation they can call for the investigation they can hold their investigation\nBut a complete investigation must include who leaked it to the media\nEight six six Ninety red eye looking to purchase your own trucker trailer\n... financial company may be able to help with financing Eric Gifford

I have not seen that changing the only numbers change in terms of uh I guess dollars are changing hands is the credit now you would have to go through of course a Congress to get\nThose subsidies and everything else the president may say I will push for greater subsidies what is pushing for a year on the surface really is selling more ethanol\nWhoa yeah this is sold job\nThat doesn't well it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't care about the credits they don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them if the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about it in the past raising the mandate right to ... percent right well if you do that that becomes say that becomes a big problem\nPolitically ... outside of Iowa good I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them\nI'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do right and sell it\nYear round well I think you're probably going to see pushback\n... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is\nWell once I like the the wife cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog well what gas stations going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know a a a faster\nYou could damage your lawn mower faster if you use e Fifteen mhm right that it should just be ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it so it's just the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIt's trying to appease the farm\nBut you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work even with changing because changing at the ... year round how does that ... the benefit those that are blending\nAt well okay you could blend it year round and you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level\nAs often that is not that's not promising to them because ultimately it ultimately comes back down to the consumer right so the mandate is on the blend here's my question\nIf the mandate is on the blend right at ten percent but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent but those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting it out let's say they responded to the incentive of of changing the credits\nAnd we went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or or the gasoline so would would have a Fifteen Percent or ethanol concept\nOn the market what would happen with the consumer many of the consumers would be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temperature right\nWhen that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have the time this is why it is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate\nAnd he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get an e Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get Chuck Grassley on board [laughter] to help you ...

third world nations\nBecause if you if you are going to do this for the United states they would have to be globally well you do that globally and you you think about where the supply chain in terms of\nFood the most important item in any supply chain to third world nations you look at the breakdown of that\nNot the supply chain itself logistically but the supplies\nThe content within that supply chain diminished greatly that's the insanity that is the insanity that they're proposing the fact of the matter is\nWhen you have people who are willing to have a ... intellectually honest discussion about it uh you and I said I'm we don't need to be at the table how about the scientists\nThat are on both sides of this have the discussion but the ... the problem with that as the politically driven the very motivated politically driven agenda inside of that to the extent that Al Gore by the way\nWhy in the world will see telling the UN and why why is anyone even listening to Al Gore who admitted back in two thousand ten that he lied about ethanol as we try this altogether\nA it's a it just to read a couple more census or from Caroline of a a coat Carolina coast online dot com and\nUh and it's an article a rich and storms worse and ah and I'm Talking about the Washington Post saying that the president President Trump is complicit ... and and he's and he said there was a study that twenty six team in the Stanford law review that said\nWe call a shooting in the September fifteenth and sixteenth Wall Street weekend edition columnist Holleman Jenkins we called him a lot and contrasted an archaeological study of the first century a de Germans who raised dwelling mounds and built dikes in response to rising sea and strong blood levels\nHe compared to what the us response of rushing him with federal dollars to rebuild so the next storm will always have something bigger and more expensive to knock down ... setting a twenty sixteen studying the Stanford law review that said we call weather related catastrophes natural natural disasters\nBut the losses were often do to questionable government policies you said Congress struggled for years to reform the national flood insurance program and has turned it into a perverse subsidies for coastal development\nYou quoted Bob sheets then head of the national Hurricane Center saint after Nineteen Seventy nine hurricane Frederick\nIt was like an urban renewal program out there he said that the uh twenty Fifteen a A R worldwide and insurance consultancy said climate change it's not climate change but the growing number and value of coastal properties has the largest factor impacting hurricane risk today a whopping Seventeen trillion\nIn property now just inside the U.S storm surge zone\nWhere is Al Gore when you need to be continued All right to climate change crowd\nHas become enamored of coastal development because it creates a constituency for doing something about climate change well not exactly for doing something about climate change but for throwing more money at coastal dwellers and calling them victims of climate change for the benefit of generating media coverage\nOf climate politics yeah wow yeah no that's a long genius way ... altogether\nBecause think about what that what what is done you know if you if you look at that and and that's that's what happens if you look at those you know the the wealth that was created\nUm and is very much displayed on those coasts with people that have the homes and I mean if you've got a beach house think about the value of the beach house right what that would be now think about what it takes to replace that right\nNot just insurance but then there has to come after the insurance there has to come public aid\nInevitably well the\nLeft has used that uh and the emotion behind that because who doesn't want to help well than it is okay this is because this is happening because of climate change\nAnd\nSo not only will we again continue the public aid that's not going to go away but on the other side of that it's to poor public money into and tax greatly\nThe American people based on the theory of man made climate change which is to say oh I don't know we'll start with forty or fifty bucks a gallon tax\nWill start with and that that that won't be the end of the tax I mean if you if you look at it there'll be tax and this is why they wanted you know a vat tax it's not necessarily because of climate change it's because you can you can implement the taxation\nAt levels before the retail level\nIt becomes a compounding ... like the vat tax this is the kind of policy that they want until you have essentially tax the poor especially and the middle class because those are the groups that are affected immediately and greatest\nThen they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they quote home and Jenkins from the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damage by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths sane vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increase wetlands to handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies would encourage building\nIn vulnerable areas and mentioning that every news site and cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence\nMr home and said major storms have become events they afford great footage which feeds a false sensation viewers at storms have become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with aid because CNN is not president\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon production is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards Libyan rationally\nA A R possible he said they could begin with Congress qualifying for the American people how much they are forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it again after a hurricane Michael mhm uh again the blaming of President Trump oh surely and that's why like I said during limburg if you want to check out his stuff\nUh he writes some great articles and he does believe again or he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it but he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong look do we have an interest act interesting prospect yeah do we have an impact of course we have an impact\nBut we're part of this life cycle here on this planet yes I Do as people always ask what do you think and I said I don't own neither do you write I don't I don't think anybody really knows you can take a guess but the average Joe on the average Joe I'm not a\nA you know atmosphere at science a scientist but ah from what I've read they don't know because the predictions are always wrong\nMhm well there are things that we could measure in the past that aren't necessarily part of the global warming thing but you talk the talk of them in terms of pollution\nProtected negative matter yeah I could you want yeah you can quantify these are things that we can measure and we can understand the problem is is when you see policy especially the cost of government which keeps creeping up\nA that is put on the American people uh with out that kind of of\nEvidence and discussion I mean again pollution you can measure\nYou can have the discussion there in fact I think the discussion is pretty much over on that but it's different when it comes to well things you can see and the politically driven idea of greater taxation based on something that hasn't had the pure discussion yet\nYou want to get in we do on the line open would love to hear from you eight six six Ninety road I\nWould I

capital nomination confirmation or a\nThe demonization when let's talk about the Justin Bieber story what is that going on in fact on ... by the way I see I have seen the picture everywhere isn't it amazing though how you see like I've I've seen his picture\nAnd it's like I don't care so I don't even read the headline yeah and so I don't know I don't even know what's going on with them even though I Know something is going on with I have no idea okay I've seen the pictures\nI nose hairs longer these days that's all I Know uh the the only thing I Do know that like over the weekend if you weren't talking the capital nomination ...\nA ... on social media at least the women I Know it was all\nA star is born there were all guy got over a Gaga oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then the other one was a U.S she fight we're went out of control in the fight and everything else that was oh I I didn't see that part I don't know who have Steve neither do I but I Know but it just it filtered I it filtered into my world\n... the the Lady Gaga and a star lowered them and they actually would be coming coming into my world or yeah just I I think it'd be able to see some of these things it was a ten second\nClip that involved day in the ring after fight yes question by Joe Rogan and I can't repeat the answer [laughter]\nBut there are other things that that we have gotten emails on ...\nA lot of people very very concerned a lot of our listeners who are very concerned saying you know ... what's going on with the Pfizer worn thing it just disappeared what happened and what we did covered a couple of times ... uh you know over the last\nCouple of weeks but just to just to go over it again\nSo everybody knows and maybe do it in a little bit more detail here where we can spend a little bit more time on it\nOr the the the president uh was going to declassify a roughly Twenty one pages including the Pfizer application\nAnd at the last minute before releasing it he decided not to and he didn't release it because he said are there\nSome of our allies that did not wish us to release it so he wasn't going to do and yet when we read it we thought OK they what are they trying to do figure out some of the classified information should stay out\nYou know ... or ... should than they need to read that more and that's was I think our original thought ... and then the president said I'm going to give it to further review to the inspector general of the department of justice Michael Horowitz\nWell we immediately said wait a minute and even ... like the day after said you know I I don't know why they won't release it and then we thought\nTo ourselves well wait a minute and this is the least covered story in America right now I think mhm the least\nThe lady made on the road I read or radio exclusive [laughter] have the money you covered about possibly the most important story death in all of this over the last two years is that the president\nBecause he said and we were at and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to a release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded go couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days\nAs you and I were discussing why would he go to the inspector general thing off the subject was Doug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what\nIs to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this and tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact you use that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence your CIA director and ah your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now you know the secretary of defense those are the people you would go to\n... to ... to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies or didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa looked\nAt this but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the apartment of justice\nThan you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said that acts but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of a Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice\nFraud or a rounding option\nAll of that would be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff or Kelly is well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here\nIf we jumped to the conclusion well first of all the executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial\nPower there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played\nIt would be well the president saying this\nThat's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena and that's exactly what you do hear\nThings about the the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee by the president right while our air supposed to be a ton of us and you know ... or which is someone that's been in place since\nBefore he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly I that's that's a key to opening the door and ending",
