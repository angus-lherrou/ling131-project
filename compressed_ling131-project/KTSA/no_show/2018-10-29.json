I mean that's the answer you always mhm mhm so well you don't ... here's the thing you don't ignore the polls that's just all out ignoring the polls or would you do is when you you say look we're don't count us out until\nElection all kinds of salt and you know what the polls who believes the polls [laughter] and you know why you say that because everybody on your side will agree with you yes whenever you're down in the polls everybody on your side agrees that the polls Ron\nWell what about election night well you can see that out crews wins you're going back to the Trump question\nWill if cruise wins will the wind be legitimate exactly we believe\nThat Russians and or Canadians and order or anyone else might have interfered with the election\nWhat ... ... they got in an election yeah uh the the I think the I ...\nIt will be interesting to see the I guess the the number of seats that that they gain if they gain seats in the Senate and where the house shapes up because you do see some movement right now and some of those polls\nAnd not by the way the Republicans picked up one over the weekend according to our sci fi yeah they he okay a couple of things they had lost one on friday so they went back down to one Ninety nine and then they gain to back over the weekend\nSo that leaves the essentially the top ... somewhere around what twenty nine right so you you know you look back at the you know and the the pollsters aren't as active and house races there just aren't\nThere some that you can find polls on but others you have to go back week's pre Kavanaugh pre caravan pre well pre heart of the election season\nAnd you can't find and there's nothing and\nSo you you have to wonder what is because the sentiment does change we talked about this on a number of times on the program how you can say well that was so yesterday and I'm and we literally mean yesterday not like years ago\nBut in ... in\nIn terms of the public sentiment it it changes drastically can change can change drastically very quickly and that's why I think the polls are important they are a number of things that could impact the race in any given house seat or house race\nAnd I think that's what you have to wonder is if any of this\nIs impacting some of those toss ups a cabin all the caravan or or anything else\nOr looking at the Missouri Senate race or from the twenty fourth and twenty fifth in Missouri scouts Holly apply for I don't know if that's you know a been impacted by the crazy Democrat\nEd yeah right oh I'm Sorry I still can't get over that still the yeah let's see [laughter] [laughter]\nI I Wonder if that's unprecedented for US Senate race it might not be for a house race\nBut I Wonder yeah you can find\nIn case you don't know we're talking about a Claire McCaskill the Democrat in ... put together an ad that we played friday a bunch of different times were she didn't practice civility at all with their own party ... where in in the ad you had two men talking back and forth and they said Claire isn't one of those crazy Democrats\nAnd you know that's her saying it was her and it wasn't a pack ad it was her at ... she put it together was it an outside group she approved of it so what she stayed in is I'm not one of those crazy Democrats than we were over the weekend in fact I had a couple of conversations with a couple of people political people that I Know and I said do you know of any other case\nSenate race where anybody actually said that about their own party\nNobody could remember one we didn't want to try to house because well again we we didn't know there's so many house races over the whole you know every every single or every couple of years and so we we just said maybe in a house race there could have been one time because there's so many house races outlier yeah what an\nAd in the interests of the word crazy ... yes because they certainly positioning of of of of any candidates while I'm more of a moderate I'd I'm not far right or I'm not far left or whatever but that's not what that was\nThat was crazy Democrat there was for a reason there was a very clear and direct physician and I think too it was a ...\n[noise] I I don't know if it was a Hail Mary I Would love to be a fly on the wall but certainly it was one of those\nUh attempts that was going to be direct and was going to be blunt\n\nAnd we're talking about just weeks before the election this ad is out there and it was hitting for a reason I mean that raises extremely tight but there had to be a connection with people the centrally that were saying that likely end the call out research that's what was going on there and turtles showed that people\nWe're using those that term specifically so they had to connect with it directly I don't know that I've ever seen that\nYou know again it may have high but I don't remember it in my thirty plus years of covering Paul VI I'll just partied all the opposition party yelling them crazy\nWild I Would expect every ... every other at at least as you know potentially has that in it but that's not what we're talking about it is a uh I I think four or McCaskill which it shows what situation that she's in right now leading up to one week from tomorrow\nEight six six Ninety red eye some insight into when even why about a potential second round of two thousand Eighteen USDA trained facilitator program payments to egg producers was provided by agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue during a recent visit in South Dakota\nThe second Charles you're famous I'd like to get 'em out sooner or later I actually hope to do it in October and this is where I wouldn't be came back in and ask us to hold back\nAnd part of that decision according to the secretary stems from a growing number of deals and negotiations says the first round of payments to farmers was announced around Labor Day\nYou got to South Korea deal for me I guess a Canadian and mix them deals on\nMoving in Japan\nSecretary Purdue added that while the trade facilitates in program payments were met this aid the egg producers impacted by trade disruptions he believes the possible second round of payments

buffalo a bishop Malone who is under extreme or a criticism a and a pressure to resign as bishop a buffalo for not getting rid of pre she should have gotten rid of\nOr not putting priest on the list to get rid of them\nUh it's all blown up and it's centered around my my parents parish one reason is\nUh the former pastor of the uh the the parish and I was there in July when he said he was going to retire I was there with my parents at church he said he was going to retire and we all thought it was you know just because it was time for him to retire\nAnd it wasn't it was because of allegations\nAre against him he was replaced by a nother priest and that priest that pastor is the one who you saw on sixty minutes last night some people are asking me well who's that guy is still there are no this was another\nThis was a a a ... another pastor of that perish who also claims that Thirteen Years of age\nHe uh was sexually assaulted by a priest and he is the new pastor of my uh parents church uh and the uh other a gentleman who you are saw on there Mr Snyder he is the lay person of that perished so when I said about a month ago\nAnd a lot of you know her must have heard that

House\n[laughter]\nThis is the man that they've called racist everything in the book and I wanted to play this because these are young blacks young black Leadership Conference at\nThe White House and the president's address to them this isn't the entire address this is just the end of it but I thought it was worth playing because I thought the president was just great and the response very good\nSo you are all the future of this nation that have to say that and there's nothing you cannot do there's nothing you can do\nAnd you're not alone you're giving encourage others you're opening up their minds\nAnd to start fighting get really fighting for real change is real change and you're not even fighting for\nYou're doing it just it's like you're just doing it we don't even have to fight for once you're on the right path you don't have to fight for it you just doing it it's just happening and it's happening again because you love what you're doing you love you see it you have a well thank you and you have a\nSwear and I love you too [laughter]\nBut you have a clear vision you know it's a clear vision\nWhen you do that you don't even have to fight but if you meet every day with

nearly as big as others\nBecause they didn't know how to when they didn't fight as hard they tended to quit a little bit sooner never ever give up never it's the biggest thing never quick make sure your vision is right\nYour vision is right next you know it is right I mean other people have her own vision never going to happen to never going to make it ... I mean I can tell you right now that the forces of too strong they're never going to make your vision is incredible\nBut never give up ...
