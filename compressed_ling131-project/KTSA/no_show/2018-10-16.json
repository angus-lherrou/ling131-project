[noise]\nAs far as her back\nWith you again taking your calls ... one of the stories that were in the was in the news today\nSo Michael of an audience last another one huh Stormy Daniels if you haven't heard this live a lawsuit over it we'd by Donald Trump accusing her of a total ... job was thrown out by a judge who said the president was engaging in free speech\nOr the adult film stars real name is Stephanie Clifford claimed she was threatened by no no man no man in Las Vegas parking lot in two thousand eleven or for a green to cooperate with a magazine article about Trish she said

down anyway the judge awarded Trump reasonable attorneys ... also\nAnd his lawyers and no amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer ... can truthfully characterized today's really in any way other than total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels and he didn't add\nUp her lawyer boy what I Love to see him get the Democrat nomination for president maybe we'll do that tomorrow ask you who you prefer to get the nomination but here's someone who disagrees with me let's see if I can find them again yeah Robin Boise idaho Rob you're on with mark\nScottish took my call I'm just happy to instill some common sense of this\nSo uh I think Trump is absolutely abhorrent uh I I've got a laundry list I won't go through them all but the the barbaric handling of immigrant children disgusting I'm there that Youtube video I've seen and believe me believe though don't believe me\nIt's been taken out for you to have a talk show years ago I Believe it was a David Letterman or he said in a slug arrogant way I'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian or can\nYou hold on I Want to just I'll give you a chance\nWhat you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrant children first of all they're not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children\nOr let's call them the way it is and I don't know what's ... why it's barbaric to say that you have certain rules and laws and ways of getting in a country and if you don't come in that way\nThen we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe is the parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being separated broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you would probably call me barbaric just because I Want some rules and I want some uh procedures in terms of sovereignty why is that barbaric\nI don't care who the children belong to the handling was barbaric and if it was your child you'd be singing a different feeling you\nKnow no no no you don't have to go on you don't mind around you know you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance when you say something so absurd if it was my first I wouldn't bring my child's us here if I knew they can be separated from me\nI Would do in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you a chance\nBut don't try to read my motivation on my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules in our procedures and it's not barbaric to say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your return\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say it is or not the way they handled it not necessarily joining it in the first place separated show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation being warranted it's the way they they uh they I'll say half bought\nHandled it let's just say for instance I'll be real quick I took my kid Chuck E. cheese recently I had a bracelet said one two three for example at my child at a brace at one two three\nThat way when I was able to leave their verified the bracelets without their logo on my way they could have done something similar but they didn't do anything she's got children at all really was\nFirst of all it was done in a half but way\nWay to first of all ... it's an unelected judges so you were trying to prove something by the judges if the judge yeah he knows what's best than what's best for the country and what's best for the rest must he never got elected to anything but leaving that aside\nThe parents shouldn't be bringing these that's what I Do you said you would do the same thing if was your kid no I wouldn't bring my child up if I knew that can be separated from me and and once knowing that I I just wouldn't do it in the first place they're the ones that are in their clients and give us yeah\nYou'd miss understood if if you were taking those routes or that route and your child was one of the ripped from you and and and taken from the border and putting some concentration camp a dog ...\nOn a ... year would be that's\nWhere you are giving you giving you you're just giving an awful name to what happened to the Jews and others were putting concentration camps these were not concentration camps they weren't close to\n... have you seen that footage where they where they were visited they were not humane due to uh to house children\nYeah well I I didn't know that that's not my impression and that and that's like ... points at one point I have on on the phone number ... okay\nI'm going to give you some more time it was\nOkay place they were there was a press briefing had recently okay we're seven minutes and thirty four seconds long she said the word Barry twenty five times or you might be like why are you bringing us up he talks like a used car salesman\n... if you listen to his speeches everything is very very very very\nThat in some way to the hard way that you'll see I'm I'm I'm a teacher I'm a teacher and I have I think I'm pretty good ... I don't care if he has a queen's English the king's English sorry\nI I don't care about that I care about what he does you're picking an seem very twenty six times you sound like all the latest you're putting them down because you're so much more fish are well here's my point no that doesn't movies is Charles I mean 'cause he says very twenty five times it proves he has a problem maybe with the language he doesn't speak as well as you do\nWhen we go by car he didn't say it could be sick or a gas mileage it gets very good he speaks in most ways very an officer and great history\nPattern is going to reach power sharing it so now you're putting\nDown used car salesman they provide a valuable function I ... I Wonder would you be like if you were you picked on me what if your daughter was a used car sales person I mean what are you saying you're picking on them because of language because he didn't go he didn't go to Harvard or something", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "16"}
