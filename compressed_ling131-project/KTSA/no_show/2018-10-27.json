lose their and you're like what so now you're gone and that's another thing here too\nYou wasn't liked a lot by people\nAt NBC she got a huge contract she was the Golden Girls they brought her over in one of the reason they brought her over because they wanted to steal her from Fox so they do that\nYet a lot of people around that there were jealous over who weren't huge fans of her anyways and she came from that place that dirty plays that dirty\nEvil place that's on the ride that dirty even play so she'd you must be tainted\n\nSo she's going to get sixty nine million dollars or what's left of her six million dollar contract to walk away to go shooting a settlement and and the settlement may go she'll get\nDoes she do thirty five they may say we'll give you twenty five but we won't restrict you and what you were able to do meaning you could go back to Fox which is what the rumors on the street they have been a negotiation for this and the thing is it's her numbers weren't good winning so

I think every time the an election cycle rolls around you shouldn't be attached\nTo a party they should want to try to get your vote ... the frustration I find is is it and right now you're getting it I'm getting everywhere you go the negative ads drive me crazy ... not one person is sold me on why their ideas better all they're trying to do is say they just suck a little bit less than the person that you\nCould vote for us we're less corrupt [laughter] how did we get to this point well\nYou know it's tricky during one of I I think right around Clinton's a mid term elections one of the things that we saw was there was a ton of money that started to get dumped into politics in a way that was unprecedented from donors\nAnd both parties have wound up kind of competing to that um and what's got left behind is what we used to have to do which of course\nUh you know court the voters who I've talked from the Democratic side\nWho we used to court and protect their interests white working class people African American community\nAnd and pretty much we all started tilting toward the bigger donors you know my estimation that there are differences I'm not implying both parties are are absolutely identical a mess but I Do feel like there's a whole swath of working people who are massively overlooked and as as both parties have kind of role forward\nA new one who's taking care of them the way that they should and the working class people\nOf this country um you know hold him shoulder the weight of of basically enriching the rest of the world even through a free trade\nAnd we we have not taken proper care or notice or seen and heard them and I think a lot of people did not see did not feel seen and heard in the law and or represented by the candidates in the last election\nWhen you say oh middle I think that's a that's a fantastic term because there's so many people who are much more reasonable but if they're looking older seeing or the amplified messages from either extreme\nAnd they're not feeling like they're represented in either the level of civility or the kind of discourse happening or even the views or even frankly if somebody else has an opposing view then you you don't get to look into their heart and make a moral judgment about the type of human they are you just you should just disagree\nOh absolutely and and and you know as Dr Agre\nWhere was he was a screen writer or a the author for the order of an ex series and and several comic book she would probably familiar with but he's out there helping the Democrats in ... and you're out there helping Democrats who are in in in races in places like taxes where you talked about a guy\nThat is you know guy was what is he an Army Ranger the guy who whose who he's built up a business\nHe is he was everything that you would look when you look at a Democrat you go like that to me is when I look at one of the Democrats that the Democratic party I used to recognize just like on the right there are some people out there that I recognize that are that used to be the Republican Party the extremes have the bully pulpit and the problem is as we've now gotten to the point where\nWe no longer look at the other side is somebody I disagree with a on political things we now just a few across the board is you're evil and your the enemy\nAbsolutely and the gentleman who you bring up is it is a great example we'll talk about this uh name's Joseph Kopser he's running into access\nA you know Twenty years in the army he was a ranger he then uh went to the Kennedy School at Harvard got a degree in international relations ... was a professor at West point I mean really impressive guy\nAnd one of the things that he did after that if he went and created a a clean energy company which was a huge success he now employs hundreds and hundreds of people and to access\nBut a really successful entrepreneur he understand small business and for instance when he talks about health care he doesn't talk about it in a way that shaming people who don't have the same view of him who who you know it's not from this perspective of\nHere's the sick child and how dare you not care about them because I think people who are conservative it's not that they lack empathy for people they're just trying to figure out a system that that makes sense for them and feel sustainable economically\nAnd what's so great with cops are as viewers he's like look I had after Twenty years in the army\nI had baseline health insurance for myself and that gave me the freedom to go take a leap to build this business which now created hundreds and hundreds of jobs and it's helping to drive the economy\nAnd it's a different perspective on it of trying to look at the robustness of the whole community and ways that we can have conversations about things like health care and look to different types of advantages\nOh I'm Still you know it's like it's like when I talked to my friends who are like they're the climate climate change climate change I said you know you guys will approach is wrong you come at Republicans and you called them deniers or anybody who who doesn't agree with you because the reality is well science is out there then you can find opposing science and the fact that some of the numbers have been\nYou know you know just dump a little bit people get frustrated and think it's a bunch of bologna if you come at it from a hey you know what whether you believe in this science that science the reality is we're going to take better care of the planet plus there is the money to be made here so there's a capitalism is a part of it\nWhy not become part of a of a solution here we don't do that anymore we can't have a conversation that same thing goes with health care I Want to find a way to get I Would love to see everybody get healthcare\nCan we can we use a combination of both what are the tradeoffs is Thomas Thomas ... say it's about trade off what trade offs can we have because at this point I look at the Republicans and Democrats they'd rather have a hundred percent of nothing than fifty percent of something\n[noise] look you're preaching to the choir on this I mean especially with the environment I think the other thing that happens just to talk\nPsychologically for a moment\nPeople have a and understandably defensive reaction when they are told that they that they are bad not that it's their views but when you switch it over to that\nAnd there's an underlying sort of negativity and environmental messaging and here I'm not being party specific I'm just saying when we talk about the environment we tend to come from the sort of\nIt's totally sleep portable version of the entire continent of a gay TSA broadcasts that are all one tap away on your iPhone
