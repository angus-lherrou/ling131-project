he had said this then I wouldn't have a problem\nBut still the media carries the story because what you're looking to do is it if I were writing that story if it were my work to put that story into print or put it on TV or anywhere else\nIt would be my approach to say\nUh this is going to be torn to shreds because what she said and I need to go back over to this is what I Would do I would get the transcript and I would read it and read it again\nBecause she's claiming the classmate is claiming he didn't say something when he did it's an all out lie but if you're in the media and you're taking that story to print to TV to whatever\nYou're part of the lie because it took another media organization to tear it down and say well I'm actually he did say that\nOr does it ever feel\nLike that and and and this does not come from arrogance whatsoever because you know that were referred or assaults Institute idiots overnight\nBut does anyone ever get the feeling and this is a doesn't include just you and there but everybody listening right there does it ever get to the point where you just think to yourself\nDealing with the Democrats right now the mainstream Democrats is like dealing with our children yes any excuses the children will give yeah and I'm not saying that are out of meanness I'm Talking about the arguments that they are making you know you and I said this\nUh last week said the American people when you basically they understand due process\nAnd if you talk about the due process and what the Democrats are doing here or not you know the belief and\nYou know that you're innocent until you know proven guilty the the the fact of what they used to claim they cared about ... you know that's what the liberals are to care about and the fact they do and I said but if you keep pushing it the majority of Americans\nDo believe in that even Democrats that said they won't vote for Kavanaugh they still view this as a cheap shot against him yes they view it as if you if you get them alone and you ask them\nThey'll tell you that oh by the way one of the uh\nUh people that I Know on social media that uh doesn't talk much used to talk more as a liberal and has been quiet over the last year came out in favor of Kavanaugh wow and\nEnded in a very subtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats right now they're not happy with the way that the ... that that this was actually going\nOr they won't come out publicly and criticize their party for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable and they understand there is no evidence here they understand and then they see this just rolling and ... and that's the whole point\nThat many Republicans look at this and go wow you can either going down this path and now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out I mean this is just so slimy and so dirty yeah a against Kavanaugh because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't stupid that will sit there and say this\nReally stinks well and that's that's it because it does ... they'll look at the forward and say all these go find me accounts another now of what a million or over a million dollars what are the world's going on here the lawyers were pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight ... why is all this money being\nA rate it looks dirty yes it all looks dirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you when you said earlier to me or off the air\nYou said this is really liked the experience that we have\nWith Capra Nick but yeah we have no idea that captured or it's about free speech or why don't you watch the new well look I'm not angry it's just I don't prefer to watch it because of\nAnd you explain what he actually did and you explained the pigs socks every single\nPerson that supported Kaepernick had no that that I've talked to and it's in the hundreds over the last year ... had no idea about the top ... once you bring that up to go it's a good point they had no idea about Michael Bennet ... no idea that Michael Bennett who was the catalyst one of the catalysts last year and has become one of the leaders\nOf the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly mhm got famous and became the poster person last year mhm to continue with because he lied about the Las Vegas police every single person that was supporting\nKaepernick did know about that either and they went oh oh okay yeah that is bad and I'll leave it at that I won't judge them and but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people when you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the\nPreponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty that it has\nTo exist somewhere there's a reason\nThat NBC wouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't they run it because they know that even there are few listeners there doesn't listeners viewers that that are left even if they're liberal would say\nYeah not not good right and\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right why we don't hide anything in the show there's nothing I Would hide\nAny news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't they right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission mhm and a lot of stories out there now right earlier lived through omission we just won't include parts of it and if and while they'll\nAn interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right\nThey will ignore\nA key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual procedure\nThe actual process in place\nThey ignored completely but when you give Americans when you start telling America's look here's what's going on with this case you lay it out to that and that's why all of a sudden you go to\nYou know sixty percent say oh or fifty percent ... percent say oh we didn't know okay yeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation well and if the FBI finds out there's no one sixty percent of Americans believe it it's almost all of independence mhm\nYeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we talked about the administration and said look you could have more successes if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberal that's not\nYour goal that will not your goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying\nYou know what I'm saying what I went to Coons I I was just I was telling them this is tearing our country apart we have to we have to do something well who's responsible for the damage try you're going to the person that's tearing the country apart yeah and telling me up to ... telling them you're coming over to his side ... position\nRight then and and then he then Coons calls you know Jeff Flake the hero really\nWho's tearing the country apart who was engaged in this kind of behavior outside of Kavanaugh outside of\nTrump even if the left\nWho's shaming people out of restaurants the left even people that work at those restaurants shaming people out of restaurants\nThat that behavior tolerated by the left it's not the right doing that that's the left\nSo if anyone sees us as a divided and harshly

the people were looking at on the on this question these people are are almost the communists anyway looking at this\nIs a bigger part a cold civil war it's colder than it is not violent simple as that is the direction of the country and they're going after the Kennedy seeing this as a last ditch effort by the left and they're losing they don't have the facts\nAre extremely in public that with

percent [laughter]\nAfter the election family that I Know it's a hundred per se I'm Out of the smartest president that we ever had modest and the room right to understand that it's a hundred percent

remember the reporter uh who worked for the times that didn't even leave as\nHis apartment to through the stories they said he went to was his name Brian Williams I don't think it was [laughter] but but you know you don't even have to I mean that but it's it is a very basic point that how can you be doing\nAnalysis real analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that\nIn an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is I'm not expecting them to have the same internal set a campaign without or that a party would have\nBut I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties that would see some things and say okay there's there are real because Obama is always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election\nBut really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype and Pennsylvania watched Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania\nBecause there was something else going on and it was anecdotal but if if we could see that really with out and we did research that we're not going to say there were no tools but we don't have the tools that are available\nThat a news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or\nAny of them have they have rooms filled with people that can whack and do we ...\nWe didn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania right ah in Michigan and Wisconsin then and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information\nThat they had where they started seeing that that to turn and and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do\nNow for those people that because we

cars more expensive\nTo buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada were all in it together you know the cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric\nYou mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused and said Eric ... uh but as you said yesterday a ... and you and I've been doing some some uh the reading and analysis on this is at her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do to look into by\nUsed vehicles yes and that's driving by market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles the used vehicles and the price goes up\nAnd so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal it's all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president things because of president or even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things ... and that's one of the bad things as automobile now it could have been a lot worse from what he was promoting before\nBut the fact is it didn't affect probably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing as we said what happened we had predicted look who's going to be all this hype all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get\nIs the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory and timber we get a little victory and dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that you that consumers are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship\nCars from the United states anywhere else\nAnd the president to use that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great\nVictory right yeah and I think if you look here's where the child will be\nYou'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry has his key to the economy\nIs because you look at the the the how often now people purchase vehicles right or more and more they're holding on to their cars\nSo that hurts the ... because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be salt\nYou make that more expensive you start hurting it industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that then and then also make the used cars by default\nMore expensive and you're going to see not just the automobile industry but of course all the dealerships\nAnd all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms of those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that because people will choose\nAs they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time\nBecause that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else we're not talking about well whether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce that it's hard to come by\nIt that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine how expensive it's going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that's that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stuff where we do have more free trade now because of it\nAnd we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine but it's almost as if we make the victory over there and we've done we shoot ourselves in the foot on automobiles now the other good thing is\nCanada will like this would be was mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the terror if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether\nA candidate is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction\nIn the United states because that timber will be coming over\nAnd that was a fear of builders that housing prices were going to sky rocket another construction from the use of of woods because of the Canadian timber and hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and there was lost his across the board but but overall if the president is stating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs on the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on\nIt well and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles and you start seeing that slide\nYou start seeing the economy slide and that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel chairs they saw companies leaving the country\nAnd they said this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this because the the job loss will be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those steel terrorists uh prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right and so uh you know the president which was called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economic\nSlump he'd give me when you get ... he's got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China there's ... then ... and by the way politically you can get away with that all day long to\nIt's going to it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by the world Trade Organization rules then not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with trying to need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy\nAnd it is going it it has to be effective because I don't know how you can put a cost on on trying to not playing by the rules and stealing intellectual property time and time again and getting away with\nEight six six Ninety road I [noise]\nEight six six months he wrote on radio [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to shovel

going on this week it's been going on that but it's not much to go to a urban in Chicago urban welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nIs during the day very good\nYou're on the radio [laughter] yeah yeah I Want to tell them how can the Republicans cry now when they created all the problems that they're going through right now how is this date they've talked about\nMoving in a field goal posts they chose to fill goal post all still feel well we couldn't even kick to feel go\nDavid ... explain how what are you talking about\n[noise] okay if they were a let Obama appointed\n... at least ... we might not even being in a situation where cabinet can\nLocate lunch break this down then but All right All right well let's break it down let's break it down now let's break it down okay that's where you've made your major what you're saying is\nUh the Republicans put themselves in this particular situation okay let's say that they did because Merrick Garland was not you know given a given given a chance it yeah ... ... yeah and you know why they ... they had both on the way we\nUnderstand let me speak let me respond to what you are stating that is that in a republic\nThe representatives said get elected and the party that gets more representatives elected by the people they get to make the rules and regulations of that particular body you're stating since the Republicans won ...\nAnd could control that body which means control that nomination because interrupt public it is the majority representatives of that party they get to make the decisions that since they make a decision that you disagree with its okay did defame\nSomebody's reputation\nNo I'm not saying that what I'm saying is this first of all that's a lifetime position so\nGet to go over your whole life when you and your mom wall if you did something wrong at that point or someone witnessed it that's part of your life twinkle when your whole life not says part of your life\nWell and I don't care for bin Laden I Will I Want to thank you I Want to thank you for your call because you now have you thank you so much for calling us up to now saying it goes into the womb mhm so now according to a Democrat it's not a woman's body anymore right\n\n[noise] but I'm not sorry\n[laughter] well wait we're Indians or not we should go back to daycare\nWhen all you know it but no it goes back to what we originally said the if you're in power you get to make the rules\nMhm right well keep in mind though that position was nothing new uh on the Senate for back in the day the Democrats held the same position because it was just as much out of respect for Hillary Clinton as it was for Donald Trump remember\nThat scenario was that the new president should should pick their nominee right and I ... and that did not that was not there was not a given at that point that Trump was going to win\nWell no the the end but the point is that this was like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week was the ... the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was\nThe head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that uh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice\nYeah the people in power we get to ... these aren't laws were not changing laws were simply changing rules of the Senate that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections as what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame somebody's a defame somebody's character because that's the reality of highly Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the plane to we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life time yeah positions NATO that does anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the womb numb all Supreme Court justices we need to go back to the boom\nWell at least they do this [laughter] how often did you pick your mother that's domestic abuse yes I'm Sorry that was a little nutty to our last caller yeah just little can't tell little ... little over the top and you wonder why [laughter]\n[noise]\nYeah [laughter] cabin always take him in his mother's womb domestic assault\n\nYeah why not just a you know okay well we'll go back to daycare he threw ice on come on [laughter] in a bar legit I let's let's well we do need to say that the kids were in a bar\n[laughter]\nBut this is this is the desperate attempt by the left when they know\nThey're losing even his cabinet or they don't get the confirmation votes for Kavanaugh\nWhat do you do when the eggs split\n...\n[laughter] yeah well it's you know a a Newsweek now pointing out that he lied about having no connections to jail when they can show his grandfather attended Yale which would make him in turn a light just a legacy student\nAnd in two thousand eleven these prestigious universities including Yale Harvard Princeton said that roughly twenty five percent of their new additions could be considered legacy students this is reaching\nYeah [laughter] this is reaching [laughter] you\nMay have had too much to drink and then when you have to go home well well I'm\nTelling you
