our founding\nA constitutional republic and a a government that tries to for the most part just do it's absolutely necessary to stay out of people's lives\nThat's what I think the real battle is about and maybe in of course money's include look at the Clintons how could I denied that right they became rich with the Clinton Foundation selling a you know access for millions of dollars I don't think that the Clinton Foundation is making much money anymore they know they're not they're low\nI I never got through it I'll do it tomorrow night um I'd love to see Hillary run again because I I think it would be best them let's go to Amanda in del city Virginia you're on with mark\nMarket rates talk to you and I I really think that we're winning and\nI think it's obvious um and I think Steve ... is a good example of how we overcome\nHorrible attacks and then are seen as hero because I I just think he is one of the brain as people I've ever seen and I also think President Trump and I'm Brett Kavanaugh are are very brave people\nAnd I was so upset by what happened to Brett Kavanaugh I decided you know what can I Do to fight back against us um and one of those things that I've decided to do is\nI Will take away the laughs ability to communicate in any way I can\nAnd I talk to people and I challenge them on their views I also um\nHave removed guard times in my neighborhood and that I disagree with because if they're going to steal people's honor and trash people's reputation and I I I can allow them to advertise the main my neighborhood to promote themselves\nYeah but I don't think you want to take away the yard signs because you can get personal trouble\nForget what the ramifications that I Know I've been saying that we had to fight the way they fight and so on but I don't want to see you give them any trouble as it is illegal to do that and you're lucky to be you that's caught taking down the arts on it so I I don't want to do that that's not the way to do it for NATO heavy on your side\nAnd I understand what you're saying and I you know I I I take great precautions to make sure that I'm not seeing but the the thing is is that I have seen Republicans ... run over and destroy and\nRight in front of my audience and show is that there was a a gentleman who drove a cost of ... right in front of the um bully Maryland a Republican office\nDrove I say thirty feet across the grass and tried to run over a sign with his car\nAnd we were sitting there watching it happened\nAnd you know it it just blows my mind that you know that somebody could do something like that and then destroying and no one does anything to him you know\nAnd I I yeah I live in California and I wouldn't put a Trump sign up on my car that'd be then to my car there were key the cars out about it here and I wouldn't put enormous rely on that I mean\nYeah yeah I saw that guy with the black pickup truck that had his car firebomb because he had a make America great bumper sticker on car\nYou know they wrote after Trump on his car and spray paint and then broke the window and set the interior on fire\nAnd I just I just know where winning when they feel they have to do something like that\nYou know and he ... his Democrats and we see them sending things on fire so we know that they're desperate and\nI just think they have nothing to offer except for outrage in protest and you need more than that is a political party to be effective and it's just ridiculous you know I've been listening to talk radio\nYou know for more than Twenty years I read books you know written by conservative people um like Rush Limbaugh and\nMark for men and and and I know more about politics than most people so when I can rent a liberal about their beliefs I can I can combat them with facts that I have on my side and I think if we educate ourselves by reading these books you know and and\nThe only two um cities towels\nWeb sites you know license to lie dot com and and and reading her story about how these um states attorneys\nAnd I'm judges were breaking the law in order to um vilify and spy on Republicans and you know once people know these things and see the dirty trips to check that immigrants are up to\nAnd I I just can't see how anybody would vote for them and\nI think that they're terrified also that President Trump has become um attractive to the African American community and out in the amount of black Americans are having a more stable of viewing the him um and I think it's you know over twenty five percent now and they need a five percent of the African American votes wins\nOn no they need like Ninety percent or a few percent yeah like a huge difference\nUm yeah so there's a lot of hope it no you may not have been listening all night but there's a lot of frustration out there and I think the Democrats overplay their hand and the Kavanaugh hearings\n... trying to destroy the sky even if there was some merit to her case that's not the point point that just wants to be given presumed innocent\nOr we just had some interruption they go get your call if that's what it was but the great call uh I think I'm I'm getting more optimistic after doing the show tonight and I'll be we'd all we\nAre filling in for the guys are I I think they overplay their hand and Republicans are going to come out in huge numbers and maybe we will not lose the house let's go to Thomas in Knoxville, Tennessee you're on with mark\nA bartender at a great job does not and I'm\nNurse at great we're at a civil war and we're ... we're got red regretful or in a field

lectures and let the population besides you know is going to grow it represented us and that's all we need it\nI'm fully or on the side of the ... on this case because you know our faith from blue is just overplay their hand as you said\nWell and I teach government part time I teach uh adult students and one of the things that I teach them is that we had a good great system of checks and balances the founders knew they didn't want any part of government to get too powerful\nSo everything we do you're right you know how to make a law that houses the past as soon as they agree the president can veto it or they can override it uh you have the court system to try to slow down too much power certainly to make sure I follow the constitution\nThese people were geniuses and created this country

nine o seven three three three nine and we're taking your calls so let's go to Jerry in del mar California trying with mark\nYeah it's a mark a long time first time I'd love to talk about their yeah\nYeah you have a ... for ... ... people got disillusioned by the John Roberts made it a tax issue out of it and and and also uh it'd be in the going back to the Bush tax cuts that were done away with by Obama so why not\nYou know forty seven or eight times the sand that try to get rid of the ... of Obamacare in back after they get extended back in twenty four gene or you'll deal by Obama\nSo he said well we need the president shall we got the president and we had a yeah take all the monkey wrench in their sided with the Democrats\nIn and get the book now is not wind that are we taking a vote on it or ... or after election they finally get rid of this Obamacare watched rocky helped me out with that and you point\nOut yeah ... ... yeah I think the problem is you can't get the Republicans to agree to anything I mean you know\nThe Democrats are in lockstep when they want to vote for somebody vote against the witness the Kevin hearings with one exception Joe mansion but you can't get the Republicans to agree on anything even they they even disagree about the ... as you point that I don't even call that Obamacare\nBut as you pointed out or John McCain I remembered there does late at night\nAnd thumbs down I think it was more an attempt to get back and President Trump\nSo we can't even get their ... and we have a ... a you know majority of it is it's all you need is one or two of them to get cold feet or feel all the this is no good or whatever it and you don't have a pet you got to say that we'll have a crafts they ... they circle the wagons go ahead\nWalmart and everybody will you need it ran on it or\n... or a McCain ... ... when he got re elected he ... he went down there is that I'm going to get rid of ... and then he turns around and yet this is what\nIs it was just losing a lot of people especially the meat when you get to buy your own party from the ... in the party and that\nIt it people and why can't you take the vote again if you you got that yes he is he is in there now\nIs is going to make a difference why would they ask you get rid of it now and let's go back to where every ... ... where everybody's got a choice in the back yet are on the church now you're ... or ... or doctor when we got the initiative to go out to get\nHelp anything else he got the uh ... if you qualify for Medicaid you'd go for that you got many you worry\nAbout is the choice if he if\nWe haven't had a choice you kill their babies why not just people that want the health care to stake people in my life\nWhy aren't we have in debt and issue brought up and that's the one thing that's one thing Trump Rana you may not run and and that issue in in his shoe legal immigration was yelling at just health care at where there's thousands or millions of people if you walk reunion\nMore for their deep action than before and in in ... you how do you think they're going to go\nIn in in ... in ... when the party that you're going to get rid of it and now we're ... which still there\nAnd if you get rid of it I Know they're going to win because I I Can't see a ... with this\nOr the vote here at all which ... which is not\nIn like you said they tax you can get the deal is to act like they got rid of it is that that that's why I asked ... me to act out of it in a while you like as he\nLearns that choice for that and why is Nick how can we get it gets to go with that you helped me\nWell are ... ... yeah I think I can I don't think they have the courage of they're afraid you know\nThe poll numbers are actually I don't know if you can believe them but the poll numbers seem to show that the repeal is not as popular as it was I don't know if that's accurate or not because we have problems with the polls but you make another great point Gerry which is what I said there's John Roberts appointed by a Republican president\nAnd all of a sudden he changed on Obamacare we're pretty sure we're going to win that\nYou can't even trust your own which is how about the Democrats they complain about them Kevin how they voted ... you know the four votes are going to be there every single time it doesn't matter you sure you don't ever seen them deviate\nBut even on the Supreme Court is the Republicans who are deviate from what you thought they believed in\nAgain you're not supposed to question them on every single issue now they don't even answer it but you couldn't even trust John Roberts to be a good a Supreme Court justice who else then who's the awful one Souter that the H a Bush a point that I mean he wound up being a disaster\nSo we we we have this problem and thanks so much for your call Jerry the problem is that\nPeople are not as you point out John McCain was probably trying to get back and President Trump but you can't even trust trust you don't have to worry when you vote for a Democrat when your vote for a liberal when you vote for the leftist that's what you're going to get\nYour vote for our own I mean I I gotta tell ya I wasn't even sure that Susan Collins was going to come down on the side of Kevin I was worried when she was going to give her speech I don't know if you remember a few hours before she gave a speech people weren't sure what she was going to do\nAnd that thing you have people like Jeff Flake right though I have to mention him\nOr he didn't even run again because it's so unpopular hates another one that hates Trump so much\nAnd you could even be sure his role and what did he do uh a woman accosted him which looks like she may have been part of the ... gang but I don't want to say if if it's not accurate you know some of them were paid the ... did you watch them by the way clawing if the Supreme Court a truck stop his nomination of these people losing it or what\nAnd that's why so those are just joining us now I said in the very first our we have a civil war going on\nBut we can't even trust the less sensitive juries question they run as Republicans conservatives whatever and then they get in there I don't know they want to be in favor of the parties or they want to get good press who knows what it is it gets them and that's why I say this for years and it's a good time to say to the audience now\nWe didn't first become Republicans and then the site on our principles we had a series of values and we said oh with those values than the Republican Party makes sense and if ever they deviate from that what is the point of being a Republican what is the point if the party can stick to it what's the point of John McCain you know", "year": "2018", "show_name":
