harder time unloading their properties the survey also says fifty eight percent of renters are planning to buy a from fifty four percent in February well here's the thing ah first of all it's not\nCheap or to rent it's cheaper to get into right that's\nThe big money is getting more expensive to borrow but it's cheaper to get into a lot of people don't have thirty forty fifty a hundred two hundred thousand dollars laying around to put down on a house to get into all the mortgage would be less\nThey don't have that up front so\nThat's why people are doing it plus a younger generation we've talked about this I talked about this last week and I don't think that it I think we're going to start feeling it in the next\nFive to ten years big time\nWhich is these kids that are getting out of college now they can't afford another payment some of their debt is so massive\nThat they essentially have a mini mortgage payment in some areas of the country a mortgage payment on top\nOf the red they're paying that's why they're moving with mom and dad they got six seven eight hundred dollar month payment they're making for their for their partial their credit card bills that they were living off of and the loans they took out in school and so homeownership in in in the coming years is going to drop tremendously especially new homeownership because these kids don't have\nThe means\nWhere you know\nForty years ago Twenty years ago you sometimes you come out of college you wouldn't have that much debt you put yourself through maybe get a little\nA little money here or there but it wasn't as expensive it is now you come out or you came straight out of high school he went to work and you're able to do to to to get ... you know a little bit of money put together and you bought a home and it was fine because you didn't have that giant dead over you it's not that way now\nAnd what that means going forward is when you look at what drives an economy one of the biggest drivers is people are buying homes water they do when they buy homes\nThey buy stuff for their own and that is something that I think if you're going to see slow down\nA lot in the coming years\nAnd it and you're not going to be able to blame it on its this policy or that policy is the policy is is we back these kids and given them all this money you go to school and settled down with a lot of debt that they thought they needed and you're finding out that really that isn't it true is a lot of people think and now what\nThey can't get rid of that debt it's going to be with them for a long time and it's getting ... a lot of them moving forward into being able to be homeowners and spend the kind of money that real boost the economy\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three actually had bits share is your Twitter\nYou can tweet at us love hearing from you so this I find to be interesting in this day and age as we head towards the mid term so we're midterms what Nineteen days away we're\nAbout Russia were worried about China worried about North Korea Bangladesh all of these things just information all of this stuff I still worry about the this information I I see here on a daily basis when it comes to all of these ads and things like inundated with\nUh when it comes to you know mid terms uh props all of these things so uh what are we to do with trying to make people\nLittle either angry or afraid and they were targeting lots of different communities but but the goal was always the same the more you make people angry or afraid the more you can control them yeah\nYeah and that right there is a and a demo a who is a disinformation researcher talking about Twitter and all of these things that they've released Adam ten million tweets from foreign operators going all the way back two years\nAnd what is it to do well fear\nWe're talking about greed fear deep it's always about voting and emotion it's about a voting and emotion and and I get this now I get people who send me stuff some people send me stuff and they wanted like I'm going to prove a point other people send me stuff and they say stuff like is this true and then I'll have to go\nLook at the website right look at the website and a lotta\nTimes their Web sites that are here in America there are American run websites who have their they have their ideology that they have and they're going to spend something or they're gonna leave out half of the story and that is it that that is frustrating but you have to look at the ... the website how reputable as it who are these is isn't it amazing that it only lines up\nWith the way that you believe because for a lot of us it's about affirmation it's not about information so it was easy to do you pick a few things and I see it all the time when we posted in St and do stuff what what agitated angry people what doesn't it's not hard to tell\nOne of the really striking example just after the San Bernardino shooting in California in December twenty Fifteen most of the trolls posting about the need for the second amendment and and to protect gun rights but some of the trolls posting civil dynasty and using the same hashtags to push for gun control\nBecause they don't get the whole thing is to disrupt people like this they just want to disrupt\nPeople here who want to sell something if you will a about a politician about a prop they're going to tell you half\nA story or bend the truth or in some cases out and out lie because they want you to vote for something here was about a disruption they didn't care if they could just upset the apple cart\nThat's the whole thing and the frustration is there's so many people buy into it and this is where I get frustrated because I look at this and I think\nVery nanny state is they want to turn this into now like Facebook and Twitter and all of these companies are getting together with the government and they're there and they will we need to protect these people look if you're an idiot in a mean happens to invoke such an emotion out of you and I see it out there every single day\nI see it out there and say if you were so upset about a mean or something and your so influenced by that that you write your gullible\nYou're ... if it influences you that much your gullible it's it's it's that's that's just the truth\nWill the accounts tried to do is Moscow grade as real American activists and then engage with three of American activists communities\nAnd they did they didn't know how much influence they have that's a different thing but remember ever it if you study psychology study any of these things it's about voting and emotion because emotions will get you to do I always hearken back\nTo what an emotion can do for somebody when I go back to the fact that ah that the [laughter]\nThat astronaut woman who was so enraged and in love and our motion for that or the other astronaut that left her she drove across country wearing adult diapers had like duct tape and her car her motion was so\nThat to me it's just how do you do on some motion when you can get people to to to not have a conversation\nTo be blinded by something so much so and when I Do my when we do videos and we'd all these kinds of stuff I'll see some people chime in and there are a motion is so strong on some certain things\nIt's it's crazy it really is you take a step back take

now destroying you and your now everybody's apparently the old writes favorite person in the world and I'm sure today I'll be labeled All right because of this but I Love to have any on man so tell us a bit about the walk away campaign\nRight so the ... campaign it started as a testimonial campaign on Facebook on may twenty sixth of two thousand ... this year\nAnd a it began with me releasing a video on may twenty six telling all of the reasons why I was walking away from liberalism and the Democratic party and I encourage other people to make video testimonials and explaining why they were doing the same thing because I knew I was certainly not the only person who was feeling this way\nAnd that was sort of the genesis of it but it you know I I also encourage people from the very beginning of those on the right to uh also make\nTheir testimonials and kind of reclaimed the narrative of what it means to be a conservative or Republican which has been\nLargely hijacked by the liberal media who loves to label these people they get some help out just to be able to make their videos and tell the truth about who they are and why they're conservative and why that label that's been slapped on them is not true\nAnd it's been really really incredible campaign so you know what it's funny 'cause I've I've I've watched some of the stuff and the evolution of of the way that you've done this because\nHere you are I mean again you're you're a liberal you know it may be a ... year against racism you're against any of the things that I think all human beings should be against the ridiculous ... of bigotry and and stuff like that\nAnd yet at some point in time there had to be some moment where you're taught yourself you know I I'm not a this this isn't really really what I jibe with over here on the left they somehow have lost the plot\nRight well that it happened I mean that ... miles an hour or so yeah the circle of ... will quarter was up ... ... ... or ... because ... ... ... of\nFriends were liberals I live in New York City which is a very liberal city so it's easy I think for any of us would no matter if you're on the left or the writer or whatever to kind of start you know existing in your own little bubble and that bubble becomes your world and that and your world view as kind of shaped within that bubble so I didn't have a language to understand what was happening I now understand that what I was\nA reacting negatively to was identity politics\nA political correctness and you know the I think oppressive nature of those things you know how it forces censorship it forces division it it it it you know it keeps us\nDivided and not United and but I didn't understand it I thought that this was something that was sweeping kind of humanity a large and when I started to hear\nThe the the language changing and I was talking about privilege and victimhood in a high ... patriarchy hierarchy and you know and ... male privilege and gay privilege and I was just like what the hell is happening like\nIt was bothering me so much for so many years that I Would push back against that even as a liberal I was pushing back against this when people would I mean it's just like zombies people started to just adopt these positions in this language and yelling everyday conversations would become about well you wouldn't understand as a straight white male but I\nJust you know black woman goes out so it's like how do you know how do you know but um it it kind of started there but I thought this was something that was happening to everyone it wasn't until later that I discovered this was liberalism this is what liberalism does to people spraying\nYeah yeah well you know I look at it like to just do this this progressive movements crazy right Brandon so ... I I look at this and I think to myself you know if you go back and look what real liberal as a person who's a traditional liberal who\nIs about the individuals about liberty and rights and stuff and compared to what what's been hijacked and I both sides have had their their messaging hijacked and it's insane because\nWe live in a world where like I call ourselves you were the middle because we go I Want everybody man gay straight black white I Want I Want the person who who was an atheist not what the person who's a devout believer I Want a person who's willing to vote both Democrat and Republican if the right thing it it is there for them\nWhat I don't want is I don't want to be an an echo chamber and an e you push back in the echo chamber are you finding now that people who your friends are coming out saying look you know what I kind of believe like a lot of what you're doing\nHere because some of it is and there were ... before until somebody made a stand\n[noise] um I don't know that that has happened too much yet in terms of ... you're you're asking have I had friends turn around is that your question no not really I I Do think that that's going to happen in time there is that this is um\n[noise] it's really interesting what happened to me and I and I do think that\nI Do believe that there is something happening in this country right now people want to call it God if they want to call it whatever they want to call it but there is no way cunning that's happening and I I think was chosen to be a part of this awakening\nJust like Donald Trump I think it was chosen to be a part of this awakening but it's you know I Can't really explain why\nI why I got it in and other people have not yet gotten it but I Believe that people will I Believe that in time almost all of my friends who have turned their backs on me or you know who just completely can't understand what I'm doing\nA so they've stopped talking to me I Know that in time most of them will get it and they'll come back to me and they'll say I I totally understand what you're doing so I'm just like patiently waiting for when that day comes but uh it hasn't happened yet\nYeah it's it's crazy talking to a brand new striker who's the uh uh well you should the founder of the camp ... walk away campaign and\nAnd you know ... ... in the intellectual dark Web rights being able to sit across and have conversations with people without looking at somebody and seeing the evil because they don't believe my ideology or where we used to have this thing where I may not agree with you and stuff but we could still part of his friends now it's I don't even want to know anything about what you believe anymore and\nI and I don't know about you brand I always look at everything and say the most diverse place in thing in the world that you can have is your mind and anymore it's not about that it's about either you believe what I Believe or I Want nothing to do with you and that is not a country I Want to limit\nNo it's not and\nI I it's it's so strange to me watching again I if I use that term zombie is earlier but it's like I've seen people who I think they probably once upon a time not so long ago word normal\nAnd they're just\nThey're ... it's like invasion of the body Snatchers you know it's like I I see videos all the time because you know I think things are getting worse and worse the closer we are getting to the terms uh is is not helping but you know I'm seeing videos every day of people on the left just becoming completely unhinged and going bananas ah and\nAnd almost every time it's not even based also something that's really actually truly legitimately happening it's something that the media has told them is happening which isn't true and then they're going absolutely I mean they're they're losing their minds\nAnd and it's very strange I I mean I I feel I probably shouldn't say this but it's it's the truth that's how I feel and I'm all about telling the truth
