Obamacare [laughter] yeah but but uh you know they they got hit heavy what you have here is\nYou have a president that his his approval numbers are higher now than when he started wasn't the case for Obama you have a his approval numbers are going up you have a United Republican Party which you didn't even have a month and a half ago you did not have they were putting them or you're not a Republican Party\nBefore the the Kavanaugh hearings for the most part\nAre you have a United Republican Party and it's not because they love Trump or the Republican Party so much especially the never Trump hers what they have\nSeen is they have seen the Democrats and they have finally come to the realization that oh\nThey're really bad yeah\nYeah you know don't really they don't believe in in the end and due process you know and things like that so you you've got that going on right now but you also have very strong economy\nYou have an economy that's pulling extremely well in in a in some cases are better than in recent any recent time ah people extremely optimistic about the the uh the the the economy we sit back in twenty sixteen when somebody call up and said you guys are going to be surprised when\nTrump wins and we should actually know he should win just because of the economy alone based on elections of of of the past and ah so you you have that and\nThen when I called the Trump Card and you\nHave this and I don't know how this is going to affect the election but you couldn't pick of the worst time you and I were talking about the conspiracy theories we heard about the caravan coming in from Central America you know crushing or you know a crossing and crushing the southern border of Mexico to come in\nGetting by all the police the hundreds of police\nThat were set up to block the caravan which now some reports yesterday's say\nIs ten thousand illegal immigrants heading to crash into the U.S border\n\nIn the next couple of weeks and we hear is this just sorrow SARS is funding as the Democrats are funding is they're doing this in order to destroy Trump in the mid term election\nI went really um I think the effect might be the opposite\nOf that there has to look at who who's going to get the benefit if there's anything that can put the funding back on the table in terms of a real discussion a politically for the wall then it's something like that but but but even before we get there we talk about the motivator\nWe look at the national polls on illegal immigration\nThe people by and large stand with the president on there they may not it it starts to break down a little bit more when when you talk about wall but illegal immigration a and sanctuary cities and everything else the people by and large stand with the president not only that\nBut I've heard that the Democrats are jumping on the I mean there there are the Democrats are jumping on the caravan and thinking it's to their advantage right and and also they're jumping on the the whole voter id thing right voter suppression by having voter id will the vast majority of Americans agree with that so Democrats were actually looking at this\nSome Democrats are looking at the caravan and the you know the the voter id as this is something that can push him over the finish line in two weeks and I'm sitting here thinking to myself this is bizarre as Elizabeth Warren coming out with her fractions [laughter] with her ethnic fractions last week [laughter]\nOh by the way in in in other news we want to make sure that we cover everything yeah ah Elizabeth Warren said she changed her mind and took a DNA test proving her heritage\nBecause Americans trust in government is that an all time low and she wants to rebuild it yeah\nShe said she changed her mind and the incumbent or spoke at her second debate against Republican state\nA representative Jeff deal in the U.S Senate race she was asked by the moderator why she had said in March that no DNA tests was needed to prove that she had some Native American heritage she said she ultimately took the test reporting the result late last week that showed\nA relative six to ten generations ago was Native American huh ultimately she said she took the DNA test because she believes one way to rebuild trust in government\nIs too is by posting her full family history on line so anybody can take a look yeah deal shot back to the issue is not about whether senators weren't ancestry it's about the integrity\nIn my mind and I don't care whether you think you benefited or not from that claim it's the fact that you tried to benefit from that claim and I think it bothers a lot of other people and it's something you haven't been able to put to rest since the twenty twelve campaign when she first mentioned having\nNative American heritage that led president Donald Trump to start start mocking her ... he had it I don't care what percentage she claims to be Native American I just care that I'm One hundred percent from Massachusetts and will be working for the people of that state and but still it was bizarre that she decided to do that you and I were on vacation but I really sat there and went\nReally really I mean and it was it was southern proactive and deliver it and then the results [noise] she thought beyond that just ... not just checking it out but then taking the results and proving something with it\nI'm a corrections throughout the morning while the Boston Globe I'm like yeah this is bizarre bizarre things are just thinking about this is the the really the three things that that uh the social justice warriors\nThat was driving them crazy first is cultural appropriation wiped operating might cultures yeah\nWhich you know what ... what do you mean\nWell the yeah the Cherokee Nation came out and said look we you know we can't stand by her claims based on this test because this DNA tests doesn't assign you know doesn't tell us which nation\nYou may have belong to an end the ... the the other one was the accusation of that's the ultimate and white privilege\nBreaking a fraction like that and claiming\nThat that you are now Native American the euro minority right wow well that's the ultimate an eagle when white privilege ego yes and arrogance I saw that one that a burst out laughing and the other one was wait a minute we thought you could be whatever you wanted to be whatever you want it whenever you wanted to be it why did you need a fraction\nRight but at least Americans got a math exam last week yes we're we're good at fractions and got into decimal points and everything else I was quite impressed they're learning at the Boston Globe but but they're going to ... [laughter] it's like the red eye\nAmericans are still eating out more at restaurants fast food establishment and businesses according to the latest consumer price index\nIt is pretty typical increase that point you first that if you look back at the uh my mom we typically see that in fact ... well that was from August September\nWith us da ... Amri Coons noting the food away from home index increasing year over year by two point six percent\nEspecially if we look back at the last couple of years where you're over here we are paying less for groceries what we think restaurant prices increase and one of the reasons we started with the the different oh just has to do with the cost structure a loan for foods at a restaurant or will tank or food at the grocery store\nTranslation restaurant at fast food customers are paying more for overhead costs like labor and service\nAnd typically them I mean the increase at a pretty steady right near the air\nA broadband reporting for the U.S department of agriculture in Washington DC\nThe USDA report is sponsored by ... wrote master XL premium highway diesel fuel and shell roads hallowed\nFuck it with our radio with a record theory McNamara [noise]\nDish HDTV keeping you connected coast it goes from the comfort of your gab find out more just remind drug ... for my truck dot Gov\nThere's no doubt increasing productivity and efficiently as important to you make sure you're illegals of his promise not just compliant simplifying or operation\nOn the tracks dot com or red eye radio show dot com forward slash ...\nWas on\nPeople see the products farmers harvest the fruits and vegetables this year's made of cotton with them and I'm thinking about the farmers themselves and now they're really harvest so much more the hard\nWorking men and women and provide for their families and ours [noise] people keep industry is going to\nOn their passion from generation to generation\nFor your commitment you're\nWatching the show are telling the engine oil to work as hard as you\nMentioned drivers here's the deal is a new tractors excellent wages what other say company the health care premiums they legally home times finishing up your CDL how about a career right out of school so fashionable training and reimburse tuition joined\nThe other six thousand drivers who choose to drive in Holland you work hard for us to take care of you for more information visit careers ... regional dot com or call\nA fourth or fifth one seven [laughter]\nGet on board with a holiday we made the next day at a\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most rent trucking newsman [noise]\nNow every week we watch me and my co host Jessica Rose as we bring you the only weekly news show breed of just joined us brawl the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile\nThat trucker dot com is the one from not you're not going to want to have them busy travel down the highway in tune in every week and watch the trucker news channel my going to the front runner dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nWe\nUse every every early and get reminded them on the radio [noise] all across America\nA six six Ninety run I he's are currently I'm Gary McNamara so ... uh when I was young we didn't have computers was young we didn't have your inner webs in your\nGoogle and [laughter] and our computers went down completely yeah and a half hour of I mean it just everything dead yeah like we're already because look at it right here ... have also looked hard copy oh I just want to have a smartphone I've got a smartphone to work on our part we were doing the show on our smartphones\nAnd the hard copy of that even though it's a pain in the butt to do before every show ... when the computer goes you're really needed at that point if you had to reference back because you haven't bookmark everything necessarily on right\nOn my phone ... the the ... are getting cool now especially well for anything right it depends on what you do for a living but it pretty much any\nIndustry there's there there are so many out so I guess that that can help you do what you do for a living and for us it's of course\nAbout the news and the events and all of that and there were some really cool apps out there ah that that kind of you know bring you some stories and I I think do a really good job a Wall Street journal and and some of the others\nAre that have been really good and I rely more on my phone that I Do my ...
