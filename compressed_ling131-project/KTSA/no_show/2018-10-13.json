Trump really wants to this deal done because the way he looks at this deal is it's going to get done with us or it's going to get done with somebody else\nRight like it's going to get did with us or the Russians are going to have a chance to do to get this done\nI don't like the concept of stopping and investment of a hundred and ten billion dollars into the United states because you know what they're going to do they're going to take that money and spend it or Russia or China or someplace else\n... ah but in saying that you have senators on both sides of the aisle coming out and saying yeah we may put an end to this deal or because we need to know what's up with this guy where is the what happened because some of the footage you looked like there was like a hit squad coming after this guy like these and and just disappear\nWith the exception of Israel\nTrust 'em [noise]\nEveryone else in the middle east\nAbout as much as I trust gas stations stations sushi\n[laughter] that is

it just right we want to have a relationship with Saudi Arabia there is to teach your partner\n...\nHelping us on on terrorists\nYeah and at the same time\nYou can't have something like this you can't have somebody disappear\nAnd there is a real sense that this thing could blow up in this entire deal and the question is why where is the what happened to this guy\nI can understand why me cautious but um I Do think that uh over the next several days it's likely that that a tenor will change a little bit\nWe'll see we'll see but the the thought process is that they may put an end to it it's another one of those I mean the last couple of weeks we've seen what we had the Interpol guy right now this is it's very bizarre and they just disappear and what happened what took place where\nDid they take him I mean going into an embassy and then boom gone\n\nWhat happens it's a hundred and ten billion dollar deal that they kill somebody else is going to get I tell people that are going he\nA huge human life more I mean he values money more than a human life we're not talking I mean this is a this is a\nMassive deal for a lot of people whose lives depend on this kind of stuff but Saudi Arabia let's be real we like them because they have the Iranians that's it they ... they had the Iranians that's why we like them\nThat's it\nHow many of the appeal of Nineteen remember that remember remember nine eleven remember that remember all of them how many of them were from Saudi Arabia there are some issues here absolutely\nBut\nTrump's looking at it in a different way of saying well you know what it sounds horrible we need to figure this entire thing out we've got to start figuring this thing out and saying that the the hundred and ten million dollars that's that's a lot of money can be coming to the United states and they're going to spend it and there may spend it with somebody else and those those those people are going to get the money\nChina or Russia and what are they going to do it\n\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three actually I've been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you so a very interesting\nThe the whole question of the day is one of third parties you know when I saw one today you know you've got ... in there and he's doing his Kanye stuff 'cause that's what ... does and it was interesting was holding court\nUh but my question is you know why can't we talked to one of the civility gone and we're going to dig deeper into a little bit later but we need a solid\n\nThird party and here's the thing that's something I talked about before when it comes to authorities we don't need a third party that's equal you\nCan make a lot of noise being strong and small meaning if you took twenty seats thirty seats in the house maybe five or six seats in the Senate right you take anywhere between you know you've got intend to Fifteen Percent\nYou can do a lot of things\nYou can\nYou can do a lot of things and I think we need a real party and I'm Talking about the Green Party right well Jill Stein I'm not talking about Gary Johnson because\nGod that he just it was awful could just admitted right like can we right\nI'm not talking about ... insane although everyday film last and he's like you know she just wants to talk about it going that's why he's running for president block\nJade and said I'm Talking about what I'm Talking about somebody and the party that is real but I think could it\nYou know can see all sides and is there more for the most of the times I think the referee and the rain I'm In\nThe mature party will call [laughter]\n[noise] what do you think though would you be open it could you be open to a third party\nThat's not insane that's not crazy but a real party fifty percent of you so far so yes I can four percent say nope forty six percent says depend on the politics and I think the politics would be very much an independent minded look at things and so let's just say let's let's break this down how this would work\nSo you've got a party that is somewhat in power right that has the most you can get a plurality just you're right but you've got a party that's got then you've got another party there so the Republicans Democrats one of those we've got the most seats the second seats is gonna be the other one the third\nHe's the one that's going to be swayed because you know those two can't stand each other and the right now it's worse than ever before so it ends up happening is they're gonna have to come to you to get stuff done\nAnd if you're able to say look I understand what you're doing there and I agree with this this and this but you know what if you want to vote you got to get rid of this you gotta get rid of this you got to get rid of this because I see it from their side too so it is a way to move things through and that might be the best way to break the gridlock\nAnd ... on\nA new hey it's the talk I talked to one stuck in traffic me catch on skipping a when he

them at all or or or ...\nRight and you could show charts about how people you know when you look at the hate how they have since Reagan Democrats have hated Republicans since Reagan and how they've far they looked at the other side is evil\nAnd only the last two years has it got to the point where Republicans is that you know if you think we're evil it maybe you're evil\nAnd it's on which is not a good thing that's not a way to do improve dialogue or help the country when you look at the other side and first of all there is another side and secondly you don't even look at them anymore because we're still tribal as\nPeople you look at them as deep and that is it good\nMichelle always this job are all over New York says that you know when they go low number [laughter] they go low we can [laughter]\n\nOh so that's what happened so now that that that's just it that's kick him because Michelle Obama says stuff like that\nI Know our motto is when they go low we go high that you\nRemember that right yeah that's like you said that's a ... you know that's what Michele say is that is what Michel says\nBut this is a new Democratic Party a Democratic Party that wants to get in your face the Democratic party that ... says now you got to be loud you've got to be your face you got to attack them you can't give it up Maxine Waters you go to their homes you do what do you ... you you have to do whatever it is you do because in the end of the ends justify the means\nThat was his new democratic running\nAround in the middle of the Democrats really fight I mean I use the Democratic party\nThere you go that's what I got no I I got no problem with fighting for the ideas of that\nRight none but if your ideas you know what we're just basically going to run a chicken\nAnd that's our new thing that that to me is an issue that's not civility that we need that's now I don't like it when Republicans go low I think it's ridiculous\nAnd I'm going to say the same thing about the Democrats when you're going to go low and this is what you want what does this say to everybody else right what does this say to everybody else I watch them civility back in there we're not always going to agree on stuff\nNot always sometimes we will\nSometimes we're gonna find real common ground on things that are going to be good for everybody\nAnd in fact in many ways there's a lot of things that we want to do in politics that both sides agree on the problem is the process what's the process to get us to this point but\nNow when we stopped looking at each other as you're just a person that has different beliefs but he said you look over and say your the enemy that doesn't help any conversation\nWhen I hear holder and make it as safe as like a made today I think it's a disgrace and ... she just says they can get it she never did she never will and that's why she lost the election well\nHe's right about that she doesn't get it but it is a disgrace to say something like that you're the former attorney general your whole it was so low\nIt's that old or ... what's the untouchable movie\nYou know when they put one of them in the hospital you put one of them in the ... it's that kind of attitude that they think that they should\nUh go after and and an end to me I I hear more and more of it they ratcheted up this past this entire fight with Kavanaugh was ratcheted up thing where you could see it\nWhen we lost the civil the civility\nAmongst each other to have conversations have even a conversation about something now everything is a debate everything is a fight you show up ready to fight and I I I didn't like that and I don't like that I don't think that does any good\nYou know Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high here's my view of the Democratic party regarding Kavanaugh going lower to step up for you you and that got her\n[laughter] I don't know if that's right either but I get what he's trying to do but Mr older you're not even saying let's pretend to go you're not even said let's get on the moral high ground you're saying let's throw down you want to get dirty huh let's get dirty you brought a you brought a knife to a gunfight\nOr keep it up give it up Mr holder keep saying that you're going to you know you keep doing what you see how the American people like this this is the number one issue I think for American November steam grill or what they did to Brett Kavanaugh do believe that what they did was OK to believe it was okay vote Democrat if he thought it was despicable vote for us\nYeah or better yet maybe step back and say I'm not quite sure what a vote for anybody based on the way that I see these attitudes that are coming out here and I find it to be ridiculous I Do I find it absolutely to be ridiculous and\nWe're getting more and more and more and more and more\nAnd we're hearing things more and more from ... from Democrats like the Maxine was like the Cory bookers\nGoes to the hill today [laughter]\nEnd up in the face of from Congress people and\nPeople like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but what he doesn't realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face when I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violent\nHe's right this coming from a guy who was attacked by his neighbor right he was attacked by its neighbor and also there was that incident at the baseball game you remember that\nThe guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shocked [laughter] ... who's almost go he was showing this is for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging that volunteers ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to resolve things\nNo it's not but that is I think what we're headed to and Rand Paul's right\nBoth sides need to take it down a notch I'm looking at the Republicans I'm looking at the Democrats we've got to have some civility and the fight that they think they're taking on you understand it for a lot of them and we've talked about this before here\nWhich is you go on these shows and you you scream and yell at each other in the back a green room there you're talking about hey what are you doing this weekend as your kids you know the whole nine yards the problem is not everybody buys into that\nA lot of them they take it seriously a lot of them look at this WWE Shakespearean kind of cedar that's going on with politics and they buy into it and they take it seriously and I'm starting to think that more and more of these people\n\nAnd I'm not talking about the the average person I'm Talking to more of the more the people that represent us are starting to drink their own Kool Aid and are more than just rabble rousing their bases that they're starting to
