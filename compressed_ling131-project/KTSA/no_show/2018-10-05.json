all getting old\nAnd she's just like seven years younger than me see I I thought she was okay well I mean we just added it up but then I it it hit me\nYeah well you know ... you know how crazy it is getting\nAnd I'm going to play this because I promised earlier we got off in another tangent after you know the the the news of\nThe Republicans are you know releasing the summary of the the three ... and and what who the FBI investigated and it all makes sense because you know as they said remembers one interview twenty or thirty or forty different people will be up yeah I said who has direct knowledge of this happening not hearsay\nNot somebody who will say well yeah I heard her talking about his sexual assault who\nWas there tell us who was there right\nWhat are your witnesses to the statue will interview\nHere say doesn't matter here where did you investigation\nUh you know here say doesn't matter who are the people that had direct knowledge that she could have given twenty people and so they all direct knowledge she gave them for\n... ... a three willing to talk to him all apparently denied a at any knowledge of knowing anything about it and a fourth one used to talk to the FBI that was on ...\nOn a on forward we we told you that they interviewed everybody that she had stayed mhm she stated nobody knew and so they re interviewed all the people again just to make sure and a few new people no direct cooperation about anything right right so there's a we are but I Want to play this you're from\nA Tucker Carlson on a with a fires secured the American civil liberties union national political director\nThey put out an ad where they had the Kavanaugh side by side with Bill Cosby\nYeah it's a terrible swam to reset and let's put it this way any it'd be a show you ran that ad against a private citizen they'd be sued for millions of dollars a there is no even\n\nThey're not even trying to hide anymore that they're not about civil liberties that but don't believe in the presumption of innocence but\nI just want to play a part of the interview the back and forth because it gets to the point of being insane remember the American civil liberties union what are the what why were they created\nTo defend people's individual rights to protect people that have been wrongly accused not just wrongly convicted wrongly accused\nBut the presumption of innocence is always the ... the number one thing that evidence is what determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to exist to protect people's civil liberties their their civil rights here's part of the back and forth\nThis is a disgusting at obviously but what's so distressing is the new ran it because this is guilt by association the very thing the ACLU milk police stood against during for instance the blacklist period Bill Cosby and capital have nothing in common than you and your twin them\nIn order to discredit capping off how could you do that has ... to appreciate your\nComments Tucker that the common thread here courses powerful men whose careers are on the line issuing denials about sexual wrongdoing and innocence and can simply believe that the denial issued by Brett Kavanaugh goes right to integrity [noise]\nA position that he's applying foreign stuff on the Supreme Court in what she said and judgment of the rest of the nation integrity is the critical importance the most important thing we have no doubt about it has on that\nGreat I I agree and I I Would never arguing against the importance of integrity but Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes in court\nAnd we all know that's the one that the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like you once defended Brett Kavanaugh has not been so telling them together is by definition guilt by association and unfair do you think that the person you're positioned Twenty years ago would have seen that\nTucker this isn't a civil or criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job for us that's meant\nAnd when I'm making the standard of proof here it's not a brief beyond a reasonable doubt so then why didn't you for the next to Bill Cosby who has been tried in ... he is not entitled to the presumption of innocence ... assume that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job I'm Sorry I I'm I'm not actually rebelled on I'm not arguing that I'm asking you why you put them next to a man who was tried in court and convicted of felonies and sentenced to\nPrison because that one of the hands on any of those things that individual also denied the accusations I think he would appreciate soccer network criticizing people on the left and I don't care about the left and right I care about the participants to make the country was when she wants to end it and now you you're an eight on subtle lands and\nSexual assault has to be taken very seriously haired talker and I think that we're often crowding out the voices of women and believing that man\nAnd not believing women in this case this woman came forward and they're not around certain circumstances here ... years ... hold on your the ACLU\nYou've don't believe in collective judgment or collective punishment and we've had in mind
