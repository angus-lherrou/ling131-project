... and then when the grand jury\nWhen they when they had the people who are testifying before the grand jury and I was reading their testimonies I couldn't even get there is some of them\n... and ... it was so heavy and so I have a lot of respect for the people who came together\nTo put together this movie that is coming out on October twelve guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer because they were working from actual facts from what was happening in this case and it's horrifying enough\nJust to glimpses that you get out of it\nBut you know they had to really roll up their sleeves and get into it and I God love him for that joining me right now is international\nFilm and TV star Peabody Award winner Nick ... who directed this really horrifying film Nick welcome to the show\nAnd thank you so much for getting my introduction right now so many people\nThey know not everybody is as good as we are we we really take care of our people here that's the way how it works\nBy the way congratulations on this film out a really fantastic cast of media dean king Janine Turner ... ... and obviously you uh directing that this how hard was this for you to do because I Know everybody I think most everybody you know we caught him up and most everybody remembers this awful horror this horrifying story\nHow difficult was this for you to to tackle as a director because this is some really heavy stuff\nYou know um when we started working on the script eh we all kind of agreed that what we needed to do was just tell the truth about this and not try to surmise about it at all because the facts of the case you're so horrific Internet cells\nThat we didn't really need to offer our opinion about it so that's really how we approach it we approached it just like we were telling a true crime story and just ... get killer happened to be an abortion doctor who was killing babies after they were born and it was it's very ... subject matter that the movie itself\nIt costs about the genetic catching him and convicting him\nIt's strangely uplifting in a way it's not and gory and it's not disgusting it it's actually a day test screenings and people people really love the ...\nAnd that's a lot of talent to be able to to to do to do that and and I know that\nYou know reading some of the testimonies and I know that this is you know you showcased this aspect of it in the film of some of these women who you know they had never been pushed to speak out about what was it about this stuff until some of the more horrific things happen and they were really brave and and that they were speaking out but just the abuses that this guy\nIn this in his clinic I mean it's horrifying and I love how you said the facts are bad enough that they can speak for themselves I mean that there isn't there really isn't any room for pontificated in this film because he is such a his evil is such a president in this film\nI'm at ... how it can be a little bit too 'cause it's I Know this was it was a labor of love for everybody who was involved and it took awhile for this film to come together\nUm what what did you find to be the most challenging aspect\nOf putting a real life story about a topic that is normally not accurately portrayed and not honestly discussed by Hollywood and pop culture what was the biggest challenges you ran across you know it's interesting in into bringing us to live\nIn a while the the most challenging aspect of it really was a wake up against the story that that it would it would still be accessible to a wider audience I mean\nWe came out of the movie with a PG Thirteen waiting which is run yeah to get all along and and the way that we did get was by\nNot only sticking to the facts as as much as we could put them together cause you have to rearrange something and you have to combine some characters in order to make the movie but there's not as much of the truth of what happened in the courtroom and what\nHappened in the best ... in the film dishes truthfully as we could make it\nAnd you know the challenge of a ... making sure that you told people about the uh the really horrific details and you didn't rub it in their face you didn't shock them with the the actual gory\nA visual images and I think we accomplish that you know quite well everybody that she's in movies\nYou know we've been doing a lot of testing is a decade and they always talk at new grateful that we don't read these images in your face and just let the horror of what his name did play in the theater right\nI Know in the beginning of this um and and\nWe're talking with next year see him you know from from justified and uh so many other so many other films and and now his new film that he's directing guys now I had read\nUm this is some time ago how initially um the film ... this this film was blocked by the trial judge because he didn't like\nHow he was portrayed he had been called like one of the most corrupt ah has hit the hit Philadelphia was one of the most corrupt government and he was mad about that he was mad about his portrayal and are you at the apparently got through that\nWell actually he you know he hadn't seen the film he was he was really talking about the book and just assuming that whatever characterizations he didn't like in the book was in the film and in the film I mean there's not portrayed as the bad guy at all just sort of changes she's staying there overruled [laughter]\nPretty rural it's not right we don't we don't\nReally go after the judge and the movie at all so I think they must have cleared up the next understanding uh because uh that all the way so\nYeah uh that's that's that's awesome you have ... he's a he's a detective who's running this down and really working detective James he he's he's running us down bringing us bringing a sky to justice how did you come to how did you come to get this cast together for the ...\nYou know we had a great casting director of LA scene a sunny bowling and Ned Mormon who who\nGot to put the cash together but some of it was also you know people that we did you know a new thing and uh we we talk to him about doing it and uh the actor who plays guys nail in the film was an old old friend of mine and Earl villains who is just terrific in the movie I mean everybody comments on\nJust chilling and\nAnd you know in a strange way how entertaining his performance kids he's he's really really terrific and a chair again Morris was somebody that we sound you're actually process and she's basically turning it in the film\nAnd
