[laughter] well let me just a thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline center the comeback you know over the uh the Redskins this past weekend and then you know I couldn't get it done but I I I I think of again the bigger picture of the fact that\nIt's not just the protests driving the people what you you you've got two big things to overcome right\nYou got to bring back the people who left because of the protest but you got to bring people back\nWho left because they they're watching other things because they're doing other things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion is you've got to create new excitement in the NFL\nNot just in the whole protest thing you've got to create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the are used in a lot of the movement to digital and and we ended up in common is going to be more of that and the and then in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is right so you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's online than that's where you're\nGonna find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game\nBut that's something nobody is focusing on right now because they can't get through you know this is even if it's just a handful of players\nIf it's making the news it's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football\nBut you can't get there because these stories still make the news\nThat's the you know it's it's like the left\nYou look at a uh a war and and oh Casio Cortez\nThey don't represent the majority of the uh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party if they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side as a result\nOf it is a ... ... was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi four seats and and you know we've got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else\nAnd who else said that a couple of others have said that um but they can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrats if you could they would still be far left but getting away from you know the identity politics or whatever it is that's driving the far far left\nWell where where do you a moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making the social media or that's not where the interest is by the mainstream\nMedia it's boring so\nIt's you know this this is this is all you know part of well\nAnd I mean really scrambled equation and what you see here's what you see happening and then ... in in the Democratic party where you have victims and the oppressors and ...\nAnd as we have said that set the identity politics you continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become a greater or you know we've seen it a ... look ... last week you saw the most of the cycling though the women's cycling a champion you know the the the the mail one the biological mail one and\nThe female came out and said it was the the two females that are are one of the females that came in\nLike third place she goes ... this is ridiculous this was a male right\nAnd he has gone crazy stating the bigotry and the intolerance and right and and and and and all that because I Know you're a you know you're a man\nYou're not a woman so that's the debate that goes on and so as we said the feminist up today the ... the old time feminist wish to protest is the new time that the new feminist do not want to protest is but you destroy feminism as\nAll along the feminist had now become the oppressors thinking about this did you ever think that the feminist would become the oppressors of liberals right now the feminist the feminist movement this is how insane it is and what you have here is in the in the NFL you're Vera greed\nYou know a Malcolm you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed\nThat okay uh the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to get money to\nTo help make racism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore mhm well now he is viewed by air agreed and camper Nick as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist\nRight he's a sellout right because the whole the the real thing is with the ... or a read\nThey don't want a deal no they want to be able to scream oppression so so the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here\nIn the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive\nThe victims were\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that\nThey will negotiate to try to make things better\nAnd the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant and they want\nThis constant that debate out there they want to be able to cry racism day in and day out and the fact that it's never going to be styled because it can't be solved once it's solved or once you get to where most people believe society is today or racism is not a factor like it was\nFifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago\nThey have to insist that it's actually worse than it's ever been or they lose their purpose or purpose has gone they can't say that things are getting better and so boom it's going to blow up\nAnd a significant portion of the NFL or blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes we believe are good causes\nNow they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens\nIs what's happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL we've been saying it\nFor years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing with you nearly with you as the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow and that's what's happening now Malcolm Jenkins is a sellout right I'm\nSure you know ... whatever other labels and want to throw at them but a

to get somebody to get a few people say that's fake news\nUh I've a feeling that that is more ... from from what I could perceive ... from the anger of the the people stating that the NBC story was fake news and I do believe they are more on the left\nAnd pop and and this this was the ... because we as the question right is this fake news because NBC reporting that a ... you know the ... more Republicans are are going out to vote in early voting or in the the eight states that uh they have looked at seven other states with\nA I mean basically toss up ... ... or a toss up or close up the Senate races out there that the Republicans lead only one state Nevada\nDo what the Democrats or a leader at the at the moment and we've talked about you know what might be influencing this election and we know that the whole cabinet thing is we when we it's more than just a Supreme Court justice it's it's about everything\nThat was surrounding that it's it's from the ... you know the the uh non belief in\nA in a in instability it's about the non belief\nIn due process under the law it's clearly where it it what has come out of this that the left doesn't believe that the Senate should exist anymore that the electoral college should go away\nAnd it's something that we have set for the longest time and I wondered because we've been saying this for years\nAnd it really started out with the whole it it started out with the whole free speech the first amendment issue\nWhen it came to and this goes back what ten Fifteen Years ago a about a well corporations in groups don't have free speech free speech is only for the individual and we said it's ridiculous\nAnd then we got to the whole thing the the whole member of the slogan corporations aren't people by the way I got that I saw that the other day somebody actually use that the other day I thought that had died out\nBut that's still out there well of course\nThat's as we said if you're going to make that argument then nobody should ever able nobody should ever be able to protest our property taxes because property isn't a person\nWell of course but people pay the property taxes and corporations are made up of people and those people in corporations have just as many free speech rights as anybody else not involved in a corporation which is why a corporation\nIs a set of rules and regulations set up by the government to regulate business you don't lose\nYour free speech rights because you want to enter into a a a a government policy right you don't lose your free speech rights\nOr you know because of it and so it's an easy argument to to dissipate but we said back then we send them when that started coming out with so they really don't believe in free speech they believe in free speech because they do business has been negative businesses wrong that's their argument businesses evil therefore evil people shouldn't have free speech rights\nAnd and so we you know and it's not a pop but back then it wasn't a popular opinion\nOh no I mean we were ... for that but what do you mean corporation yeah people in ... you may not like it but yeah people well why should why should they have it because their goal is to make money\nEnd of the matter what their goal is are are they stealing or ah right they still have for money right a\nBuddy thrown in jail colonial because it was it was it was coupled [laughter]\n[laughter] it's real bad you know [laughter] but the but the thing is is that um the the\nIt was it was part of the whole well there's too much money in politics\nOr oh who's the guy that was on I'm used to be on CNBC then he went over to MSNBC or Dylan Ratigan\nYou know that was his ... and he had had the fake anger thing going on but we said look breakfast out of work to do it you know what I'll break it down to two words\nCasio Cortez\nShe spent next to nothing compared\nTo her opponent Hillary want Hillary didn't win right\nBut I Know but nobody in the ... really has complained about money in politics right since ... Hillary's it was funny 'cause some I saw that on social media somebody said Trump won because of the money in that said ah\nHillary raise more money and then they just shut up they were quiet life right a look at look at ah look Democrats don't complain about money and politics and if they're raising the money you see that in the exact no nobody's complaining about not I have not heard one Democrat\nCome out and say it's just wrong that Robert Francis O'Rourke is raising on precedent that money for it right now in fact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea to have sons is a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was McCain's ah but you know that was McCain fined gold and and that's when the rules and regulations came out as two groups of people that\nCouldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within most at sixty days of of an election I Believe ... sixty this within an election because it might influence an election right well that's the only reason you're running ads if to influence an election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election\nAnd at that point we just said do these people understand\nHow the country was formed do they understand about the partition of government for redress of grievances irrespective of who that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand it so we said this spat going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen an ... maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago when you and I got together and I know we were saying that beforehand\n... but it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't believe in the second amendment and so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe\nIn these major tenants of the constitution of the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right\nAnd now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in the the bad well the who wants it came out said that the president's seat was adequate yeah that was a few weeks ago was that that was Michael Moore was Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same thought it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially the\nThe office of the president of the United states you know it's over this is you know it's it's now gone it's\nAnd then someone in that same period said we we need to do away with the presidency altogether right and so but we've heard the electoral college just to go now it's the Senate that has to go right that's being picked up by more on the left every single day if you go to social media oh it's just not fair of a sudden it needs to go\nA Senate needs to go to and as we've said that is extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which

how the majority of people look at it but they have to use it\nThey have to you that that's more Raj of an opinion comes from the left well the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians or your you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I'd never met one conservative\nWhen it comes to a legal immigration that say well now let's let all the ... all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America right over that no\nMy biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's not only the only argument that they have is race so that's the only argument that they can use that can't defend it right the McCain got into sanctuary cities you see how quiet they got ... they got quite because they understand what the the one thing that I think even though\nThe the\nPeople in the media understand is that those in power in the Democratic party actually do believe in open borders that's what they want they want open they won't reject open borders\nAnd so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign when it should be whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to anybody out there\nWould be okay what we have to do is we get it would be to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for a significant period of time right and you and I both often said\nShe if you make the offer just see what the response would be from the left if you said okay\nLet's give legal ... let's give ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrants but his but in this country since\nYesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally\n\nA must be sent back ... that we will give you everybody who is in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and what do you think the response from the Democrats would be\nWell they're ... they're not they can't accept that\nThe reason they can't accept that is because now they're at the point of wanting open borders\nIt is not about that because\nEven they realized that the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill an agreement for that\nAmnesty and then\nStrong enforcement or the borders were Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now we're still be people coming here illegally that will be here that will that will get here and stay here for five years ten years whatever it is\nAnd the argument doesn't change do they know well forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want\nTo have the borders at all come in and stay as long as you want\n[noise] I I have a challenge to the Democratic party\nGet together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always hear them say that but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still saying it I'd I'd forgot who just set of recently\nI I I burst out laughing what we need a comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include and be very figure base but be specific and tell me or at least\nGive the stages the major stages of it that would be effective the major affect them stages of your reform plan what would they be\nI think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive immigration plan that you can go to specific\nA congressman and uh and and senators and state to them say\nWhat would what would you want in your comprehensive immigration plan and they ... they just wouldn't say comprehensive immigration plan so we asked a question to the left why can't you tell us what your comprehensive immigration plan would be is that a fair question right is that an outrageous question for us someone\nFor for for the two idiots overnight to ask of any politician in Washington DC you keep saying comprehensive immigration reform tell us specifically what it would be give us the specifics and they won't do well why not\n\nThe leadership of the Democrat Party wants open borders and prove us wrong prove us wrong come up with a comprehensive immigration plan\nShow it to us and prove that we are wrong I Will be the first person to say okay I was wrong I Know I won't be wrong but\nI Am wrong because there is your plan and you're going to stick behind\nWell tell me one Democrat or a recently who said and I mean at any one right now either running for office or that is in office that says and has been promoting\nWe here's what we here's what I think we should do and it would look like this we would have whatever it is\nAmnesty and then border control because we've been asking the question okay fine what measure what measure a border control do you support\nRight what would your at now I I Want to correct this year there might be one senator among the Democrats' side there might be one senator that would give you a plant\nJoe Manchin yeah\nYeah maybe I ... I made I Want to be fair here and there might be one senator on the Democratic side could answer that would that would give\nYou his even replant is even a Joe Manchin saying anything right now I don't know\nBecause the question is what is it really I mean the party has to promote it you're going to have to have the rest of the party obviously um and you know you're trying to get your trying to take control of the Senate you think you're going to win the house you've got momentum in the house you want to build momentum and the Senate races so\nHow do you do that what's the point\nWhat measure what level of enforcement do you support\n\nBecause really in my opinion if I were in ... answering there is no half measure\nAnd the problem with amnesty is that you're going to do it again later on it's gonna happen you're just saying okay a amnesty now and then there will be also amnesty later because we'll have the same debate and we'll still have the exact same scenario or Twenty years from now\n... as they as a debate point yes that would be you bring that up as the debate pointing as a ... to find out what because the goal is here not to get legislation right the goal is to get out of Democrats what they truly think and what they truly want what the leadership of the Democrats want\nWe know you don't want a wall okay one level of enforcement do you support\nIs that an unfair question Danny Democrat is that an unfair question to ask your party leaders right\nAnd you think about it how can we have all this discussion on ... on immigration and illegal immigration and that never gets answered ever by the Democrat leadership right ever does it get an answer right show me where does the specifics\nOf once you get the amnesty what's the level of border enforcement right specifically they don't want to watch eight six six Ninety read I\nSaw it with what I told ...
