I don't know now now now now John let me talk to you about that when I talk to your listeners about your views about that\nThere is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could've show that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could a shared it with the FBI if you could have discreetly conducted\nThis inquiry in July and August without betraying missed sports confidence is and they have betrayed her they pointed her to lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers are gonna have to face a D.C bar investigation and ... their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face and investigation for why they leak that all of this could have been done discreetly it happens hundreds of taught hundreds of times\nEvery year and the cherry tomato doesn't have a rather ...\nI'm with it ... they're they're sensitive ... this is their life issues that are the ... and I've only had a chance to talk about\nYeah so there you go ...\nI Want to move away from ... that doesn't look good for the narrative are yeah well no because those those are huge points that he may yeah I mean those are those are huge points first about the lawyers we'd ask that question without that we'd ask that question early on was she made it seem like\nFord made it seem like I never knew that the committee wish to talk to me what the committee talked to the lawyers\nAnd that's when we asked that question we said that hasn't been that hasn't been resolved and Tom Cotton coming out over the weekend insane her lawyers didn't tell her and they need to that and and as you said\n... will face a Washington DC bar investigation for allegedly not informing heard that the Senate Judiciary committee staffers were willing to travel to California to interviewer well why wouldn't say\nRight\nI mean who's working for your pro bono are you you're not working in the best interest of your client if you're not giving them the options that is the charge have caught and is making there which is huge because that shows why that's why wouldn't your lawyers be working for the best interest of you\nBecause they're working for the best interest of someone else yeah well how much you're paying them as a client I'm not paying them\nOh\nSo are they actually working for you and that's where you and I talked about this Friday and cotton is making the allegation\nThat you know they'll be facing the Washington DC bar investigation for not informing her when you asked a question why didn't they inform her if she didn't know why did it and will those questions they asked by the F ... uh\nWell I mean you would you you're looking to through the FBI looking to vet the process all over again right\nBecause it is a serious allegation is just as much to prove her wrong as it is to prove him wrong or liar\nIt is just as much about finding out well in fact the entire purpose is finding out the truth is not necessarily to find out which one is lying because one of them as lying\nIt's about finding out the truth which means it's equally as much about the person making the allegation as it is the accused\nAnd the other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats and the media we're always trying to make the point will Feinstein did her best teacher one wouldn't know she didn't\nAnd as we subtle long if you listen to the show we said look there is a process\nAnd I'm Glad that Tom Cotton pointed out the process and and ... and they said they do this hundreds of times you an and decker said he doesn't know well not that sensitive because no justice sensitive another issues but things that are highly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "01"}
