phrase room is not that bad or write\nA sleazy porn lawyer but let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on with mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I just was you know interested in why there's such a big I'm such a big talk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise]\nUm you know what they did was terrible book you know ... you know even if it were to do something small that's all right but it's such a big and making such a big uproar about it I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it\nWhen it's in our interest you know when when we could prevent you know bigger a human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is different\nBut in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card um you know say if they did it ... it is in our best interest to just you know the big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they helped us out so why um what's the big uproar but you know they've\nDone things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months\nTo get to make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know it's not your regular guys like I'm a stay you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook it's a ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nWhat I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to save and great about him because he was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know the their their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nSo I'm not a big fan of what he believes in a in that sense what to do when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have\nA special status when a country has an embassy in another country that is there's and their territory their land you lord in there and and then you chop them up and you assassinate him and\nI it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on and you're right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to fight Iran it's very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been it got to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with him probably many issues\nBut that's you know agree with him but kept getting getting killed like that is horrible\nYeah I mean so ... yeah ...\n... even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want a large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and and things happening I mean I\nI don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's a it is a horrible incident but for this alone I don't think you know\nI'm In the bigger picture you know ... ...\nYeah well I I I cringe when you said cutting off business I think that's bad in this in this story\nBut you're right we we need that we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who's terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey I'm never going there again while this guys and the princes in power and this and Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know which is crazy sounds you have to have some\nCivility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that is one of the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was\nWas so outrageous to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but I I I've followed this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved in the mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not saying Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nA lot you know this there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way taking out ... was so outrageous by a Obama a because he was becoming our friend\nA difficulty yeah so you you get it and it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff do the right one although I have the different countries and assassinating them go ahead\nI ... I but I I Do feel I mean my my impression is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the X. box um I'm sure you know it's probably known you know in Washington is probably like you know\nKnown that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure she takes out you know yes people going down\nHis political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon you know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became like ... it's a very public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there and it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and you said you know if I don't come out and you know here's what you do and and you just disappear and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up\nAnd they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that it was a wad of interrogation that a guy got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little crazy right well yeah and I'm sure they're\nPretty sure they're pretty ... [laughter] if\nI'm yeah you bet yeah this wasn't a by the way I was mentioning my producer last night just wasn't a job interview going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the credible home I think people even on our side are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way you can drop 'em up and when they ... didn't they bring suitcases\nIt's reported it and you know how do they think it's funny I mean\nI don't want to be gross that way on the air but I I think all of that stuff you may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff\nGoing on but this one way of played out was not good yeah thank you Andy I appreciate your call very much by the way how old are you I'm a twenty two [noise] and I thought you sound young who is your choice on the Democrats' side who would you like to see run against presence\nI'll tell you what for the fun of it I Would love for ...

they were ... we went out and say that you know he just said ... okay then we've got ... past become president ah they we have the speaking out because by the next election do\nWith what the Democrat with the Congress\nWhich would be pets run or what would they have another a law for Republican Party and\nYou'll love you you\nYou know ... would be likely person to be nominated because he would have been an option unless he was a disaster\nAnd um he could pick whoever he wants to run with him is as his vice president running mate and it'd be hard for anybody because that recognition the incumbency being president is very difficult to defeat it rarely happens he he would likely run and pick a vice presidential nominee to go with him\nIf it is and you set a record our house ... ...\nYeah the house has to go ahead I'll get a second so people know you miss that correctly the house and peaches and the president but then the Senate has to try\nUm the president and and they decide whether he gets thrown out of office so Bill Clinton was impeached a lot of people don't know this he was impeached by the house but the Senate wants to know part of it so he never went to

kind of a kind of us did obviously yeah I agree\nWith that and of course we know some of the stuff that's gone on in the oval office that's why I mentioned President Reagan wouldn't walk in there without his suit and tie and I've learned I'm not always agree on this though I I as much as you guys who were Democrats can't stand to Donald Trump or George Bush for that matter I felt the same way about a mile but I Know I've learned\nIf he walked in the room you give credit to the office of the president United States and you stand\nUp to like him and I didn't I couldn't wait for him to get

McDonald's I have a story about fast food restaurants that'll have to wait till tomorrow or Burger King I think you can do your way\nOr is it in and out I'm trying to will will have to\nBurger King I was right the first time All right let's go\nTo Tim in Caldwell, Idaho you're on with mark [noise] hey good lord and mark how are you\nGood morning to you\nYeah I I I'm I'm a water jet was that Trump supporter but\nI think oh I think probably the the president for the next six years the fight if a Democrat to vote on one of them it would ... the I I like the old man should actually ah\nI was pretty impressed with him about re vote or Capitol after he knew he was going to get a blood to\nDrop out of all the other Democrat and each field it so\nThat I really kudos for that that's who I Would love to have coffee with that out and get it right away and the worry what this country to be in six years from now we'll see where he had like it to be\nDo you want to hear something like that yeah you want to hear something negative about the vote that there was some ... that ... one Susan Collins came out for Kavanaugh than mansion felt safe voting that way he certainly wasn't I don't know if it was a true but this is what I heard\nHe certainly wasn't going to be the one that put Kevin uh over\nBut one's columns made her speech and came out and said she was going to vote for cabinet and it was obvious that he was going to win then mentioned was comfortable doing that now\nYou know that may be true may not be true uh of course I mean he seems like an idea that I write you didn't hear too okay good\nI did I did hear that and that's what they want to\nPick his brain about this just in general\nIf the guy asking the question why do they vote the way they did\nAnd just to hear it simply adds because he really didn't give an answer I mean you just basically voted for him and I I was pretty impressed with the Democrat I knew he was going to take a bucket of crap from the Democrats than we ever one does if he said anything negative towards\nUm but uh I Would I Would just like the setting data picked at him and just want to see what he's really got going on in his head although again\nI'm big heart in him and I shouldn't be seen as like a nice guys I just said of the fact is Trump did when white or by forty points or something ridiculous in West Virginia so did he really ... yeah and we've been talking also the last few nights about the Senate and house races and\nAh he may keep his because of what he did right people may feel the way you said that hey he was courageous and he did vote for Kavanaugh so I hear I hear we are at least I Am being unfair maybe he really felt that way would have always voted that way or there was no cooperation all that kinda stuff\nBut there are other senators like uh what's her name Hi Heidi Heitkamp whatever name is she's in big trouble and in fact the way out is the whole ... a Kevin fiasco has helped the Republicans just the Democrats were always upbeat they were always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact of having a hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse\nBut our problems are in the house the house of representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nice if they take back\nThe house you're in the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to piece\nKevin I'm trying to impeach Trump with hearings with subpoena powers ah with calling for their impeachment is not going to be fun\n[noise] no it's I think it's going to get our glee I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that that would be crazy\nI mean I I honestly didn't leave anything Ford said to me I didn't really do any of it it didn't sound credible to me [noise] um [noise] I I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most\nHonest either one of the water the what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion I mean he got all these other we've got you\nKnow I was going to say it seems like a decent guy and you as you started say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case\nI just think they were using her as long as we're talking about who should run for president Democrats side a ... book her and I call them that because of his own name that Kamala Harris\nThey they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined that if someone didn't do that assault on her all those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch a it was difficult it was\nHorrible it was really was it well they are in which he was yeah that's right Lindsey\nGraham was so good when it came out and said that I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do uh but that so they are they ought to be yeah well thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely I'll I'll definitely call back again\nWell thanks so much to him and uh yeah Jo measure would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nI think she's going to come out I suggest that she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her and I said she could join the OJ Simpson as he looks for
