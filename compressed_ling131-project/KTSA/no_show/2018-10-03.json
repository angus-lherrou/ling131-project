some of the material has been passed on to a national circulated newspaper or not provided to the Senate and he proposes a proposes this is suggesting ... a lack\nOf candor adjacent to those request as a curious paragraph this National Review the full details of Dr Ford's polygraph are particularly important because the Senate Judiciary committee has received a sworn statement from a long time boyfriend of Dr forge a sworn statement he's been under oath now\n... stadium that he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations when asked under oath in the hearing\nWhether she'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph Dr Ford replied never the statement racist specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination result she continued\nThe Senate therefore needs this information it'll be interesting well they give it to\nOr a is gradually using this as the defense that when they don't\nThey can expect to send it to delay it any further right right and or make any other choice in terms of the vote because I think this is clearly by the chairman yeah I think this is well it works and then on both levels they handed over a new review it or they don't hand it over and\nYou essentially look at the you've you send it on to the Senate majority leader and say well we've done our due diligence\nBecause if you're looking for and looking at evidence and and you can't get any other witnesses to back up what she's saying then what you want to see is All right what was the process especially with the uh any video or audio that was recorded during the polygraph\nThe you know they they asked for that before the hearing\nThey asked for that ah [noise] the weekend before the ... the hearing a couple of weekends ago and her attorney basically said no it's not relevant of course it's relevant\nBecause you said that she took and passed a polygraph test\nWell we need to see the methodology and the polygraph test\nTo see that you know what questions were asked\nUm and and again how the how the process on that level of work\nI think that's fair you know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate if you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't and and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody's brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used and said these are the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else to take a polygraph test you know and and you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say\nNo I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating nope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes\nBecause she is using the she is using the polygraph\nAs cooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify that the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to get because she was always telling the truth right\nHer attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to interview her and act\nOn investigative leaves leads they have provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh quotas is inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr ... allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are Deborah cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top FBI officials in our letter obtained by political\nUh again it's not an investigation no this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talked with the end\nAnd also ... wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they well they if they don't I understand why they would not\nBecause it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing a background check on Kavanaugh and so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or tapping ought to get their statements because they have their statements by the way\nThere is they don't get to know the the the attorneys her attorneys\nDon't get to know who the who the FBI interviews or who they don't\nIncluding people that they say they told the FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with is the FBI maybe doing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that\nRight that this is not about her this is a background check on Capitol Hill about her claim but\nShe is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does there there is a no there is no way for them to be a part of the process\n\nFor them to be included or directing the

statement making America a nation of laws not men and the liberals are doing the exact opposite uh by making this a personal thing you ever thought\nWell you know like oh let's go to ... and they get so much just said well look we started talking about this as soon as Trump was elected in the people started calling him a fascist\nAnd then anti FAA see we were calling them we we'd recognize and

if that's even the correct pronunciation came out I don't I don't know but yes we'd call the ... and they came out and said that they were anti fascist we said no they're actually fashion so if you look at what they they uh uh you know what they believe if you look at a lot of what\nA you know Trump was criticized for the travel ban or no we need to stop him from his dictatorial wasn't dictatorial it was exact opposite the judges actually getting involved in that was\nA dictatorial yeah well you know we agree that ... a nation of laws we believe that there are things\nThat we should

then we'll get back to your calls and comments or its we'd been nominated for the last couple of weeks on the cabin on the thing and and we continue to talk about it we'll have more to say and more of your calls and comments are coming up the story\nOr Amazon now to pay Fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage and and now after they announced that there are now going to promote\nThat the government raised the minimum wage from seven fifty an hour it's like oh you're doing it now that you've raised it yeah right\nOr not unexpected tight labor market that we have today mhm well\nAnd there was a lot of flak on a as the especially early on as they were setting up the distribution centers for Amazon or receiving a lot of negative press on the the uh the workers being overworked underpaid and that kind of thing you set the new standard which goes above\nI think even the Cosco a starting or or maybe it's the same as Costco I I Can't remember we're Costco went a Wal Mart with ten dollars an hour a few years ago on starting wage\nAnd the starting wage now you will be Fifteen dollars an hour by the way private sector companies can do that if they wish but it is about and here's what happened at Walmart\nUm it you know they were clearly they were changing not just the pay that that's there's a a public relations point to be made there no no problem but it's also to attract\nShouldn't a that comes in Tempe comes into this particular point and in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to\nDefeat all the cost of the regulation from government in the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here\nAnd sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating part in\nWell keep in mind in two thousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash their their foreign arms\nTheir foreign business was what was keeping them alive you you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here ...\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect mhm based on economics which is how people respond to incentive and disincentive ... not in my

watched or heard about the cabin on hearing [laughter]\nWatched her her wow right up right those two groups though\nAre the\nMajority of voters agreed with the Senate decision to lay the vote by a week and involved the FBI just search for\nCooperating evidence yet the FBI review finds no cooperating evidence sixty percent of voters support the confirmation of capital ... uh when it came to ah let me see\nThe\n... uh Dianne Feinstein here was Seventy five percent of Americans ... disagreed with the fact that she kept the letter yeah right she should have given it to the so they she's not winning\nThat one at all no not at all and you know because for Democrats are liberals they would see that as look you could have done something out early on about this and it would have been a bigger story\nA potentially if you would have done something about that and then him for uh the conservatives or or Republicans and maybe even people in the middle\nShe violated she violated essentially the process and the rules\n\nAnd and I think you you know them easily you can move on to the who leaked it about Ford because the Democrats claiming you know they wanted to help protect her but yet it's clear now that they're the ones who wakes up to the media in order to out her\nIn order to make the story public\nIs Seventy five percent of voters believe that Senator Dianne Feinstein should have immediately turned over the letter a from Christine forward to the Senate Judiciary committee in July ... when she received it which means Republicans have made their point they're ...\nOn other issues are ... a Russian investigation ...\nAmericans want transparency when it comes to how and why the investigation was launched yeah sixty five percent of Americans this polls just done by the way\nSixty five percent of Americans say it's important to turnover evidence from the FBI and the Justice Department to clear the air in how the investigation was started\nTwo thirds of American voters want an investigation into potential abuses at the FBI although voters are split and on whether or not biased played a role\nIn launching the investigation fifty two percent buys played a role forty eight percent say biased didn't play a role but two thirds of Americans believe and I would say that if you say forty eight percent said there was no bias\nOr in the role in fifty two percent said there is bias\nThe fact that you have sixty six percent\nOf American voters favor an investigation that means many that believe biased didn't play a role believe it should be investigated anyway\nYou're talking about again the independence there goes your independence and her saying okay I'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American voters favor a that investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's late\nAh [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks and then liberals will be screaming for transparency\nThe first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n\nOr you know it's interesting that seems like a ... bad two years Americans are paying attention probably do the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI department of justice or to see how the investigation started a is a is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said they believed that Trump committed collusion\nAnd they want to find out my ... and they're willing to release it to ... to ... he committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually believe that well\nI mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nUh you know beyond that uh that typical party line number of just ... you know if the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which\nMeans there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that and\nWho knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think that it's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying this it doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice\nThere needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparent\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to or we talked about it earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant ah application and and and those Twenty one page as we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying\nHey it's just disappeared for instance there's going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story right well we did a a early last week when we said because we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guys just started talking about casually\nOn the air and saying I mean what the world why would you send it to the inspector general you know because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies or we're going to release it ah but ah we're\nA ... we have so much action from our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the same in an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're released something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you

that's actually what he did say then I'd be okay with it but he did say that right and so you're trying to determine the level of intoxication\nOf somebody thirty six years ago right and since we now have a society that gets high instead of drinking mhm since that seems to be the direction we're going that's like saying how high was the yeah I was pretty high no dude you were just really stone that's perjury\nSee the thing about it I mean there's the thing you know by the less standard he could say if it were about pot he could say well he he tried it with but he didn't inhale\nThat would be\n... for capital rod I drank the beer but I'll spit it out of ...\n[laughter]\nI don't know it was bad Clinton um yeah so but at the end that's why the ... this is refuting specifically about a specific you know something that she never did when it came to a polygraph\nThat's not trying to figure out how drunk were you thirty six years ago right at a ... ... at no specific time is designated as there is no incident to how drunk you were one specific time it's in general and your whole life right\nAnd in pretty wasted in times how wasted really wasted I think you were mega wasted\nYeah you're you're committed perjury you said really way said you were making wasted\nOh yeah\nSo I'm doing five years for perjury in prison for what and I said I was really wasted and they believe the guy that said I was mega wasted\nWhat's the difference was likely PSA bus driving is drunk driving and then of course the drunk sitting in front of the TV Now is not set up it's not\nBut it it well I don't ... the bought ... the ... the entire thing is if it's technically ... you know what to do a whole because this is how I think when I see the bus driving ... wait a minute if I'm at point oh five mhm and I feel a bus and I feel a buzz and it is and drunk driving\nNot by the my state standards\nRight yes not by not yes not by the state standard I I don't think anybody's below pointed way\nI don't know that anybody right as I think they're trying to move something was there was a movement or or call to move it to point oh four right which would be okay bus driving can impair your you know your ability your skills behind the wheel that's\nWhere you could ... which you could leave if you could look at that and say well do do you ever charged with drunk driving ...\nUh uh\nAnd I I guess I'm I'm trying to think of would be the scenario but your point let's say let's say your name is bad too\n\nAnd the cops pull you over I bet you don't run you didn't run oh you did [laughter]\nYeah you have a much better scenario but but I could come up with yeah thank you very much I don't think they can out of thin air just out of nowhere\nTo have\nWhat ... what are you by the way we think about the ... with with ... that the the critique or whatever the review he gave it up some performance where we talked about\nYou know some dance for foreigners who talked about why the

no that doesn't apply to the election today either folks yeah right\nMost like that does now you you know you you can bring it on ... somebody may not vote for him because of it but nobody in Austin, Texas is not going to not vote for him because\nIt's ... it's about what it says and does you know right now and then what he says right what he did back then\nBut how do you ... again so the the the department trying to make on perjury is the fact that hers is about a specific behavior that can be measured did your did you not tell somebody you said no we got to witness it said you did now do they find that woman\n... ah that would be the next step right and they would find the woman ... yeah now she doesn't have to testify no no way to make the Senate can subpoena you can't yeah well and I think they want to do another hearing yeah\n\nBut that'd be if anybody can ... that somebody you know he's new and it's come aboard will the FBI interviewing him and then they have the name of the woman they know the name of the woman that she helped\nHer name appears [noise] I I I don't know because it depends on really they they were given a broader scope on Monday\nThe president or maybe it actually officially happened late Sunday the president broadening the scope you know to being able to interview anybody and anything that was that was tied to those claims but I don't know if it's not necessarily something that\nThat she said in a ... that would be the investigation I'm Sorry the background check\nA would be would include that which is something she claimed\nYeah they have the name ... Senate McLean so I'm sure he's given the investigators her full name right and if she's alive I'm assuming that\nYou know you wouldn't ... somebody in the Judiciary Committee if this thing when any further if they're going to stick with her as this witness and the Democrats are going to stick by this and Republicans are going to stick by the next thing would be to get her\nAnd then if you had the ... the U.S the boyfriend in his testimony and then the woman that she actually helped with the lie detector if she helped or the alleged helping looked at the lie detector test\nIf she comes over and says yes she helped moved a lie detector test you got her ...\n\nWell here's my question to on asking for the materials that Grassley asked for by the way on the the video or audio related to or or of the process of the lie detector test\nHe's asked for that before my question is if the Senate committee officially asks\nHer for that because that really was that was presented as evidence\nExcept for they didn't get to scrutinize the\nMethodology of it it was just the results right the results being presented as\nPart of the evidence will now that she has testified in front of the Senate because at first Grassley asked that before she testified but is there just the Senate have the power to subpoena\nThose those are those documents\nThat information\nI mean is a binding legally I guess is my question now that she's testified because that's where the official claim\nIs made\nIn regards to the Senate committee and consideration for Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice so would that not be part of the legal process are her lawyers legally bound to turn that over\nI don't know I ... I didn't see anybody right it that way I'm just asking a question but I Would think because it's part of the process and they presented the results as part of the evidence\nThan they would be compelled to turn that information over\nSo I don't know at at an interesting point I don't know that I don't I don't yeah I don't know that either\nI don't know what though because it's different before she testified and that's the first time you got for\nI'm just talking about just the the lie detector test right out of the audio or video any any audio or video related to it um because as as they as she officially basically and then under oath she\nTestified in may use that as part of the evidence he's still requesting it and hasn't gotten and hasn't gotten that I Wonder if they're just delaying or you know if they believe that they lay logged enough that the vote will get through this whole thing goes away I don't know that they're legally compelled to or not I'm not sure I'm just asking the question eight six six Ninety ...\nDairy what's the high profile I guess you connected to U.S Mexican and Canadian negotiations that led to what is being called the U.

Tucker [laughter] this is not about trying to get the facts or get the proof it's about trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed for the Supreme Court that all comes to an end this week Tucker\nWhat I find so striking is a he's a sitting federal judge has authored scores and scores of opinion and said hey we're not debating any of them his initial philosophy is not even up for debate it's all about his high school yearbook does it strike in this conversation is on the coming of a country as advanced as ours it's just so stupid finally\nDumb why it is it is pretty amusing to say Democratic senators poring over high school yearbook as if it were that the Vinci Code\n[laughter] that's my favorite line right out of their rights\nAre but you know that that's where we are I Wonder how much you know talk today we only had\nA boat one called today we had very few ... this week we've been doing this for a long time as I said this is my this week marks my twenty ninth year end talk radio ... we know when the Democrats have an argument right or when they believed to have an argument we know Democrats don't have an argument and they don't believe that they have an argument the polls show\nThat you know for example the most it's Seventy five percent of Americans which means that's close to almost half of Democrats when you get to that kind of level or they believed and Feinstein was completely wrong\nFor ... for not you know taking that letter and and going through the process and so right from that point on the Democrats haven't been able to sell their message to half of their party looks at it and say\n... uh of\nOkay that's that's just not good there is a ... as we said the the uh the poll that shows the sixty percent of Americans\nA belief that if the FBI has no cooperating evidence of after this\nUh you you can for him right you you can for him to be a Supreme Court\nA justice Americans look at Americans believe in due process is the one call we have today didn't even talk about anything well he's unprofessional because of the way that he acted which is again was the talking point but we and as we reminded the color he's about two or three days past that talking point which really died\nA couple of days ago that they moved on from that talking point to something else but\nReally that's it and that's how we get as anybody knows what you accuse me because you think about it the accusation actually as as an extent expanded\nBecause ... not just attempted assault but because she claim a that ah I Can't think of the other ...\nI'm Mark judge was there that none of it's almost an attempt to gang rape isn't it right and then the game right Alexander you know allegations came along\nSo you sit there and you see a a cabin on as we talked about he was angry yeah you'd be angry too if I shouldn't be oh you're in a job interview that's not a job interview no job interview is not when people are testifying under oath a job interview was not when you have senators\nIn the in the Judiciary Committee looking at you\nAnd saying I Believe her which means they're accusing view of sexual assault on an allegation alone that's a personal attack on you as an individual but still that's all they have blood but it was unprofessional\nThat cause you're running out of any type of argument to defend the person that you were hoping\nCould ensure that cabin on never served on the Supreme Court of the United states we know what it's about we know what is what it's always been about I just wonder what happens if you get to the point where\nAre we know I mean after the ... and I don't know is the FBI 'cause we we asked you know where's the FBI going with this background check are they going to talk to forge old boyfriend and for Jordan old boyfriend identified\nA a Ford's a girlfriend identified or by name a ...\nAs saying she told this woman I'll help you with ... and show you how when I'll help you with a a a how to beat a lie detector test to both they can find that woman and I said earlier she's alive the reason I said that as she can only be a witness who she's alive\nBut does she live and they find her and she's willing to testify and she says yeah I mean under oath yet she\nHelped me do it you've got a perjury charge everything falls apart it's already all of these cases are falling at every day another layer is being peeled from these allegations against Kavanaugh\nI think right now and again you know I I don't know the answer the question I asked earlier about her lawyers being compelled to to ah to forward that information and materials that\nAre Chuck Grassley a called for by assume that's not the case and they're not legally compelled to do so even still they would resist doing it\nUh I think they're going to resist whether they are legally compelled compelled or not\nBut the they're likely doing that white well\nBecause if if she's telling the truth during the lie detector test which they say I mean that's the whole point of all I did check their test is that you passed it\nExcept there were different questions", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio",
