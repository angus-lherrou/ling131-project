maybe some people say he is the most influential and powerful voice\nIn politics in the middle east has some two million Twitter followers and he has disappeared he went into the conflict in the Saudi conflict in Turkey and from there it just got weird or to the point where everybody started to say what happened to have some of the stuff they're saying\nThis is some of the stuff they're saying is\nA lot of men and a bone saw yeah\nThis morning the Washington Post is reporting Turkish officials claim to have a video showing a Saudi security team\nDetaining 'cause she'll be in the consulate you can hear his voice and the voices of men speaking Arabic in an identified individual told the post you couldn't hear how we visit interrogated tortured and then murdered\nThe Saudis have fiercely denied any involvement St ... left the consulate and went missing\nSo what ends up happening is this guy apparently is trying to get a marriage license and he goes into the Saudi a consulate Fifteen says what's guys show up\nTurkish media releasing surveillance video they stay shows Fifteen Saudi nationals entering the compound on the same day a possible hit squad according to Turkish reports\nPresident Trump now taking a critical tone said us investigators are in Turkey and working with the Saudis to find out what happened\nHow real are they looking into this Trump has said a just a little while ago I Will be calling at some point king Solomon\nSo what is he going to do I do know says he's going to call and good to talk to them about what why is this guy so powerful what about at well first of all he worked for what many perceived to be the the most liberal\nOf progressive Saudi newspapers all what time and that's one of them he was in\nExile for a while on his own because he was worried about certain issues that were going on that threat to the Abbey comes with extremely powerful family a wealthy family is ah is ah if I'm correct I Believe it seized his uncle was part of the er\nAt that because yoga is part of the Iran Contra deal their family's worth billions of dollars cousin was ... he was\nDating princes Diana when they were killed uh he was educated here at the Indiana State university and this is just a very interesting thing and there is apparently\nSome of the interrogation was transmitted via his\nApple watch and\nBones saw is what people are saying was involved thinking about that how\nReal some of this is or isn't I don't know but I Will tell you this there is a big deal coming out here with the fact that there is a lot of money involved with about a hundred plus billion dollars pouring into our country for arms and things like that Saudi Arabia is better the devil you do in a lot of ways\nThey're friendly issue\nTo us but not too they\nHate Iran which makes us like them a little bit more\nThey had a oil they bought our stuff it is a weird thing that goes on there remember this is and people say well we can't not do this we have to do the steel people are texting me and him saying no no no\nI think we looked at this I understand what Trump's trying to say he doesn't want to kill this deal because a lot of money pouring into us has a lot of jobs at a hundred billion dollars that people are getting depending on\nAnd saying that though this is a journalist who had power and if I'm Trump I look at this seriously really seriously what influence what was he working on what was happening that you would send potentially says\nKeane men to take him out he and by the way from\nMay really want this deal but I Will tell you this Congress had to say on this and a ... yeah they're not thrilled and if anything's going to unite them for all of the stuff that's happening in our country it may be this thing\nFor I think it's important to know what happened [laughter] we've read the same include everybody else around so obviously I'm for some additional information which are kind of share we need to know what happened [noise] but ultimately I mean to say this and I'm not saying this is what happened during the learned soon enough\nIf the Saudi Government ordered a guy to be abducted they killed them they chop them up the sound a bunch of people end up killing them proper amount and then they live for that's what happened [laughter]\nI'm telling you either the what's going to happen here on Capitol Hill as a complete revolt against our policies with Saudi Arabia\nThinking about that and they could override this they could override this it's a very ... and again the relationship we have that look at nine eleven look at several of the other issues that have gone on well hobby is them all of these kinds of things it is the you know it's one of those things where\n[noise] they hate it they hate Iran that that's huge\nThey do their mortal enemies and that is a big issue so we walk a weird fine line and that we have for for years the oil all of that stuff is a very fine issue we walk but that a hundred and ten billion dollars in a lot of people were looking at what is taking place in this kind of\nBizarre weird fight revolution that is going on in in in what is trying to become a more modern Saudi Arabia\nWhere they were they younger king who was forward looking women may be able to get you know drive and yes where they're getting license but there may be some more progressive things but then you've got a very hard line religious sect that doesn't want to move any any more forward than the sixth century that they're living in\nA so you've got all this weird things and this guy I mean this guy is a very ... cars show he is a very\nInteresting character like I said he he befriended\nOsama bin Laden in the eighties and into the early nineties and when he was fighting the Soviets and uh and and at times he was even trying to broker a deal of peace between Saudi Arabia and bin Laden he disavowed him after\nTwo thousand or one in nine eleven he just said he would would never have anything to do with him but he begged him to step away from all of this stuff this guy is that a lot of influence there and the influence he has in giving people the opportunity to have a voice even if they don't say it's so much out loud to him and threw him\nWas huge and now we're in a situation where you know people are looking around going what what is going to happen with is what's gonna happen with this relationship with us in Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's unfortunate because they're unimportant partner and our Middle Eastern strategy to contain sort of along the various influence in the region [noise]\nUh but but if they haven't gone as far as to where the sky emphasis constantly kill 'em cut up the body offering them Santa Cruz here to do that and then they laugh at their

Seventy nine forty four to find out what this could mean for you\nYou're just like us and I was scanning for one audio and here's what I found is like a dueling narrative\nIs the food that Comey oh he doesn't represent black people noises represent ... and ... he's making all black people looked at ... which is uh is he representing black people and therefore making black people look better or is he not representing black people and then you obviously have nothing to worry about\nIs just silly the way the news just has to be everywhere on this instead of accurate I mean the idea I\nI don't know the I'd I mean just the thing that I have seen that I've been it's just I I don't know this is the craziest stuff I've ever seen the reaction to this\nSo that's the the one thing going on and we're going to talk more about that because one of the other things that apparently went unmentioned as I saw all of these people\nTry to cycle analyze this dude who by the way it he said on camera while he was meeting with the president which nobody picked up on because they're clueless he said that um he had been missed\nDiagnosed with bipolar and he actually was that and he said he that he went to the doctor and he had like a the tea all of this kind of stuff and he said it was actually sleep deprivation play this this was he said it was\nI've accumulated to yourself oh no no no I Want that yet and then I Do that but he said that he had sleep deprivation and that's what it was I don't care what it is\nDoes it make it even if he does or if he does it does that make a call for people like Jimmy Kimmel here to mock him like those listen this is cool\nIt really should ensure even the people who love Donald Trump's would be like oh maybe it's not the best when it comes to the decision making [laughter] not only was this a crazy conversations for this White House this is the kind of conversation that would typically be held between people worry hospital bracelet\nMm wow\nNothing says let's raise awareness for mental\nWorld mental health awareness day like mocking somebody and trying to undermine their humanity and that's exactly what this was that's exactly what this that's exactly what these people were doing\nThey were trying to to to to undermine all of this because heaven forbid somebody go out I didn't realize there was such a threat to people somebody going out and simply exchanging ideas with with someone else\nI just unbelievable now ah\nAnd we have I Know we've got a lot more to get into on that because I I'm going to play for you some hot takes by all the cable news folks last night\nAt because this is your these racism is okay apparently if you're attacked attacking any free thinking\nBlack person in America that wants to find common ground with someone who is a conservative or Republican he's\nNot endorsing him he's there to I mean he ... he they actually had a conversation on criminal justice and he apparently brought like names with him and he didn't just go there for a photo op like he had like went there for and I you know that's good where are all these people swimming him when he was on television St George Bush hates black\nPeople\nI Know that was I thought that was unwarranted for sure and I'm like I Can't even believe that somebody would say that\nThat's awful but and and where were they when he was meeting with Brock Obama talking about criminal justice\nI like I said I have never\nI I I Will mock people who are celebrities if I think what they're saying is stupid and unfounded\nBut politics is downstream from pop culture that whole like you know shut up and dribble stuff I've never gone down a just I've never gotten because politics that is a denial that politics is downstream from pop culture politics as pop culture codified\nThat's what it is now switching gears here from\n... to the media trying to change the narrative I actually went back and forth or ... or a little bit this morning a because the media is on\nDay to day three of their not 'em up [noise] the violent leftist or not um up they've they've gone from trying to compare and trying to justify\nWhat people are doing it by comparing them to the peaceful Tea Party to now they're saying well you know Trump I mean at his rallies and stuff I mean I don't even know man I just it's just so bad and you know it cetera et cetera\nAnd that's what they've they've\nBeen going on and on and on and on with that\nAnd we have a um mob super cut as well that we're going to play for you all of these people in the media who have been saying don't call it a mob\nDon't call it a mob and then you have waters and vulgar and holder and Hillary Clinton and everybody who says all of these things [noise] um\nYeah that's it's pretty
