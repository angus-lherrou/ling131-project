is still used today mhm\nWhen either side does it it's wrong we should be basing our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media\nWhere people believe that okay I have an audience now\nAnd so just like the media there's this thirst that I'm going to be first and then I guess the right conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\nYeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right and you were putting together a puzzle but then that's not what this says it's speculation pure speculation pure speculation based on zero evidence based on nothing\nYou know if a Catherine heritage\nOr says look ... ... it's possible based on the leaks that are coming out a that it is but that somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle together a I think she's done some stellar work on a number of stories or over the

how the truth I guess starts to come together\nThat's all that is it's called journalists for those under sixty journalism was very important you go to our nation and its rarely practice true

they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates\nBecause they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do activism in place of journalism\nIs what we see today more often than not and you when you look at a story especially one like this and still unfolding and and the

Gingrich I think it was before the Drudge Report I actually got where I guess sort of adult southern network out which\nSay that the Democrats had two or three chance of winning the house and it turns out I'm just wondering if\nThere's a buildup to scare away independent voters know maybe a scam away but it's hard to say well it's the law so why bother you\nAre you saying that's why they would use them that's why Newt Gingrich did that\nFor sure I'm not sure about health and fitness Quakers yeah but in general I mean I think a ... she was\nFirst of all why or how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the polls sense that they do that would actually encourage independents who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe well that can be at a point to maybe that was as you point cushy\nI look I when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation was and they'd probably be more willing to tell you after election you know why they why they did what they what they did and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we have a question you don't need silver for example we still question\nYou know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races and make these determinations we still have a ton\nOf of questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house and a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate I\nThink you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with Republican\nYeah in fact I saw something today ah that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was it was the headline was directed more at the Republican candidates in those races or republic Republicans in in general\nBelieving that they were going to keep the Senate or where the houses going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even\nThrough polls but if you do it strictly by the polls right now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take the house that would not be shocking a when you talk about a first term president\n... often that first mid term\nIs is something where the that shift of power happens that happened with a rock Obama in two thousand ten\nRight and so you could look at at at history that dictates has now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yet trend in that area yeah Trump yet cabinet and that's\nWhat I was saying about the polls have you go by the polls in history than than you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate and then you look at\nNinety four ... I did that happen right I was only a talk show host for a couple of years I still remember it how shocked everybody was\nAnd said whoa really except for ... nobody really got that one did that and I wouldn't really came out of nowhere how did the Republicans take\nSo many seats mhm well there was this underlying you know a underlying passion that existed and voting excitement from Republicans to go out that somehow nobody saw now with the technology today\nAnd with the way that we do polling today have we improved it I don't know well and I will know a little over a little under two weeks from now call\nOuts is the only way you're going to get an answer for I'm a Republican or conservative in many cases you're not going to see them at protests\nYou're not going to see them as you might see them at a presidential or the or the ... the president's rallies but you're not going to see them doing these grass roots rallies that the left is doing right now but the whole get out the vote make sure you out that kind of thing\nOr an independent Bob yesterday and had a post about wow that ... ... ... a really putting up a fight against Trump and a lot of people\nYou know and and I of course had to add to it you've been drinking today ... know and and trying to find in ... and I I was just kidding with him I was just having fun I don't really argued that much on social media and uh but other people ... what are you basing this ought to go to the number of signs\nA number of signs there uh I don't see one crew side in the neighborhood that I live in ... and I can guarantee a ton of people are voting groups mhm every sick I have not seen one crew sign ever\nOn my street it's a about half of the signs not every yard has a sign of course but have the signs of cruise and have the signs yeah uh two sons are better\nOkay I've not seen mhm a crew sign in all of my travels not I don't do anything or maybe I Am\nOne of the streets that I'd take here one guy had for Ted Cruz science he's really an average four times\nThat's right uh what is that any indication of who's going to win the election of course not does any indication of\nA good fight being done no I've often wondered what is the value of signs in front of homes bow I've often wondered that yeah yeah yeah ... ... for sale sign I Know I Know but I I Would say yes I Would I but I Would ask that as a political consultant ...\n... are you being a fishing by spending your money on all these signs of people are putting up in homes how do you know you're getting a return on\nThat especially today right back in the day yeah social media is you might be able to measure it certainly was different measurement but where does it stand today what is the impact\nStand today [noise] eight six six Ninety read I [noise]\nWas ready to do with a record ...

this or not I didn't know the answer to this\nBut if\nChelsea work to run in twenty twenty by the time the primaries rover she'd be forty she'd be forty ... imagine she ran for president in twenty twenty she'd be almost forty one just weeks away from our forty first birthday\n\nFor some reason I was thinking she was a I don't know maybe a ... a few years younger I don't know I didn't know the
