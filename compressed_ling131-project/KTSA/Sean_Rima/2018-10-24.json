{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "You do that yet no no\nNo that's all right no cats so then you get baby step five which has kept college you'd get maybe six 'cause it's done which means are near um baby step seven right now so that is just knowing wealth and giving which is a pretty awesome spot to be so what I Would say for you guys is funding our retirement\nBut then also have similar goals that you guys want to me because I'm you know there's there can be this monotonous state that you get in\nWhen you don't have any debt or a house payment none of that and you're just putting money away\nAnd savings and it's just kind of like okay it's just there so you need something exciting that you guys want to do whether that's a vacation you want to take maybe as we went to upgrade our home and five years and can we cash flow that can we go next Kobe are upgrade of our house we are going to complete we're never going to go into debt like bless your grandmother and say we're going to know that\nSell our house put money towards that so he'll have something you're working towards because that makes the saving money fund versus going just a black hole accounts and stuff for you guys to your lifestyle keeping in check like you don't need to go strap against\nNavy yeah you could up at a few a few percentage points each year as your income grows that's totally fine enjoy that because you guys are at that spot um they had that savings go once and I\nYou know we we definitely have the couple now we're like okay what do we want to save toward because again like I said it can kind of be monotonous of just putting money in savings so having those goals for you guys as a couple and as a family a Cheech and\nLaughing at least learn it's the first thing we always talk about but it's true I guess you're at a position you know it's a really cool camping because you guys have no payments and all night even help paying that much of anything that's out in a while do really the big things you can do now and vast safe for something in the short term that you guys are looking forward to and they gave her you know\nWe know Chris Rock and talks a lot about this when are you do as well I think the thing they need to do next is go to a very nice dinner\nCandlelight dinner and take a pad of paper and dream a little bit of that remain because essentially what you just laid out was dreaming yet and I think they're in the position to actually really dream\nAnd even about giving and and maybe a homestead what if that's your deal you want to buy land and what happens is now that you're in such a great position you're going to get their way faster than you fought but this is a season to dream\nAnd it and for anyone out there like this is something that couples especially if you're married ... if you're\nHere like us which I think you are you have three kids right but it's like every day it feels like your alarm goes off you wake up you drink your coffee you get ready for it to get the kids have to get them out the door and how low toward my roof you I mean there are things that you know you go home\nYou get kids going to throw in the bath tub ones running out naked you're trying to get him back in the ... mine are like my age they might like it and you finally get them in bed and you're like oh\nWhat did happen like and you could live in that state for you and you never look at the Capitol me like what we want to look like in five years and that's the fun part Chris does it and it's true in marriage you guys like you get to build your future together so\nLauren her husband need to do that debt free but also if you're in that still have those three meetings and dream because that's what you mean like what are we going to even if it's our dreams to be out of debt and Eighteen months that's an awesome dream go for it\nYeah and she can make a very key key point and I want to drive this home to folks somebody out there don't have a lot of hope and it's because you're not focused on a vision\nSo there's a psychology study up there it's a very well known and uh it's it it shows that the brain what it focuses on we tend to see you notice when we didn't see before and here's an example of the study that most people get when you go buy a car\nYou buy that car on the lot you drive it out and how many times have you done this and you see it everywhere for the next ... days have you noticed though yeah totally so that's real it's a real effect yet and what's happening is the brain has been so focused on this new car purchase you wanted if you look forward to it so much then you go buy it and you're so excited about it\nAnd then all of a sudden you never saw before\nBut it's materialize and in front of you it's always been there but you weren't focused on ... so to your point that applies to this idea of even if you're just just completely covered up and debt right now maybe your baby step one you just got to know Dave and you're you're doing the steps\nIf you can have the meaning that you talked about Rachel what it does is it allows you to see the end of the baby steps and when you can see it and focus on this desire future phrase reuse around here all the time yeah then your brain will begin to see the baby steps and the sacrifices me opportunities to do the long haul stuff to get you there\nThat's the key it's not just as fun romantic dream section it's practical it's what keeps you in the game\nOh absolutely and I said earlier on the site again something about ... around here it is for them to pay the fee you're you guys were you know wherever she said twenty twenty three you know thinking about Thirty years and you're fifty three like what do you want to ...\n... big things

the devices were made to maim or kill ABC's pair Thomas we don't know how viable\nThese devices for but I can tell you this they contain explosive material that from the NYPD and the D.C police chief so whatever this is this person to all these people who are sitting on his packages have access to explosive materials and treat it extremely seriously\nPresident Trump and the first lady spoke at the

[noise]\nBut this feels to me like somebody's putting the song somebody is really freaking desperate about the midterms somebody is really freaked out by the voter turnout in the in the early voting days are starting this week\nThe cabin offing didn't work out too well what was the other thing Chris where the Supreme Court would the cabin off thing was just a sham and embarrassing for Democrats all the way around there was a shameless\nAttempt to uh to take down Donald Trump's Supreme Court justice nominee answer make Donald Trump looked like a weirdo\n\nThe caravan ah is not exactly I don't think having the fact that a lot of Democrats were hoping for right before the election a Jew again portray Donald Trump and people who support him as being Xena phobic and racist\nAnd we want to keep America whites and we don't want no damn immigrants coming in here and that really is it having\nIt's really not having that effect does it I mean it's really got I'm having the opposite effect in in that most of us watching this caravan thing are are good of the idea that there's big money behind this\nTo create the optics\nThat Donald Trump is a racist right before the midterms\n\nIn ... uh in the um the second day or third day of early voting we have multiple bombs going out none of which explode or they are sent to\nTwo big name Democrats most of whom are even in play anymore Brock Obama Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder do not currently have\nJobs they're just a name so all they are [noise]\nAh Maxine Waters is in the news he's an idiot but she's in the news quite a bit she still relevant she's still in play if you will within our government uh but the others are are just name sex they're they're yeah they're campaigning\nFor folks but they themselves are not actively uh the help they hold no office they got no gag\nBecause when I look at things like this I tried to figure out what makes sense and as you hear me say every single time we bring up conspiracies well who who gets the payoff outta this who does this work for right don't we don't we say that every single second time\nYou know people bring up the ... nine eleven conspiracies I'm like well who benefits from that who's who who who for whom is a risk worth\nThe benefit they may receive right\nAnd if you stack all these bombs were somebody who was a craze Trump supporter Rick praised white winger and uh and they have built up and themselves a hatred of Democrats or hatred of liberal policies\n\nIt just seems to me the people they predominantly go after would be people who are still in play\nWho could actually have an impact of which Brock Obama and Hillary Clinton do not not really beyond again campaigning for people\n\nAgain given this factor these facts it just feels more to me like they're somebody is trying to have an impact on on the midterms and and it's not necessarily a crackpot right wing or it may be a crack pipe left wing or\n\nBecause as a crime parenthetically it just doesn't make any sense from the perspective of somebody who would be a Trump supporter does that make sense do you do and you're all five nine nine fifty five fifty five two one zero five nine nine fifty five

to get in touch with him what that means is there weren't any complaints about police presence prior to what teams\nWe need a little tweet now we find out\nAnd it's been confirmed from case that I first heard about this a little while ago my brother a brother in law\nUh had posted something about this that ah the San Antonio police policeman is association the union\nHad made the claim that cheap McManus or at the behest of Joaquin Castro\nThat asked his uh his patrol guys to to pull back from voting sites and then case at just a about a thirty five minutes ago a posted a story ah verifying that it was the deputy chief police chief a flavor and who who put out the directive in an email\nFor uniformed police patrol units do not to just stay away\nA from a from the early voting sites now what's interesting about this with my wife ah it used to be in retail and used to work and for some businesses in that area and this is my wife tweets may or or texts me uh I've\nWorked in that exact spot it's high crime to pay less there and AIDS cash advance in advance America all had been robbed they're always police there\nAre so it's a high crime area so now now take the high crime factor even ... even take that out of it and I don't know about you but if I'm Out of voting side and I see a cop sitting there I'm not going to blink\nEspecially this year when you have long lines people are waiting tensions may rise it it doesn't I'm not surprised at all to see a ... in fact I Would feel better seeing a cop car in the parking lot at an early voting ...\nEspecially given that

are excuse me we are on the video stream on K TSA dot com and also on the Facebook page\nAnd people are saying well as working just paranoid about cops exam the cops I don't think that has anything to do with it I think what\nDemocrats are about the business of right now is making it seem like there are issues with the voting sites and I think what Keane is about the business of making it seem like something weird is going on at these voting sites because prior to that tweet he was tweeting about it you know machines that weren't working long\nLines not enough staff to monitor the voting was taking too long and then suddenly he tweets about police presence to say about the police this isn't about democracy crumbling as he said on Monday\nA this is about Joaquin Castro being you know\nA

they can show me or did they have a lot of complaints\n\nWas the San Antonio police department are receiving yawn with canes tweaked his ... were they receiving an inordinate amount of complaints from folks in Las ... and other locations about the presence of police because if they weren't and I suspect they weren't [laughter]\nI haven't looked we've been on the air talking about early voting for three days now we haven't taken one call from people calling them saying you know it was fine but then the cop showed up and it kind of weird and now we haven't heard anything about that\n\nIn fact we've heard nothing but positive things\nApart from having to wait a little while about the voting process in these days of early voting so if there weren't a groundswell or even a significant amount of complaints from people at the voting sites on my God there's police here breathing now my neck\nThat what's happened here is one congressman complained about police presence at one site and all the cops were pulled back from all the sites\nWhich in my opinion kind of makes them less safe\n\nEither way it stinks it reeks of freaking\nPolitics [noise] two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five two one zero five nine nine thirty five fifty five [noise] uh what do you think\nPatrolling the last ...\nArea of of the early voting side which is my wife we texted me as a high crime area used to work in that area is almost cops there as a result the deputy chief of police deputy chief flavor and sent out an email all pd instructing them to pull back from all voting sites\nUnless there are there on a service called specifically [noise] and\nUh you know I to me that's not only really freak and weird\nUh because\nI I I can see that there was a ... was there like a huge influx of complaints from people\nThe department received and Joaquin Castro receive a whole bunch of complaints from people about police presence of voting sites\nBecause if that didn't happen then\nOne us congressmen I guess made a phone call and police were pulled back from every voting site in the city\n\nNow you you know for my dollar ah I think what what team is trying to do is create the idea that perception that there is a weird stuff going on with the pope at the polling science which there\nReally isn't\nAs far as I can tell as far as I mean we're just in the business of covering stuff and we haven't heard anything weird or shady going on other than walking Castro claims and what can Castro in his original tweet said he's the one you observe the police\nSo now you've got police presence

to be talking about the bomb thing all all afternoon and [noise] while that's a still a big story and we we don't have any additional updates on that though at this point fried Dennis there's nothing going on [noise]\nAnd so we uh we ended up stumbling into a story that kind of broke while we're on the air or it's from a two day old tweet from working Castro a saying that he was concerned that there were uniformed police patrolling the voting cited Los ...\nWhich is a high crime area\nApparently in the forty eight hours since he tweeted either he requested or somebody from his office requested that a cheap and ban is pull the a PD a off their patrols in these voting sites because I guess what it it intimidates people right\nAnd that's precisely what they've done I mean the deputy chief uh he's the guy who actually gave the send email out\nBut he wouldn't have been able to do that wouldn't have been able to do that I Would assume without McManus signing off on it\nSo what's going on here we've had full lines I it smells kind of shady to me honestly all of this smells like desperation to me I I I'm not a conspiracy guy but I Do believe there is a concerted effort by Democrats\nTo use bizarro techniques and tactics to try it out you know changed the outcome of this election which I think the shady or they get the more they're going to get the opposite reaction they're looking for I think that's why you have a record number\nRecord numbers of folks turning out for early voting Rene Monday and Tuesday were breaking records we're looking at numbers we hadn't seen since I think does said since twenty four team\nSlacked off a bit today which was to be expected but it'll be interesting to see if tomorrow it picks up again as a result of this story 'cause I think you all getting desperate\nAnd when Democrats get desperate they go shady [laughter] even when they're not so damn desperate they go shady but if you have you guys actually think this stuff is going to work for you I I mean I Would not late money on that I Would not two one zero five nine nine to five fifty five is Kathy Kathy how you doing\nOh I'm doing just cry when did they tell you about that I had yesterday uh my husband and I found head out to a library that as a ... a\n... yeah uh that's how my neighborhood that\nWhy we were there and there was a year the foreign to a police officer there I think he was telling me I was that the white uniform and I don't think he likes that county actually think it was a constable he was cleaning everybody ethic hey well I uh we were there for a whole hour\nBut we got up to the door and we can say exactly what what's going on body that was handicapped he was walking in and taking them to welcome to the people that say about it wouldn't have to wait on the line for an hour wow I don't see any reason for why anybody should make complaining about\nThis I don't think anybody was I think Joaquin Castro tweeted something and because even if you look at the original tweet\nHe was talking about what he observed I I I Can't believe\nThat this was any kind of a an issue where people were actually calling up the city saying hey you know all these cops patrolling use voting sites is freaking me out I I I just don't see it so that led to some leads me to think that this is a little more shady the one we're that well we understand\nWell I Hope so because I I really think that uh whichever a police are ill with out there if they were doing a wonderful job and they were doing a service All right all the ... for\nWell apparently you're not going to see any cops or anywhere near the voting science now because ah they pulled them back to stand down at the voting sites in San Antonio so I appreciate the call and thank you for your insight I mean that's that's my neighborhood is probably be the library unbend error road is probably we're all go vote on Saturday when I\nVote with my beautiful life instead of voting with Chris classical this morning as we had originally planned but I I'm just saying\nWho is intimidated is there anybody listening who is this for whom this is an honest thing that you were actually intimidated by seeing cop cars and police\nUh and voting sites I I'd be I'd be interested to hear your opinion and why that would freak you out because I have not taken the call from a single person for whom that is true about a single person on either my video streams is is is saying that it's so I tend to think I don't ... Castro didn't say he was getting complaints\nFrom folks of the voting centers about the police presence there was something he himself observed\nSo what happens so he what did they call the police department\n[noise] he didn't he said Christ that he was going to call and he was gonna call judge wealth or a judge wolf a at some point are they going to the original on Monday we're reporting that that he said he was going to call judge wolf about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "24"}
