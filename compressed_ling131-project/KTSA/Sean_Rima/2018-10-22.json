and so if there is a cozy relationship\nSo hang on this show for a long time that why are the Democrats going further out on the left why ... why do they think that's going to work\n[noise]\nUh why do they think that is going to work and I because I I ... in my mind that's the dumbest\nThing if if you get a guy elected who was a non establishment politician and not even a full bore Republicans certainly not\nAnd he's a businessman he's a businessman\nAnd he wants to bring a business ethic to the White House\nAnd that's what you elected in the ... plus he has a positive vision a positive

like you would go more towards the middle on your national platform and they've done anything but\nIt's so I I Believe that's why you're seeing what you're seeing today [noise]\nUh no I don't know we we can't you know we're not able to completely break it down as to uh you know whether this is a you know mostly\nDemocrats are that are turning out to Republicans we do have a a reports\nFrom even folks like NBC where they're saying well Republicans are outpacing Democrats in early voting um and and the NBC is not exactly a an outlet for news outlet that would be friendly to Republicans or conservatives are Trump in general\nAnd that's what they're reporting it's probably even worse for the Democrats and we know so one more is Rosa Rosa are you doing\nI'm fine how are you pretty good what are you thinking\nGreat well I went to the notion library where I usually do in my early voting rights and I walked in and the line was way all the way out the back door it was almost like the

was a very light that was like a fourth one in line and at what was interesting that was a gentleman behind me talking to someone else said well it because if Kavanaugh\nHe was judged guilty before proven innocent so I'm not voting Democrat\nThat I I think they really underestimate what a turn off that was for a whole lot of folks on their side I think\nI think so I think so yeah\nYeah you know honestly interesting wow well thank you for the inside we appreciate it sure you lock on\nRock on the I mean I think the cabin all thing as I said earlier was the nail on the coffin\nOf the of the

call up say they voted for Hillary but\nThe party's left me it's gone and some direction that I'm not comfortable with in a in a lot of people cite the Kavanaugh thing as one of the well they they say two things they cite the the uh the hypocrisy of the hatred of the left or right now\nBecause there's a lot of folks who really believe in that tolerance and respect stuff\nAnd the Kavanaugh hearing which was a just a a scam and and shady moves from the very beginning and it turned a lot of folks off and they're voting ours\nThis time out even though they're Democrats just do ...
