there and I'm like you know what you're the loud minority\n[laughter] I Know\nYou're in a loud minority that's perfect are just\nThere you know they're not the people voted okay that people who voted for Trump right and there's still bicker and about it you know and the people are and and the people or you know they what judge Kavanaugh because he's an innocent man I mean you can you can really tell from his than what he said I mean this guy is it the last time we put through the ringer\nI mean she did and this is the guy who has been through half a dozen FBI background checks which are\nMuch more in terms of an open ended than the than the probe that we just hang out\nAnd then another thing is so many people are saying well I Believe I Believe Christine whatever her name is I Believe or whatever I honestly don't believe\nI just go right I I I I'm Sorry I think it was a gender\nBy I don't either I honestly I don't know for a couple who are ... are the G largely full of crap you know and I I\nI Do and I think people I think the senators are saying no you know she obviously has been traumatized yeah ah yeah she's got the mental issues for sure but\nI mean it but I I don't think I don't think this is true and I think they're saying that they're you know they're trying to be sensitive to this lady whatever but because they don't want to get you know uh get in trouble and they were reelected\nNorth ... driven almost earlier\nYeah yeah I you know I I\nDo one thing I've learned in this ... this my didn't you know in a friend a few people but I don't care is that a lot of people in the mental health ... she's a professor professor of psychology right\nHere though is that they tend to be really messed up people themselves and I just say I mean I've met some therapists that's why I don't see it shrank man they're they're usually more needed their own services and I am there's some really people they really are\nI I'm laughing actually really hard because my mother or my mother was\nTelling me if you ever get into medicine and I did I got into medical and I tell you why am I what I Do write she said if you ever get into that and just promised me will ever get into psychology psychiatry is like ... you know they called you because you just sit there and listen to all these crazy people one of these days you drink crazy yourself\nSo if you do the crazy rubs off on you [laughter] [laughter] but I got a rough time I think anytime thank you so\nMuch cheaper to buy a new one zero five nine fifty five to pay our man [noise]\n\nMost of the mental health people I worked with were not I mean it was just notch and I don't know if it's because people who are nuts she filed\nA career in psychiatry and psychology because then people will assume they're not nuts because they're in\nThat field and secretly friction nuts you know what I'm saying to just go out there who\nAre crazy people\nTwo one zero five nine nine but he was true man to enjoy it I Know I'm paging with a broad brush cooked and say that any more there aren't the ministry broad\nUh [laughter] [noise]\nThere's Jessie you're all new start to decay Jesse now and if someone what are you vegan\n... noticed over them and you get a Supreme Court justice that does or near you think he's conservative and then he turns out to be somewhat liberal but others\nThe liberals have definitely stay mad at him to be a conservative after the way they're treated him\nYeah it was really toxic man is this this whole thing has been toxic it's the best word to describe it you know I I I think they're really screwed themselves over for November you know which is\nWhich is interesting because I was talking to Chris Chris wants to go about this earlier my producer we're talking about how you know a lot of these folks on the left are not on educated people are literate intelligent people who are completely unaware of what fools they look like him have looked like since Trump got elected it it's amazing to me\nThere are some of the Democrats are ... what I consider liberal people they really they really don't like all this violence and yelling and screaming and running people at a restaurant\nI've met people I've yeah I Know people like that you're right you're absolutely right\nThere are a little bit liberal but they're not they're not crazy allowed up like they're going to want to either lose or whether they won't even go to the polls or there'll be voting Republican\nYeah I've ... I've had quite a bit I go I tell you to tell you guys this all the time I got a lot of liberal friends just because I grew up on the east coast and Maryland a very liberal state\nAnd more than a few of them said to me you know this is this is not what why am a Democrat this I don't know who these people are they're they're uh you know there's I think I think here's what I think will happen I think a lot of folks who may even claim\nThat they're still voting for Democrats once they're in the silence and the secrecy of the voting booth they might do something completely different uh mostly\nBeauty of our system that's right and that had bad root of all sir I appreciate it to an zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five or his\nElvis Elvis how you doing\nOutstanding uh initially I ... got a lawful ride\nBush going a really great or racial or I mean I Want to put that went up there with the Emancipation Proclamation a on a set us free\nSerious or absolutely that was just a fan childlike\nDoes dot every I mean I thought it was good no no no\nBut I have a little late last night dragging the you know and I are about halfway through I was kinda like [noise]\nI mean they just take the ... you can't be quick you know they just can't be the the emancipation and they may have to pay the Emancipation Proclamation was like one page long you're going to be kept as freak and a half a world and and this you know", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "05"}
