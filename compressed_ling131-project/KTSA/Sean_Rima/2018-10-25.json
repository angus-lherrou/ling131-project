{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "A bomb march march or late for next year we that's where we're headed ... oh\nOkay so here's what I Want you to see\nFirst things first your current job I Know you're Boston it you're working hard but it's making a huge difference and in less than a year from now you're going to be debt free and then after that you're going to put an emergency fun together and get through baby step three how long do you think that's going to take\nA less than they are probably eight months ago thirty six to eight months for a good a good emerged in front of like about six months\nI agree with that Josh that's not that much time for you to bite your lip and be the study he wrote that you're being right now and get yourself set up to make this step not asleep but a step so my other question is let's focus on the future so how much experience do you have a Web design\nAll I have a lot from the past but I Do with technology everything advances All right with that I'm kind of out of the loop on that as far as the the code and stuff but\nThe one good thing I have in my corner if I'm a very quick cornered the market and I'm a film motivator still right we're not going to learn learn the stock market\nSo um but for the oh knowledge I mean I've I've got a lot of knowledge\nThat's hard for this uh Josh here's the deal so you got some experience which is great so you're you know that you've got the skill set this isn't a skill issue this was a train issue so you're the number one homework assignment\nToday is to go find out what qualifications you're going to need for the marketplace to say I'd hire Josh to do Web design that's that's number one homework assignment what additional qualifications\nSlashed training education do you need and I don't mean college because I just mean getting more equipped and getting up to date to make yourself marketable\nFind out what that is that when you find out what that is the next question is how much is this going to cost me\nFinancially then the next question\nIs based on my budget based on getting out of debt and everything that's going on in my life if it's going to cost me this much much financially how long will it take for me to complete that qualification which will then make me qualified and marketable to do the role I wanted it Josh\n... that's all you got to do because once you get the answers to those questions that's your plan\nYou understand you just\nPlug in play at this point All right to continue this much I'm going to say about this much money I take this class this course and then you begin to practice proximity and talk to people who are in the Web design space in Winston Salem North Carolina who's hiring Web designers\nOr this could be companies that hire internal people or maybe it's a marketing group Asia you begin to identify targets now this is all happening\nJosh while you're paying off debt and this current sixty five thousand dollar over time gig is not going to burn you out any more 'cause you're going to change your attitude towards gratitude which is this job is the setting me up to step easily\nAnd triumphantly into the role that I ultimately want a field do you see where that is you see that about a year from now or it may be sooner if you get the qualification sooner and you can get a Web design job that's going to pay you sixty five thousand or sixty thousand after you've paid off the debt\nIt's a game changer all of a sudden Josh you waking up on Monday morning fired up and feeling so white you're not even sure if you're sitting in the car\n[laughter] ... yeah but I mean you can see that can't you\nCan see it as as how are you saying that it makes me my my attitude trained already and I'm Glad I call Jim ... clarity that I made her\nWell listen me and I'm Glad you called because I think there are millions of people that just heard your story and they see themselves in your story\nBecause you you got it figured out and and it's just\nComing up with a basic plan Dave Ramsey has been giving people a plan for twenty five plus years\nA folks there's five stages the ... and the dream one discovery who am I what do I want to do what I Want to do next research you just heard me walk Josh through research what I Need to learn to be able to do what I Want to do then after I figure out the research what I Need to know who I Need to know\nUh when I Need to learn who I Need to know then we're going to move into\nActually embarking stepping out in making something happened practice that proximity principle get around people they're doing what you want to do get in places where what you want to do is happening that's the embarking you're gonna start knocking off those mini milestones in those goals\nYou're going to begin to achieve and as you achieve your ... going to step\nInto that dream roll the role that you were created to fill the world needs you to
