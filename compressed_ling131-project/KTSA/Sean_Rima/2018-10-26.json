I Would agree to that now we can't say I appreciate the call and we also can't take away from the guy but he's a freaking lunatic\n\nAnd he's apparently always been a lunatic he's got a rap sheet he threatened somebody with a bomb back in two thousand two long before Trump ever showed up\n[noise] uh\nSo ... for a guy like that could some of the crap where you've heard in the media over the past two years have played a part certainly it could have a ... but but again you know I I don't I\nBut [noise] yeah\nProbably a Trump supporter\nI'm you know what the van with all the stickers on it and we now are seeing a videos and photographs bobbing up and various Trump rallies\n\nBut again you know my question to you and you're going to answer you know ... if you'd like to an zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five\nDoes this guy I mean I think most reasonable people understand that this guy does not represent your your average Trump supporter of this guy doesn't represent their average human being am I trying to spin this I'm just saying I'm really not getting the sense from people\nAnd I don't certainly feel this way inside myself that this is going to affect them vote in any way shape or form ... it sucks it's unfortunate when I heard the news I was like oh God really [laughter]\nYou know and I guess the the most obvious explanation is usually the correct one and so given the list of folks that these bombs were sent to\nA it was it was more likely that the guy was going to be a Trump supporter or I as I told our buddy Jeff there I'm I'm going to leave a little space in my head for the possibility that they're going to be more to this but\nIt's not because I'm being a conspiracy theorists I'm just leaving I'm just leave me a little bit of space it might not get it for the possibility there may be more to this than we realize because the crimes themselves themselves were were extraordinarily hokey\nJust hokey just like his van is hokey\nThe bombs the the the novel lobes were hokey it just seemed to cheesy to be true so\nBut it may turn out to be that this guy is just a really crappy bomber you know I don't know how to put it but again and Chris Glasgow producer Chris and I were talking about this before I went on the air if\nYou look at the list of people that he sent the bombs to these are almost all all of these people these Thirteen individual splurge Robert De Niro freaking Hillary Clinton\n\n[noise] all of these people are not only critics of Donald Trump but all of them have called for the impeachment of Donald Trump Maxine Waters famously called on her supporters to harass cabinet members in public Robert De Niro famously I think he said there's a couple of times was going to kick Donald Trump's ass\n\nSo I'm just trying to keep it a objective here and make sure that we're we're looking at both sides of this thing I'll admit that are my initial idea that this was all a hoax was was completely wrong at least it appears to have to be that [noise]\nBut uh uh that having been said there still is something really really hokey about this guy so I don't know\nWhat will obviously learn much more about the dude over the course of the next two days\nAs we make our way through the weekend but ah you know if you want to chime in and we'll cycle back around of this do you think Donald Trump is responsible for this guy and in some way shape or form or or or just the rhetoric of the Democrats the anti Trump or is responsible for this guy\nOr ultimately is this guy responsible for his own ...

TSA known if anyone else everyone I'm Sean how you doing [noise] we got full lines were talking about some lingering questions that we\nStill have about this guy picked up in Florida and that there are things about this case it's still do not make sense\nThe guy just being a you know a rabbit Trump supporter it'd be ... there are still questions that you if you're if you're being objective you you have to have an issue with and I had some guy call up during the break that says I'm being delusional [noise]\nOf course she couldn't hang on so you know she wants to call back as cool you're set on my hands and wait for it but I I I don't think it's delusional on looking with my own eyes at various images of this man [laughter]\nAnd they don't even they don't look like individual stickers they looked like large\nPhotoshopped images that are one large sticker um\nI've done a lot of design work over the course of my adult life or designing my books and and just the graphic arts and done a lot of that stuff over the course some of my adult life and and if if these are individual stickers they are perfectly aligned\nAnd that's really freak and hard to do from a design standpoint they seem designed they seem like large stickers that this guy you know did a collage of\nAnd then had a massive sticker printed which is not doing enough itself the cheapest thing to do for a guy who was living out of its freaking van\nAh there's\nJust too perfect and there are other questions that I have I mean he's got a picture of Obama tries to go with a with a with a gun site over the guy over the guy overturn over Obama's face\nHe's got another cigarette above that with the gun side over Hillary Clinton's face you can't those are federal crimes uh\nI don't know man and then and then there's the other great then we'll go to the phones two one zero five nine nine thirty five to ... it's just to freaking perfect man\n\nAgain if their individual stickers or certainly must be pictures of this man as he was collecting these things but I can tell you just from my this is just\nMe thinking out loud here if their individual stickers for solve I Know it is really really hard to eyeball\nStickers on your car and have them turn out perfectly straight and these these stickers on this car are just they're perfectly aligned\nAnd he does have the back windows covered as well which you know again I don't know what Florida law is I don't know what it is here to this extent because I I just this stuff is just kind of coming out on the air\nBut I've always been under the impression that even if you have a band you can't in the back windows\nBlocked you have to be able to see behind you through the car or\nThe other aspect of this case it really doesn't make any sense if the guy is cognizant enough to attend Trump rallies then he knows what's going on you in the news I mean the guy's following the news right\nSo he he he is obviously aware that this is early voting week\nAnd in why [laughter] I mean it's like I say man for ethically even crazy crimes got to make sense to a certain extent okay even if you look at the craziest shoot a mob some mass killings that people have done\nThere is always some reason there was always some link whether it's a personal relationship that went south or whatever or in the crowd of people that are that are shot up\nOr you know even the guy in Austin you know I had a beef with a certain kinds of people um why if you are a Trump supporter\nWould you do this\nAt a time when you you want people to vote for Trump White white committed this crime this week it just doesn't make any sense\n\nThe guy would have to be cognizant enough to know that committing this particular crime this week could possibly have a negative impact on the on the on the midterms are Republicans\nSo again why would you do it\nJust wasn't something he just woke up one day and decided to do this is something he planned very obviously he had to get the the address is printed somewhere he had to print up those are those are printed\nAddresses on the envelopes when did they do that you know I mean where did he do that where did they get these stickers I mean there's this\nYou just didn't find them under a mushroom okay [laughter] next that battle ... old you know I mean ... does does it just doesn't make sense\nAnd I really don't think I'm I'm putting on the tin foil hat by raising these questions two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five\n\nOr here's Bill Bill how you doing\nA show that I got a couple of course the ball ...\nAt this guy is such a such a radical Democrat hater why wouldn't you make a twelve fake bombs I mean it's not that difficult to figure out how to make a bomb that works\nWell as I imagine yesterday the kid the kid in Austin was twenty three year old college dropout with as far as I can tell no electronic expertise whatsoever he's a business major and and he went online and figured out how to make bombs that actually blew up\nExactly that's what we're talking about in the toilet of total sales really I don't think so and then the other thing is there you can have a world market had walked in downtown in your head knocked up are starting to riot aid driving around in this thing and he didn't get killed\n... Scott nice ... there's no way she was I mean we don't know but I mean are you telling me this guy's been living out of this van and he's at no issues with anybody and they want it doesn't make any sense\nAt that made national news and you don't hear nothing about this guy is it stinks in the fish market brother\nSay we'll still got some questions are a little weird about this thing of course we all have concern nobody wanted to see anybody get hurt but\nI've long ago was expelled from the parents house maybe up until then he was driving their car you know living at home so there was no need to drive is banned but now you're not in the house we don't know we do know that uh and and you really think that there's some guy out there who's going to take lunch with a team\nAnd I I don't know I'm just all I'm saying I have no idea all I'm saying is that looking at the facts as we have them bus far and we'll probably learn a lot more through the weekend\nI think there are genuine questions that people are asking doesn't mean that they have an answer doesn't mean that there's anything to this guy could be exactly what he seems to be but yeah there are questions like why do this now a ...\nHow did this the van you don't you at least admit that the van looks really over the top I mean this guy\nThis man existed for at least a couple of years based upon what we're hearing and he's driving around at least at some point with with sites over over presidents heads faces on on the imagery and he'll get pulled over for that\nFreedom of speech you know and\nIt's not freedom of speech at the federal crime dude\nWell I I Know that but again you know we we should also be talking about the concerns that targets and it's almost like some of these guys are disappointed that\nYou know I'm not I'm not disappointed and explode I Am questions asked the white none of them dead but I'm Glad none of them dead and certainly we're all thankful that nobody was hurt so of course\n... well yeah and even the president said the FBI did a good job he didn't think that they in wasting their time\nThey didn't they got the guy really quickly I mean that's nobody saying that\nWell they did and so we shouldn't be glad and hope that there's no other devices\nSo I I agree I agree absolutely absolutely\nAll right thank you for letting me a jerk speak my mind\nNo I ... and I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying I'm just like the questions are there and uh obviously they were just in the first few hours after this guy's been apprehended so by Sunday night when the hell of a lot more about this dude\nAnd I and I hope that some of the questions that aren't presenting on the air our answer some kind of reasonable explanation for it because there's a lot about this just doesn't make any sense and uh I think it's fair to to see how to ask the questions ran a two one\nZero five nine nine fifty five fifty five and I don't know why my Facebook stream keeps cramping out on me to it but it keeps cramping out on me so I'll start up again here possibly in a few minutes a two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five\n[noise] uh who should we talk to next\nSchool with Bob Bob how you doing they Bob yes what do you think man\nOh here's what I Am thinking is I'm not relying on the on the media to to get it right for us [laughter] and there's just this past\nElection much bias right at all costs the ... and now we've got to lean on law enforcement and if this is where the red line is that that's mine's not toed and this is not solved\nWithout a major part in this country because if we can't trust law enforcement to get this one right who can we trust of the nation to ... a divided nation\nWell it I you know where it is specifically we're talking about the FBI in this case and the FBI you know hasn't exactly been are earning for itself a lot of high marks a over the past few years as far as how they've handled some fairly large investigations\nSummer where there is still ongoing I mean you know there's a lot of distrust mistrust around the FBI and some of its desert so\nIt's a it's a it's a tangled knot it really is man I'm just I'm going\nWith that\nLook it hit me in history when you've had other nations that have raised in the fall and then people get installed getting started\nBut ... thinks the parrot but it it happened ... ... it's not impossible\nThis is true I appreciate the call Bob you so much doing zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five will probably keep talking about this\nUh off and on\nBut I Do have some other stuff to
