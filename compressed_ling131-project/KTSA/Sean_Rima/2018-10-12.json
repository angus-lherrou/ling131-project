have a house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you\nDo how

wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nBut you wouldn't want you wouldn't come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty

it 'cause they can't move and um Long Beach harbor in Southern California and it's basically a big hotel now\nIt's all it is and you can go on there and they have parties and you can get married on it receptions and they try to they tried to dress it up as though it were back in the Nineteen whatever thirties when the queen Mary even know much about him or was when it was a big and you know huge and and um they claim to be haunted\nSo every so often they'll invite a bunch of groups on there to do things in our group got invited and we went over there and um we took our little equipment and we were wandering around all over the place and they said there's one room where we get the most complaints and we're like okay well we want to go there\nAnd they said well it starts now we don't let anybody in there and they said well can we see their own we saw they were they open it up and it's like wall to wall stuff\nAnd um you went into the room was down in the boiler room like these old ships are made and it's like a reading all over the place and taking pictures and we've got our tape recorders could the tape recorders you sit there and take by the way and you go\nHello if anyone here and you feel really stupid and then you wait for them to respond and you go if you're here what's your name\nCan you say something to us can you give us a site and then you have to if you have to go back and listen to all that stuff and usually what you hear is yourself going hello what's your name that kinda stuff I spent the night there [noise] uh\nAnd we all had rooms and I was in what was the servants quarter to a big sweet so I was sleeping in my servants quarters and about three and the clock three o'clock in the morning I heard pounding on the wall All right that's what I heard\nAnd I opened the door because I had the sort of go to a door that went into the main cabin door that went out at all so I looked out in the hallway and I saw nothing\nAnd that's the only experience I ever had heard banging on a wall and that the sun nothing saw nothing else the rest of the day we went back and looked at the data but we have the market down in the data\nMy thinking is that because they all we've invited people in somebody from the queen Mary walked by my room and what and then right that's what I think because we got no nothing else there but since sixty percent of\nPeople believe they've seen a ghost I'm just curious if as we come up to Halloween just then a couple of weeks if you have ever\nSeen a ghost heard that goes anything like that in your home or someplace else again

what are they get to the story a couple of times this week just had another time other things have gotten the in the way but if\nYou grew up in San Antonio I've lived there a long time you might find it odd when recent transplants ask about the rules and times for trick or treating people here seem to instinctively know to start trick or treating after dinner and the stop when your neighbors turn off the porch light so it's always been a fan isn't it\n[noise]\nI mean you start ... usually start trick or treating when the sun goes down when I was a kid we started when the sun went down and we walk around and when I take my kids out now to my my son my daughter ... adult um but when I take my son out now\nHe uh we'd go out to after the sun goes down and if we come across any houses that don't have their lights on or whatever we pass them by a little courtesy and all of respect and that's just those are the hard and fast rules one would think\nAll we do here have specific or ordinances outlining the specifics of trick or treating you may be surprised to learn and it's been a news a lot lately that many other communities do in fact some cities have serious consequences\nFor violating the trick or treating ordinances several North Carolina cities have age restrictions for trick or treating\nHolly springs so like a porn star name but it's actually a city uh passed an ordinance last year restricting the activity to children under the age of Thirteen in apex the city ordinance states that children must be twelve years or younger\nAnd that nobody can be out past nine pm now that sucks\n[noise]\nNow I Can't remember I was thinking about this and I've been thinking about it since I first read the story earlier this week\nI think I was Fifteen the last time I went trick or treat a I was with\nA bunch of buddies of mine and we wanted to where we were just doing it to goof around and you know we had a party to go to later on that night just a good costume party or a Halloween party and ah you know but it was later on\nAnd it was a Saturday Night so we went out just to get some candy to have something to do and to eat the candy and then afterwards we went out to the party and then after the party was over a we want it around and about ten thirty at night and a lot on o'clock at night and if we saw anybody out there with their lights on we knock on the door just to be not just to see if they were were awake\nAnd we decade but that was the last time after that it was like when I was sixteen to work and um that was kind of the end of that but the Thirteen just I don't know just a hard and fast to age like that seems bothersome and not past nine o'clock\nI mean I Will I honestly right now oh shut things down and around ten\nBecause that's why we're getting ready to go to bed right around ten o'clock so if anybody comes and that the Al Al push it later on if I'm Still up if it's a weekend you know during the week yeah I get it everybody got to be school next day that's fine but if it's a weekend friday night Saturday Night I'll push it someone knocks on the door I'll push it\nI don't have any problem with kids going out and having fun you know\nWe expect so much room when they go to Dan school now that the let them have a little fun for a while but can't do but they can but the Thirteen it just seems kind of I don't know\nUh Chesapeake, Virginia you're getting attention on social media sites for its policies the law there are states that anyone over the age of Thirteen who trick or treat can be sent to jail\nFor up to six months or or the city's websites that police will not actively seek out violations of time or jail limits for a teams who are behaving that is until eight PM\nSo if you're if you're over if you're if you're over a Thirteen after eight o'clock then the hundred that anyone who is still a lot ... than candy can face a thirty day jail sentence and fines of up to a hundred dollars\nSo if you're fourteen fourteen seems kind of young enough to ... fourteen\nAnd you're out trick or treating and it's a ... one you can get thirty days in jail and a fine of up to a hundred dollars now you've odds are you probably wouldn't get that but it's on the books so you realistically could do that\nThe same right in Newport, Virginia kids can trick or treat through the seventh grade\nTwo how old are they in the seventh grade twelve yeah when I was when I was a\nYeah when I finished seventh grade I was twelve 'cause I was Thirteen when I got out of the good so I I went up to stop the stop when I was twelve uh there were some of the great or until they turn twelve right otherwise they face a class for misdemeanor trick or treating an upper Deerfield chant township New Jersey\nLimited to children twelve years of age and younger and the following New Jersey community trick or treating stops at seven seven o'clock\nBridged in\nCommercial Deerfield hope well Lawrence Morris reversed do creek and upper Deerfield as well as the borough of shallow so everybody's trying to shut it all down\nNobody wants to get to go out and trick or treat any more I don't know what that is are they afraid of ... ... people getting poisoned\nAnd I check my kids candy when he goes out and I served ... take all the recent peanut butter cup\nFor a long time I tried to convince him that he was allergic to peanuts so you'd have to give me all the Snickers bars and re Fifteen America but my wife made me stuff and so uh you know why but either way I Wonder if you think we need restrictions like that\nAnd what they should be because I went out until I was Fifteen again and when I was Fifteen it was just goofing off at fourteen the goal was to get candy man\nI went out there and now the ... like seven o'clock\nThe lord at seven o'clock you still got two two and a half hour the good trick or treating time ahead of you you don't want to start when the sun's out\nNo Halloween costume look scarier cool in the ... you need that lighting to help you out when I was just stupid it's got a Steve on line one a Steve you're on a new start five fifty K.
