getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using this huge income you have declared this debt really really fast\nSo given those numbers I might give up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay me cash five thousand you can have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into that\nYou're going to have if you're gonna do that you're going to do it somewhere else 'cause I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and that's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's I'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that\nBrings you harm because I care about you and if

Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and I'll bet that in mind that at filling out college applications that my daughter my son's already in college and\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him into much debt already he's in two years\nA hit that he started his second year of school and my daughter was like I said in the fall that he already has a like ten thousand dollars and a and school grounds and then we have fourteen thousand an apparent python [noise]\nMhm and it so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing and how do I get them through college\nWhere is he in school ah Washington state university and kind of what is the tuition\n[noise] ah about well the first year at twenty seven oh tuition it is a around [noise] I Can't even think\nWealth eight and ... twelve thousand okay tough that probably pretty close on my pillow\nBut there should be about there in state tuition and that at school or something like that the national averages about ten but I think Washington's a little bit higher okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus\nNo he's not living on campus you know I think in the house trade paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay is working\nYeah he works about twenty five hours per week right now that he does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good [noise] okay and we got to get him on a really really tight budget and needs to be applying for scholarships left and right and you guys helping shut down and figure out what you can contribute\nTo the equation so between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really are and the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can pull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and don't add any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question as we had that we have a car loan where\nHave a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I've got he's got that parent PLUS Loan now do I start hammering on the parent PLUS Loan Oregon\nWell a camera on the car loan Carlin a car loan and then the parent plus on yes okay because I didn't know if that you know when you go down that I didn't know at the end that for kids when\nThis number five but we're not investing for ... hours trying to cash flow with them yeah help him get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of saving for college or trying to get through college now\nAnd then my daughter has starting in the fall she is selling out gosh it she does have we do have some money you know not much but a little bit of money said sure\nGood she used to work like an animal and she only out like tens of scholarship applications that day\nAnd again she chooses an inexpensive school the least expensive option possible because you guys are broken you're trying to hold us together as a family and get these two kids through school it can be done but it's going to require a lot of work a lot of scholarships and choosing the inexpensive school out here and there is no shame in that game\nTo be able to that every day and other people go a hundred dollars in debt that puts this hour that

know we're we're talking about\nAh\nWe're talking about you know that this business that America is so divided nation to fight it because that's what you're hearing from\nPoliticians with big mouths that's what you're hearing from the media class in this country that we're just at each other's throats and I really don't believe that I I just don't\nUm and the reason I don't believe that is because the people who are telling you that are themselves from a reasonably small communities of people I just mentioned the political class a ... that being you know like folks who are cabinet members who are\nUh congressmen senators\nA political activists a you know and they ... it in the country what are we Chris producers three hundred million something around them\nIn a country of three hundred million people that's a relatively small amount of folks\nAre the media by and large are against this president that's why they're engaging and things like fake news that's why they're there by us\nUh is is so obvious and and the media class also represent\nA friendship we small community of people uh in in relationship to the total population again roughly around three hundred million\nAnd if you look at a congressional ... congressional district map from ... from the election of twenty sixty a few folks have police out including\nOddly enough the Daily Kos a couple of universities to this as well\nAnd you look at the red as opposed to the blue and you're not exactly seeing a nation that has divided what you are seeing is a nation that is tired of well the political class and the media class\nUh and uh you you see a country that was actually fairly unified\nWith some exceptions you know on on both coasts a you know you you saw a lot of blue there you know in states like California will certainly wasn't the entire state a lot of the states that I've lived in Maryland and Delaware we're we're almost fully blew\nSome of the north east eastern states\nBut man is a whole lot of red and what that always told me this is why we don't we we we we killed our horn anathema to my or encourage them to to our orange\nIs that we were one of the few shows honestly on the air that was saying which I'm going to win\nHe's he's gonna witness and I based that on talking to you and I base that on folks that I was talking to off the air\nAre like sick of these lion politicians I Am so sick and tired of these empty suits who live incredibly luxurious lives on my tax dollar in that they lie to my free can face\nI Want to go I Want somebody who is not that and in in the election of Donald Trump I felt we were fairly unified country actually the ... in other words the people who are telling you that we are divided or the people who are still pissed off that they lost that election the media class\nAre royally test and they can continue to me royally passed because they can ... they called it so dramatically wrong they just got it wrong man they just all of their predictions all their commentators all their talking heads all their analysts got this election\nHorribly wrong they miss called it and they're still bud heard about that\n\nHe's still the only way way down and a lot of the folks in the political class are still a you know upset and spiteful white because they look like fools ... by merely getting elected Donald Trump made them all look like fools and like the hypocrites if they are and they hate him for it\nAnd and rather than reevaluate that and say well you know how do we do things differently next time you know what are we going
