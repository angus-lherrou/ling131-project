{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "Right [laughter] that's okay that's okay\nIn terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now he's getting all these ideas and they have now um water that active location on something like this that he's going to be facing with\nIt depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and with some tax advice to find out how it's structured ... in California as well\nThat is correct down that that's the first thing you need to figure out what the taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're going to do I would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nI mean if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just use a number okay and\nIf you if you've pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen million that you just pretend like you're not there so that makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you could buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of ... okay so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the uh in ... in the abundance\nOf counsellors there are safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors a needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer he needs a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs an investment person in his corner\nI'm ... probably you when someone else sitting there that will look at him and telling me stupid when he's being stupid and he needs to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not that do it for you but that coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing your with and that's how I get shy strict right\nAnd and I don't want you doing it by yourself because you're probably not completely equipped but we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board right we've got a CPA we gotta stay plan or we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person in the mutual funds world\nAnd then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nThey get a negative ten million dollar signing bonus and they're really good at football but they are not really good money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost and million dollars here's how you do it you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and God you as a group\nYou don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut then and they need to say they need to look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments from forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes and decides to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose at all by the ... three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah that's what I'm afraid I'm too young so don't do that you know don't don't don't open the twenty million dollar business don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business is\nVery small he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time either tortoise don't be the hair\nAnd just take your time put a group of counselors in the multitude accounts for safety put a group of counselors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak to you teach you and how old is he today\nTwenty eight so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue\nOkay yeah along the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars\nIn it'll take ten years from ... intellectually and emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all\nIf he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money\nI'm going to open a tree and a pizza parlors all gone it's all gone yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone\nIt's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it's just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree for the you know for generations to come\nBecause he's wise with it does

saying that for a long time if if Obama block Hussein Obama had had to contend with the same\nMedia that a President Trump has to contend with he he'd never would've you'd never would have been elected yeah I agree\nAnd and and so we could see during the years of Hussein Obama we could actually see what he was doing meanwhile they were telling us he was targeting the red sea and everything world hunger but we could see fast and furious we can see the IRS scandal\nWe can see a billion dollars paid\nToo I ran in the middle of the night on pallets we could see all rise scandals but they continue to tell us he's just saying that in a world owners going to end the poverty is over with the\nCrime that we can therefore that's what they were telling us to think and here you're out the opposite\nThese people we can see everything that President Trump is doing he he he's he's keeping his promises fulfilling the the economy is storing jobs are on the I mean we can see it all\nWe can actually were actually living some of the results 'cause I Know economically I'm doing a little bit better under Trump that I was under Obama just because of the tax breaks\nOur paychecks wall attend bank accounts or fatter and we can see it right it's physically manifest but meanwhile the media is telling us that you know he's a bumbling\nIdiot and there are there you stay in Corning and it's but it's laughable but we\nRarely laughable that that the chaos and the and all of that hey that anger is is ... from the left they they're all of it comes from their\n... and a lot of folks who are the loudest voices themselves are are filthy stinking rich and are doing fine no matter what the economy's doing\nThey don't have to punch a time clock they don't have to suffer the economy downturn in
