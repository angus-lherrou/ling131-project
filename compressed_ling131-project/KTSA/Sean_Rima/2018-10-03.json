you want is that where you cool with that\n... years from now when you would be cool with that [noise] [noise] yes I think I Would be\nOkay when you know hey you got to go with your\nOn that one that's the thing is like in business we would love for there to be an absolute formula that says this is always right this is always wrong there's black and white and are certainly some of that but a lot of times as business owners were making a value call there's going to be risk either way\nEither way you're going to take on risk of okay I'm going to sell it and then I'm Out like I'm Out forever I'm giving up this baby I'm getting up ownership to what the growth could be in the next three to five Fifteen Years or you could stay with it you know like men there was a risk where I gave up that awesome offer the shiny things so\nThat's the thing in business you're you're really asking Reuben I think of value decision of what do you want what's in line with your goals where you want to be in three years\nYou sit and think dreaming about something new with that often amount and your bank account or do you want to be in the business and you actually taking credit for all that growth both both to be great it's really up to ...\nGo with your heart run the scenarios use commonsense go with your heart just go to Adam is on the line in New York New York Adam how can we say\nHey guys thanks for taking my call so uh I'm In a career very started career you calm my wife and I hate or pretty much all of our data up the house and uh it's coming to the point right now where you know had the idea for the past Fifteen Years and I\nDon't know where to start to kind of watch the business ideas so what it is is I'm looking for a pet friendly public place that offers food and beverage to you know bring the community together um found a prime location um landowner one two hundred thousand a year for a leaf and basically it just kind of\nI Know there's a demand out there for it I reached search but from there don't even know where to start\nHow would you monetize this this this tale of the food and beverage just\nYeah so it would be a show of food and beverage or along with kind of like a membership fee to get inside the crime is\nJust so you can drink\nA lot of like a mix between it's a mix between like a like a gym membership and a dog park that offers just you know unlimited access to the facility but that also food and beverage is republic\nOkay I've got a question for you for this market 'cause you said you've done research he said there's demand for it for this particular market that you're going to serve that's going to pay this membership fee and so on what\nProblem or you solving for them through the fitness\n[noise] so in the area that I mean right now are they don't have any type of public access dog park for at least twenty five mile it's all private effort out rather than ...\nSo this is a dog park meets food and beverage meets tech\nYeah So Adam she's asking the core thing there is no place to take your dog isn't that the big ... you you there's no place to take your dog to run around there's no public dog park\nThat though there are um but what the town does is they're constantly limiting the hours that type of access or anything like that so this is kind of just a blend between all three I'm primarily yes dog park\nUm but then also it kind of like a gentrified type of situation where you know if I Want to go there and have some type of craft beer or food truck style food um you know all that is on premise\nI say here's what I meant challenge us Adam 'cause I Know we're running short on time I I don't think your idea is bad and you seem like you've done your research and I totally get it so I could totally see hipsters with their dogs and their laptops eat and drink and expensive ... like I can totally see what I Want to challenge you to do is\nThink of a one point of arson that's the ... version I Want you to think of what is the lowest lowest hanging fruit what is a way to baby steps away into this business without the risk and the commitment of two hundred grand that you may or may not have when the demand may not be there yet\nHow can you start desktop on the ground floor organically in a local park in your backyard or really unimpressive version to justify it gets some revenue coming in before you take the next step I just want you to prove the idea\nThat for you take out some raskin cost and that type of thing so I just want to challenge you what that's the big dream what's the ... of that dream that you could test first\nThat's really good advice dishes and I I don't know if it's a good idea but I got to give it to this might be a thing where you start to sit down with local town leaders and go hey we need a full public\nParks just for like ... no limits none of this stuff just anytime you want to show up your show that's meaning the first need then do have one of the changes that I could get a license to sell so there you go yeah rice stuff that was at one point or you got to start getting mines in the root cause the two hundred thousand dollars around it's hard\nTo get people to pay for something they set for free I don't know what it's like in New York but in Tennessee dog parks are free so\nI think he's going to sell the food and the drawl that at all yeah but people have a free paper hanging out to get food they don't have a membership I don't know I just got to understand what problem yourself informed as good like Hey Chris you write Thanksgiving on only think our producer James child today are system associate producer Zach Bennett and of course you America thank you so much\nThat Iran's which [noise]\n\n\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around

who again I I Do have a lot of affection for as a person uh I I just think we are messing with some thing because to a certain extent of trendy politics\nAnd uh individual politicians are like ah like Bush who who you know may want some kind of legacy for themselves and and they're willing to do that at the expense of a sacred ground\nThat's my thoughts humans are all five nine nine thirty five and divide doing zero five nine nine thirty five fifty five what I wanted to start off with uh the primary story that I Want to kick off with is this business of Donald Trump\nA mocking Dr Ford and mocking her account uh enter testimony ah we're we're learning all kinds of new stuff about this\nOr this woman and a and her past or in fact we have an ex boyfriend who was with her for about six years in the nineties who raised refuted much of what she testified\nOr one of the things is funding sources said\nIs that ah he ah has is aware or witnessed her ones using her training as a psychology she's a psychology professor using her training to prepare a friend to pass a polygraph exam\nWhich can be done and\nAlso a newer ah for about eight years or in total and she never mentioned to him any of the things you testified about immigrants to Brett Kavanaugh didn't mention that you knew him never mentioned that she had been the victim of a sexual assault and I can tell you and I've been through a lot of relationships man\nI'm not saying that the brag I'm just saying ... producer Chris and I I've been in a lot of freaking relationships ... in a while I'm Serious I was one of the I was one of those serial monogamous guys\nFor the most part doubled up on a couple of relationships but\nYou know for the most part I hop from relationship the relationship producer Chris I think I've only actually been single for about three years of my entire fifty one years or fifty years on earth\nOr the egg creme is looking at looking at me with disgust you should I I've only actually been single I think I did the math on at once the past twenty five years I think I've only been single for about three of them [noise]\nSo I've been a lot a lot of relationships man a lot of relationships and I can tell you that the women I was involved with a of any of them who had had some kind of a sexual assault\nOr some kind of a attack or something of that nature harassment that has been perpetrated against them you know what they told me\nDoesn't mean they told every boyfriend but if you're involved with somebody for years you find out they tell you it's just part of what being in a relationship is you end up telling each other\nBecause if you're not telling each other a squat and you're not being honest about your own background the relationship is going to last me on a couple of weeks you're in a relationship beyond the year two years three years let alone six or seven years maybe if something happened to her you know about\nIt it comes out\nAnd the fact that this guy is saying that uh you never heard about it she also never displayed and he's a fear of small spaces\nOr rooms with single exits says she testified never showed any kind of fear of flying he even said that\nAh frequently she also flew in small planes now if you have a fear of flying you're really going to have a fear of small planes\nSo I you know my estimation based upon her own statements as a doctor Ford is full of crap\nAnd let's play the audio this is or was this from Mississippi or from last night this is the president or from last night thirty six years ago this or

on FM a well seven one [noise] um\nMr Sean and I want to kind of pick up where we left off because this is this this topic a ...\nIs a at the center of a lot of things that we discuss a at a and and this idea of how do you fight but how do you how to combat\nWhere the you know politically a lot of folks who are willing to do anything to get what they want and I think through the you know obviously a we we sort of knew that about the ... a prior to the election of Donald Trump we certainly have learned that and have seen it front and center every single stinking day since then\nAnd we sure as hell obscene it since I'm Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation a ... has been or at least attempt to do even tempted to derail it through some pretty crappy tactics or the question being how do you\nFight a bunch of folks who are willing to lie a\nWho are willing to do backdoor deals were willing to smear to label a to get his nasty as they want to get you seem to have absolutely no\nShame [laughter] about their behavior and and I that's how I see\nFolks who are going after cabin I have no freaking shame whatsoever\n[noise] ah ... ... ... why is that first of all let's identify that well I'll tell you why it's because and I know this because I I Do have liberal friends\nUh who have said as much to me in that the ends justify the means that's what it is the ends justify the means it is a kind of arrogance\nA I have good friends who who were of this nature and the the arrogance is we are so right in what we want to do and we are so much smarter than everybody else that we need\nTo do whatever we have to do to accomplish what we want to accomplish a because these stupid robes are never going to see how smart we are and how correct we are outright we are\nThat's a general thought specifically or individually you have a lot of politicians on that side that I'm Sorry or scum bags but you're right they they they engage in very skinny behavior to maintain their power base don't kid yourself though there are Republicans who are just as willing to do the same thing\nI think the liberals though for them it almost seems like policy\nAt this point so how do you what do you how do you deal with that and he got a lot of these folks in the media who are absolutely no different they should cash in their journalistic ethics\nThey don't have any\nAnd the last guy I had an issue with me and he's just not the first time he's brought this up and then he knows I'm friendly with Ron Nuremberg which I Am a as a person a as a politician as the mayor of the city I of brutalized that guy on the air just like I have any other mayor I disagreed with\nUm his his argument in something I hear a lot is well we've got to start giving it back to them started gotta start giving it back to him\nAnd he mentioned you know lie cheat and steal well I don't want to be a part of any movement but that's the lie cheat and steal to get what they want if you allow yourself to become the enemy you really know freaking different\nAnd the whole thing goes spinning down the toilet [noise] ah I think there are a lot of Republicans or conservatives in general who are not willing to go there they're just not willing to go there because of their personal ethos or or whatever you want to say they're uh they're they're goodness or or their standards are\nAnd as we've seen even with guys like Islamic terrorists when you're you're fighting people who have no standards whatsoever it can be kind of a dicey thing yeah uh as far as politics in America I think Trump's\nDoing it right and this was the point I was trying to make it through the the last caller Trump's doing it\nThe ... ... mock them insult them call them out on their BS every single time and do it in very plain language\n\nAnd as you've seen it is extraordinarily effective I think one of the reasons Donald Trump has been so extraordinarily effective as a president is because that's what he does he doesn't hate them he\nDoesn't want them to die he's not holding up severed heads he's not making cancer and assassination jokes\nHe mocks them he he does what we pretty much doing this show if I think you're full of crap I'm In a mock them in a mock U and insults\nYou might call you out on your BS because prior to that are Republicans already been doing that you have Lindsey Graham last week who was a bad ass for about five minutes [laughter] you know help\nBrett Kavanaugh was a bad ass when he gave his statements on Thursday because he called them out on their best the best way to combat but yes used to combat BS\nWhip the truth and sometimes you have to do that in a very snotty way but now I'm not going to go about the business of hating people\nI have no desire especially this chapter in my life I Can't think of anybody that that I hate hate is a waste of freaking life it really really is and\nYou know there was a time in this country is that wasn't so long ago and I I'm not talking about uh

everyone else up one what are you thinking\nHigh high gas wanted [laughter] that's why they ask you what what makes you think Dr Ford is lying\nThere was nothing about her story makes sense that continues to change and there's absolutely no corroborating evidence or witness testimony\nWell if I were to tell you the story I Wonder if you thought I was lying\nIt would depend on that you made sense and if you know\nTrade sentiment your stories based consistent\nWell it's basically the same kind of story and hurt 'cause I was sexually assaulted but I Can't tell you what they what are what year it was\nWhen we were told her story not falling apart because of that stuff first story ... ... it's changing as she goes and the people that she lists who ... or ... she believe should support her testimony are actively refuting it\nWell I actually told my girl friends than I did it happen but I had not spoken to one word of that ever since it happened\nBut she didn't tell anybody and then the ... the person she didn't tell the story when she told it changes\nBut I Wonder if my friends would remember when I told them because it was actually just kind of you know under my breath jade this just happened and I want to go home you know and really you know everybody was you know pretty see but nonetheless\nYou let me ask you for it yet\nI guess what I'm asking you should we believe everybody no matter what they say\nNo but you can't just dump them because you don't like that she's on whatever side\nHas nothing to do with what side cheese on it if Kavanaugh was mostly you gotta let and let me let me respond to what you're saying if Kavanaugh was with these women are claiming him to be I wouldn't want him on the Supreme Court either\nBut all of their stories one thing that's consistent is there's no consistency and there's no corroborating evidence there is no testimony there's not as the other person and report it\nI'm not talking about being recorded I mean I'm Talking about she's with a guy for six years he didn't know anything about it she didn't she didn't manifest any of the fears listen to me she didn't listen she said she had certain fears that were effects of that attack which this guy was were there for six years is that it's absolutely not true\nOkay so I had also and you know I've been married now with a little bit over twenty five year my daughters who are adult daughter\nDid not know your husband no my husband and my husband did not know until it happened to come on the news with Kavanaugh happy\nBut what I'm saying is the daughter she testified she had a fear of flying and everybody who knows who says she has absolutely no fear of flying I mean shouldn't we also have the ability to ask critical questions I mean that's what a cop would do if you reported it they want to find out who did it\nSo they're going to try to corroborate what ... what you're saying\nI agree and I read that you have any doubt about her corroborating evidence but also there are some to appoint a degree that his story ... either\nWay I mean a story about him like why he's not a bar in that book did hit brand broke he signed a letter that some college friend produced the other day that he signed it bark\nAll right I I got to go on to pick it up right from there when I I'm just all because of heartbreak we'll talk about next on their start by the decay

not a fan of\nUh going against this thing since day one I really think there there there's trendy politics at play here\nBut you know whenever I talk about the mayor and I I've been pretty brutal to them err on the air and and let me tell you the mayor is well aware of the fact that even though he and I are acquainted and you know we're friendly with each other which we are uh I treat him like no other mayor and whether you don't treat them any differently that treat any other politician on the radio show he knows that\nBut yes I Do you know like him as a person I think he's a good person [noise] uh we\nJust disagree in a whole lot of stuff that's all and I had a guy called out of this is the second time he's called up but he says you know basically\nI should not be friends with Ron Nuremberg or because of the his policies is politics [noise]\nAnd ah you know we were talking about ... which I totally disagree with and I'll I'll get to that in the second um you're one of the things you hear over and over again as a ... conservatives need to fight to more\nOr against the left against the this progressive pseudo socialist movement that as a foot in the country today\nA look at what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh it's pretty toxic what's going on with this guy and I think it's fairly obvious to most people and the idea is that conservatives tend not to fight or get is dirty\nOr as some Democrats are willing to get and we got to start throwing it back at him\nAnd I guess this plays into even your personal relationships and who you agree to be friends with and who you're don't um I disagree with all that I mean I I Do think that Republicans need to get fights year oh hell yeah Lindsey Graham did it for about five minutes last week and you need to see more of\nThat uh I don't know if becoming equally as hateful is going to work\nA because we are dealing with a with a populist movement on the left that is extraordinarily hateful it is just buggy I hateful it ... for all the hatred\nYou know we have this uh this presidential alerts that most of our phones today and even some of the Post's I've seen a about that and had been pretty noxious\nHim pretty hateful and\nI I Believe it is true and I know I said this earlier that I've known a lot of a quote unquote liberal progressive over the course of my lifetime I grew up in the east coast a lot of people I went to high school with a lot of my friends from one of my old friends are are old school liberals\nAnd some of them you know have the idea and I think you're seeing is a play now is that there are so right about what they want to do for the country are due to the country and they're so\nConvinced of their own rightness and there are so convinced of the stupidity of anybody who disagrees with them\nThat they have elevated mirror disagreements into meaning hatred so if you disagree with me it's not merely that you disagree with me it's that you hate me\nOr conversely if ah I don't like what you believe I Need to hate you and I it's open season on you\nYou look at the president you can make assassination jokes about this president you can waste rape on his children you're gonna wish for the the White House to be burned to the ground and all that good because they're so wrong and they're evil and they want to take everybody's rights away even though it was absolutely no
