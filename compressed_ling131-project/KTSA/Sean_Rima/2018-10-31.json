always for themselves\nAnd and I think we've seen that at reach a shrill pitch over the past two years with the election of Donald Trump that's why Trump messes with them so horribly and they're\nCompletely unaware of it they think he's an idiot they think he's just a greedy business guy and uh they think the the\nThe only reason he got elected as because he he put out coding dog whistles were freaking racists a and haters and and that's why the country is in such bad shape right now and maybe you've noticed as well the\nMore they talk and the longer Trump is president the

people who are the most bought her about losing that election the press in our political\nClass the press the media and our political class\nAn end to a certain extent our celebrity class as well so

in ghosts let's put it to you that way I don't know what the hell they are and what the hell's going on but I think there's something there and we're talking about folks and I and I am I going to go on a bummer here where I Am just like a freaking chicken but I mean not a we had a lady\nUh colds a little while ago and said that her brother committed suicide and and he would continuously come into her dreams\nAnd you know I I Know that when my my brother passed a a about a month ago we flew out and that's when I was going for that where you are flaws are going to handle stuff with my mom and and my brother my other brother and stuff\nAnd my nephew picked me up from the airport my nephew is twenty three years of age to find young man obviously I've known him since he was a little baby wake me\nAnd you know we're both having a rough time of it and so we went back to his place those kind of late by the time we got back from the airport so he and I frankly just sat up and drank wine\nTo live off five in the morning and kind of talked about uh about his old man my brother you know and shared some memories and had some laughs and it was actually a really cool night it really was we really I hadn't seen him in a couple of beers\nA it was the first time where you know he's an adult so we can sit around and have your glasses of wine kill a couple of bottles of wine together\nAnd we really just had a great time and uh and and really got ourselves through you know kind of a of a tough moment [noise]\nAnd he has a shed out in the back yard where he lives where he and his buddies can go to a party and they you know they play cards and stuff and throw darts and stuff and he was showing the showing this to me\nAnd he had brought a flashlight because they couldn't get there there's a fluorescent lights in the shed\nA ... he has not been able to get to work uh we're out there and he's got the flashlights those who want to show you like three in the morning and route thirty slashing the flashlight around I'm checking it out and all of a sudden that fluorescent light just starts blinking come on for a few seconds go off for a few seconds\nThey come back on for a few seconds and as long as we were in there that light kept blinking I'm being absolutely serious\nAnd he looked at me and he kinda got shaken a bad week I my friends and I were in here the other night for two hours trying to get that light to work that light does not work we both just looked at each other and\nIt was this understanding and I almost felt the presidents like my brother was there and it was the feeling that he was a very positive feeling like wow I'm Glad you guys are together my son and my brother and you're having this moment and it just it was a very comforting\nFeeling but I definitely felt the presence of my brother in that shed and so that my nephew and he told me that if he was on the on the air right now and once we walked out of that shit that like went out and it did not come back on again\nSo I you know I Do believe that I Believe in his stuff I again I I I Can't define it ah I Can't explain it\nI have some theories with quantum physics that might or the some of the stuff might fit into but ah you know nothing is lost in the universe we do sort of know that right there nothing goes away\nReally matter energy\nIt gets old remains within whatever this is\nA and\nSo I I Do believe in and this is you know in conjunction also obviously\nWith some of my religious and spiritual beliefs that if nothing is lost in the universe including energy than I Believe would ever is going on inside of\nUs you know we call the sole color consciousness whatever you want to call it why do why would we assume that that goes away why would we assumed that when nothing else has lost\nThings merely transform why would we believe why would it make sense why would it be reasonable to believe\nThat this consciousness thing this uh again we call it the sole whatever you want to call it why would we assume that that goes away or so there's my thoughts on that two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty\nFive a here's Richard Richard how
