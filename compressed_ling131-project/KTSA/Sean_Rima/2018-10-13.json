South Carolina twenty six twenty three here at Williams rice\nStadium and it's time to take a look at the final tally of today's winning numbers brought you buy your twelve home loans dot com home of the twelve hundred dollar\nHome team discounts anytime it's victorious\nWe look at the numbers that of course we were right correct what yeah I said if we win the turnover battle we win the game and today we did when the turnover battle plus two\nUh the big one was a Oliver\nWell they're actually both were big Oliver with the interception in the end zone that does kept South Carolina from getting any points early in the game\nAnd then later on a a big pot return a great man causes the phone both Tyrone doctrine falls on it we get our first bumble recovery of the year for the Aggies and were plus two and turnovers that that was huge in the game if we're not plus two we probably don't win this game will\nJohnson he talks about the Charles Oliver interception played right into your winning numbers certainly\nDid because red zone defense is what I look at every week and I went with a today and it Caroline I got into the Aggie red zone twice and didn't score a point one of those times that means your defense one in the red zone a and they got the touchdown late but\nIf they get in there twice come away on one of those no points like they did because of the truck Oliver interception\nThose were winning number did you want to read all today got it done against the good thing or wherever we mentioned early the good team jak he's played that kind of been getting the end zone again yes once they got us out of twenty yard line didn't happen today well done by the sea and we go uh conversely Aggies go five for five uh from the red zone\nThey had they had the field so they got points when they needed them but they got that touched down when they do\nThat means read something and but this game away so that was good I said balance\nA way to get the passing rushing yards no there was a balance there but we always talk about the plays Aggies ran Seventy seven compared to fifty three for South Carolina will you kept bringing up time of possession forty one twenty nine for a and M.\nEight teams thirty one for South Carolina that's time and time again there's a there's a team that's one of the best in the country with China possession because of this style and you don't have to run the defense out there\nToo often and it it it it again it's it's it's almost like they have really adapted to this dial very well\nBut boy it is it is so refreshing to see our defense go out there in the fourth quarter and not be dragging\nI and we're we're past the halfway point of the season now so this is one in past years we struggle a little bit on defense and the second half and they look pressures daisy today when they did let them drive the link the feel most of that was with penalties and uh but uh it wasn't because they were tired and they knew they had a ten point cushion and were able to\nTo obviously when the football game though like all those penalties though no I don't like that either but\nAre they would be it would be fun to see the review and see what the Aggie coaches say in the end the tape\nA and how they respond to some of those calls because I Know I I I'm not saying anymore\nNow David ... pro injected into first quarter targeting Donovan Wilson and the fourth quarter a gets gets a targeting and it's\nHis third of the season for him but there were some I I guess I guess we'll comes to the you're talking about the efforts there execution at times but this team keeps getting better we worried oh my gosh the last two weeks drop passes oh we're going to get quarterback play we see that improvement you can improve on executions\nAnd I know we don't like the twelve penalties nobody goes I thought execution\nWas a little better today though I thought there was a proven execution wise but it's another game I think the Aggies one because of their mindset mentality under jumbo Fisher in the effort the extra effort I think it's another game they won because they\nAre so sound of mind under this head coach that has those savvy especially lake games like the word of the knock shrinking from the moment they they want this moment it's ... and the moment being getting the ball it's seven Twenty one and you said let's put a long drive together it's exactly what they did\nAnd they just drove it right down the field and for the most part uh we talked about the twenty three order to start burger but for the most part\nIt was on the ground and it's like crazy I just would not go down now I mean he just kept grinding and grabbing even on the touchdown from three yards out I mean they've got jumbo in there yeah I made that I'm Talking about the deep end right on both right and I got beat their guys and we got the three are touched down\nOn the drive the war when small hits the thirty nine yard field goal to give the Aggies the lead Trayvon's not running on that but he's protecting killing bought I told you had to be at least three times he picked up a Blitzer and gave killing some time and you said\nAnd I agree with you wholeheartedly a complete back today was another one of those examples for trade going well it's it's fun to watch fun to watch 'cause it's all about the way you know he's got great numbers I get that there'll be satisfied and I know he doesn't get his average or anything like that but they get the way that he's a big part of it and I had to be good to go in\nFrom three yards out and I think he proved as much today with a Seventy eight your day of the ... did was though some of those big numbers he put up because he's getting the hard yards now contact each do push board gets two or three\nMore and he did a lot of that today just to get to Seventy eight and that's the key in the SEC right out what can you do after you get hit at the line of scrimmage and make its second fix instead of second yeah bingo and then he will do that now that\nWe will get our final thoughts those are today's winning numbers Roger you by twelve home loans dot com for twelve hundred dollars
