I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment\nBut I've got probably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now what we're doing the show I Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need\nAnd then we make a decision whether we are going to buy new and we certainly pay cash for it\nAnd whether it's cameras are computer systems in your case it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment\nUm couple pickup trucks to do delivery and stuff around here and one bus that keeps running us between buildings but other than that we don't have any big stuff like that but still I Can't have that bus breaking down all the time but ... boss used\nDonald Harris drives our bus everyday runs us back and forth between our little shuttled between our things and it's it was a huge shuttle an unpaid attempt for what a new one the cost\nAnd it's run I mean it's broken down a couple of times when we rented a shuttle for that day when it broke down kept kept moving we'll put it in a shop and fixed it but I mean for that little bit of inconvenience it's safe and it's been reliable enough to get the job done and not shut us down\nAnd so that's a minor example but it's filling in the same metaphor and so yeah you can you can make this work by use to pay cash for your equipment otherwise all you do is work for nothing\nOh you do is end up with no money for all your work because and and the you know the heavy equipment dealer gets all your money and that just doesn't work for me I don't want to live that way Josh is in Savannah hey Josh welcome to Dave Ramsey ...\nHey Dave how are you doing\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\n[noise] so my wife and I made from Alabama or Georgia almost a year ago and we have our tags for our cars are are coming up to be here and in Alabama you

I just think it's unfair right I mean I don't know how you say it's not how you say your claim it is fair\nPhysically this is it do winning a women's cycling championship\nAnd and then claiming that people who are criticizing him are freaking phobic sin and and and we're ... and ... and I I think it's a bunch of crap\n[noise] uh you know because at that point no matter what your gender is I guess you could just compete in any sport\nThat if you're if you're a dude identifying as women classically ... you know it was a female sports and if you could mop the floor with um just 'cause you're a dude physically that's OK right\nDoes anybody who has a problem with that is just being hateful and phobic towards you I'm Sorry that's a big fat steak and crab salad sandwich right there that's right I said crap sandwich I'm back\n\nAnd it's this liberal idea and I was talking about this earlier it's kind of a liberal idea of the new liberal agenda which I I I you know we keep rocking and rolling with us because they're not gonna help you in November and it sure is that going to help\nTwenty twenty [noise] the the ... it's almost an inversion of what his classically banned the liberal agenda okay when you go back to the civil rights movement when you go back to the women\nRights movement when you go back to the gay marriage fight okay the the underlying theme of all of these great social movements and I think they all were great social movements in their time\nWas that people don't choose who they are you can't choose your skin color you can't choose your gender you can't choose your sexual preference or sexual orientation\nAnd I I Believe that you you sound like gay people like eight straight people and gay people do not choose their sexual orientation that's who you're that's just who you are\nAnd so you have this great liberal movement speaking for the voiceless and the forgotten writes\nA based upon the notion that people cannot choose who they are and yet now in the area era of Trump but it really even more so in the wake of great social and cultural victories like the first black president\nRight same sex marriage\nRatified if you will at the Supreme Court level it's almost like the liberal doubt your average liberal idiot now has\nTo find almost invent new minority groups to fight for\nThat one of the groups that they've invented to a certain extent is the transgender community\n\nWhere no it really isn't a you know you you really can choose who you are\nAnd now it's a a kind of oppression if\nA if you don't abide by everybody's choice on who they're going to be\n\nSo if you're a dude who can you know power left\nAh I don't know the eight hundred pounds or whatever the hell I don't lift heavy things why wouldn't know but if you're a due to big hairy dude\nAnd you can power lift you know a eight hundred pounds and you put on a wig and some lipstick I guess because you claim to be a check you can now compete against checks in female you know weightlifting competition says that's unfair to you\nBut I think more over what's what's even more interesting is this idea that you know the identity of now choice\nAnd it's all a choice and\nIt it's it's it's almost in complete a it it's completely the opposite of you will of what the very same folks have been claiming for a long time and an idea that actually won the day and some great social movements and cultural movements", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "15"}
