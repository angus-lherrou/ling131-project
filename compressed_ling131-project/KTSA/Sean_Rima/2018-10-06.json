proposition I have never heard that phrase ever\nYou've learned I but it's you know moving shades but I mean I was trying was motorized words right\nOkay All right getting back to the ... ...\nI think it's a great idea um especially if you have high ceilings\nOkay you have high ceilings\nAh I have my feelings but mostly among the ... of the fact I don't have any more cords or I just have more control this point that I can move my shades of low control very clean and\nThey are sleek I Will seriously gives them a motorized shades that because I think that is a very glamorous thing to have in the house\nI don't know about glamorous but I Love the idea of not having strings everywhere like you were saying the strings and chords that get tied up and they they break in yes I think that's a great idea and I've seen many houses that have um most of the houses that have those are very high dollar homes because they're not cheap\nRight yeah I'm finding out it's about three to a hundred dollars per window\nThat's a lot of money yes especially here forty or fifty windows you know a lot of cash yeah I Know you have ten that's three to a thousand dollars right so\nI'm Wondering what your a strong would be in terms of free cell whether it be any resell ... calculated resale value\n[noise] uh yeah resale value on it is going to be minimal but it's going to make the house so much faster if that's going to make any sense\nYou know in a lot of it will depend on what else you have in the home because if you have certain things it will raise like if you have granted per se that will raise that X number of hours but if you have granted you have upgraded floors cabinets and you and the um\nAppliances then it goes up exponentially because of the package\nSo if you have an upgraded house and you put them on the rise of lines in there that adds to the whole package and you can actually get more for it otherwise it just makes it it could be the difference between somebody picking that and three other homes\nYou know one thing that I have seen online recently and it's really annoyed me are articles saying putting I don't want to say solar panels on 'cause then Scott will get mad Scott it's my brother who works in solar panels\nBut I have seen a lot of articles say installed this in your home so that you can see X. amount of dollars back and a lotta times that just is not the case neighborhood by neighborhood it varies\nThat is going to be something that will definitely make your house sell faster and it definitely does add value it doesn't add the same amount of value every time\nLike what you're saying is if it's a hundred thousand dollar house it's not going to have the same amount of value was five hundred thousand dollar house or a million dollar house yeah\nI see yeah and and if it's something that you're going to enjoy like a pool\nThat is something that I see it's kind of similar which is that you're going to enjoy those lines and you're going to use them then you have an appreciation in a reason to put them in whereas if you're going to go and use put them in strictly to sell that that house than\nThan that's not the greatest investment in the world yeah exactly understand I understand okay now do you have kids or no because if you have young kids sometimes you know just the\nNot having the chords are strings saves you from having to replace them anyway or Harris sometimes\nOur our room by that eats your chords does that happen at your house it happens all the time and I get major trouble when I leave those down\nOkay\nAudrey should information\nAnytime thanks for being part of the show\nWhat a cool question I Love\nLove those motorists lines I think there's just the coolest thing ever yeah you know one of the first time since I ever saw those and which one your hands\nOh yeah that's true they those high windows now you can schedule then to you know open up at certain times a day off or if you're a block away\nFrom your house you go on your smartphone you hit a button and then you could put 'em all down\nI'm just saying I Would seriously loves\nTo be woken up by the curtains or anything I think that'd be so cool\nNo wonder you know you you I'm sure it'd be possible it's definitely possible to have motorized window I'm coverings not only the shades with the blackout curtains so when your alarm goes off at your case ten thirty in the morning\nMy six Fifteen in the morning that\nYou would wake up through the fun of me\nIs at eleven thirty so badly slander holy day and that is not true

U. I. N. C. dot com ask Glenn that's L. Y. N. N. F. L. U. I. N. C. dot com\nToday we're facing together the reality that the things we have done to provide for comfort comfortable retirement are not working for us we've been discussing a business model you can use while still working in your current W to job or running your current business\nIt's even with the new tax laws the IRS allows us to reduce our earned income tax on cash flow by taking a depreciation deduction against the property\nAnd we can avoid capital gains tax when we sell using something called at ten thirty one tax exchange ten thirty one is the part of the tax code that allows us to sell one property and buy another\nBest rolling over our gains and not paying taxes on them\nHow long can you avoid those taxes you know we have a a fun saying and real estate it's deferred deferred deferred die [laughter]\nIf you pass the property onto your children when you die they will inherit the property of what's called the stepped up basis and what that means is is that the property will be valued at its current cost basis at the time of your debt\nAnd that wipes out all of the capital gains over the life of the asset as far as the IRS is concerned you still your children still have that equity and the property but they do not have to pay the taxes on that unless they decide to sell\nNo other investment vehicle to have such a huge tax advantage and we talk a lot about legacy and that's another show but generational wealth and the ability to create generational wealth is another incredible advantage that real estate investors half\nAnd finally on my list of five reasons why real estate is the best way to create wealth and passive income is market appreciation [noise]\nReal estate typically increases in value over time that we might fluctuate in the short term and we've seen in the past recession\nBut it's forced to rise over the long term with inflation and scarcity as available land in desirable area so well stock investors live and die by market appreciation real estate investor see this as a nice bonus to pile on top of the other ways we make money [noise]\nOne thing to remember too is that even when you have a sit down and the value of your property it still rent it you still have a tendency in that property and they continue to pay their rent\nNow if that tenant loses their job as happened in the downturn\nThere are other people who are looking to rent property and in fact what most of us experienced it lifestyles unlimited is that our rents went up every year throughout the recession\nAnd we had higher cash flow than before even though our properties had lost a little bit of value at this point they have recovered and in many areas they have far exceeded the values that we had before going into the recession\nSo real estate again as a very\nForgiving and effective business model for creating wealth and passive income so you're starting to understand\nWhy delete why we believe this is the business you should use\nWe have a call from Paul in memorial city Paul I'm Glad you called how can I help you\n[noise] [noise] Hi Lynn I have a pretty basic question when you're talking about a time frame of look to to five years to utilize the

working together to adopt a new beliefs about the best way to earn the money you need to retire since our jobs are current businesses for one k.'s and other investment vehicles hasn't worked\nIn the past two segments we talked about the five reasons real estate is the most effective vehicle to create this wealth and passive income that cash flow unique to retire\nAnd then Paul called for memorial city in the last segment and asked is investing in an apartment community is the only way to retire in two to five years as a real estate investor Paul are\nYou still there yeah I Am okay thank you for holding through the break because this is a question I think that a lot of people have and and the the simplest answer is that if you have the resources\nThat will give us our starting point so if we had our starting point in our in destination we can now create a map I and that makes this journey smooth and a lot more fun than we went through the five reasons that real estate is the best way to create that wealth and passive income\n\nAnd now we're going to go through three chips to get started in the business or take your current real estate investment activities to the next level of profitability and they're really simple do the exercises\nThat we talked about throughout this show I Know who you are and what you want out of life and create a detailed vision of the lifestyle you want\nAnd find out where you're starting from that can be a little bit painful to take a look at our finances and except where we are in life\nBut if you do that the pain will be over soon because you're going to be able to move forward and create a happy healthy comfortable retirement for you and your family have so that's the first tip is just do it [laughter]\nI rip that band aid off and face it\nThe second tip is just find a community of like minded real estate investor and there's two reasons that you need to do this one is the support because the people around you are going to think you are crazy\nFor doing this why would you seek to start a different business you've spent X number of years developing your career why would you want to change now\nWell it's not going to be a sudden change it's going to be a transition and transition is actually going to be into retirement\nAnd this is the business that you're going to work on not in so that you can retire and spend more time doing the things that you want to do with the people you want to do them with on your own time frame for your own benefit right do you find that group and that group should include and this is the third ...\nIt should include successful real estate investors\nWho will provide some education and mentoring and that's usually going to be a company of some sort and you're usually going to have to pay for that education and mentoring sure you can get education and mentoring for free out there\nRight you have to go through an awful lot of information and determine which one is going to work for you and combine them into some sort of strategy or you can come to lifestyles unlimited where we have a time tested strategy over three decades\nThat will allow you to step through this and following the footsteps of successful investors who are giving back to the community\nOf investors that help them succeed\nDo ... is my mentor he's mentored all of us at lifestyle some limited and the only thing he asked of us when we're successful\nIn implementing his real estate investment model is to give back to the people coming up and that's what we do so if you have people around you who will pass back the maps and show us successful route\nTo travel to your destination\nYou have a plan\nFor where you want to go and where you're starting from and you've mapped out the route to get there\nAnd you put in the time and effort that's necessary to take that trip you are going to reach your destination and a two to five years you can reach retirement I understand we have a caller and we'll try and go there real quick and and spaces in by the end of the show high how can I help you\n[noise] All right I'm currently over seven years old and then the issues are you so it was two years

tuned in to the best\nOf the best as the Aggies gets set to take on Kentucky both these teams are on the fields fought a warm ups before they head back and listen to their respective coaches time for us to get the thoughts on this game from the head coach of the fight in Texas Aggies jumbo Fisher [noise]\nI'm excited to start this because you had told us that the special teams so close the defensive line so close you open up that when it gets Arkansas Jay Shankar but just on lows you got all the blocking that has made a great way to start a game\nThe timing was good and we had a couple of extra ... got blocked and guys came off and they know extra effort to get back into the federal I mean I'm barely got piece of the guy then that's when you get a kick out man I'm telling you they're inches away and whether it's at twenty or gained up if you're again to a hundred yards gained in ... he had enough juice to finish it also it was great and was re start to the gang he's an exciting player and a jumbo the really\nYou got all the tools to be a great player and catch it he can run and he just special teams ... did a great instinct to play football\nYou're defensive line everybody on that line the starters they all got sack they they were getting they were getting Arkansas aren't\nAnd they really didn't we had seven three announcing the game or had pressure constantly in the game I mean you get when you're getting facts from your insight I got in your house I got that makes it tough because not may not many people can do that because you know the museums that guys are pushers and all your edge guys but it it's a good mix when you can do that\nWhen the defensive line to get that kind of penetration and pressure does it help the rest of your decent\nBall lord I mean because you know do I now I guess they don't have to I'm at a book and they were determined to double him and the three technique well they did but I stayed double overtime so backers of running for eight people and kept running for re and Mac inside they were trying to do that to him and when those guys are dominant like that just freeze other people up to fill those gaps and make those that was\nThe interception by Donovan Wilson that is that that is a culmination of that entire defense in sales I gained it of\nCourse that you've got what you got to play that front of the throwing over the top he read the ... and actually got a little step on our inside a lot but he played underneath was taken and he Throws Away Donald plays role played over the top\nAnd then made a play on the ball and it wasn't a needed their steps that guy coming up into his body and there's sometimes you see guys dropped those and all of a sudden you regret those mistakes later on and you know Donna made a play on huge and it's great for our deepest to be able to steal a game and two minute like that\nI Would love to talk just about tray beyond rushing yours but one play really stands out to me the way he just clipped a blocker allowed talent to complete a pass to can Buckley that's just gone to his entire day and\nNow he's learning to be a complete players MA with our ears are still walk in the way he was not only are player the way he was a ... like the past blocking things he did and also in the run and get laid out in some of those runs for killing so he's he's become a really complete player\nHe got the two best Russia's you play against Kentucky right smell for Kentucky attribute hunger and\nYeah we do when it is I mean and that's why I say when you when you asked accessible teams are very successful were trying to get successful and be there you're able to run the football and both teams drive on that and now it's going to be an interesting contest\nYou're tested against this Kentucky all censure defense is going to be tested isn't it\nVery desperate to know what they do run run what they run very well a very efficient a passing game and then the thing about that still makes there's die as we got him\n... that was five yards I mean it's just so so many and then all of a sudden he breaks sneaky and then all of a sudden the quarterback is so dynamic till you get caught up on him and then all of a sudden here comes the quarterback personality so exposed to and I can throw it so they know what to do\nThat to mobility by Wilson their their quarterback keeps you get your attention doesn't\nOh no doubt because I mean he can take the house I mean he gets in space and even when you got guys there he can make you miss\nI was just going to ask you about how much confidence does that get a defense and we got to stop when we need to\nWell you know you can do it before there was a well I Know we can we get to say well no I Know I Can't because I went and dinner and you know being able to do something is a lot better than hoping you can do [laughter]\nYou you lose your monarch has been um but it seems like you had enough guys to step up we talked about this before you can't just take one guy ... you\nKnow we know we're mixing the ball around you know the thing about all the names and not only is packing but he did so many things as a leader that group and into blocking schemes and all the things we're using for but we got guys can do that or learn to do that and uh but you know hey losing but those guys right step up\nWhere you want to see to get a win against Kentucky and then we got to be consistent we play when we get to a fast start just like we did\nKeep great intense and they keep that execution throughout the game and learn to take the air out of things we get up to his take advantage of not give them any run the ball stop the run their downs red zone was great in that turnovers that take care of the football and we got to find ways
