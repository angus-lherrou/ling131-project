estate investor radio show\nToday we're talking about how to tackle big projects with parallel a gigantic ... process of\nTurning my home around after letting it get out of control for a whole year at least six months' worth of not taking care of me to any of the whole year's worth of natural annual maintenance\nAnd the fact that we want to improve some of the problems that we have so that you know our main play and we went from having a property that every single year fifty percent of the stuff died because of the tropical where it was an annual players to trends freeing that are changing that\nWhole bunch of stuff it's ineffective that needs to be changed into effective system the fact of personnel and systems you know you hear it all the time\nI'm On a new show um forgot\nThe name to show that he's always talking about it's people in process people in front of the profit that it's people in process people in process so we don't have the right process going on no matter how hard you work it isn't going to get you where you want to be people if you got the wrong people helping you the wrong people working with you wrong people working for you\nIsn't going to get done the last thing you need to keep in mind is\nEven though you got the wrong plan and you're working at it doing more of what does it work isn't going to get you to a better place you know I was trying to throw more and more and more landscape and half of the plans would die I put more in there\nAnd that was an effective that's just like throwing good money after bad as they talk about it and many people end up in that same situation where they're throwing good money after bad so let's go through the process again one more time here in the last segment step number one you need a master plan\nFor you your family needs a master financial plan what is our plan what are we going to do the right or we ate Dave Ramsey family we're we're going to work double jobs eat beans and rice save our money get out of debt and they put all of our money and mutual funds and work until we're sixty five or Seventy\nAnd then hopefully retire is that your plant the next plan or is it the lifestyles player I'm going to get in here\nI'm going to solve all my water leaks first of all my problems money's going on in my life I'm going to take the assets that have happened I'm going to turn them around or put them into effective\nOr investments that makes me money and I'm going to double my wealth or they annual to by air and you are twice every two year basis maybe five years but one of the thing is for sure I'm going to retire\nHabit of passion and come to retire within five to seven years now if you listened my radio show all the time you see people all the time telling me do I did it and two I did it three\nYes but I'm saying to you our players decided to take anybody out there that will do what we say to do follow it specifically use the right people in the process\nFollower process used the right people in the process and do we tell you to do most people should be able to replace the hurting the income\nWith passionate young within five to seven years at the actual them inside of the equation like I said many other people so after we had the master plan actually when you do a segment our problem so is your problem your spouse does your spouse\nAnd all the money or broke is your problem if you're up you're headed that you have bad credit and you can't go do anything because you have bad credit\nIs that part of the problem is that what are your problems is that you have no money because you suck all your money to pay off your house and that are in that money's already knew nothing he's put all your body to four one K. that money's early you nothing let me clarify that for a second I'm Talking about it pay you every month so you don't have to go to work your poor when kids will pay you you're paying\nIt it is it solving a problem say they with your IRA\nYou're paid in full house is not earning you encountered that still cost you money taxes insurance maintenance repair every year your money is in places where it earned you know the average American earns less than one percent return on their tired network per year less than one percent per year they're tired of where\nWhat a waste so we'd break these things down segment of the problems and figure out is that our expense side or income side\nIs it some of the stuff we already have is not working as well just should be we need to fix it we've got all these temporary next what we do is we isolate each one of those areas and find out what the problems are within that area and how we can maximize that area we do that at each and every area like I said I have ten different ones I have ten different um\nProblems going on at the same time ten different that's not the right thing tend to projects going on at the same time along with my home the construction maintaining the exterior my whole my roof and so forth so there's lots of balls lots of isolation isolated areas and many of them once I get 'em fixed they don't have to deal with them for six months to a year\nYou if you served in your life isolate the problem next solve the problem\nAt last what's the problem solve started new project get yourself out there with the goal ended up better next year and every year for the rest of your life that's the key if you start now continue to grow each and every year between\nThree and seven years five and seven years whatever number you want to go after depending on where you're at you should be able to retire remember\nNot just money it's a lifestyle have Gray Davis you tomorrow\nThanks for listening to the lifestyles unlimited real estate investor radio show whenever that this show is for
