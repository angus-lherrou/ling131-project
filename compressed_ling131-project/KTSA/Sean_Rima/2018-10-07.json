things and you know it's interesting that you called on this because this is actually what we're going to talk about the whole program\nI guess I better [laughter]\nBut a call our office the offices are the numbers to one oh three for one to five six nine and let us give me an evaluation of this and we have the latest with the ... element it's just a is it is one of those the fabulous\nI'm scanning devices that gets us all kinds of information um we have technology that is so good\nAnd we can give you a very good\nThe diagnosis very easily and or just give us a call the number is ... when I\nTalk about all kinds of things we do you think it is so far away for\nWell that doesn't matter when you get the results the distance does it matter results and everything\nSo you will talk about a\n... yes yes and also it\nAlso on our office is a ... a new associated Dr Williams and Mark Williams in his phenomenal he's won all kind of awards has gone through school this\nAll this from UT Austin on forward with a a average is all the way through is just marvelous and he has a great um kindness very kind a gentle way I Would really love meeting him\nSounding too I Love the show Dr\n... thank you very much for calling and let us hear from you\nThank you bye [noise]\nOkay so that was interesting so we are that's exactly what we're going to talk about the day and the reason being that I'm\nYou're seeing probably a lot on TV about mail order orthodontics well what a novel idea you can get everything else from Amazon so\nWhy not Arthur ...\nTreatment [laughter] you know they say they can do everything else so [noise] so we're going to talk about that and uh\nWe want to start our program talking about this amazing talk technology that's available with invest salon clear liners and it's it's a wonderful process\nCan accelerate in fact there are two processes to accelerate orthodontics movement actually they're more but there's the practicality they're only ... there are only two really practical\nSystems that accelerate\nAre the clear line or movement of tea and to a fraction of the time that normally is designed by the dentist are by an orthodontist for unorthodox in that case to straighten the person's steep\nSo let's start our discussion with the beginning of why consider straightening your teeth with the line ... in the first place and back to our caller's question a age doesn't have anything to do with it we've had some very um\nAnd it improper swallowing patterns which are called mile functional swallowing\nAnd its stress that can really move the teeth around this is uh\nBig problem and you wouldn't think swallowing but then when you put it into a fact that you swallow two thousand times a day\nAnd you just have a very few ounces of pressure when you add it up it's a matter of towns that are moving those teeth and causes all kinds of problems from not being able to wear dentures properly from not being able to breathe properly a it's a huge problem\nAnd then something that happens with the teeth is wearing of mended your advanced meant devices these ... these are designed to help correct sleep breathing problems like sleep apnea\nOr sleep disordered breathing and these appliances are great they solve the problem but at the same time there are no effect after Arthur dynamic appliances and they moved the teeth all over the place and they have to be carefully monitored you can't just put it that a man they beat her appliance and\nAnd forget about it and sell\n\nFood habits that can dissolve the teeth ... talk about that a little bit\nSure so we see a soda for instance of something with the low ph meaning highest city things like that can dissolve the food and uh you ... a city with aggressive tooth brushing habits that's even worse\nAlso sports strings sure Gatorade ... three point five to ... about five point five so you are really at risk when you drink these uh sports drinks and these monster drinks in monster caffeine drinks\nAnd then if you have to swear plus you're exposed to dietary asked that it's even worse because the enter the tooth called the Denton is more susceptible to asset erosion than the outer right so that inner layers exposed and you're exposed to a specific food stuff then you're really at risk\nAnd then of course there's to damage from aesthetic I mean from accidents a which happens and then there's that ... and\nIf people usually want their teeth straight in for the aesthetics but actually from the dental aspect that's really the very last one that we should be looking at and the reason being we want to preserve the teeth we want to preserve the gums\nBecause if you have did it for looking teeth and don't pay any attention to that you're going to be the loser and that's what these mail order things um you're taking a very uh interesting risk\nWhen you\nHave something mail order to you and don't have any follow up and you haven't addressed any of these issues that we're just talking about my gosh why would you want to do that why in the world would you consider a mail order that this our mail order dentistry\nTalking about a destructive exposure 'em and talk about buyer beware mhm that's that's that's amazing [noise] um and it's\nJust different so if you have orthodontics supervised by a dentist they have all your current X rays have done a meticulous dental exam they kinda know all of you\nIf you're doing it would be a mail order system either you're going to a center where they're scanned in your mouth or you can even make an impression at home and that gets mailed to the people who manufacture the trays but there's nobody who's really providing it with a comprehensive don't treatment\nAnd none of these factors that we're talking about that are also health factors\nAnd health um health um\nYou you're missing out on getting those healthy issue or health issues around teeth not being addressed and you can wind up with pretty teeth but a a terrific amount of\nUh a lot of problems so we want you to what we want to point this out because it was raised by a color and them ... you're going to see I was saying this advertising all the time on these very expensive ads on prime time television\nUm I was just marvelous um you can get your ... you get scanned and get your teeth is out of mosques\nAnd the ideal is it's quite a bit less expensive than yeah wrecked dinners didn't just to see a big eyes yeah to be but then\nAt the end you're going to wind up possibility with a huge problem in a huge expanse trying to maybe straight and a lot of things out that we're not addressed\nSo that's why we want you to consider a dentist and consider our office\nAnd we'd never going to give you a mail order\nA set of uh liners and uh our office is Dr ... Williamson and our numbers to one oh three four one what five sixty nine to one oh three four one twenty nine sixty nine\nAnd just to play devil's advocate I think there's probably a small subset of people for whom these mail order liners work yes that'd be somebody who has great oral hygiene know dental decay\nIs going to be a hundred percent compliant where the airliners twenty three hours a day doesn't need a lot of follow up care and maybe has one or two teeth yellow winter ... yeah that sort of thing so that's not going to represent the majority of the people seeking orthodontics treatment\nThis is true but at the same time if you look at it over a period or where are you going to be in Fifteen in ten years Fifteen Years Twenty years I'm ... without any supervision when it isn't that I'm not a good idea yeah there really isn't because again we go back to the fact that you're cases in the last ... plus years\nBut they need help they need\nRepair they needed to look at your teeth can't repair themselves\nAnd you can't chew with your teeth without accumulating some damage in ... in and of course feelings or problem especially the over mercury filling\nUs out again the next question is why didn't the world would you even consider mail ordered industry\nSo I just wanted to in the light and you on the entire process straightening teeth\nAnd age is not a a a limitation um [noise] so now back to the to straightening accelerant so this is an interesting field or talking about accelerant ... so the typical\nA line or case is designed to change these are liners every two weeks that's not a bad deal\nAnd uh however how ever\nA there's a big seller rent number one and it's a micro osteoarthritis preparations like that as big as a a pin head preparation in the bone between the two chief it's painless because of topical anesthetic is used\nAnd it uses and the old principle of generating what we called cytokines that start\nHealing and with that the bones starts moving painless me and accelerates the time to wear ... raised by fifty percent that is instead of every two weeks you're going to change trays every week\nAnd it's funny or the word inflammation has kind of a bad connotation but in this sense we're actually utilizing the inflammatory response to accelerate the orthodox treatment\nGood point now then accelerant number two and this is a light\nIn an easily held device that's placed on the teeth for five minutes per day at home and then on the upper teeth\nAre and then five minutes a day on the lower ... so you're going to take this light this hand held light and put it on the teeth for five minutes and the upper teeth and then you're going to reverse it and put it in five minutes a day on the lower teeth\nAnd the clear or liner trays with this system or then changed about every three point five days so instead of\nA fourteen day on line or change it has dropped to three point five with this makes it so much easier so you can get out of it in and out of your\nUh invest salon case or you clear line or case in just a very short time and it's safe it doesn't hurt that it doesn't hurt the roots which happens with sometimes with metal um pressures\nAre measured metal I'm orthodox so it's an incredibly it's an incredible and safe accelerant snow\nI Would add in the technology is very cool so he ... with your smartphone it can remind you know when you do it can track your progress it actually can tell your dentist how often you're using the tray mhm that's a really neat thing technologically\nAnd this is a system that's been used in medicine for a long time to heal bones so it's not anything new and it's been recently made have been available to the dentist and assistant is called off though pulse if you're looking for a name Arthur ... is the name to be used with a clear line or see the invisible line or that clear\nConnect uh uh liners and I'm\nAlso it's being used with author Don is the author Don is really embracing it and they're using it with wire or if\nWho have said and they have a reason to say this as far as that technical aspect and they say that you're all health shows no cause assertive effect on any systemic\nOr they were to dental schools that are the oral surgeons and they say in a different the vote in the dental school ...\n... they did this and they wrote it up in the journal of the American dental association there was a response and then it was a response by multiple dental schools and the dentist of those dental schools challenging that\nWell I can tell you and the problem is we as a dentist looked at a lot of subjective things that is if a person comes in with the access to and they've\nGot a large swelling where that too is um that's called a subjective mhm observation mhm\nIt is not a scientific out surveys you write that right that's right and my ... ... s yard [laughter] you know this is what's so confusing to the public when they've written you're going to read an article 'cause this\nJust came out in August of the journal saying and the media is going to pick up at the end say oral health has no impact on general ... al ...\nWhich is not right right but you can't prove it because you're not going to create\nA oral health problem and monitor a ... a heart for instance\nOur brain abscess you you're not going to you're not going to do that and it would be an unethical study yeah so this is the trap that you fall in when you read these things and that's why you need to listen to this program so we can help you make decisions on this because if you don't say you come in with an\nAd swollen abscess are are swelling in your gums where you have it to its abscess\nAnd you don't do anything about it um you're running a risk of going into a severe infection that can be pneumonia which takes older people out a pneumonia just to that always makes older people because that's a pretty much isn't that a common in the mouth mhm\nAre you're going to have pathogenic bacteria that go down your throat which you into in ICU situation\nOh yes and what we see a lot of times the airway get swollen yes due to an infection that originated in the ... and then you can't breathe he can't swallow it's a major major issue\nSo when we read these articles and they say oral health doesn't have any connection to general health um\nGive us a call [laughter] let us help you with this are listen to this better yet always listen to this program 'cause we try to steer you in to\nThe information and show you why this is not something to ignore\nI Would also bring up the point for those people who have prosthetics joints knees a lot of time off\nAnd when those prosthetic needs fail a lot of times they find oral bacteria and those joints in for that reason a lot of the what the ... surgeons recommendations take antibiotics before they're dental exams so that's more evidence that there is in a world systemic and a connection\nThe same goes true that its record recommended that you get all of your dental treatment done before you go into the chemotherapy mhm or radiation therapy for cancer mhm\n[noise] well [laughter] um [noise]\nThis is this is this is so um\nWe ... we just want you to understand that your oral health is really important\nAnd um you're going to read things that might be contrary to that\nBut uh you give us a call and let us help you sort through these issues and um you will see we can give your data that uh would counteract no yes we cannot prove it\nBut at the same time we can give you a direction that will leave absolutely no doubt and then you need to have oral health in first class condition\nI Would bring up the point even if we're just being sort of superficial wearing wearing inflammation that kind of thing people need food to eat and you know nourishment is so important is to stomach health\nIf you have a poorly functioning ... it's hard to eat all the healthy foods the fibers foods and stuff that really requires a lot of chewing for she just can't do it with a worn out to eat missing teeth et cetera\nSo to me that's more evidence that dental health is huge\nAnd then what Dr Williams and I are in the process of doing is setting up\nA ... a good direction to where if you're facing retirement and five ten or Fifteen Years [noise] will help you design a program 'cause we have all these prevent it things now the silver damning Flora and the low lows uh things the\nIcon a resident profusion we have so many we have these wonderful\nPreventive things that we can put you into a preventive holding pattern for several months even a year or two and you can work on getting your mouth\nRestored and then by doing that in ... basing at your expense is you're not hit when you retire and you think you're going to have all this time in\nA possibly money and we see people who do that and they come in with just a disaster and it's it gets very expensive so this is something that uh we're going to talk a lot about and it's a yeah we want you to\nUtilize the services again one oh three four one twenty five six nine Dr ... in Williamson we'll talk to

emotional about it and\nAnd and all of that but but ultimately physically no one is physically like you so when you come in we treat you like that\nYou're not a cookie cutter we're going to see what's going on structurally assess your posture assessed your structure see what's going on with your body and see what we can do to help you\nThat's the great new so you can call my office right now for a complete evaluation tire practically a generation chiropractic and instead of the normal to sixty three forty depending on X rays how many and how much\nIt's only forty nine when you call right now to one oh six nine nine zero five hundred\nTwo one zero six nine nine zero five zero zero I Know you might be thinking okay what are the three strategies what are the three tools I'm gonna wait 'til I hear those to see what I Want to do or see how I Want to help or anything like that I'm going to let you know we've limited it this week to only the next five callers we have specific times this week\nWe have patients they call every single day to come into our office they pay full fees\nThey find on insurance doesn't cover everything\n... there's not really any insurance does that cover X rays these days\nOr the exam so the first visit is usually the full feed them eat your deductible or to meet your co pay or to find out later on the insurance wasn't going to cover it or to find out it wasn't something that they wouldn't want to do we know that your premiums go up in your coverage is are going down we know that insurance is limited and we know that it's not really invested in your health\nEven though it's called health insurance\nIt's not really health insurance it's sick insurance isn't it you know life insurance doesn't cover vitality pills and anti aging creams does it\nWhy is that because life insurance is to ensure the loss of life\nWell health insurance is into is to ensure the losses health so that's why it will pay half a million dollars for cancer or three hundred thousand for a heart attack incident that's why it will pay tens of thousands for medications monthly for rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune conditions but that's also why it will not cover\nNatural organic cooking classes gym memberships and really truly getting wildlife structural alignment\nNow I I preface that by telling you insurance is terrible but some insurance is do cover care so bring your cart and will cover it we'll see what it'll cover will do what's called an in depth verification or between your first and second visit to let you know what they'll cover for future care\nSo that way you'll know up front we like to give our patients the peace of mind isn't that cool like instead of you go to a doctor and then you find out later up it insurance wasn't going to cover it or they just tell you flat out insurance is going to cover this so we're not going to check it and that kind of thing so regardless of whether insurance makes it affordable or not let me give you\nPeace of mind that we do make it affordable almost all of our patients juice either not use their insurance or use it in a very limited format we take health savings flex spending we have all different other unique ways to help you afford the care that you really truly\nWhat it's called need not always want you know we all want that quick fix don't we we all want that that medication if you don't want that medication you want that massage if you don't want that massage you want that ... meant you want the thing that's just going to get you a better you want to watch that next year or two but here's the idea if you go to some like a success expert and you're like\nHey I haven't been successful in business for the last Twenty years but what I Want to do\nIs I Want to go to one course one seminar and I want to leave that seminar and be all better I Want to I Want to know everything I Want to be a successful magnet and I want to know everything and they would laugh you out of there they would probably take your money but they would laugh you out of there because everyone knows that success in your life is something that's a journey\nAnd not a destination and something you continue to build towards not something you you're good\nYou know that's that's like the quote on quote good right\nYou ever been at church and yeah somebody how you doing today and you really wondering and I say good you and you're like no but really have you ever taken that second I Want to inspire you to day if you did that earlier today at church on Sunday Morning and you're going back later this afternoon or maybe you just need a ...\nReally how're you doing I really want to know and Texas cool we know that's awesome and we know that they get read but give them a call and see how they're really doing\nAnd so in my office I feel like that's that's where we really come from you know that superficial stuff of hearing the whole\nCommercial that you give every doctor I'm just going to be direct like I like I said it's called real talk with Dr Josh not you know facade and not what you've been telling everyone else I like to say well you've been doing has gotten you what you've done\nNow that's not proper English but it kind of relates you know in regards to the fact that if you keep doing what you've always done you will continue getting what you've always gotten or got whatever it might be if I have an English teachers I don't want to break her for the right now but let's let's just think about that for a second\nIf you've gone to doctors and told them your same old story\nYou got the same old thing from them\nAnd what we want to make sure we do is create a different experience on your first visit in the office so when you call our number two one oh six nine nine zero five hundred right now to come in a generation chiropractic you can check out online reviews about us and really check out what's going on\nWhen we check out what's going on we're going to give you a different experience you're going to bring in your application for care completely filled out when you come in so we can know what's going on so we can spend our time really digging in versus getting into the superficial stuff and being\nHey how you doing good you\nSo we know that you're probably coming in our office and you're not quote good and so we want to help you not only be good let's get back to a good first but get to great you know I had a pastor coming um office years ago and he said you know what Dr Josh I'm no good to my family or to God and my purpose if I'm sick\nIf I'm less than my best or if I'm dead\nSo I really need to get my lifestyle right you know as we as we realize these things we know that we get on an airplane and go on vacation these holidays and this and the flight attendants going to give us the most amazing life advice we could ever get\nWhich is this is the mask drops down from the ceiling you don't save everyone else first who do you say first\nYourself and why so you can help everyone else that is why you save yourself first so so you can't really help that many people if you're not even breathe than if you're sucking for air\nYou know what I mean that's why I say like money's not an evil thing when it comes down to it you know sometimes it gets that connotation and churches and religion today that money is evil and that's not actually the truth lots of amazing things have been done with money and and what I call resources so whether that's money great but sometimes the greatest resource you have the time\nAnd the other greatest resource you have is passion and energy\nAnd if you're living life with low energy if you're not sleeping well because your nurse systems\nResearch getting and going off and if you're in pain that's shrinking your brain is tripling your nervous system up it's affecting your body and ways physically you don't understand until\nDown the road if you're just fighting for air with your health right now I imagine it in five or ten years can you just think about that for a second I'm not asking you close your eyes if you're driving right now but just in vision your life from a ten thousand foot view looking down at your life from where you are now what's the lead you to where you are now and where you're going\nAnd what I'm giving you right now as an opportunity\nAn opportunity for breakthrough with your health whether it's low energy bad thyroid function poor fleet\nWhether it's bad focus attention in memory when do you think that you're heading down that way of dementia and Alzheimer's or some timers or senior item or whatever you want to joke about you know it's not really oh as a joke is it when you when you say that stuff you put this out there\nSo that people don't really get through that hard shell you put on when it comes to your health if they really knew what was going on that you got it on your knees at night and pray for your daughter's health because he's dealing with a child with autism\nBecause you you really really are getting down on your knees or night praying for an answer for your wife's immune system that's been completely destroyed and you've tried everything doctor said that you had to go get this removed and is taken off in east chemo pills and you see your hair falling out if your if your husband is dealing with diabetes to the point where his neuropathy is so bad he's angry you every night\nLiterally angry with you every night and and it'd be it's because he's in so much pain it doesn't justify it doesn't make it okay but like what if you could do something about it now and there's this thing called the point of no return\nThe point of no return it's it's from a a\nA actually is from two things the point of no return is is\nA term used for mountains so you get to the point of no return there's no oxygen past that point so you need to have masks and if you get to the point in our turn this is the best analogy and what's what it's used for the point in return when you lead up to a waterfall so there's always a point where you can turn around and if you're going down the wrong river\nOr of dance Jackson and for ten so a family practice and a wellness center and the uh uh we've been running a great allergy program and Ryan runs that for me very effectively and wonderfully so wryness here today and so how are you doing everything a\nGoing away you happy to be on radio and happy\nThat radio for the first time experience so I'm excited to be here if you don't have food\nGood love it well we have to enjoy it had any over there at that point I thought that Ryan would be fantastic to come and talk with me today is Ryan is extremely knowledgeable\nSo you know when we talk about allergies in especially in San Antonio there's there's a lot and when we see patients and we get allergy results back\nWe have a full page usually of ah you know allergies that we need to treat but there's a lot of this and a lot of things that you know ... maybe scare patients are patients just don't understand so I'm going to clarify few things I think one thing that I really want to clarify\nIs that an allergy treatment as a natural treatment\nSo that the you know allergies or you know a lot of people will go to the pharmacy and they'll buy a nasal spray and a ... or you know all kinds of minerals all kinds of medications and\nAnd will treat themselves and and there's a lot of uh you know sign his fight us and bronchitis and things like that that build up\nThere's a lot of time last from work and school so it's a very expensive problem and you know for the United states it's a very a a huge burden on on the medical system\nAnd so I think when patients think about trading at in and when we talk about allergy treatment most people think well I've got to go to my allergist or to an end tea and you know had no you can come see your primary care doctor Dr ... allergies downright Ryan so\nWe know it's interesting Dr ... is a lot of fishing who told me well I'm actually fine I took him a leg or every day and that totally picture my problems were taking nasal spray\nAnd I feel great with the don't realize what they're doing it there masking their symptoms\nAnd how to use it of allergies is still progressed and under the radar they're still going to feel crummy once as medication system right while you're offering ... her clinic is actually a pretty much er er during the long term treatment for these patients it's right up to Fifteen Years of symptom relief after that and with the treatment you do at your office\nThat's incredibly ticket that from a bottle or from other from our just that they're just going to be a bunch of pills\nThat's right so when you when the end I think it's incredibly important what you just said it's a it's a curious not sure it's a it's a long term remission\nAnd the freedom as amazing now I went through allergy treatment a couple of years ago just to see I never I never do anything at the clinic that I don't ... I don't try\nAnd so I went through the allergy treatment and I am still this is five years out or so I'm Still pretty much allergy free and so by by the all of those prescriptions and see I'm a doctor and they'll sinus problems and whatnot of\nYou know and I the is freedom and and I love that feeling but I think what what would you say is probably the biggest myth or maybe at the top three biggest nuts and concerns that patients have that might keep them from actually seeking allergy treatments\n[noise] there's a couple of the first one I hear the most common one is I don't have allergies right\nWe are we ... we look over patient population of the quick to come and we we screen them for allergies because a lotta fishers who don't recognize what they're doing with is not something they have to live with forever right let us have no idea and some of the symptoms there's mental fog there's the ... and you don't sleep really great with allergy sometimes\nThings beyond just the stuffy nose runny nose watery eyes that's the only part a fraction of the equation yeah the other thing is uh twenty or Thirty years ago the allergy tests on your back your individual ... sitting there for a long time it was\nReally traumatized experience we use plastic applicators would do on your arm you get to see what's going on while they're supposed to developing\nThat the results real time is not a scary process for you and it\nDoesn't hurt allergy testing to an even kids we can do kids and kids don't get it and scream and cry I think it's a little bit and that's the biggest problem honestly it's not a painful process absolutely right\nAnd so well in I interrupted you apologize that um that I was going to mention uh the first thing you said about\nUh about you know a patience and and uh it kinda that denial and whatnot and that mental fog and the secondary consequences of have an allergy is there a lot of children who are diagnosed with ADD\nThat are ADHD that actually have asthma and allergies and when they get that treated they actually are clear and can perform at school and don't have to be on ADD medications which are you know fraught with side effects and problems so there so\nThat was you know one of the things that came to mind when you mentioned that\nOther things would be a fight affects those antihistamines are taking right order masking their symptoms of them have fatigue ... side effects for example for his or her\nRights right they wouldn't brings they will not let pilots\nTake or tech actually because of the fact that there is some secondary fatigue from that and I've taken or take before too and falling asleep on plenty of patients so I Know [laughter] it's a definite and\nBut yeah so there are side effects of those medications and and you're right you you're masking symptoms you're not feeling better you're not carrying anything so really I think it's it's very important and one of the things that I've been looking into lately and I don't really have a lot of uh\nYou know medical evidence or scientific evidence behind this and you've heard me\nSay before at the clinic that I think there's a tight end to auto immunity with having allergy problems and it's actually in integrative medicine\nNow as theory that allergies and asthma are an auto immune problem and so I think that opens the door and leads to other auto immune problems so rheumatoid arthritis or anything at all the way to multiple sclerosis I think this is a tie in all and food allergies and whatnot so this is a tie into all of that\nAnd it's a much bigger problem than people are aware so treating your allergies is not just treating it like you say a stuffy nose\nOr sneeze it is treating some significance to sleep and memory problems work problems and and uh some very expensive medication habits and whatnot so and truly important so if a patient comes to my office or to get algae treatment how does it work what happens\nSo I'm Glad you asked that question so one of the things I Love most by your practice ... just the individualized care your patients receive\nAnd I make sure that every person walks through those doors just feels great about the fact that he you know there's a problem we have to have a really good solution for you [noise] first up is getting them identify what I thought a forum that race we ask them about their symptoms of medication use helps us to know because as a person that could benefit from some sort of a different treatment beyond what they're doing\nGenerally you identify those people in them so here I don't want you to come and talk to this ... I think there's an allergy problem with getting tested right to know that we like to test in her office before we treat anybody of course let's get in touch with us identify with that process is going to talk to them I Would verify their insurance benefits before they even\nDo anything with us and I let them know exactly what the cost is going to be right then they come in from out in the office they sit down with me it's about an hour long process to go over some paperwork stuff\nWe discuss their benefits I'm going to be actual test the test itself I guess that is done on your arms it takes about Fifteen minutes for it to develop\nA little plastic applicators I step on the patient skin and I love the liquid extract\nFrom those tests just sit on their skin for Fifteen minutes\nAnd like you were mentioning earlier the worse than they are going to build a little bit of itchy to say\nI watch them really close to ... to go through allergies it's been a hard time educating them on the different treatment options they have\nWhat's going on physiologically and their bodies we have a really clear understanding about their treatment options we can make an educated choice going forward right after the test results are brought to you and you can give me your interpretation and we discuss with the patient okay what do you want to do going forward\nYour options here's what I recommend\nAnd it's on the on the strain Dr ... what do you think is the best treatment options choice for these patients with their allergies\nSo honestly that allergy shots and there's lots of controversy now that you know shots versus drops or things like that and I think that the uh you know scientific evidence is not out there yet to say that drops are clearly effective and there may be you know allergy docs are are in teased out what kind of\nYou know a fight me on that all of it and that I Would love to know more but I have not seen that clear clear evidence and allergy shots\nAre I think the number one and and the gold standard to this point I and very easy to do and I know patients are just said deathly afraid I think that the biggest problem\nAnd missed a an obstacle that I see with patience is trying to discuss treatment and that it is in the form of a shot so how do I how do we overcome that\nSo first of all when you think of a shot you may be thinking about a ... a flu shot or a steroid shot with these huge monster needles you see these videos are getting injections nearby there just is not like that at all used influence rented they're super small super skinny very doable most patients told me they can't even feel it when\nThey ... always make the joke that it's more like a mosquito bite than than an actual shot and and even when patients have diabetes and they test their fingers you know for their blood sugars\nThat's an incredibly painful process right and you know the allergy shots you're right they don't feel it's an upper arm and you know and patients can do that Neal themselves if need be and it's really you know if some of the children are not afraid once they have a shot or to you and overcome that you know\nAn antibiotic doesn't treat you can lose your leg and these are very serious problems that go all the way back to something as simple as treating your allergies\nAnd so I don't I don't know if people think about any of those other long term consequences like that but that's a huge one\nLook at look at the sinus infections that come from allergies and you mentioned scary one in five patients that have grown artist will develop a move their lives you know he's lighting long condition that affects the jobs in your overall hoarded was\nRound trip to yours maybe a what a week's do yeah I got to the area and so by going to you're already under control before you get to that point right hopeful exactly who the decrease in the amount of patience to develop a more after being on the allergy shots is just so significant right over over the counter medications or the noodles ...\nAnd for pediatric patients one ... one in two pediatric patients will go up as more of the night is that is\nGreat I Believe that and that happened actually to my child my middle child has a horrible you know a\nAsthma or ... in the springtime with the ...\nYou know allergies and she is miserable and she couldn't play sports she must have so many days of school and not to mention cat sleep and can't run and can't read and you know it's very scary we've we've had to do a lot of steroid shots which makes you gain weight and bumps of blood sugars ... there's just so many consequences asthma is not a good thing to have\nAnd you know it too I think it goes back to the saying an ounce of prevention right and\nAnd treating your allergies it is a preventative a preventive fought and that's where I go to to the auto immunity is a cause I think as the is an autoimmune condition is considered one now and you are preventing that auto immune condition and applies to so many other things so\nYeah wonderful good point I uh\nYou know you know what ... can you absolutely believe that we're almost to the end of our time already [laughter]\nIt goes so fast it does that every week I looked down and there we are we're about to that to the end so I Hope that we have provided you know a couple of key points\nUh first of all the uh safety uh and the ease inconvenience uh also the fact that it is not a scary painful process\nIt's not an expensive process it's something that is easily taken care of in a primary doctor's atmosphere\nOr it for all those other ... there are you're you are very pointed to pointed out that there are lots of serious a a patience and conditions and whatnot that do belong in an allergist or in the office and so we very appropriately us into those doctors so among all the ... to an allergist out there to know\nI'm not taking your faces and they know that too they like to see so serious patients they like to keep their office clear of the easy patience and leave room for those more serious patients that they need to be seen so they can spend the time on that they\nActually do appreciate that I I Do believe that in my mind but uh anyway I just hope we've provided a good basis or education hair on that and I certainly appreciate you I appreciate you at my office and I appreciate your coming in and ... patients out there and radio land so thank you for for joining me\nAbsolutely for you for having me you\nGot it will do this again um so yeah as we kinda gathered near the end of the time I'm going to talk just a minute about the clinic so most of you may remember me being out at Shane filled road or on Campbell is road and we have moved so we are at forty four

simple straightforward thyroid or diabetes or cholesterol and I I have a very different way of working it up I\nHave a very different view on treating it and it is more holistic and natural and I'm

on the radio I Want to talk to them in a traffic report to sign a\nIn traffic whether give us something to think about it information you connect to you from morning afternoon revived EKG essay and found mono seven on [laughter]\n[noise]\nHello everybody welcome back to the trading group show this show is about ... ordinary opportunity it's an opportunity to not only\nMake more money [noise] increase what you make but I Believe this is an opportunity to change your life it's an opportunity that you have at your fingertips and I can say that because all you gotta do is call the toll free number\nEight eight eight seven eight eight one seven eight eight\nAnd you'll have a chance to participate in what I believed to be the best opportunity I've seen I'm forty nine years old that I've seen everything from network marketing on down the line\nBut this is the opportunity and anybody can get involved I've got Michael with me here and he's going to share with you in detail what it is we do a Michael\nHey Jon thanks uh you know first of all I don't want anybody to get scared off or intimidated when I talk about what we do or if you've never experienced trading\nDon't be scared off this is as easy as a one two three process um what we do is we trade one product\nOn the market and again it's\nAn easy one to three process that are mentor instructs and the software instructs\nWe trade one product it's called the ... future it's on the S. and P. five hundred what's nice about the e many future is its trade in both directions so when the market is moving up we're making trades when the software tells us to and when it's going down we make money\nAnd trade so we actually don't care what the actual result of the day is whether the market is up or down\nWe make money either way we get to capitalize on all types of markets and all types of market conditions\nYou know this week for us was just another typical week uh you know all weeks are good for us but in particular yesterday was very very good and all we do is follow the instructions that the software it gives us\nAnd like I said before the software is presented on a very basic level it's color coded and it's only two colors so it's easier than looking at a street light or a street latest three colors right Jill that's right [laughter] this is only two colors blue screen\nThe green light is going up and the blue light is going down so it tells us exactly when to get into a trade and when to exit a trade\nThere is no thinking and that's what I Love about this there's no thinking about the trade itself\nThe software tells you when they get in and wanted to get out and it's phenomenally accurate it's for all types of people experienced and non experienced we've got people in the group\nThat just heard the radio show several months ago they called us they had never even heard of day trading or the fact that they could make money doing it from home and now they're in the group and they're making more money than they ever thought they would ever make\nIt's truly a phenomenal thing in what we do [noise] you know it's kind of amazing and\nThe fact and\nEven to this day I I sometimes sit here and I I I chuckled than myself and I realize that all I'm doing is listening to my mentor tell me to when to get into a trade and and the software tells me when to get in as well\nWhen you look into your Facebook notifications what do you see this guy I liked your comment that gal after deer photo some clown you don't even know commented on your link\nYou on white once this something from the TSA\nSomething's on now I Need to here and there was a weather alert hey that guy down the street made the news yeah that's when you know you liked the right Facebook page but Facebook to work for you and stay connected fall okay TSA on Facebook at five fifty K. TSA\nWider San Antonio turns ... this is not about discrimination from Iran ... center of volunteers we out giant at one point seven million out\nOf jury of nature here at home dorms that do develop

connected not stupid Beatty I say on Twitter at Katy essay news now do you have a Twitter account to clean up\n[laughter]\nI like to welcome you back to the trading group show this show is about an amazing opportunity we say make five hundred of five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that but\nThis is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh is my wife has even said that when she said in a session and she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter]\nAnd and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy\nAnd our mentor he monitors you and this session\nAnd and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software and it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling you stuff and uh his analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand so\nThat knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none\nYou'll walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved you call\nEight eight eight seven eight eight one seven eight eight\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session\nAnd Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nOr thinks John you know first of all just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is that our mentor is providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on if there is not an active trade developing there's just nothing there is just silence no talking and you can attest to this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet\nSo between what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to\nThe utmost level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program research this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then you put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking Tran\nSo that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's a simple follow along color coded system that he verbally describes as well as it's happening there's no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally tops you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen so when we say this is\nIm is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software and it signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen and I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it in a witness this for yourself we don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show\nWe want you to see it then you can leave us after you see it\nYou can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on this show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day [noise]\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories when I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of give us a call\nEight eight eight seven eight eight one seven eight eight that's eight eight eight seven eight eight one seven eight a\nReserve you're spot in a couple of our sessions there's no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phone live\nI'm so give us a call check this out and and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people\nAre trading real money our phone lines do get busy during the show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job and get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a jail be or my mom had a J. O. B. and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income or the more likely you can far surpass that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at the beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred grand and uh and and now you come out with a degree and then you have to pay that back\nNow you have to get a job and pay it back so are there are other trading schools but there are two things they don't have\nOur software and the leadership of our mentors we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ...\nIt's like a classroom and handle it literally it'll change the way you think uh I don't think\nThe way I used to anymore at all or he reduces the variables in this thing to make it where you can make more money\nBut what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important when I got involved in this\nWas building my nest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big ... or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades\nNine were winners and the other two I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor\nAnd are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you start you start to think you know what you're doing\nAnd that's kind of when you get into trouble so where else are you going to find a group like this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you and only our group has the software program we have to guide you and make this easy", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "07"}
