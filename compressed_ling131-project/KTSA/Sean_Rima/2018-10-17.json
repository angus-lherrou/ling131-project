I Believe that our country's going in the wrong direction and that it\nNeeds new leadership\nWe talked about yesterday then goes on to say I'll make a final decision after November but I'm inclined to do it\n[noise]\nOkay this is why bet tool that to all this is why ... going to lose this is why a lot of Democrats are gonna are really going to have their hats handed to them or in November\nIt's this disconnect how disconnected gonna hurt can a human being be in in Trump's America where more people have jobs or unemployment is down the economy is rocking and rolling the Dow Jones was off the charts the other day\nAh we have an actually my brother Trey where did a a really cool blog on this earlier this morning or if you want to check it out K TSA dot com the tree where page where he lists all the cool things that are happening right now in America so what what America is wholly on Castro living in\nMan what's the wrong direction we're heading in dude\nBecause that's not going to where you ... that's going to win you anything and that's what that's a big problem a lot of Democrats at in that they come off as like they're living on in some other America on some other planet in some other dimension\nAnd\nCompletely unaware of of all the cool stuff that they're ... you and I are experiencing in our own lives and I'm not you know I'm not a rich guy I Do pretty good but I'm a radio guy and I tell you what\nYou know I've seen a the benefit of some of these tax cuts in my own personal budget and so when you start saying stuff like first off I have a strong vision for the country what would that be ...\nHis vision for the country is he is president [laughter] is what is missing is\nHe says I Believe that our country's going in the wrong direction and it needs new leadership and again what's the wrong direction\nI'm just not the rest of us are digging the direction the country's going and that's why we voted for Donald Trump and he's been very effective and so I think any Democrat that goes out there and start saying you know talking about this crap they they come off as completely disconnected they come off as elitists\nA moment Jeff here has an excellent point two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five Jeff how you doing\nAbout it from another mother hey you know a lot of the day what's uh what are you thinking about the silly on Castro business\nWell

money to Iraq you know riding hundred million dollars you know\nThose five hundred million dollars that's you know that's why I personally I think I don't regard he was talking about the brother McCarty jak regarding was saying earlier that he thinks he may run just as a trial run\nBut I'm looking at this quote that he's going to wait until after November to decide and I think if Democrats really you know suffer as badly as we predict they will I say he doesn't run in twenty twenty because he's not going to run run against Donald Trump as the incumbent\nHe's young enough you can wait it out for a couple of election cycles or maybe just one more\nSo I think that reveals what kind of what kind of a person to use as well because it's really not about the vision he asked for America it's about his own career as\nWell I'll tell you that especially for San Antonio allow forget and all the stuff and you know all the crowd rise doing that because I could go on like thirty minutes with that but like as far as I look at the legacy left in San Antonio first off he had a big fan and still is that an ... and and the reimagining the Alamo change in our history we all know what

hundred or I'm I'm right\nAnd you know he's been directly involved in a lot of that stuff and and he only on Castro's for my money is precisely the kind of politician I voted against when I voted for Donald Trump he ... he is precisely the kind of solace political creature\nWho wants to achieve his own ends no matter what and when a guy like that with this much money as he has starts talking about how the country's going in the wrong direction well do you don't currently have a job that you have to worry about [laughter] you don't work dude I mean what was his jail right now you know oil and you have to\nI think the hub thing sinks in in any campaign but we'll see two one zero five nine to find that you find the other thing that happened today that I thought it was very interesting and it's not getting a lot of play on CNN but it's getting a lot of play on Fox is\nA this video that was released a of of the president of President Trump the Trump stir\nWas full cabinet saying hey I Want each and every one of you to reduce your your annual budget by five percent five percent not one percent not three percent five percent every single one of your\nUh even said that there are some people in this room that will do more than five percent\nAnd uh in his comments about this reduction mandatory reduction across the board from all departments are he talked about how we rebuild our our military what she has a in that's a you know that costs some money to rebuild the military starting about law enforcement\nAnd uh and so he said you know we need to need to trim the fat basically is what he said we need to trim the fat you're going to trim the fat off of your department whatever agency whatever that may be\nAnd you know watching him do that that was a business decision that something a businessman would do\nWe need to start coming under budget we need to uh you know really start a it get on top of wasting the taxpayers' dollars or if he was a if this were a a business you know we need to stop wasting a our profits\nAre revenue stream on on meaningless crap that were just spending money on for no good reason it's so across the board five percent man each and every one of you need to reduce your budget by five percent or you're operating costs and and I'm watching this going now that's the guy\nThat I voted for that's the guy that someone like ... Castro just does not understand or freaking Beto O'Rourke they just\nDo not understand the guy like trombone that's why they hate him so much there Trump phobic\n\nBecause there's a guy who comes in and says you know what I'm not going to dictate Jia which programs he caught I'm not going to dictate to you any ... I just want to be reduced by ... percent guys like early on in our war are constantly about the business of expanding government and so a guy like Trump missed advise them\nAnd that in my mind going now that's my main that's who I voted for right there turned that trend that fat [noise]\nTwo one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five two one zero five nine nine fifty five thirty five\nYears Dwayne Dwayne how're you doing\nOh I'm doing great I uh just sitting here thinking about a stroke so already as a politician swap places\nWith his brother not on the river walk right uh [laughter] it's\nLike that I mean do we want a president who can have a twin brother or we don't know who's who's doing what they're saying what\nAre the ... will be ... what are we beginning to presidents for the price of one [laughter]\nRight [laughter] I just you know I God Bless them you know I've encountered them many\nA few quite a few times over the years and you know they're just I they're not very impressive people that you know he's just not there and and the fact that he is described as having this charisma and and I'm just I've never seen it with either one of them\nMaybe ... when you get a few beers in ... ... you know down his throat gets interesting\nBut they're just they're they're really they're they're they're they're uh uh how would you say their ambition is so obvious so very obvious but if you look at what they've accomplished actually it's really not that impressive but in fact it's actually quite the opposite especially if we look at the hub\nUh thing and the loss of his five hundred million dollars you look at what teams congressional record is pretty weak you you know he really hasn't done anything except on MSNBC\nSo you know anyone I appreciate the comment that gives you an zero\nFive nine nine thirty five defied I I haven't talked about this at all I'm Talking about we get back at five oh five that's that that would be these charter amendments\nI Believe we have a a town hall tonight tonight right Don coming up to ... about the the amendments and someone to give you my thoughts on these things when we return at a at five oh five\nAlso we have the human as radio on coming up this or this Friday which is something I look forward to every year so we'll talk about that little bit more next hour Shawn Ryan my infant Sean ... new start five fifty K.

one five thirty eight I Mr John and we're uh we're talking about the charter amendments is going\nTo be a a town hall debate whatever that looks like in this town are coming up a little later on with the mayor but I'm just giving my thoughts I really haven't touched on this yet I'm for these amendments\nAm I going to be some more reasons as to why I'm for these amendments which essentially make the referendum process a little smoother or if you want to push their southern you and your neighborhood that you're not happy with and city council and the mayor and do nothing about it and there are a lot\nOur they haven't done anything about the the the lack of street lights of bottled water the flooding well then if you can get twenty thousand signatures on a petition on a referendum petition and all those things just can be verified then it gets on the ballot and everybody gets to vote on it I I think that's freaking great\n[noise]\nAnd I'll tell you a precisely why in the city manager thing again I think you you kept the salary it's still gonna be a pretty good salary man kept the time at that age you get eight years and you're out uh uh I think that's going to\nDraw more local people to the city managers job which I think it's a good thing ultimately because I think that shop should be held by somebody who loves and cares about this town [noise] um today as I mentioned\nA few minutes ago or is my today is the anniversary of my twenty ninth year in radios twenty nine years ago today in Nineteen eighty nine that went on the\nAir for the very first time and in that uh twenty nine years I've lived in a lot of free choice [laughter] I keep her thank you [laughter] it's not necessary but uh in that time I have lived in a lot of places I've lived in a lot of small towns\nUh I've worked in the smallest markets and I've worked in the biggest markets you know what I mean I've spent a lot of time and a lot of cities are like\nBaltimore and in Denver and LA\nAnd San Antonio has a completely different dynamic from any other city I've ever lived in and this is precisely what it is it is a big small town it operates like a small town for being as large as it is\nA as one of the things I Love about this town and try honestly the problem with that when it comes to city government is you do have a bit of cronyism going on you do have a elitist and folks within a the city who are kind of a you know at play or their\nPlayers if you will a behind the scenes\nAnd that's what you find in small towns you find that a lot of small town governments where you know it's really the rich guys who kinda run everything\n[noise] and I think to a certain extent you have that here in San Antonio\nAnd I've lived you know for the past six years six years almost seven years since I moved in with my wife I pretty much lived in working class neighborhoods\nFor the majority of my time here this far okay my neighborhood right now working class neighborhood uh where I Lived before all ban Darrow wrote working class neighborhood and I'm Sorry but when it comes to city government those folks\nAre very often just kind of freak and ignored\nThose neighborhoods are freaking ignored and they were ignored because the power elite behind the scenes doesn't give a crap about I'm Sorry guys don't\nAnd you could tell by the reaction you can tell by the reaction you're seeing from yeah my friend the mayor but ah from also some folks on city council and other folks were just all this is horrible horrible horrible [noise] ... yeah I said yesterday we are talking about with Warren right\nThat a person's reaction reveals a lot about them how people react to stuff reveals a hell of a lot about who they are and what their motivations are and you're seeing some extreme reactions\nTo these charter amendments which tells me that those power elitists those folks behind the scenes are not digging this because they feel they'll lose influence and you know what they will to a certain extent the system the process is not going to be damaged in any way shape or form you still got to vote\nUsed that folks are still gonna have to go out and campaign to be on the city council or sit\nIn the mayor's office right\nBut with these amendments\nYou you get to hold their feet to the fire justice marriage so the now when somebody runs for mayor when somebody runs for city council\nThey're going to be a little bit more concerned with telling you the truth and then being proactive on at once they get into office they're going to take your opinions on things a little more seriously\nBecause that's what needs to happen in this town [noise]\nFor twenty five years it's molded melted resistant it comes in any Colorado rainbow they resisted\nColor stay looking great for

we're talking about something else and I know that I'm\nNow wants to talk about this so Alex hang on we were talking about why Ted Cruz doesn't really hammer the whole battle thing a little bit a little bit more uh ... the debate last night sorry was so forget all that I I I forgot this one point where the line Ted thing came up\nYou know Beto brings that up as a lot you know he says he's so much in favor Donald Trump and he supports Donald Trump\nBut a Donald Trump told them lying dead but yes he's still lie and to you know it was kind of a ... it's it's cheap politics that and if that were me if I'm Ted Cruz I'm going to start hammering among the nickname thing\nYeah well do do you think Hispanics are so freaking stupid that a white Irish guy like you [laughter] can suss poll or a Hispanic a nickname out of his but put it all over his signs because I guess you think that there are so stupid they'll vote for you assuming you're Mexican\n\nI mean that's the only thing I Would say like why aren't you hitting that harder\nMaybe in his mind he wants to rise above that but I I'm One of those people have things sometimes Republicans need to get a little little more ... here in these in these things because the other guys aren't going to care they're going to go forward would ever cheat thing making a label you\nWith for go for they're they're gonna do it so I I don't know

work\nWith like Harry Carey I think he's a professor ate at himself I during such a thing that's how are you kidding me\nIt's pathetic you know it it really and like I said yesterday dude if your vision for taxes and your vision for America\nIs so wonderful why do you need the shady miss of the of the nickname Whitey and you need to trick people into voting for you if you want to do is such a wonderful thing it's crazy but\nHe took a page from the Elizabeth Warren playbook simply\n... and ... and it's ... it's so hypocritical these are the people that can't shut up about cultural appropriation except when they're the ones doing it then it's OK then your the racist if you bring it up it's like oh please we're not that stupid\nRight ... and uh you know and and one more thing and this was not nice to either candidate but last night when I watched the debate all about Fifteen minutes far shut it off they used to ... to cruise to grandma grandpa monster project a good ... or ...

said for a long time and I were you talking about bad tool\nIt's like there's a little window into into his soul there's the window that's who he is\nIn his damned insulting to the Hispanic community that when you're trying to win a seat in the Senate you are you being an Irish Catholic I Believe he's Irish Catholic\nAnd you pull a Mexican nickname out of your butt [laughter] plastered all over here signs\nI'm Sorry what do what you were saying to the Hispanic community is your so stupid enough to educated you will never know I'm not a Mexican and you'll vote for me because of the because of the name not because of what I stand for now because of my great vision\nYou'll vote for me 'cause you're stupid that's what the whole battle thing says to me and I know a lot of Hispanics and a lot of them feel the exact same way like who is this guy seriously and again it's it's kind of odd that ah that ah\nThe cruises and hitting that a little harder to ones you're all five nine nine fifty five fifty five and go with a damn demand Dan how you doing\nToday show a shift back to the blind squirrel [laughter] I'm really\nCurious who's paying for the trait that\nYou know are we gonna is
