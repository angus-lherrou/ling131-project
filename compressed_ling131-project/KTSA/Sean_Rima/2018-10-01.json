don't either this is this is the FBI of killing a rotten Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama\nAnd they're just not Donald Trump's uh uh FBI hurry or does it hashtags where is Jeff Sessions but the Democrats the evil demon crafts have not seen no proof that all of any wrongdoing here because if they had it they would lay it on the table they don't have that so they're asking me a huge to prove their innocence\nBut we know now who the demon rat Democrats are they're telling us more and more who they are every day they're rebuilding themselves more and more every day we absolutely know who they're\nFar left uh extremists are\nThen they let me give me an example of this real quick Steve just real fast and we have an example\nThose two girls that went into that elevator and corner Jeff

the weekend was this not laughable James combing\nNow you can't put a bus or you can't what ... what did he say you can't put a time buzzer on on an FBI investigation that when he said they didn't tell me says we can you do put a timer on the FBI investigation you can't put a buzzer on a sports bar or whatever something like that you can't put a timeframe in other words it was supposed to be a week\n... you and I both know it's not going to be awake\nWhatever they come back with the Democrats going to say we want more and more they're already doing if they're already saying that\nBut what I found so funny and and uh you know when I say funny I don't mean ha ha funny\nI mean sick funny is James Comey saying that\nThis was the guy that had mounds and stacks of evidence against Hillary

have gone to jail\nBut James kill me gave her a pass because James Comey\nIs in it with her as a as Andrew McCabe as is Peter Struck as is Lisa Page and we can going on and on so I think I think

[noise] are you happy [noise] are you thrilled are you super excited today that the FBI is doing an investigation into bread Kevin I'll just say you know what the FBI investigation is like it's not the same\nAs the Senate in fact it's not as thorough as the Senate the Senate has an investigative\nBody particularly these a particular bodies that are within their the committees\nAnd they do a very thorough job and they're able to subpoena and they're able to look deeply into what's going on and find out what's happening and are able to make some some really incredible fines and that's exactly what the Senate had been doing every time a name came up Everytime another twist are turning this awful story came up they checked it out\nThat was the whole point of the hearing last week when Brett Kavanaugh kept saying you're the investigative body not the FBI and the Democrats kept saying we want the FBI what the FBI is if there's something magical about the FBI the FBI by the way wasn't formed until last century\nAnd our country did this process for a couple of centuries without the FBI even being in existence and they did it very very well\nSo now that we have an FBI investigation now the FBI investigation is expanding because the Democrats want it to expand and now that we know that the game that the Democrats are playing and they\nThey want to ever expanding investigation now they want to now look at is drinking and they want to look at a you know his temperament and they want to look at and ask people about\nYou know this ... thing and the football football football football\nAnd all these things that all came up in that hearing now they want to look at every last night and I want to look at perjury says Bernie Sanders we gotta we gotta check to see if he perjured himself now and that could take weeks because we got to you know parsed words and we got to get right down into what he meant by this word when he said that what did he mean and\nThat's where this is headed\nWe're talking to a never ending process the only way this process will ever end well there's two ways if his nomination in ... in you know the the president yanking at our our Brett Kavanaugh getting out of it which how how did it no way\nBrett Kavanaugh is not going to get out of this now\nMean his family has already been ruined his reputation is in tatters now so it's not like we are going to catch it out even lower how much lower could they possibly cutting down so he's not\nGoing anywhere unless the president you know that President Trump as of today says he's not yanking it that he's going to stay with him and he's going to stay in there and gotta keep on keep an eye on\nSo it it it ends that way or it ends when Chuck Grassley and there were other Republicans say that this is ending and we're going to have a boat and we're going to have a boat right now and when that happens and they have the vote then the process since the circus the charade the witch hunt\nLast one and ends but until that time happens it\nContinues and it will continue and the Democrats will make sure that it continues and their thing is they're playing the long game they want to run out the clock and they want to make it to the midterms and then I Want to hold that seat open as it is now you know today is the first Monday in October\nAnd the Supreme Court a shorthand it\nThey only have up there they need nine and because of Democrats had been fooling around with this there's not a night person there on the Supreme Court\nBut I Want to talk with you about something that's an even bigger than all this uh really theatrics and and baby are crying and ... throwing that we see the Democrats doing right now\nAnd I want you to sound off on it because this troubles me more than anything else I was just talking with a single mom who did very well and raised three really great boys basically by herself if you will\nShoot a phenomenal job with them all three of them are very successful and their own right couple of them serving their country third one wrapping up his is college this year all three of 'em are outstanding upstanding young men\nMom was just like the one I'm referring to have got to have some consternation in a whole lot of concern right now about the future of our country and what kind of country we are going to live in what we're saying happening here with this a nomination of bread cabin on how it's playing out by the Democrats\nAnd what we have coming up in the midterms is nothing short of what kind of country are we going to be going forward\nAre we going to be the kind of country that you see the Democrats portraying right now which is your guilty by a mere accusation until you prove yourself innocent\nOr are we going to restore some sanity back into who we are as a people in society in general\nThis weekend alley ... who is a host on C. R. T. V. was at the twenty eighth team Texas Tribune festival in Austin\nYoung lady I'm going to say she's in her mid twenties maybe of that much she said I'm devastated to see a man's life almost in ruins this is what she told the audience there and Austin over the weekend\nI'm devastated to see a man's life almost in ruins based on uncorroborated unsubstantiated allegations now this was when the crowd started to get restless\nShe said I'm devastated by the thought of a world in which people are guilty until proven innocent and the burden of proof is on the accused and now the crowd really started to get restless\nShe said I listen to both of their testimonies and while I think both are believable I think only Kavanaugh is credible\n...\nNow the savages or read it for a scout ready to go after\n\nShe went on to say this is balls the on her part I mean she's got balls I'll give it to her because she's an unfriendly crowd and I want to come after her they're getting wrestlers\nAnd she said he's the only one that has substantiate for anything that he said he's the only one with any core operation he's the only one who is gone through six and now seven FBI background checks the only one that has any evidence for anything that he is saying and witnesses to back up what are you saying\nYou don't understand that right I mean we're clear on that the only one who brought any evidence to back up his claim as Brett\nKavanaugh the accuser brought nothing nothing\nHer word\nThen ms alley bath stuck you went on to say he's the only one that has yet a and we're ... that has that and yet we're supposed to unconditionally bleep believe the woman why because of her anatomy and that's when the crowd started to boot\nSo basically what you had in Austin over the weekend was the crowd Boeing the presumption of innocence that's what they were booming\nNow the presumption of innocence you hear about and law cases in court cases all the time but let me tell you something it's not restricted to the courtroom\nPresumption of innocence is something we all should have all the time from the cop who stops you on the side of the road\nTo the time that you are at work and your boss cause Yan and says hey someone's so said you did this and such", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "01"}
