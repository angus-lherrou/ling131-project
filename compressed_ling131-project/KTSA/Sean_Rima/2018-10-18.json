it's worth I support it but and I think a lot of\nThe whole I think your your side of things is probably going to win the day so [laughter] right well in\nThis case but but I Do but I Do agree that I think I don't trust\nThe individuals involved who are doing it and that's that's the quandary is that I Do agree with the concept that that some of the things around the Alamo can change and we can make some changes and make it make it a better attraction than what it is um I I agree with that but\nI definitely don't trust the people involved and I think that's I think that's one of the issues I think that's the issue that is probably a ... at least as big of an issue as as the whole idea of\nBecause I think you know of many most people I think like yourself I think we all agree that you know we're not we're not opposed to change but the problem is we don't trust\nThe people in well we're doing it now and we don't know really what's behind the ... cause I agree with you on that I mean I I have no problem with some renovation I have no problem with building a freaking museum alright so Phil Collins can absolve is crap there and we can look at it and all that stuff\nMy issue is that I think what's at play here is not really about honoring the Alamo it's about reimagining the history of\nThe Alamo and and so what do you have at play there and I think if you look at the way the public have really been excluded in at many different levels of along the way on this journey uh uh I think in large measure because the people behind this no that wouldn't pass muster with a lot of folks especially folks were\nFrom here and and I I I Am worried about\nPeople who may have an actual disdain for the Alamo being the ones in in care of the Alamo uh because\nYou know it broke one statue Yankee Travis Park right and and I'm with you on that I don't trust the motivations here\nUh I really really do not and and I I you know it's not like it's going anywhere so why does this have to be done now right well I think it's obvious why they want to get it done now at first they ... this particular group of people that have the claiming rights to doing that\nAnd uh and ... but I don't think they're doing it out of the uh care of the health of the Alamo which I as I agree with you I had no problems with renovation I have no problems with making it healthier\nBut you know this whole thing has been political since since day one and I think that's what sucks about it so\nRight yeah and I think that's right and I think that's the primary source of the problem is that we don't trust them I mean rise as citizens we believe there's a day there I mean he was\n... you know we should say there's a they shouldn't exist we should say look everybody we we've gone through a process

zero five nine fifty five thirty five years Jan Jan how you doing\n[noise] hey John this is Jan um first of all I'm a native Texan and uh the Alamo to us is a place of reference is not a tourist attraction um so I went\nTo her on heroin it is the tourists are determining the reimagining or ... apparently the tourists are under ... so\nWell apparently we paid a bunch of big money to some big contract or a company to do a survey when I went to one of the meeting I went to two of the meetings and one of them they had showed this big plan how they did a worldwide survey and asking hey what's the Alamo and what does it mean to you and all that\nAnd you know they did or didn't want to come to the see the al ... thing to do what it was whatever bottom line is they were complaining they we're reimagining or whatever the Elmo plaza based on what the tourists want to see not what we as taxes\nHave reverence in our hearts to go a tape pay homage to the Alamo\nPrecise ... one of the things was that they want to have all these trees planted in the in the plaza so that they can\nAll the tourists can be shady because it's too damn hot down here for him that's too bad\nOn the other hand and they shouldn't come here too hot but anyway the other part is is that they want to move the Senate cap what I heard was because they want to have reenactments out there in the plaza which would be okay but it's all the trees are out there they can't during that so they were talking on both sides the ...\nAnd I I I've never understood the idea of moving the senator off which is a six story worker barge five hundred feet you're going to risk that beautiful magnificent work of art just so you could move shuffled off out of the way a little bit come on man they're\nSaying that they want to move that so they eat they can do these reenactments how they're going to ... ...\n... there's there's ... there's been so many different explanations we want to send a top it smells is there's been so many different explanations for the movie first there was it was hard to see remember that my heart to see it's six freaking stories\nHigh who can't see it the blind squirrels you know I mean it's like ... it and then\nWhen you have shifting explanations for things you know something shady is going on\nWell the other part is is is that they want the parade go round behind the Alamo and then they kind of turn around the corner over by the hotel and they and they kind of look back at it well that's that defeats the purpose of having the parade\nMiddle and give their homage to make any sense yeah\nIt's well they will but am I going to you got a lot of people but uh you know I agree that they had a plan in mind they didn't listen to anything that any of these groups that came out as an individual but they had a lot of lot of different groups that came to these meetings and they would just shut 'em off they didn't want to hear what they had to say didn't make any changes that I can see\nBased on what groups came up and and and complained at the at these meetings\nYeah though I agree that I Need you need is a good idea because you know\nWe have a problem with that but I mean they don't have to rip the crap out of the middle of the city for years and years to accomplish that\nI think it's an expensive venture for the city in the state to do this and I'm In the long run people that that have no reverence for the elderly itself and that and the people that died fought and died there\nAnd all over the state actually because bell fires is of course they ... they have all the people that died ... and everywhere else um and just to make it into a tourist trap for people to from out of state I don't agree with\nIs that I I agree with your gym thank you so much for
