U. I. N. C. dot com ask Glenn that's L. Y. N. N.\nAt L. U. I. N. C. dot com\nToday we're facing together the reality that the things we have done to provide for comfort comfortable retirement are not working for us\nWe've been discussing the business model you can use while still working in your current W to job or running your current business that will allow you to replace your earned income with cash flow from your real estate investments and the next two to five years that's doable [noise]\nNumber two is equity capture number three was principal pay down because our tenants are paying down our mortgage balance each month\nSo now let's continue the list number four is the tax advantages real estate investors pay the lowest taxes of any for profit business in the United states even with the new tax laws the IRS allows us to reduce our earned income tax on cash flow by taking a depreciation deduction against\nProperty and we can avoid capital gains tax when we sell using something called at ten thirty one tax exchange ten thirty one is the part of the tax code\nThat allows us to sell one property and buy another that's rolling over our gains and not paying taxes on them\nHow long can you avoid those taxes you know we have a a fund saying and real estate it's deferred deferred deferred die [laughter]\nIf you pass the property onto your children when you die they will inherit the property of what's called the stepped up basis and what that means is that the property will be valued at its current cost basis\nAt the time of your debt and that wipes out all of the capital gains over the life of the asset as far as the IRS is concerned you still your children still have that equity and the property but they do not have to pay the taxes on that unless they decide to sell\nNo other investment vehicle has such a huge tax advantage and we talk a lot about legacy and that's another show but generational wealth and the ability to create generational wealth is another incredible advantage that real estate investors half\nAnd finally on my list of five reasons why real estate is the best way to create wealth and passive income is market appreciation [noise]\nReal estate typically increases in value over time that we might fluctuate in the short term and we've seen that with the past recession but it's forced to rise over the long term with inflation and scarcity of available landed desirable area\nWell stock investors live and die by market appreciation real estate investor see this as a nice bonus to pile on top of the other ways we make money [noise]\nOne thing to remember too is that even when you have a tick down and the value of your property it still rent it you still have a tendency in that property and they continue to pay their rent\nNow if that tennis loses their job as happened in the downturn\nThere are other people who are looking to rent property and in fact what most of us experienced it lifestyles unlimited is that our rents went up every year throughout the recession and we had higher cash flow than before even though our properties had lost a little bit of value at this point they have recovered\nAnd in many areas they have\nFar exceeded the values that we had before going into the recession\nSo real estate again it's a very\nForgiving and effective business model for creating wealth and passive income so you're starting to understand\nWhy delete why we believe this is the business you should use\nWe have a call from Paul in memorial city Paul I'm Glad you called how can I help you\nHighlight and I have a pretty basic question when you talk about a time frame of looked at your five years

unlimited real estate investor radio show I'm your host liberal and today we're working together to adopt a new beliefs about the best way to earn the money you need to retire since our jobs are current businesses for a one k.'s and other investment vehicles haven't worked\nIn the past two segments we talked about the five reasons real estate is the most effective vehicle to create this wealth and passive income that cash flow you need to retire [noise]\nAnd then Paul Paul from memorial city in the last segment and asked if investing in an apartment communities is the only way to retire in two to five years as a real estate investor Paul are\nYou still there okay thank you for holding through the break because this is a question I think that a lot of people have and and the the simplest answer is that if you have the resources\nAnd a lot more fun than we went through the five reasons that real estate is the best way to create that wealth and passive income\nAnd now we're going to go through three chips to get started in the business or take your current real estate investment activities to the next level of profitability and they're really simple do the exercises\nThat we talked about throughout this show I Know who you are and what you want out of life and create a detailed vision of the lifestyle you want\nAnd find out where you're starting from that can be a little bit painful to take a look at our finances and except where we are in life but if you do that\nThe pain will be over soon because you're going to be able to move forward and create a happy healthy comfortable retirement for you and your family have so that's the first tip is just do it I read that band aid off and face it\nThe second cat is to find a community of like minded real estate investor and there's two reasons that you need to do this one is the support because the people around you are going to think you are crazy\nFor doing this why would you seek to start a different business you've spent X number of years developing your career why would you want to change now\nWell it's not going to be a sudden change it's going to be a transition in this transition is actually going to be into retirement\nAnd this is the business that you're going to work on not in so that you can retire and spend more time doing the things that you want to do with the people you want to do them with on your own time frame for your own benefit right do you find that group and that group should include and this is the third ...\nIt should include successful real estate investors\nWho will provide some education and mentoring and that's usually going to be a company of some sort and you're usually going to have to pay for that education and mentoring sure you can get education and mentoring for free out there\nRight you have to go through an awful lot of information and determine which one is going to work for you and combine them into some sort of strategy or you can come to lifestyles unlimited where we have a time tested strategy over three decades\nThat will allow you to step through this and following the footsteps of successful investors who are giving back to the community\nOf investors that help them succeed\nDo ... is my mentor he's mentored all of us at lifestyle so unlimited and the only thing he asked of us when we're successful

advice and they started showing up at the road trips the case studies I started shaking hands meeting people that were doing deals and got caught up in a very quickly\n\nNow one of the themes I ran into and I don't know if we run into this as much anymore and you've only been here six days to maybe you haven't been through a large enough cycle yet to see this happening but one of the things I used to run into all the times got somebody come to me and say you know I Want to do single family\nBut then they went on a road trip and we next week they called back you know just change my mind that procedure is on the road trip with the ... family\nAnd you know the a week later the sale to start out as a passive and you know we got to come back you know you know what after seeing this I think I could do this to I Want to be I wrote a you know and then come back and so you know what I'm looking for this wall deals that they just going to go and go up to\nYou know I'm a lead investor you run into any vast relations yet [noise]\nUh yeah the one that I'm working on they actually came into the passage but there are retired and may have seen enough now where they're going you know what we could do and we have the money to do a forty in a deal on our uh maybe we should start doing that\nBecause they're uh they're proud of being picky watch a dumpling report probably not a bad idea on who they invested with and then that cycle takes time to understand what makes a good partner for your specific situation\nAnd finding somebody that has the same goals are is on the same track that you are and uh yeah so they're swinging back around now and we started talking about them just doing their own deal and part of that actually was me telling them look I've already got two people that are by twenty minutes and this is just happened in the last you know forty five days\nSo uh they realized that that could happen a little faster and uh and I think you know sometimes you just got to push people off cliff ... once I get to the edge and ah so I I think those that couple will go that way but are all the other cycle she I don't think I've been around quite long enough to see the transition that you have a\nTwenty seven years or however long you been doing this\nWell the next one is um a more difficult question I'm you've done some due diligence so far\n[noise] yeah we actually did a deal a Monday\nTen days ago now um for a guy he's actually had a central Texas or what the deal is in a camp which actually falls that are used to a territory so it came to me\nUh we went on site didn't know I never stopped at the Capitol I've driven through it on my way to fishing trips down on the coast but I've never stopped there so I got to go down there for a day they had done a nice job of pre shopping in the market we walked all the units\nAre had some contractors they're looking at everything to decide how much work needed to be done on it for going in so they knew how to properly\nBudget for any or deferred maintenance and things like that gets back off to start\nAnd I actually I just got a text from two minutes before we got on air here and he wants to talk this afternoon he's read on his business analysis and he wants me to take a look at it and\nKind of play devil's advocate on what he's missed and whether I think the deal still work or not\n[noise] well I think that's probably a good place to take a break we'll pick that up on the other side also when we come back\nWe'll discuss this guy has to do just this discussion say yes or no to deal with

uh the Houston multifamily mentor and it's got to where we left I left you a question here that was a basically have six months a year ago you're taking your foot off the gas\nAnd starting to pump the brakes and now all of a sudden you got it shifted into high gear hear what's going on does what has changed\nYou know the uh I I think I've heard you use this phrase that and it's very true the uh thing that can keep a lot of people away from a great life as having a really good one\nHand I think ah when you and I had that conversation I was having a a very good life I um [noise]\nYou know I was always pretty financially conservative and getting out of college at Twenty one twenty twenty three years old I Would get money magazine and read it cover to cover the day it showed up I Do all the little worksheets that they put in there on how much money you need to retire and all that sort of stuff and [noise]\nAnd my first job out of college I immediately went after Eighteen percent I was donating to the four oh one K. to really get ahead of that thing I didn't believe Social Security was going to be around and I wouldn't count not at forty five years later\nI'm ... and I one of those worksheets ... number how much I needed to retire and a couple of years ago we refinanced my first two deals and I had to sit down I only redo my personal financial statement to really look at all that stuff when they make me\nTo get a loan done and I did my a deal and a wet you know what\nI'm over my number now or do I do I do I quit or I'm too young really to to totally quit but you know these things will keep throwing off cash flow for as long as I keep all\nAnd I thought now's the time to start focusing on the lifestyle issues and stop worrying about money\nUh so I really didn't have a need for more deals I didn't need them to feed my ego I didn't need them to feed my family or anything like that and I also at that same time two years ago I had my first two I have twins and there'll be juniors in college and a couple of weeks here\nUh but they got into college and I realized it didn't hurt me as bad as I expected it to um having that\nExtra money going out so uh so I really I I was wondering what I'll do next what what I Do for an encore and uh [noise] at some point and this really a leads into why Mitt lifestyles now back\nAround New Year's I'm not a big New Year's resolution guy um but I had said you know what I Need to ... and\nIt just so happened about that time a deal kind of fell into my lap that's the one I did back in April\nAnd about the same time John Ridgway came to me and said hey I'm moving up to support this national effort that lifestyle just got to have your taking my job and\nI Love you know this but I turned him down twice a day when he came to me no I didn't know that event yeah and then he eventually sick Curtis on me and and you do know that Curtis and I started in the gallery of pretty much together about the same time so we used to have lunch once a week and compare notes and help each other out and\nUh we haven't been doing that he's got busy doing his thing and and doing the lifestyle mentor thing as a I don't know too much for two years ago when he took the shop\nAnd uh I got to do in my ideal and Curtis called me up said come on man will be like old times I Need your help [laughter] so uh he's the one that really convinced me to to take the position\nAnd uh yeah it's it's just been a real commitment and um and at the same time I'm doing more of the things that I Know that I used to enjoy helping\nPeople tending road trips things like that I kind of falling off the bat ah for the lifestyles are things for a while there and it's got to be reinvigorated re involved and ah and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for them it's just that being more active again things kind of pop up and I just had my eyes open and\nYou know decide which ones you want to do\nAbsolutely now I'm going to throw another ... along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which are knows when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all of this came about you found this deal out east back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to us for the first time ever to you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas and I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units and I guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would be like to take the money and the sophistication and the experience that we have accumulated in this group and\nTaken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or without being insulted at least they have less experience than we do and be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area and ah you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed and the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston\nAnd Dallas and San Antonio in going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going\nTo ah you know all these different places we have these deals and they're now saying we've opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\n... absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I are first two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was where best opportunity was so we moved there for a little while\nBefore we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a\nCampaign and so I started an subscribing to all these things to creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I'm sitting on the couch with a a football game or something on she was on the other end of the cash down whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail\nAnd one of the things that happened A R a which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nOr had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald\nAnd when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals and the Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this\nAnd I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home by the end of the day I didn't need to own\nSo ah anyway as are sorting and and I didn't ... I was just hitting delete delete delete scrolling through the subject lines the Cincinnati deal pops up and I went huh and I clicked on it and I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas\nIt was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was on this a posting that I saw\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about finest deal out of town and we've got a business excuse to go fly up there a couple of times a year and see all those friends that we left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nThings that were thirty percent\nOccupied and giving three months free Fifteen months it's starting to farm up I went and did a search on my own after I saw the data come out of these guys and I looked at all those places on a subscription service that I I look at\nAnd they're all Seventy Seventy five even eighty five percent now there is a new batch of them coming online now that some of them are below ten percent because they just come on line right by my house or inside the loop there but\nThe stuff that I thought the struggling a year ago it's warmed up and some of those things have even been able to refinance now that they're above Seventy five percent were usually we think Ninety percent of the magic number on our stuff so [noise] the capital of the banks agencies wherever the financing weather starting to back these deals can a\n... and it looks like they're they're saying a bottom there's one deal on the market right now\nBuilt it for a hundred and Seventy five thousand a\nCouple of years ago before things turned down they could have sold it for two ten but they were holding out because their goal was to twenty five to thirty five\nNow they've got an expiring alone and they're going to bail out of it for a hundred and eighty five thousand or they still may ten thousand adore building that deal uh but the person that's buying it firmly believes that in the next five years we're going to see a return and they're going to be able to sell that for two twenty five or something like that within the next five years so\nI think the model that you and Curtis have actually been chasing I've been wrong on it and I think you guys have had the forward vision a little better than I have and\nThings like ah those classes rights are up a couple of percentage points now the margin between the the rats on the rents are starting to grow again I've seen my occupancy growing in the gallery at that project I was talking about so everything's starting to shape up really well\n[noise] you know just for those who are listening for the first time you're not saying by gossip arm accomplish for a hundred and Seventy five thousand they're saying a hundred and Seventy five to two hundred and twenty five thousand\nPer door that means per unit [laughter] that's absolutely right that's ... [laughter]\nYeah 'cause I was looking at looking at the one the other day of classes like you know there's a big difference for between a syndicator and in in Iraq and I'm I'm trying to ... I don't know I may have to syndicate one just to do one but I'm trying to do it as an I wrote preferred to that way\nBut the differences is that there becomes the depth of cash you can actually come up with it so you look at these things and say okay let's let's say it's a hundred and fifty thousand a door and that's a decent number\nAnd you know you got two hundred units that's thirty million dollars right\nBut if you got three hundred units that's forty five million dollars and that's a big difference when you got to put twenty five percent ... percent closing costs you're talking thirty percent\nOf thirty million compared to thirty percent of forty five million that's half the difference in what you have to come up with and so I found that you know I'm not afraid to buy the expensive stuff but I don't think I could buy the three and four hundred beautiful it says that makes sense\n[noise] Oh absolutely you're talking about a ... five million dollars and those two scenarios that you played out there that's a lot a lot of cash come up with and\nIt's a situation where I think you're dealing with slightly lower returns than we're used to you know on a on a year to year basis however I think there's big capital gain that's out there at the end of the rainbow for those deals\n[noise] well the ... you know it makes sense given given both of those or neither of those are the way I look at it as is\nTen years from now classes will be classy mindless or a class B plus and they will be the center of the market\nNo doubt there will be building properties are going to be you know selling like you say two hundred two hundred and fifty thousand or people will be paying three thousand bucks a month to read it's going to happen that there is no doubt about it it's going to happen and so [noise] if you think about it\nWhen I first got in Scott I was buying sixties and seventies construction I thought so but he's really cool no see I got started eighty Seventy eighty eight eighty nine that area so I was buying stuff in the seventies and thought managed to flee ten years old this is not bad\nUh by the time I'd been in ten years I was buying stuff in the seventies and started buying stuff in the eighties\nAnd I bought eighties struck construction was like mom clasby stuff this is incredible does unbelievable but man we're we're not talking about two thousand Seventeen I mean that stuff is now like dead it's fifty sixty years old somewhere those buildings you have to wear out and give up and go away so\nIt's kind of would appreciate you coming on the show

the market\nAnd again it's an easy one to three process that are mentor and strikes and the software instructs\nWe trade one product it's called the e many future it's on the S. and P. five hundred what's nice about the emu any future is its traded in both directions so when the market is moving up we're making trades when the software it tells us to and\nWhen it's going down we make money\nAnd trade so we actually don't care like what the actual results of the day is whether the market is up or down\nWe make money either way we get to capitalize on all types of markets and all types of market conditions\nYou know this week for us was just another typical week you know all weeks are good for us but in particular yesterday was very very good and all we do is follow the instructions at the software it gives us\nAnd like I said before the software is presented on a very basic level it's color coded and it's only two colors so it's easier than looking at a street light or a street light is three colors right still a threat [laughter] this is only two colors it's blue and it screen\nOr the green light is going up and the blue light is going down so it tells us exactly when to get into a trade and when to exit a trade there is no thinking and that's what I Love about this there's no thinking about the trade itself\nThe software tells you when they get in and when they get out and it's phenomenally accurate it's for all types of people experienced and non experienced we've got people in the group\nThat just heard the radio show several months ago they called us they had never even heard of day trading or the fact that\nThey could make money doing it from home and now they're in the group and they're making more money than they ever thought they would ever make it's truly a phenomenal thing in what we do you know ... it's kind of amazing and the fact\nAnd even to this day I I sometimes sit here and I I I chuckled than myself and I realize that all I'm doing is listening to my mentor tell me to when to get into a trade and and the software tells me when you get in as well\nAnd I don't have to work forty to fifty hours anymore it's absolutely amazing opportunity you need to check this out if you're looking for a plan B if you're looking to make five hundred five thousand dollars a day\nThis is the opportunity or you\nCall it eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven and like I said you\nGet to test drive the Ferrari for free you get to get behind the wheel and and again that number is\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven [noise]\nWe're the trading group show we'll be right back\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nI like to welcome you back to the trading group show this show is about an amazing opportunity we say make five hundred of five thousand dollars a day [noise] like Michael said you can make more than that but\nThis is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and make people laugh is my wife has even said that when she sat in a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter]\nAnd and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy\nAnd our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software and it's nice to have the expertise\nBut to have him there motivating you and telling your stuff and they hid analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand\nSo that knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you'll walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved\nYou call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nOr thinks John you know first of all just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is that our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on if there's not an active trade developing there's just nothing\nThere is just silence note talking and you can attest to this year and the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet\nSo between what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to\nReceive the most level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program research this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking ...\nSo that he simplified it didn't do a process that anybody can do it it's the simple follow along color coded system that he verbally describes as well as it's happening\nThere's no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen\nSo when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software in its signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen\nI've shopped more than twenty ...\nUh programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself we don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show we want you to see it then you can believe us after you see it you can call\nUs at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on this show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know\nWe had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day [noise]\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories what I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of\nGive us a call ... eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nReserve you're spot in a couple of our sessions there's no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation\nWe have people right now answering the phone live I'm so give us a call check this out and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people\nAre trading real money our phone lines do get busy during this show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job and get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a jail B. E. or my mom had a jail be and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income or the more likely you can far surpassed that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at\nThe beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred grand and uh and and now you come out with a degree and then you have to pay that back now you have to get a job and pay it back\nSo are there other trading schools but there are two things\nThey don't have our software and the leadership of our mentors we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ...\nIt's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think\nUh I don't think the way I I used to anymore at all or he reduces\nThe variables and this thing to make it where you can make more money\nBut what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important when I got involved in this\nI was building my next guest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big oil Austria Jake or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades nine were winters in the other\nTwo I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor and are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you\nStart you start to think you know what you're doing and that's kind of when you get into trouble so where else are you going to find a group like this where you have a mentor\nLike we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you and only our group has the software program we have to guide you and make this easy like Michael says this is the new age of earning", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "20"}
