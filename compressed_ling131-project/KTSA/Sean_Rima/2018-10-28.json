three four one twenty five it's non remember that the program\nLast eighty plus years but only with the help of a dentist and hot and this and this happened on Monday or this week Dr ... Williams and two and three for one twenty five sixty nine they went out three four one twenty five sixty nine\nNow another thing that we want to remind you\nStart thinking about is coming up to the end of the air and those of you that can have insurance benefits insurance companies are just\nHoping I yeah it's all hope\nThat you do not use those paid for earned benefits because it's money free and clear in their pocket if you don't use your paid for benefits that you've earned\nSo start thinking about giving a call our office and using these insurance benefits that you have\nHolding over ... they don't roll over to the next year typically and the supplies are too well health savings accounts I think you do you don't have to worry about that rolling over and I don't know about flex savings account or left on that you know\nI don't I'm not sure all over not sure but insurance we know does not roll over and it's so much\nAnd here's what happens is people get to thinking as well and they'll call later and then it gets down to November November's busy getting ready for all the holidays and stuff\nAnd then it is now the December well insurance companies if you're going to use the benefits they have a\nProcess that uh they don't pay until the work is completed many of them and then you have a risk of getting into a very crowded situation in the dental office where you don't have the freedom to choose your time\nAnd ah get things done before the end of the year and get everything completed so that's why it's better to start early and that's like this\nWeek or next week and get an evaluation and find out what yours requirements are to get a chance to use your benefits they can\nThey looked up very easily because we have software for all insurance companies there's just with a click of a button and your name we can fight and we can tell you how much a value you have left and what you can have done\nAnd uh how long it will take and you can get all this coordinated very easily so he shared give this some thought and we can't urge you enough to\nStart thinking about this because ah it's time this year my gosh this years gone by now we have two months left oh my gosh\nIt'll go fast so we want to just urge you ... it and start thinking about calling our office and finding out what your insurance benefits are\nWhat you have many if you have work it's over hanging is also\nLike I said we can develop a plan where if you if it's not financially feasible to do something at this point in time at least you can get it postponed\nFour months five months six months out or maybe a year until you get things better organized and can get a attention from there\nYeah I wanted to make the same point the lack of dental insurance doesn't mean you shouldn't have the best dental care so I encourage folks to come out and see us get a thorough evaluation and plan even if they're not in an economic physician to pay for it right away I just so we can get in a preventive mode early on and then have a game plan\nThat is such a good point because\nThey're it's normal because Parrish a patient this has insurance they think are typically they think well they're going to let the insurance company decide what is the best treatment them and this the insurance company\nIs not bound by any rulings for that they only thing that they are bound by is how much money\nThat your employer are you're a policy holder\nPut in to the program that was designed for that amount of money [noise] it has nothing to do with what should be done mhm and what needs to be done\nIt is strictly a monetary decision from the insurance company which is\nThat's their business and they've got to make a decision on that that is a company will go to let's say a TNT they'll go to an insurance company Missouri want dental insurance for their employees\nAnd the company the insurance company will say how much money the one who locked\nPaying for each employee and they'll give him a number and then they will take and figure in what their overhead is\nWhat they're processing fees are\nAnd figure out what benefits can be provided it has nothing to do with the design of what should go into that gee maybe coincidental that is the same but if that is not their intent is by law not they're not required reading that\nThe dentist is required to give you an accurate\nReally history I plan we are required by the ... the state board or dental examiners but that is a dental insurance companies are not as bad as entirely correct\nSo when you think of that that we are held to a different standard than insurance companies [noise] it's something that you want to think about when you're writing an insurance company make a decision for you about a treat it should be lasting eighty plus years for all of your life [laughter]\n[noise] so [noise] it's a it's a ... I just want to point then it because it gets confusing ah you're given the\nThe idea that because you have insurance and your roles and say the the oh they call it um er an HMO that you have this vast dental network and vast dental treatment available\nIt's not that's not the way it's designed [noise] so we just want to point that out and that's one of the values\nOf putting a value to your teeth and not letting an insurance company which has no obligation from the Texas border dental examiners\nOf designing something that's best for instance I looked at an X ray and if it doesn't fit the criteria for extra they throw it away they will well they're not only that they may throw it away but the most important thing is\nThey will make a decision based on an X ray and not a decision on what the actual condition of that taste is almost fracturing mhm or decay that can't be seen\nDifferent breakdowns a lot of different conditions that the debt has we'll see but the it's not seeing on the X ray so the insurance company goes by what they're given [noise] and that can be an an an ... an X ray\nWhich doesn't give you then for nation\nI think it goes ... yeah so we talked about before the risk assessment were evaluating the entire patient might do a thorough enter all ... than we know the entire individual the insurance companies making their decision may be based on one ready grass\nAnd that neglect all that other important information that we a choir\nAnd that's all right we're not criticizing the insurance coverage they were just describing the way the system works right and you\nCan benefit I having some benefit\nPaid for by the dental insurance but allowing the dental insurance companies make the decision\nAn overriding a dentist decision\nIs a trap that a person gets into especially if they want to keep their case not wind up with the data for their choice all in right or that they show on TV most times for prime time uh-huh of all of your teeth and a day and I'm\nA very expensive services um you'd want to prevent those things and you want to stay out of these things and this is one\nLittle clue ... they do to help you stay out of these track and we're again we're\nNot criticizing the insurance company because this is what they're paid to do this is what they're designed to do this is what companies hire them to do and that just don't have any input in the process of designing these programs for instance\nThe Texas state board a dental ... doesn't have any input is the design of these programs\nGene are the most about\nThirty one altogether I sixteen and Eighteen or the worst ones that cause cancer both in women and men and they this virus boroughs down into the nerves like the shingles or the chicken pox\nVirus and burrows down into the nerve to share and breaks out whenever it's convenient for the body um there's not no longer able to defend itself so this is a reason\nWhy having a cancer exam an oral cancer exam a yearly\nIs so valuable because things have changed and this is an example of how in men\nThe human papillomavirus is breaking out uh it's all over the place the numbers are staggering that uh these this problem is is is around\nThis is a ... another reason why ... ... you want to see a dentist and get a diagnosis in a risk and evaluation to what's going on now one of the things that our office is so unique about\nAnd ah [noise] it's about comfort it's about anxiety reduction it's about fear reduction\nAnd I've been interested in this subject for ever ever since ... dental career began and I have worked and worked in dense creation creative things and uh\nWe have come to a point where we can deliver the most comfortable\nDental appointment that is available and\nWe have this of course with incredible nuke 'em they're only about three dental offices in the town or the county that use new calm and it is such an incredibly it's used worldwide and it's such an incredible system for anti anxiety\nAnd anti fear\nSo this and then we have nitrogen oxide which could be combined with the new com which is it's an exceptional comfort situation and after the treatment that no treatment is finished\nAnd the new common the nitrogen oxide is removed you can go back to your business you normal activities throughout the day without any impairment\nAnd this works of very large amount of time for dental treatment and it's marvelous people love it\nThen of course we have pharmaceuticals for people that have really high here we have pharmaceuticals at work so well and they block your memory of what the dental treatment is it's called conscious of the nation and it's a conscious of the nation because in dental treatment\nIt is necessary to have you to be able to respond to command such as open and close slide your teeth swallow things ... commands like that so conscious of the nation\nYou don't have any memory of your treatment but you are totally\nUm have a\nComfort with the entire system and you do not remember the dental treatment which most people are very happy to have that experience and then we have a an additional choice of ... that talk it tell us about the ...\nAre so similar to what you described with the world conscious of the nation that uses some similar medications typically uh been so days of beans are opioids and kind of a similar experience the benefit is we can catch titrate the dosage ... drugs on an ass needed basis\nAnd again you have no memory\nYeah no memory um\nAnd as a as a side this is what all of the oral surgeon Jesus is what all of the Perry down his use so this is an extremely safe procedure and in addition to the uh safety the Texas state board of dental examiner's has been given\nCommands by the Texas state legislature to make it even safer for the public mhm that'll tell us about how that that what\nHas he has so ah [laughter] there was some changes in the state dental board recently\nAnd now they're mandating that every office that does what we do which is level ... oral fixation or level three ... which is I obesity nation\nBe inspected by I'm a member of the Texas state board of dental examiner's within the next two years I Believe I'm so for that reason a lot of people are dropping their suspicion permit just because there's so much that goes into having that perfect ... set up and they don't want to\nRisk having an unsuccessful on it\nAnd then they tightened up um ... the the prescriptions used to be\nMonitored by the Texas Department of public safety which is not a good system right change that to the Texas state board of pharmacology is ... ... which is a better much better system for the public mhm\nAnd so they've tightened that up so the point is the safety of the systems is unparalleled\nAnd so that ever been safer that's right and you can choose the level of your comfort you can choose the level of your anxiety reduction you can choose the level of your fear reduction with any of these systems and we can help you with it so it makes our office so unique\nSo down please give us a call we can help you thank you so much for listening I Love hearing from you all the time and ah have a great

really key when it comes to an end it's what people really under value in the process of losing weight because what are you really want to lose weight loss what are you really want\nTo lose do you want to lose water do you want to lose muscle you want to lose what do you want to lose\nMost people saying I Want to lose I Want to lose fat\nAnd it's like well how do you know if you're losing weight water or fat or what you might be losing and that's really important to know in my office if a client comes in for specifically for chiropractic and weight loss or just for weight loss we do an in depth test on then that actually assesses\nThe water weight the fat person and also even to some degree the muscle mass percent and and wait\nSo we can really assess throughout a weight loss plan for you are you losing water or are you losing muscle are you losing fat really really really cool tested bio and peanuts analysis so it really checks that the only people who can't do that test\nOr people with pacemakers or any type of rhythm a device that's affecting the rhythm and your body or ... muscle simulator um it's it's looked down upon to be able to do it that way because it it might affect the conductivity and the transmission of those which wouldn't be good right if you're a pacemaker or just doesn't work for thirty seconds we don't like that\nSo anyone else though this test is amazing and you can call my office and leave a message and let me know you want to get to the weight loss addition to that test and and I are my team will let you know what that is it's a nominal fee usually anywhere from twenty seven to Ninety nine dollars to get that for work done on the weight loss or metabolic component\nPretty cool testing that we do in our office and also want to let you

you know about two of them because we still have some spots left in those and until those are full of we don't open up that third workshop time so it's coming up on October twenty ninth at six PM\nOctober twenty ninth Monday at six PM you have to be registered it is free\nAnd complimentary workshop or you learn all about our weight loss in metabolic programs\nWhether you come in with our a or MS er nurse degenerative disease or whether you just want to lose ten pounds through the summer I mean through the through the winter and get ready for the spring you know many of you it would just be a single goal by by uh by by just being honest\nJust to not lose not gain weight this holidays that's what I'm trying to say sorry similar in words that you know to not gain weight by New Years would be a great goal so that if you don't gain that ten you don't need to lose that ten in January does that make sense\nSo I can give you some tools some tips that workshops amazing Monday ... the twenty ninth at six PM or actually November first at noon that's at lunchtime on a Thursday that's November first\nThe Thursday November first at noon or the twenty ninth at six PM I mentioned them a couple more times but that's Monday of that week in the evening or Thursday at lunch make it happen it's about an hour long workshop bring a pen and paper\nIf there is limited seating in my office I can only have one he's three spots\nPer workshop and you know I'm just going to let you know the ... seats will fill up I'm as we've talked about it in our office now for a while and I just want to let you know we only have a few spots for that so called my office to win a six nine nine zero five hundred\nAnd bringing bring somebody who you want to bring what you whether it's a coworker your coming on Thursday at lunch or or in the evening right after right after work you are going to go grab a healthy salad at a lot of heat and air and then you're going to come on up at six PM and and and have a great time with us and learn about how to truly lose weight through the holidays\nNot just an I gained weight but how to lose I mean I say you had to lose Fifteen pounds and thirty days it's not for everyone but it could be for you don't discount it you know many times results from these programs are minimized because that's all they can do they're only gonna show you how to lose half a pound of water a month\nAnd that's really not going to get you where you want to be I think it's more dangerous to leave that Fifteen to twenty pounds in your body than it is to lose it fast that's personally now if you do it chemically there can be long term\nDetox Oregon responses and that's what we really recommend a doctor's supervised doctor recommended product program so that you can really have that coaching accountability and doctors can kind of know they can know what to look for what not to look for\nAnd I'm going to say not all doctors because many\nMany doctors are trained in that product they're going to sell you they're trained to some degree and they're trained to some degree the the fifty thousand dollar machine that somebody talked him into buying but do they really know like how to check the metabolic things in your body in my program as well which is really phenomenal you'll learn at the workshop on the twenty ninth or the first is\nIs is tracking so we have an app that we've helped or be a part of and developing\nAnd literally on that apple you log un once you're on the program you put your measurements and your food you put it in it it gives you daily emails of different stretches and exercises you can do if you want to add exercise is a component um it gives you recipes that you can be utilizing during and throughout and after the plan\nThat's another great thing is the follow up after the plan is over after you've completed your plan and you've achieved her goal to not just go back to how you were so the three secrets I'm In the show you are underlying foundational premises in our program the number one I'm going to talk it out is hydration\nAnd electrolytes balance you know as you lose\nWeight you want to lose and burn fat we know that it's a no brainer especially toxic fat you want to get those toxins out with the fat\nBut how do you know your properly hydrated other then you just think you drink a lot of water will you need a trach at half your body weight announces per day is a general rule but during a detox or cleansing process for the first week or two of the program you're going to commit to you want to make sure you're actually doing even more than that\nYou want to be giving your body water but we even have a dropper bottle in our in our program that's a scene mineral concentrate that really does help to balance your electrolytes and when you do that with your program it really helps you to actually retain a healthy amount of water and not lose an unhealthy amount of water in proportion to fat and you also\nBe able to maintain muscles so hydration it's also important in that\nIn regards to teaching and training your body to burn fat so\nHydration half your body weight announces another great secret tip now I told you three but I Would have probably give you like a few per item so if you want to grab a piece of paper or just even a notepad or something and remember these a voice memo in your phone or something as you remember recall something that's a great idea\nSo again half your body weight announces per day of hydration you want to make ... make sure that if you're doing a detox or cleansing program or a radical reduction in your caloric intake which is what a lot of programs recommend not necessarily mine\nYou want to make sure that you're adding in a concentrate up\nSome electrolytes and see minerals and that kind of thing so you can keep and retain water but another great secret is to do lemon water or even alkaline water throughout the day but lemon water to start your day and lemon water to injure day so I recommend you even use like cuddle him and\nI'm half of it juice it put that into your water first water bottle of the day don't make it too big of a water bottle so it's dilute you want to get a good concentration of lemon centrist in that water and the first thing of the day and the end of the day which are really help you it'll help with energy it'll help with taste\nBut also to help a detox singing cleansing during especially that first week of your weight loss plants now\nWe I don't want you to go anywhere 'cause I mean

wellness for life with Dr Marian briefed on top five fifty three and one on one\nHalf the sundae out there hey this is Dr Marian than I Am on Katie essays five fifty and talking some medical\nTrying to get you guys healthy and happy and feeling well doing well so let's let's take off on another Sunday another topic\nLast week it talked about cholesterol a bit and that was a fun when I've gotten a lot of great responses from you guys thank you very much for all of that and so this week I Want to talk a little bit more about kind of the weight loss indicting department because I get a lot of questions\nOn what kind of diet should I Do because you know when we look at the Internet\nYou know the news and ... anything out their media related there is so much information coming and constantly about the different diets and there's always a fad there's a\nI knew um you know a new venture out there on how you should eat and you know there are some old fashioned ideas that are still around that have existed this far for a reason and so I Want to go into that a little bit with you and you know trying to weed through some of them is that are out there\nUh it just to give you an idea about how to eat too there's so many different to miss so let's let's get through it\nAnd some of the things that are important about eating I think overall is that yes you do need to change how you eat and yes you do need to move more\nIn order to lose weight and be healthy so it really isn't just about losing weight it is about being healthy\nAnd in this day and age it is very difficult to lose weight and get a nutrient dense\nMeal or or amount of calories and per day and what I mean by that is the more you reduce your calories the more you reduce your nutrition over all and not only your nutrition but your fiber\nSo you know there are many many different aspects to eating right other than just reducing your calories you have to get in the right you know nutrition your be vitamins or all of your vitamins and you have to get in the right amount of fiber\nSo that is really very very difficult and and you know many many years ago I used to say get your nutrition in your food but I have learned over these last twelve years that that is next to impossible\nThat there is no way to decrease your calories enough to get you know enough nutrition and and our nutrition is so poor in our food we have processed foods so far and so far above\nWhere we should that there is no nutrition and our nutrition so yes we have to do supplementation these days\nAnd even that is a bag of worms\nSo uh and you know my opinion on that I'm I'm pretty happy about it uh you know supplements and I'll talk to you about that again in a minute but let me back up a bit so you know in losing weight and getting healthy and and even in anti aging you know we're not only trying to lose weight these days but we're also trying to live longer and live well\nAnd in doing that a calorie reduction really is the way to go now ah one of these days I'm going to do a special program on how to eat less but do it successfully where you don't have\nA ton of craving and you know where you don't suffer for decreasing your calories but today let's just talk decreasing calories\nSo uh yeah you do have to divorce food to lose weight and it get healthy but it it really is about anti aging\nIt's about building muscle losing fat dropping your information getting rid of inflammatory and allergenic foods and building your immune system to a stronger better immune system but also you know increasing your muscle mass where you are a machine\nAnd you know you're fighting off disease and inside information which is the cause of disease and cancers and things like that so\nThat's what you're trying to do and that way you slow down the aging process so you know decreasing calories that is the first thing that you do the second thing that you do is you do need to decrease over all your carbohydrates and your starches\nNow by that you know there's a very long long laundry list of ways to decrease your ... the Quito diet there's paleo\nYou know there's there's a ... Atkins and you know there's a thousand different ways to decrease the cars but it's really very very simple so uh this is something that I Do in my office and not try to provide to you in the office\nAnd that is to practice cart counting but also decrease your starches so to decrease your piece potatoes and corn your breads and sugars and processed foods\nBut to increase your proteins and increase your uh you know fiber and increase at some of the fact\nYou can live very very well and eat very well increasing your proteins and veggies there is very little room to leave for pure refined carbohydrates\nSo we need to talk about uh you know things like that\nThe carbohydrates which is ... which are complex and which are simple and and all of that that really just keep it to a very very simple structure\nWhere you decrease the the carbohydrates in your in your life that are all ... carbohydrate and increase your carbohydrates which are mostly fiber when you look at a you know I'm a label\nLook at how many carbohydrates are in your food\nGo ahead then and subtract the fiber and level it off to how much protein is in there the more protein there is the more fiber\nAnd the less you know added sugar there is and the left carbohydrate the better your food is going to be again that's not going to leave you with a lot of nutrition and there but as far as carbohydrate counting that is really what you want so you want to make that and and protein the solid part of your diet\nFats are not as bad as we used to think there are ... that are bad out there there are certain oils and and things trans fats that are bad for us that saturated fat is not bad so meat\nIs not a horrible thing a butter really is not great for you but oils and uh and you know meats and things like that are okay so be sure to get in the right types of fats and if you're going to look at your your meats make sure that it's a high quality\nMake sure that it is you know grass fed\nOr organic in nature and make sure that it is you know on a solid clean antibiotic free type of a\nMeat that you're taking in and protein\nSo increasing your proteins and off to your vegetables when you look at vegetables and fruits vegetables must be the mainstay of your diet you can allow some vegetables and that makes sure again that it's lower starch type vegetables there's another way of looking at this called the glycemic index\nIf you ... you know purchased say a book or even just go on line and type in glycemic index you're going to get a fantastic list of you know zero to one hundred of veggies and fruits and things and breads and and other foods that are listed along this uh glycemic index\nOne hundred means pure carbohydrate and zero means absolutely no carbohydrate what you really never find any of those but if you can stay at about fifty and below for your carbohydrates than you are staying with something that is low glycemic and that is a carbohydrates that is okay to have\nSo keep your proteins really high keep your carbohydrate slow and keep your fat at kind of a medium level and just separate your diet into that now the next thing that is extremely popular has actually been around for centuries\nOr maybe even longer than that as long as time has been around and that is intermittent fasting\nSo you know people practice fasting and all sorts of ways and it's mostly related to religions and the religions you'll have it right they've they've incorporated this into their diets for a very long time and what intermittent fasting is\nYou know it's very difficult too fast for very long periods of time there are certain religions that do that say the Muslim religion\nHas Ramadan and other fasting periods where basically they'd go an entire month fasting from sun up to sun down and having no water and no food in between during this month\nAnd then they also practice this at other periods of time sometimes on and off during every week and there's that and then there's other ways of doing so if you if you consider that you eat a meal [noise]\nAnd the stress hormone cortisol increases every time you eat\nAnd cortisol is inflammatory and you would like to keep cortisol low then you should eat fewer times during the day many of these diets said that you should eat six times a day so three meals and two or three snacks and eat every couple of hours\nA state of exercise that ... and so it can't just be you know moving around a lot at work and lifting heavy pants and things like that it really has to be an organized an event\nSo one of the best things that you can do is do an exercise called hit so H. I. T. and that is high intensity interval training\nThere are thousands of ways to do it there are apps all over the app store if you go to the interest and put in hit\nHigh intensity interval training you're going to come up with the suggestion after suggestion\nOf different types of uh you know exercise that you can do the same thing for intermittent fasting you can also put that into ... or an app store and you can come up with all sorts of ways of doing it something that fits your lifestyle\nAnd so make it fit your lifestyle it can and will and so make it fit that when you do high intensity interval training what she'd do is you make your body become a metabolic machine\nYou make your body build muscle burn fat\nAnd you make it you know so much more efficient at doing its job and that is also you know a a way to lose weight and build muscle so usually what I Will do is recommend that people do strength training or muscle workouts on him so much more of a\nStrength training a guiding person I Will have you do more of that than actual cardiovascular exercise I don't think cardiovascular exercise is the end all be all I think it's wonderful to do something\nBut I think what really makes the most sense is to build your muscle mass as intense and high as you possibly can\nAnd that makes you a fat burning machine then once you build your muscle then you can do some sort of cardiovascular exercise that will allow you to burn off the excess calories and carbohydrates or just in the body\nAnd allow you to go into fat burning mode so first you do your your uh you know I work out with weights and then second do about Fifteen minutes of high intensity interval training and actually can be anywhere from\nSeven to twenty minutes there are types of seven minute workout\nThat are so efficient that are such a complete workout added on to muscle building or make you a great calorie burning machine and fat burning machine so even a seven minute exercise can do it believe me it can be done\nSo um you know one of the things I probably would like to do is give you a little bit of contact information where you can reach me or to some of these questions\nAre because I Know you're you're probably developing a lot of questions and so Dr ... at wellness for life dot net so the R.

experienced trading don't be scared off this is as easy as a one two three process um what we do is we trade one product\nOn the market and again it's\nAn easy one to three process that are mentor and strikes and the software instructs\nWe trade one product it's called the e many future it's on the S. and P. five hundred what's nice about the e many future is its traded in both directions so when the market is moving up we're making trades when the software tells us to\nAnd when it's going down we make money\nAnd trade so we actually don't share like what the actual results of the day is whether the market is up or down we'd make money either way we get to capitalize on all types of markets and all types of market conditions\nYou know this week for us was just another typical week you know all weeks are good for us but in particular yesterday was very very good and all we do is follow the instructions that the software gives us\nAnd like I said before the software is presented on a

a day like Michael said you can make more than that\nBut this is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh is my wife has even said that when she said in a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter]\nAnd and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy\nAnd our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software\nAnd it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling you stuff and his analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand\nSo that knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you'll walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved\nYou call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nOr thinks John you know first of all just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups as at our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a soft where\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on if there is not an active\nTrade developing there's just nothing there is just silence no talking and you can attest this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet so\nBetween what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to receive\nThe most level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program researched this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking ... so that he simplified it didn't do a process that anybody can do it it's the simple follow along color coded system\nThat he verbally describes as well as it's happening there's no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen\nSo when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software and it signals is unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen\nAnd I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself [noise]\nWe don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show we want you to see it then you can believe us after you see it you can call us at our\nEight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not gonna sit here and\nAnd talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day [noise]\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories what I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of give us a call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nReserve you're spot and a couple of our sessions there's no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phone live I'm so give us a call check this out in and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people\nAre trading real money our phone lines do get busy during the show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job and get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a jail B. E. or my mom had a jail be and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income uh but more likely you can far surpass that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at the\nBeginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred\nGrand and uh and and now you come out with a degree\nAnd then you have to pay that back\nNow you have to get a job and pay back\nSo are there are other trading schools but there are two things they don't have our software and the leadership of our mentors\nWe have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ...\nIt's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think uh I don't\nThink the way I I used to anymore at all or he reduces the variables in this thing to make it where you can make more money\nBut what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important when I got involved in this I was building my next\nGuest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg\nAnd I want a big ... Jake or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades nine were winners and the other\nTwo I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor and are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault\nYou start you start to think you know what you're doing and that's kind of when you hit into\nTrouble so where else are\nYou going to find a group like this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "28"}
