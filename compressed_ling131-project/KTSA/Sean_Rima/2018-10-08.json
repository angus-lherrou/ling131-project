when there is a big issue for Republicans we paid protesters to we just don't protest as much\nAh because we have jobs you know on the uh but uh don't don't think when you hear about oh my goodness the Democrats were paying protests we do it too okay it\nAbsolutely positively but there's just not a lot of video of it happening and um they uh they have video and these people are sort of

uh you go in and all of the people on the left all the operatives spokespeople even a Kamala Harris from California was on the the Judiciary Committee\n[noise] um they didn't refer to what Dr Ford said as the troops\nThey did not to they were not referring to what she said as the troops\nThey were referring to it as her truth because I was on the air with a democratic operative named Kenny Lee or something like that and she'll say Dr Ford told her truth and because she told her truth and I was like wait a minute but not your truth and my truth\nThere's not truth\nLike Patrick Moynihan once that you can have your own ... you can have your own opinion but can't have your own facts you can't have your own truth there's either the truth or there is not the truth and that's the way they got ... got around uh all the things that Dr Ford said that she fabricated\nUh for starters that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her eye and then this party that she couldn't remember all this kinda stuff the they got around calling it a lie by saying she was telling her truth and the only thing I can imagine is that if you're a serial if you're a psychopath\nAnd you become a serial killer and it's the dog that's telling you go out and murder people you can testify and that's your truth\nBut the dog told you to murder people it's not the truth but it's your truth\nThe dog told you go out

suggested to me that it wasn't funny what's your ...\nWhat are you laughing at it's not funny if you kind of funny I mean it's not an funny ah what happened you see a bunch of people go nuts over something that's been happening in this country for two hundred and some years you don't always get your way\nThey were talking before the break about how they're getting their the Democrats are going to completely weekend that Bernie's a repair Ginsburg because there is no way they want Trump to have a third\nSupreme Court pick Andy if the Republicans maintain control the Senate and he gets it it's going to happen you are literally going to head explode just walking down the street and there'll be blood everywhere regret um but people were talking about\nUh you know how it's a process and you know the Republicans didn't respect the process they respect anybody but it was the Democrats and work at prospecting anything they came out right off the bat said they weren't going to a a can vote to confirm Kavanaugh they hadn't heard a word\nOf any testimony at all this is even before Dr Ford fabricated her story um the uh right off the bat there was one group that even issued a press release saying that they wouldn't support and didn't even have his name on it\nBecause they didn't have the time to put the name of David right away they're not going to support it so when you do stuff like that\nIt becomes a sham and the entire thing was a sham and even got people they're talking about the impeaching him and again they can impeach him if the Democrats get control of the house they can impeach absolutely can they can go through the process it will be an epic disaster for them\nBecause you had a woman who lot no she didn't want sorry she told her true again not the truth her truth or who told that they're going to go through the process it'll be completely partisan and then when it gets to the Senate will vote for whatever punishment they won't vote to remove him\nAnd it doesn't matter you know that kinda stuff works with a um with a politician who has to run for office every couple of years that's when that stuff works when\nYou've got somebody who's appointed for

they were destroying languages along before that they were taking over people and eliminating their customs long before that they were in slave in each other long before that and if you want to talk about invoking superstition\nEither people who believed in God's and dancing around to make rain All right that wasn't exactly [laughter] as though there was no superstition here before Columbus got to the Bahamas as well so it's just kind of funny to watch in watching the [noise]\nWhat would you call it I guess you would call it revisionist history\nThat pops up now I Will say this is well\nThe idea that people are actually getting around I mean I Know there are parades\nYou know especially in areas where there are huge populations of Italian Americans\nI Lived in New Jersey for a while and then I don't know if you've watched there was a show called the Sopranos a few years back it was it was a PBS I didn't want her to people thought anyway I'm Italian Americans liked to have their parties and they're they're cool what's Columbus and so\nAh they tried to do it there and are in New Jersey and the Italians basically told them to shove it and uh so that kind of died on as the away um but uh in other parts of the country they do do that like I said in Austin\nA last year the city council approved a resolution to recognize the second Monday of every October as indigenous people's day to day that day saying they've Columbus Day and a day of the city council resolution said for indigenous people forever changed their identity cultures and achievements\nJust like um some of the other indigenous people do to them when they invaded raped and murdered and enslaved other indigenous people\nHash tag reality uh so they got all bent out of shape and now people are trying to do this and now they're attractive and they're attacking Trump\nAnother Twitter user pointed out Columbus did not discover North America\nAre due to Trump didn't say that so okay yes there are now now they're now were reduced to arguing things that Trump didn't even say a but that's okay [noise] uh and they're getting all bent out of shape about it and that's fine if everybody wants to get all bent out of shape but it's Columbus Day it doesn't matter\nAnd if you're against naming at Columbus Day in favor of indigenous people's\nDay then at least pull your head out long enough to acknowledge that the indigenous people were doing the exact same things to each other probably hundreds of years before uh Columbus landed in the bombs\nSo to suggest that there was no rape enslavement murder of indigenous peoples going on before Columbus got here\nIs uneducated and foolish but I'm just curious if you ah have a problem with Columbus Day some people do that today it's Columbus Day where I live some places it's indigenous people day in fact in Columbia [laughter] nuts are Columbus in Columbus ohio there's no Columbus Day\nThey call it indigenous peoples there today so you've got an entire city named for Columbus but they don't even celebrate Columbus Day there they celebrate indigenous peoples they are they going to change the name of Columbus to indigenous peoples I Am from indigenous

I don't know if you heard the speech we didn't get you up here the speech it literally kicked the Democrats on the tea\nIs what it did he literally doubled up this this thing just punched him right in the mouth with everything up among other things he apologized to Brett Kavanaugh and his family we've got that will play to get a little bit later on but he apologized to Brett Kavanaugh and his family he addressed his daughters\nAnd apologized to a ... to do his daughters and talked up the uh his um his or their dad to them which was eloquent the speech the Trump game was eloquent and that's not something that's often used when talking about Donald Trump\nOr he a set of course that everybody was innocent until proven guilty\nAlso said that uh he was proven innocent which is irrelevant because you don't have to prove yourself innocent it was a just a bombardment of lives that was spread about Brett Kavanaugh you've never seen the funny thing is by the way\nAnd now I'm having the TST because of the past few weeks was all coming back to the funny thing is is that ah the Democrats have been calling this the barest met the Democrats have been talking calling us attracts you been doing all these things the Democrats are the ones who caused all of that\nThey announced both for Kavanaugh was even\nAnd as the nominee that they were going to oppose his nomination it didn't\nMatter not one pitch\nAbout these uh sexual uh the the the the the live these fabricated stories about sexual assault that never happened\nIt didn't matter one bit\nBecause they weren't going to vote to confirm him anyway they ... Dianne Feinstein five even find that I have\nA a go find sign as we all know held on to the letter\nAh let's see if that's what I'm Dianne Feinstein of California top Democrats the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee or tweeted that confirm Kavanaugh in the face of credible allegations which didn't happen there were no credible allegations\nOf sexual assault that we're not thoroughly investigated and his belligerent partisan performance in last Thursday's hearing\nUndermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court\nSo the uh they weren't thoroughly investigated well\nGee let's think back here if somebody hadn't held on to the letter from Dr Ford for two months\nDianne Feinstein and then ... who what Dr Ford was trying to ... to ah control her anonymity was trying to maintain our anonymity and then when you realize it was going to happen anyway that is when you or somebody on your staff leaked\nThis letter you remember only three people have this let\nDr Ford had the letter or lawyers that\nFor their lawyers and then there was a member of the house whose name escapes me right now and Dianne Feinstein and her staff Feinstein absolutely positively one hundred percent leaked this lead or somebody on a staff did there's no doubt in my mind\nAnd again I can say that and I'll just I'll just say this\nI'm telling my truth\nBecause if you remember after Dr Ford testified\nAh once she settled on a story because she had a little trouble settling on a story Dr Ford did\nAh first ah you know are there were two attackers then there were two attackers there was just one she couldn't remember where it was she can remember when it was she can remember who was there and then she remembered who was there she named witnesses who say that it never happened all the still trouble deciding on her store\nThe house that had that they were trying to build a second entrance do because she was going through P. TST and needed to have that second exit\nAnd argued with her husband about it it turned out that that wasn't actually the case they were starting a counseling business out of their home and that's why they needed the second amendment so that the\nPatients could come in customers could come in so she had a little trouble are deciding on what the actual truth was Dr foreign debt\nSo there's all fabricated story maybe um if they would have had I don't know two extra months to investigate this B. S. but they didn't so this was a completely fabricated event this was a non event\nIs what this was but the Democrats tried to use it and put it out there senator Cory Booker who's out of New Jersey or said that the option of impeaching Kavanaugh\nShould not be ruled out and said he would support further investigation into the newest just just just as a book or told a from Iowa he was interviewed in Iowa\nBecause he's going to run for president by the way a said if there is conclusively evidence that shows unequivocally that he lied to a Senate committee that is a crime and he should be held accountable for those criminal acts but there is no such evidence because he didn't lie now\nThat being said or the Democrats prepared to bring perjury charges against Dr Ford cars as of right now it looks like Dr Ford made up the entire store there's zero proof none\nThere's not one ... of evidence that Brett Kavanaugh did anything so if they're going to bring impeachment charges against cabin off which wouldn't be pointless by the way because if they bring up by ... if they get control of the house\nAnd they bring up impeachment charges against him then the punish even if he's convicted which he would be because it's Democrats of all political or he shouldn't be because it's a completely make believe story it never happened but uh if they ... if he's convicted or in the impeachment um a proceedings uh it would go to the Senate\nTo vote to remove him from the Supreme Court you\nWould need two thirds of the Senate\nTo remove him from the Supreme Court that's sixty seven votes\nThat means the Democrats would have to pick up almost twenty seats in order to get that a sixty seven votes they aren't going to get that so he will not be removed from the Supreme Court because it will be another partisan battle\nAbsolutely positively a partisan battle and uh the the ... Republicans aren't going to vote to remove him because there is no new evidence because you can't have new evidence for something that didn't happen and the sexual assault with Brett Kavanaugh involved never happened", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "08"}
