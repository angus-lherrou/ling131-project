you office called All right thank you very much for calling I Hope that helps yeah it does Yes sir Bye bye\n[noise] okay [noise] so uh\nI've been doing this show for over Twenty years and it's been so much fun I learned so much and so let me hear from you if\nIf and don't be bashful please call now and number two one oh five nine nine fifty five fifty five [noise] to winnow five nine nine fifty five fifty five and let's talk a let me help you out with any dental situations or oral health situations\nAnd um [noise] love to hear from you love to help we help you and discuss any problem that you may have\nWe have so much information and so much knowledge that I've accumulated through the years in preparing the show's studying and going to continuing education courses have thousands\nAnd thousands of hours continuing education so that a lot of knowledge backed up and can help you along with these different questions and so now\nI wanted to pass it on and on friday I had my yearly appointment with my ...\nAnd so I ask him about kidney stones now has nothing to do with history this has nothing to do with history but I get questions why I'm from time to time for my patients about calcium supplements\nAnd of course we're very very in tune with the county and calcium supplements and we recommend them very highly for bone\nHealth the bone housing especially around cheap\nSo we do recommend calcium supplements and the all the vitamins that go with the calcium supplement\nSo from time to time I get callers and as well as my patients who asked about information on calcium supplements do they cause a kidney stone as well as oxalates\nLike those in foods such as peanuts chocolate chi stage do they cause\nStones kidney stones so he's up\nData on a lot of these things are in his ... it's a large group and he's in charge of the information in relation dispensing\nSo Dr self stain is his name and he recommends a calcium supplements especially a calcium sits right he recommends five hundred milligrams twice a day with meals\nAnd this is for men's bone health and he does not treat women particularly so this is about maintaining bone health and men osteoporosis and ...\nAnd of course\nSaid he doesn't treat women so he deferred on that because that's a whole different\nArea this regimen was to prevent osteoporosis and men in the ... no ... in his opinion he said that oxalates and food and calcium supplements as previously mentioned or not a problem unless there's an issue with hyper\nThyroid is hyper thyroid isn't\nSo which creates problems in this area but if you have a\nNo problems with that\nThen it's not a problem so they take away your point is that you need to be concerned about calcium supplements and he recommends calcium sits right in five hundred milligrams twice a day with meals for man's bone you know\nAnd then are actually formation 'cause the oxalates and peanuts and chocolate and she ... um because studies\nShow very little risk of developing kidney stones and that's an interesting point\nAnd I did not know that he did point out that drinking a button war they\nWill remove and wash out most stone policy when they're small little grand noodles learn like gravel and the good news so the bottom line there has to remember to consume\nDaily a bond water so\nThis is a I thought that was very interesting because calcium we recommend calcium and they're very we have a very wonderful a bone guard\nForte it's called ... for ... and a calcium supplements because so many of our patients have bone loss of the housing of the cheese oh period I'm tired of this period or from disease and once you lose a bone you're not going to get it back [noise]\nSo if you have ... inflammation in the gums you can change that you can reverse that that should be the end of the line\nIt can be corrected within two weeks but refused losing bone you're gonna have a major problem going forward as to what caused the bone loss\nAnd eventually you see a bone housing around these laws teeth to get weak or or not we ... mobile and then you lose two\nI then I I've been a okay Ronald [laughter] to where they where they were still putting gold\nSo they always remark about all the gold I had them I\nMean it's marvelous set of farmers are those are the those worked so well so [noise] uh\nThat should give you some guidelines for what you have to try and do it that you gave us a call if we can have your doctors lately\nI got your number okay great thank you so much that day thank you for calling about\nOkay I Would say so these are the type of problems we like to help you out with and um [noise]\nDiscovered the calcium and oxalates so I Hope that gives you some information on that Dr ... the urologist was not concerned about the\nCalcium supplements the ... he like calcium sit straight five hundred milligrams twice a day with meals if you are needing a calcium supplement and um\nHe was not concerned about the oxalates unless you're eating a lot of you know it's chocolate\n... a\nTea or things of that type even if you were the incidence of oxalates forming kidney stones is very very minimal according to the studies so I Hope\nThat will give you some idea 'cause I'm head through the years I mean many people ask me about that and I didn't know the exact uh information on that in a world even follow up more on this\nUm but I didn't I Hope this gives you some guidelines on calcium supplements because calcium supplements are so terribly important oh my gosh\nI'm especially it seems like the osteoporosis the bone failures of its it's being replaced it seems like just about all of my patients not home on patients but so many of my patients have it replacements and\nKnee replacements and those are those are problems because those replacements uh I think a hip replacement\nIs anywhere from five to ten years since last thing and there's cemented with acrylic cement and nice acrylics the Mets are problematic to a degree so any time that you can keep your bones healthy\nAnd keep from getting into problems with bone loss and of course we're concerned about bones because of the housing of the teeth is so valuable to you\nAnd it is a harbinger of bone problems at us when we examine your teeth doing examination and the Hi Janice as a charting of the depths of the pockets and a records what's going on\nI'm currently in the mouth paying attention to that is is very valuable information because once that bone of housing that his housing your teeth his last year not going to get it back and that's\nProbably a very big problem\nIf the gums now a report it to you recently that they had this world wide workshop on the classification of Perry uh Donald and implant diseases in conditions\nBecause a consensus report hadn't been done since Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo they decided the American academy varied ON Technology in the world federation of implant ... ah they decided to do enough dates and the main thing of the update it came out of this was\nIf you have a bleeding point when your gums or probed to determine the pocket Depp deep your pockets are a pocket being the space between the gum to shoot and the truth and when it hits the bottom of the pocket which is bone\nIf you have any bleeding at that time you've got June ... which is the precursor to period on I ... and bone loss\nThe good news is though if that's all you have and you have no pockets over three millimeters it can be reversed in as little as two weeks and then you can put on be put on a maintenance schedule where you will not have a problem in the future\nSo [noise] ah we've reported on this\nWhole\nUh meetings and uh we can do some more information on that because it was a world wide\nA\nStudy and report on taste definitions for period out on health and ginger by this which can save your chief is following the instructions and the information there a week you can save your teeth you can save your\nGums uh it's it's and you have\nA just a marvelous systemic or systems are\nThat can be addressed with these this information so I can give you some more of covered this two or three times and I can cover it again if uh everybody is so inclined it's very valuable information and one of our biggest problems is dancers\nBoth in my practice and in other dental practice medicine specialist one one of the biggest things it seems\nTo have people take seriously the bleeding points and not trash ring the value of healthy chase and not spending the time\nI'm brushing the truth influencing the tooth and using that device called an air force or our water we have these wonderful tools electric toothbrush is we have an air flush or which uses a puff of air and water to go into areas that you can't get into\nThey have wonderful a water pick type devices shoot a stream of water into these areas and if you have any kind of implants you've got to be using\nYou've got to be using the water picked on these devices on these structures\nBecause that's the most effective thing that we have currently to lean an implant and that's why I was talking about the gentleman that first caller how important that it is because of the skin\nWithstand so much more\nA bacterial attack then can an implant and implant is very that tissue around the implant up the implant itself\nThe tissue around and employment is very very susceptible to deteriorating gum disease so that's the point I Want to make about implants versus teeth\nOne of the numbers that I've seen by an authority is that the implant the tissue is Fifteen times more susceptible to infection and a natural to\nThink that the implant the tissue around the implant is Fifteen times more susceptible to an infection of gum infection\nFifteen times more than a natural to to shoot around a natural too which is huge just huge and that's why I say if doesn't implant since Nineteen Seventy eight\nWithin a pioneer through this whole process and watched all of the systems developed than how wonderful they are\nWhen we when I first started doing it was done pretty much by general Dennis\nAnd we were really not look that uh we weren't looked at very kindly by the dental community because it was something that was way out of the box type of thing\nBut with persisted and then in Nineteen eighty two and more random are published this landmark study that he'd been doing implants for quite a few decades silver in Sweden and they did work and so that changed the whole thing\nBut uh and now it's just a routine thing placing an implant is pretty doggone routine\nAnd if you don't have bone bones can be um ... supplemented are enhanced or different things but again it goes back to the fact you're still better off with a natural too and that's what we have a hard time to getting our patients\nIf you have had X rays then go ahead and bring your X rays and we can give you an evaluation or you can go to the dentist and get other opinions dentist or love to get second opinions it's not a problem\nAnd keep a notebook with you keep your X rays with you assume that you don't have to go through these things are locked and keep your health history in your health history is very important in determining what half way you're going to choose\nAs I mentioned if you're listening previously we has tremendous technology available\nOr is just stunning when we're able to do is change history and all the way from very minimal type of work to very sophisticated work so what were you going to say\nWell okay so now the question as out I don't need like all the services available I mean I just made a couple of ... because like I I mean like ... they are worn down in the back top and you know that the top of the body\nIf they're not I mean they're still cosmetically I guess okay I'm\nA little here's one thing you want to keep them here's one thing you want to keep in mind is a is and that is in this one is very wonderful for moving these worn teeth out of harm's way if you don't correct that wear pattern\nAnd you don't move the teeth where they are out of nowhere function you're going to destroy your teeth you're going to have root canals or nerve damage and so on but you can\nWith the invisible line very uh effectively have the teeth moved out of harm's way and we can we have technology now we have a a light ... we have a light that will move the teeth I'm like a instead of\nA every two weeks changing the trays you can move the trays ... every three and a half days so the treatment is very fast active\nSo there are techniques like this [noise] uh and that's one thing that you'd want to look at what you want to evaluate your natural to you if\nYou possibly keep those natural teeth a that's a wonderful way to do it and you can get by with you don't have to have a full miles of of he asks is the yeah and you've learned that already [noise]\nBut yeah they know knowing what would try to fix that Keith ... and\nHis own okay probably is the bone is the bone okay well we're doing was not had\nThat when I had that data at a ... and then she'll consultation dad you know apparently it was because I only heard yelling out when they're measuring whatever they're measuring\nFor one time yeah so they were all cheeses threes and that was okay for that that's ...\nFelt but I'm not going to pay fifty thousand dollars to get it bad sure and so I started looking into other option that I thought well I could just you know do it and they play at one she live plants and I'd have once you interpret I'm Anita side but here it's that question\nOkay so if I were to do something like that yeah it just gets ... what I inside\nEventually it if I Lived long enough to buy their teeth because they become a ward are are going to have problems and so eventually I Will probably it you know have to have to do something maybe put in one of those\nI mean livable ones would they be able to work with the two implants that I already have in my mouth and adjust those around a bridge\nIt is possible to enter your around there\nBut again you're without getting a proper diagnosis you were when you take a ... a problem like what you have and it's a major restored a problem\nYou want to get all your data figure it out and figure out from the dentist is going to tell you what do your mouth is going to look like in ten years Fifteen Years\nAnd get a treatment plan\nA value wage what do you have now and where you will be moving forward before you make any decisions and doing making decisions on your own life that you've gotta have dental\nUm design team to show you because there's there are many things that can be done especially if you have good healthy bones around in your case it's amazing what can be done so that's the first thing that you want to do like I said you know your X rays\nAre and make a point was to get treatment Mexico there are some good dentists index men Mexico and what you um [noise] have a risk there as well\nUm I've seen some good work and have seen some work that you would be you would that would not want to necessarily do so but there are so many it's the main thing is getting a diagnosis without a diagnosis of without an accurate diagnosis\nThen you can figure out what can be done you can get the different prices for the techniques because uh if\nThere is so ... so many avenues because so many pathways so that would be my advice to you [laughter]\nOkay well thank you for that I don't see all that many path life but [laughter] I see I see that I see it go and plants and that's and that's okay but it felt right and I mean I get there that's a great 'cause that\nSure if you want to if you want to come in and let us give you an evaluation will be happy if you bring your X rays\nAnd we can give you an evaluation of its Dr ... Williams and\nAnd the adverse to one oh three four one twenty five sixty nine [noise] I've got to run now what's the end of the hour wow it went fast thank you so much for calling in and\nEverybody for listening and have a great we remember to brush your teeth at night in last night's it's like you live longer studies are pretty substantial thank you so much\nAnd she wants to talk to you next week by by [noise]\n\nOoh\nOoh\nAll to you as a moral regional national world by breaking news\n\nFrom Haiti scene in\nA caravan of Central American migrants his own them move again in the order ABC's ...\nMinutes with a group and you see a dad who don't go in the man is trying to reunite with relatives in Austin, Texas after he was deported a few days and you have a daughter\nThat's one of the reasons why I'm going back and forth\nYou know I don't want him to show that I had [noise]\nPresident Trump is making the caravan a major issue going into the midterm election\nPresident tweeted quote for efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border and quote an added quote the caravans are a disgrace to the Democratic party and quote but there is no evidence of any connection between Democrats and the more than five thousand Central American migrants who have been making their way to the southern border\nABC's Alex Mellon in Washington a Saudi official is now clarifying his government's narrative of how journalists Jim all his show he died efficiently saying that the Washington Post columnist was put into a chokehold that he did not die as the result of a fist fight us allies are responding to the new\nUK France and Germany have issued a statement calling for urgent clarification from Saudi Arabia over the death of Jim ... show he unnamed Turkish officials have leaked gruesome details of a pre planned assassination of the Saturday dissident\nTurkey's president said he will announce details of their investigation on Tuesday\nABC's Jennifer ... at the foreign desk in London officials in Costa Rica essays for Americans are among the five people who were killed in a rafting accident in that nation they say it happened when they're around capsized on rain swollen river\n[noise] you're listening to ABC News\nI'm a veteran we hit a line in Vietnam as America's veterans face challenges da da da da da de ... get the benefits they learn\nTo finally admitted that might be TST I wasn't doing well so veterans can reach victories great and small now I Wish I'd found any sooner\nMight make during just enjoying each day\nMore and more victories were veterans and go to ...\nIt's time to time to join the millions of people that need happy with zoom video conferencing who gives you flawless video crystal clear audio and instant sharing across any mobile tablet or desktop device but the best thing about new pitches works to ditch the distraction\nJoined a movement and need to happy with zoom video conferencing ... us to set up your free account today that little dot US zoom video conferencing\nThere are some things electro doesn't do very well elections are held butter rub down\nUp into our show I'm going to go over the first key will take a quick break and we'll come back for the next two but the first one is really key when it comes to an end it's what people really under value in the process of losing weight because what are you really want to lose let's talk about weight loss what are you really want to lose\nDo you want to lose water do you want to lose muscle you want to lose what do you want to lose and most people say I want to lose ... I Want to lose fat\nLike well how do you know if you're losing weight water or fat or what you might be losing and that's really important to know in my office if a client comes in for specifically for chiropractic and weight loss or just for weight loss we doing in depth test on and that actually assesses\nThe water weight the fat person and also even to some degree the muscle mass percent and and wait\nSo we can really assess throughout a weight loss plan for you are you losing water or are you losing muscle are you losing fat really really really cool tested bio and peanuts analysis so it really checks that the only people who can't do that test\nOr people with pacemakers or any type of rhythm a device that's affecting the rhythm and your body or ... muscle stimulate her um it's it's looked down upon to be able to do it that way because it it might affect the conductivity and the transmission of those which wouldn't be good right if you're a pacemaker or just doesn't work for thirty seconds we don't like that\nSo anyone else though this test is amazing and you can call my office and leave that message and let me know you want to get to the weight loss addition to that test and and I are my team all that you know what that is it's a nominal fee usually anywhere from twenty seven to Ninety nine dollars to get that for work done on a weight loss or metabolic component\nPretty cool testing that we do in our office and also want to let you know as we jumped into these three secrets I have some live in office workshops coming up in my office coming up in a couple of weeks\nUm I have three offerings which is really great I'm I'm gonna let you know about two of them because we still have some spots left in those and until those are fully don't open up that third workshop time so it's coming up on October twenty ninth at six PM\nOctober twenty ninth Monday at six PM you have to be registered it is free and complimentary workshop where you learn all about our weight loss and metabolic programs\nWhether you come in with our a or MS or nerd degenerative disease or whether you just want to lose ten pounds through the summer I mean through the through the winter and get ready for the spring\nYou know many of you it would just be a single goal by by uh by by just being honest\nJust to not lose not gain weight this holidays that's what I'm

to leave that Fifteen to twenty pounds in your body than it is to lose it fast that's personally now if you do it chemically there can be long term\nDetox Oregon responses and that's what we really recommend a doctor supervised doctor recommended product program so that you can really have that coaching accountability and doctors can kind of know they can know what to look for what not to look for\nAnd I'm gonna say not all doctors because many many doctors are trained in that product they're going to sell you they're trained to some degree and they're trained to some degree the the fifty thousand dollar machine that somebody talk them into buying but do they really know like how to check the metabolic things in your body\nIn my program as well which is really phenomenal you'll learn at the workshop on the twenty ninth or the first is is is tracking so we have an app that we've helped a be a part of and developing\nAnd literally on that apple you log un once you're on the program you put your measurements and your food you put it in it it gives you a daily emails of different stretches and exercises you can do if you want to add exercise is a component um it gives you recipes

week or two of the program you're going to commit to you want to make sure you're actually doing even more than that\nYou want to be giving your body water but we even have a dropper bottle in our in our program that's a scene mineral concentrate that really does help to balance your electrolytes and when you do that with your program it really helps you to actually retain a healthy amount of

practice medicine I feel like I Am finally helping and healing people as opposed to just passing on a pill of some sort and\nIn hopes that you know you get a little better and that it helps solve the problem but it never does and so I Am very excited always to be on the radio and bring you some new information so here we are and this week I wanted to talk a little bit about cholesterol I got a few requests\nTo talk about cholesterol think I've talked about it before but uh you know cholesterol is such a common issue and it is a ... not just common but it's it's probably one of the most important things because heart disease is\nOne of the ... you know the highest ah killers in the United states as far as diseases go\nI you know heart attacks and strokes and things like that or a ... related to heart attacks and you know heart failure and and all those things so\nYou know close to a place and important important role and it's something that affects us from way way back in our you know younger years so as soon as your kids are born the clock starts on trying to prevent heart attacks and strokes\nSo good diet and exercise and uh you know managing your weight those are the of courses so those are the things that you know good and well that you need to do and and that's always very difficult to do I understand on every corner is a water burger or nothing against water burger but I Love water burger but\nUh on the corner is a fast food chain of some sort and the grocery store is you know an hour after hour of Coca Cola and processed foods and things that make our life a little bit easier and taste really good\nBut aren't good for us and so it makes it very difficult at the other thing too is is the processing of our foods\nWe have things that are a containing a lot of pesticides and sugar or not just sugar but carbohydrates and refined grains and things that also were not very good for us that you know helped perpetuate the problem of of ah you know\nGain weight and gaining weight and and bad cholesterol so you know those are things that again are the of courses and and I said that because of course you've got to eat right and exercise right so\nHere's a few tips I think that might help in the long run to you know deal with a cholesterol problems that you don't have to go to the doctor for I'm not a big proponent of getting giving Staten medication so\nA Staten are very commonly used by doctors these days and are very well studied but I think we miss the mark and I think the guidelines that are out there for cholesterol have miss the mark\n[noise] so let me explain you know there's a number you go to your doctor you get your blood drawn and you get your cholesterol checked and you sit down with your dog and they go over a number right or a couple of numbers maybe four or five numbers\nSo that is where the guidelines have focused in the last two years and I am in significant disagreement with this process [noise]\nSo I don't just check four or five numbers I check about Fifteen numbers and let me explain why so when you sit down and your doctor tells you about your bad quote unquote bad cholesterol\nWell cholesterol is not that inherently anyway cholesterol is something that we need it is how we make hormones so especially at night when you're asleep [noise]\nThe cholesterol goes through you know or the triglycerides and pre cholesterol things go through the the blood and go to the liver and deliver begins to make cholesterol and then you go through the process of repairing body to she's making hormones and other things that cholesterol does for you\nWe need cholesterol it's a part of our existence it's a part of what our body needs so we we need it [noise]\nIt's what makes it bad is a couple of things so your doctor tells you the number is what makes it bad well no not really number is important so even if you have you know the good type of of course\nFor all even if it's to hide that still not good so everything in moderation right not too high not too low right in the middle\nBut what makes it bad is actually the size of it so when you eat a lot of carbohydrates and uh you know refined processed foods\nWhat happens is the cholesterol becomes very very small and very dense so it's packed full of cholesterol and the more that it gets the smaller and more virulent it gets\nSo it likes to eat end of the artery wall and then begin to build up in the artery wall and that's when the disease process begins [noise]\nSo it's the ... what makes it very ... like that and an aggressive\nIs the size of it but also some other particles that are both genetic and acquired\nSo one of the genetic factors is called lp little a and one of the acquired or two of the acquired factors are LDL sea and there's ideal also but ah another important one is a ... be a P o capital be\nSo these are particles that make up the LDL particle and so the size of it being very small and dance and packed\nFull of cholesterol and then also being full of these extra particles make it more virulent April be it I I relate it to teach\nIt's like the teeth that are attached to the cholesterol molecule and that's what each end of the artery wall and the L. P. little lake and it's like a little tail it's kind of a sticky table so it collects other cholesterol pieces at that stick together and then hold on to the artery wall more tightly\nAnd then LDL see is just again what makes up the LDL and the more of it is definitely not better but all those bad particles around that make it more virulent\nSo if you have a Staten and you take a stat and what it does is it reduces the number okay it does not reduce the other pieces of it that make it virulent and aggressive\nSo ... and all those things they might be a little bit affected but not affected as much as they should be\nBut it will reduce the number so even if you're number your LDL say is one fifty and it comes down to a hundred and that puts you within the guidelines but you haven't done anything about the size of the political or the virulent pieces that make up the political\nThan all you've done is lower the number but you have not changed your disease course you're still going to build a bad cholesterol and the inside of the arteries [noise]\nSo what you need to do is ... and again that's that's why I and go back to the beginning to the of horses and tell you that you know you need to change up your diet and changes significantly lots of protein and veggies take out a lot of ah the refined grains\nTake out a lot of the carbohydrates and sugars those are the main things that Dr cholesterol to be bad in any form and then you know GMOs and also a lack of nutrition and I'll talk about nutrition here and just a few minutes\nBut those are the things that will make your cholesterol bad so you want to increase the size and that sounds a little backwards and size of your cholesterol is something that I checked out of the laboratory that I Do\nBut you what you want is to increase the size you want it to be big and fluffy and bounce off artery walls and go to your liver at night and make hormones and so even if you have a high number of you know good cholesterol\nA high number is not necessarily good for you but it's better than a low number of bad cholesterol so the Staten medication actually reduces just the number it doesn't change how meaner virulent or aggressive your cholesterol as or the size of it\nUh you know and you put in your ... the answers in your health assessment there's an algorithm of eleven thousand medical journals that your answers will go through and then those medical journals are listed in your vitamin a\nRecommendations and you know those are things that even if you're not scientifically inclined are are medical inclined you can still look at that and see the science behind what you are taking and I think that's incredibly reassured\nSo the science behind this ideal life is absolutely amazing and it contains the right things that you should be taking now other things that will be explained the book that's not ideal isolated that can be added to it\nOr things like red east rice and also which actually is a natural stat and uh it doesn't have the same vitamin depletion that are associated with it but it acts much like a an actual Staten\nA it there's also another thing that I like to recommend by ... the um [noise]\nThe vitamin company or the molecular another favorite of mind my mind and that is burg amount Bert ... is another you know herb and has incredible study is behind it or the molecular has done some wonderful work with cholesterol\nAnd burger much can increase your good cholesterol as well as decrease your bad cholesterol plus the inflammation\nAnd this is a a powerful combination we have no medication that will increase our good cholesterol there were some trials in the past that are included a a medication by one of the drug companies and it was pulled because of safety concerns\nSo broke um ought to this date is a an exercise or about the only two things that I Know what that increase your good cholesterol so there's another reason to exercise right there\nUm ... again there are some other things that Dr Houston's book will mention a now for the last thing I Want to talk to you about that the reason that I don't use Staten in my clinic\nIs uh for some of the reasons I mentioned but also because I can treat your cholesterol without using a stat and so I treat thyroid conditions and we all have a thyroid condition the reason we have a thyroid condition is because our thyroid may actually work\nIt may actually put out firewood horn them\nThe problem is thyroid hormone is not activated yet when it comes out of the gland so it really serves no purpose once the hormone leaves the gland it does nothing\nIt has to go to the liver and some other tissues but it goes to the liver and it's converted or activated into free teeth three\nNow because of our vitamin depletion because of stress and quarters all issues we do not make as much free T. three as we should so free T. three is low and then the other culprit is testosterone you know my favorite\nUm I use a lot of testosterone therapy in my clinic I Do ... as opposed to creams as opposed to shots shots arson that ethic and they are not safe in my view\nPallets are natural and are safe and no you're not putting a foreign substance and deer skin with a lot of um scarring and and uh you know visible scars and things like that that is not what happens\nPellets are plant based they go right underneath the skin and a special shot there is no real scarring associated with it you don't really see any of marks and it absorbs completely over a three to six months if you're a woman it's three to four months if you're a man that's five to six months\nAnd it completely dissolve there are no artificial compounds that are associated with it\nSo you're not getting any weird scarring you're not putting anything weird underneath the skin and pellets have been around since the Nineteen thirties and the safety studies behind it are absolutely amazing there are thousands\nThere are no studies that show that testosterone when it's natural is not safe so it is a hundred percent safe\nUh and that is something that I Do at the clinic [noise]\nUm so I invite you to take a look at some of the things that I've recommended here and my time has run short I might have to sit down and do a second show I guess on on cholesterol because it's a huge huge issue\nBut I Hope that some of this is how you can find me at Vance Jackson and for ten so I'm at forty four to Vance Jackson road just outside the leap for ten I'm going to give you a telephone number here uh so you can call for an appointment at\nTwo one zero six eight eight seven seven three five you can also call two one zero six nine eight seven nine to five I'm for some reason feeling like I'm giving you the wrong telephone number\nA says six nine eight seven eight to five so uh that is the that is the ... number\nSometimes I I think I I Need to have my uh my testosterone increase right get my brain working a little better\nAt that and forty four O T advanced Jackson sweet one hundred please give us a call and convince at the clinic we will get your laboratory I Will do these special labs I Will educate you on all this I'll give you all these recommendations\nThis is amazing science this is not stuff that I have made at this stuff is real\nAnd you can read mark Houston's book and see some of that for yourself\nA science is ever changing and what we learned in medical school is in you know what the guidelines are out there or not what doctors I feel should be doing there's more to the story and that's what I studied was more to the story\nAll right I Am going to have to go now and uh we'll be back next week with a new topic I always love hearing from you if you want to email me Dr ... at wellness the number for life dot
