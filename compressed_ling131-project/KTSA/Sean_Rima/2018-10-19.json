friends don't have the means to have that dinner in that commodity in that sell the ship that we all enjoy every Thanksgiving\nAnd it's one of our ways that window world and and as as a family to give back to be almost city in and help those people who may not otherwise have that great meal and have that chance to fellowship with other people\nIt's very easy is it Thanksgiving is a is a moment of the year we're really supposed to count your blessings but you know those of us with family I guess we get used to having our daily or a yearly ah celebrations and it can be easy to take it for

for one of our big sponsors this hour and Sarah Mr Anthony Corey given up rather to guard [noise]\nHow you doing man I'm great crazy excited to be here\n... we're glad to have you here and as I told you if you're in a few minutes ago you know both of our vehicles or ... or the guy you guys are just always treated us so well and uh you know you go into some of these places and they're very impersonal but in Syria you guys\nAre are very personable and the ... just enjoy buying cars for you to talk to me about what are you guys are uh you know a deep role and you guys have been involved with the with the radio on for for a number of years\nAnd this is your first time I think of the Radio's on yesterday is what what is your first impressions about what you're seeing going on here\nI just think it's an amazing thing to be a part of obviously just reading some of the stats for everything that has to be for the money raised is like the turkey for instance being Ninety four hundred pounds of turkey\n[laughter] to me that's that's insane Ninety four hundred pounds of turkey were raising money for\nIt'd be twenty five thousand people on average every year a there's a a volunteer force of four thousand people yeah you know and when I first moved here one of the first things I did was the radio on and that was seven years ago and I just fell in love with this town as a result\nOf the human as dinner and knowing the getting to those amazing family and you guys have been and then Sara been with us through the whole thing is wonderful\nWell at least we can do to get back to the community that just so much for us it's it's a just a small token of of how we can help and and to do something as amazing as affecting twenty five thousand people as his awesome so we're glad to be a part\nYou know it was really cool about the dinner itself is that you get people who go there because they're kind of in a bad place or maybe they're just isolated from folks\nYou know I probably would like to talk to you about this stuff at some point you know I I don't know if I've ever mentioned this to you before but my father who who passed two years ago uh worked with the arch and Special Olympics or for the last twenty five years of his life now Paris my mom was eighty six she's still a legal advocate and uh\nEspecially with the special effects I mean it's such an amazing event I I've been participated in a few over the years is special\nOlympics fit so much with what more it's more land is about and that is if you give people an opportunity to do something right a daycare they that they thought before maybe they could not do and it's like that more is when I ride a ride that maybe they thought they could not ride or was not we're not able to ride right to self esteem from that is incredible same thing happens with the Special Olympics\nWhen someone gets in and in competition wins are even if they don't want everybody wins at the special effects but the beauty of the competition and the camaraderie in coming together and inclusiveness changes people's lives and that's why we're so proud that the Special Olympics is coming to San Antonio\nNow speaking of changing people's lives to one thing we've learned about the dinner is that you very often find folks who were alone isolated and they go to dinner and they are so moved that you know the next year or when they get back on their feet or whatever the situation changes they come back and they volunteer\nOh it's incredible you know San Antonio is an incredibly passionate city yeah ... ... with a lot of passion um but you know when you do go to the the dinner a on the lunch I called the lunch because really more of a lunch and does it end right\n[laughter] I'm I'm getting ahead on and say I'm Sorry man [laughter] but ah it's um\nIt's an amazing event because you do meet some people who um honestly during the day I don't see folks on a regular basis and you sit down and talk with them and they have a lot they want to say and it gives them an opportunity to be included and the reason that such a big deal I'm speaking personally if I may hear inclusion is everything\nRight now I'm blessed with a daughter who has special needs and and I watched many times where she was not included and that's why we got involved in what we do 'cause all about inclusion that's what this\nUh event it's all about is including everybody in one of the most important days of giving back in thanking a A R a you know giving thanks for what we have\nYou know in San Antonio is a great city one suggested that unfortunate we have to talk about and we need to be upfront about it is one out of four people in San Antonio the poverty level and\nAh and I'm so there are a lot of people who need help out there and the beauty of what your doing by raising this money and you all started early this morning and it looks like I mean you all doing really good but you got a ways to go stale and you know people need to whether it's five dollar fifty dollars five hundred dollars or whatever it is it makes a difference because\nOne of the neat things about this dinner lunch\n[laughter] is that is correct that it uh it it it it what\nYou are able to do and respect what it costs for each one is incredibly low in able to feed so many\nSo every five dollars every ten dollars every fifty dollars every hundred dollars really makes a big big difference for and you don't want anybody to come down there and say well we didn't have enough of this or enough of that and so therefore we can't have you part of this we don't want to leave anybody out so\nUm I I Would just asked if people really think about if they had that opportunity to give really make it a priority right now\nToward Hartman
