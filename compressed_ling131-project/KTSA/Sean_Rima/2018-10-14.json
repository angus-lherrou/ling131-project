they can't do it on their own you need help you need a dentist to keep watching and making sure that your day start splitting are breaking down are\nWearing a you'd need are shifting goodness you can shift very easily\nAnd uh one of the things that we're finding a courses as sleep disordered breathing where you have breathing problems it moves it's very hard on the teeth and shifted teeth around quite a bit\nAnd bless their medical problems with the sleep disordered breathing so none of this has addressed with any of these things for instance with sleep disordered breathing\nYou're subject to cardiovascular disease you're subject to diabetes more prominently and one of the biggest problems stroke and also a cute cardiac arrest as this argument's sleep disordered breathing or where you're not getting the proper air when you're sleeping\nAnd you're holding your breath and then you have another big problem in that a drug resistant high blood pressure\nThis happens quite frequently when you are having sleep disordered breathing or sleep fractured breathing or sleep apnea all these terms apply to that\nAnd this is something that's quite common and it's also Mussa teeth around quite a bit and um we see patients that have ... of the air severe breathing problems oh my gosh\nI'm an unraveling that really takes some medical expertise are both from the EMTs we used to some great EMTs like Gilbert Gilbert ... like to say but I had a\nAnd a Texas sleep specialties and it also ... involves children goodness gracious involves little children and has such an effect on learning their their development that brain development\nSo these are things that um\n[noise]\nA ... you need to get an opinion on and get informed that's the main thing I didn't for now you may have need for having one or two tweaked\nThat's that's certainly works well but when you have to have an evaluation or you need an an evaluation for all these different conditions that are over being overlooked\nThat are not for picked up on the stand [noise] are without a when you have just a dental assistant looking at these things um be aware that's my main message to be aware of what's going on and\nGet a second opinion nothing wrong with getting a second opinion and I just about all that just\nEnjoy giving you a second opinion just because we want the information to be out there\nAnd we want you to be informed and you have so much a ... so many ways to get informed with social media with the different uh ... articles that are written\nBut there's still a it takes a dentist to decipher a lot of these problems and so you don't hesitate don't ever has state getting a second opinion is really really valuable and they help you along as far as the longevity of your teeth is\nAgain it taste is designed to last year eighty plus years with a live nerve and a lot of blood vessels supply and um it can but the chief cannot repair themselves\nSo they take you have to have help from a dentist you have to have help from a party at office\nAnd along that line wondering if you've been listening you've heard many times that I've talked about ... a gum disease or in the recent\nAnimal from\nThe American Academy of ... in the world Academy of very down to ... to steamed organizations\nThere hadn't been a ... vision of Perry Donnell or gum disease diagnosis since Nineteen Ninety nine are still using the same patterns are the same criteria\nSo they had this uh ... very large meeting of the American Academy of very downtown G and the world as a category of varied oncology\nAnd they re find the a description of what constitutes a disease gum disease ... very Donald disease meeting bone loss bone infection\nBone Perry uh Donald disease once you lose that bone you can't get it back so it's very important to stop this thing\nEarly on and you have they came up with any kind of a a diagnostic to [noise] uh is if you are\nHave any probing and that's a probing is when the dentist or the Hi Janice steaks and places a measurement instrument\nVery gently end of the gum tissue and into the space between the gum tissue in the chase and you press down the hit resistance which is a bone\nIf you have any bleeding when that's done this is a diagnosis that they've determined is of gum disease so that means any kind of bleeding points you should not have any in a healthy now\nSo there's bleeding points are very critical because a neat thing is if they're just one two three millimeters in yeah\nYou can in you have a bleeding point our points throughout your mouth you can clear that up in a week or two and that's that's fantastic news you can get totally healthy\nIn one to two weeks oh my gosh just with proper instruction are being constructed how to capture these areas are captured the bacteria clean the bacteria use we have so many tools now\n... national brushes and special losses and have all kind of rent since\nI'm it's just marvelous the things that are is available to the public and we just had this can help patients with so again the bottom line is if you have any leading it all\nLeading gums with either and that would include not only the dental probing by the dentist your Hi Janice but that would improve\nThat would include a flashing your teeth sloshing around your gums using to fix 'em any kind of device like that or any kind of rushing and you've noticed leading on your gums\nUm you've got an infection and you've got inflammation infection and inflammation or two things go hand in hand\nAnd you need to get that fixed and you can and that's what's a neat thing you can get the correct in corrected in reverse released Lee and it shouldn't take more than one to two weeks now the pockets are greater than three millimeters\nAnd you'd have bleeding then you have a problem of ah going into bone loss and oh my goodness that's a whole different thing because what you lose that bone it's you're not going to get it back and it's going to create more problems it's going to create more health problems\nI'm Down so again\nThis is why dentist or high genesis so terribly important to give you a thorough examination before you go through with any treatment especially if you're doing it I I'd do it yourself\nA treatment like the ... mile direct so just wanted to put that out there uh for the\nCutting edge a and then of course decay do you advocate do you have a ... and this is one of the neat things it's gonna it's looking like decay\nIs gonna be more and more a thing of the past it's very possible a thing as a fast we've got the low lows which you to take a course of ten of these twice a day\nAnd your repeated every three months four months six months depending on how much decay activity have and if you make some improvements with your sugar in your diet oh my gosh that removes district mutations which is the bacteria that causes decay\nSo that you can get a mouth pretty free of decay moving forward\n... late ... this is just a miracle and this is it's been around in Europe for quite a while it's been used in the United states so it's not absolutely new thing\nThan used in medicine and a lot it speeds up the movement of this chief uh in ... speeds up the movement with those trays\nAnd it's all safety and is then safely trays move the teeth safely without damaging the teeth\nSo your speed can be ... you can be added ... treatment things in very a very short time but again you need a dentist to help you with this you need a dentist to guide you this you need a dentist to design your treatment for you you\nNeed a dentist to track\nYour treatment to see if you're everything's moving like it should are there for some problems were diagnosed or there's some problems that have been overlooked [noise] um so again\nWhen you when you think about and do it yourself the industry and these talk on the box a\nThings you leave a lot on the table you need to be aware of that and the light accelerated orthodontics is\nIt is an amazing system just amazing as well as the micro Arthur Arthur ... ration orthopedic preparation a system in which one you choose is depends on the dentist\nAnd the dentist choice but it really accelerates a procedure\nSo\nKeep that in mind uh we have so many things going on that are fantastic um this Arthur ... Arthur voter month ... modulation been used in medicine\nFor a long time and now it's used in its history with great great success and it's used with fixed appliances as well that is Arthur talented\nThese are using this they're bracing this very very uh substantially with their wire and their fix\nAppliances and as well as using their uh liners using it on a liners which are the removable appliances so things have changed [noise]\nUm and you're looking at times of fifty four percent sixty three percent of changing the average time improving the time like sixty three percent of of a reduction in average time for a liner\nThat's huge jest huge so\nThese are some of the great things that are that we have available now an orthodontist are embracing this very very heavily\nBecause it helps him in patients so comfortable you hardly even know what a ... when you're wearing these things hardly know what's going on and it's so comfortable so\n\nThen back to the inflammation of the bone a inflammation is so critical because now this is something that I've talked about it recently and I'm just mentioned it again briefly\nCame out in two in the dental journal and two major dental school said that there is no connection there is no treatment connection\nThat uh connects oral health to systemic health and medical dental integration [noise] so um\nYou'll probably read a lot about this and when it gets picked up in the media\nBut then when I re heritage here first um and there were a couple of dental schools that a voice I'm the particular problem in\nAnd of course the reason they're saying this is true you can't design a situation where are you going to give a person that oral health and then you're going to see what it causes is going to cause um cardiovascular disease that's gonna cause arthritis or things of that time [noise]\nSo ... to a point they are correct\nThat you there there are\nThere are there's no definitive evidence that treating oral disease has any plenty clinical clinically meaningless all effect on the prevention treatment our outcomes of any systemic disease\nAnd so what they're saying is that observation of studies cannot definitely prove all ... now that's an interesting point because when we say a patient and they come in and they have a huge amount of swelling in their face as big as a golf ball\nOn the side of their head and their extreme pain\nThey're saying that observational studies and that's an observation of studying you see that the patient has infected he's got a big golf ball size or great sides swelling on the side of the face\nIs running a fever [noise] [noise]\nBut the Arthur's ... in this state is things say that observational studies like that cannot definitely prove all of a salad the that is like heart disease or arthritis are\nStroke or things of a brain abscess or things like that so they have a point\nBut it just it it it is it it's\nJust difficult it's just difficult that um this concept\n\n[noise] it it has not been shown to meet several\nUh\nExperimental validation and of course this was by\nUm\nDismissed by a one of the hospitals in New York and the department of dentistry that were on them actual facial surgery\nSo they have a point but at the same time\nWhen they say observational studies are not valid that that's that's really puts a dentist and the unusual ...\nNow a report from the American Heart Association showed an association between period on all of the season after school neurotic vascular disease and um\n\nThe correct interpretation is patience with one condition often have the others so that goes back to the causing the cause\nA it's not proven causality just because they have ... disease and very Donald ... doesn't mean that there's an association between the two\nI ever [noise] um\nI think from a dental standpoint there you're you're looking at a large risk when you\nAccept this uh thing\nOr this decision [noise] but um\nI'm\nIn another verifying it holding up this was the department of rural medicine diagnostic sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago college dentistry Chicago Illinois but then ... came\nAnd they came from uh\nHerman astro school of dentistry University of Southern California\nAnd a Harvard dental school uh-huh\nSo they're the point is if there is a\nUm I Would say disagreement among these very learned\nIn train highly trained oral surgeons so most of these articles were written by oral surgeons and most of these have a dual degrees indeed DDS degrees\nAnd R D MD a dental degrees plus a PHD I'm One of them professor of developmental biology emeritus at Harvard School of dental medicine medicine Harvard University\nHe disagreed with so that so\nUh it just goes to show that there is a difference of opinion in these things\nAre\nIn the failure to reaffirmed that the mouth as the beginning of the food canal and like every other Oregon system it's an integral part of the body what they're saying is it's really not part of the body doesn't affect the rest of the body\nJob where a person after being treated once or twice very inexpensively\nAnd have those toxic memories not removed but detoxify had to where they can then face gentle treatment without having these meltdowns\nAnd this is huge to have something like this treating dental the TST\nPost traumatic stress disorder but dental origin\nHe can also treat posttraumatic stress disorder from\nA service related injuries he's treated over two thousand feet DSD military related problems very successfully so\nWe have things that are distinguish our office quite unusually so it because it's all dedicated we're very very dedicated\nTo seeing that you get the best treatment possible\nThat you get the best uh have the best comfort available and uh haven't paid him improve\nYour health even though these are doctors are saying yes there is no connection between the oral health and systemic al [noise]\nUm I have disagreement with that but they're they're looking at it from a scientific standpoint which put you in on the horns of a dilemma as they call it in a in a in in figuring these things out\nThat's in psychology and psychiatry and\nNow in medicine the horns of a dilemma Scotland [laughter] so\n[laughter] uh like\nI said yes somebody or if you have a two to ... you're getting pain from that and it's affecting the rest of your body and you know that\nAnd getting it to the treated either where the root canal or with extraction is going to make the rest of you feel much much better this we do know\n[noise] so\nThis is a this is the state of the our dentistry we're so lucky to have these fabulous technological advances and want to encourage you to use them\nGive us a call Dr ... Williams and our number is to winnow three for one to five six nine to one oh three for one to five six nine doesn't matter how long it's been since you had\nYour last visit we're not going to embarrass you are not\nGoing to make you feel bad we're going to help you get to the top of your oral health\nGame and get you healthy and we have always systems available for you ah that are just incredible the amount of training and and\nIt takes and now the the other thing along this line of the highest fear and high anxiety treatment\nThe gentle the Texas state board of dental examiner's has been given a a\nA a call\n... ... improve the with the\nProcess is to the public and in other words they've tightened up the requirements a great deal\nFor a dentist to be using these different systems on our patients and this is to the advantage of the patients not the doctors\nThey've really tightened up the um requirements and it might be pretty difficult for the younger graduates coming out to go into these things with it over may be remains to be seen because uh\nThe qualifications have gotten pretty stiff and again this is for the patient the benefit assistance to the benefit of the patient\nThat uh these state\nBoard of dental examiner rules have been tightened up and this is interestingly enough at the ... direction of the ... Texas state legislature because they're\nThey weren't concern there is too much a weakness in the systems\nAnd so the state Texas state legislature directed this Texas state board a dental examiner's to tighten up these um anxiety remediation systems and so\nYou can feel comfortable you can feel good about the fact that your\nInterest in Sioux Nation is\nYou're being looked after better than ever before and I mean ever before the requirements and really gotten um\nStiff and this is for the patients benefit\nSo you don't have in other words you're not if you're worried about the situation protocols\nThere have been made very powerful for the\nPatient safety\nWant to get that across really well because it\nSo uh the examination the testing I mean the ... are they a cardiac life support a accelerated cardiac life support examination is a ... is really\nA tough one in which all dentist who treat these high level of ... has to pass so anyway thank you very much for listening when I have another interesting program next week and ah\n[noise] have a great week and uh it was called Dr ...

every other Oregon except for one organ\nThat is the master control organ of your body you know what controls your car that you're driving down the road right now it's the computer in your car right and what's the computer inside your body what's the master of all the electrical system the electrical system in your body is your nervous system but the computers what since the signals from the computer\nAnd sins that out those those wires to tell the throttle to release ... closed to open or to\nTo put more fuel and the engine or not to tell your tires to turn\nTo tell your air conditioning to go up\nTo literally tell your seat to move to literally till the lights on your dashed to shine or not to tell the chickens in like a pop on or not to tell you\nEverything that goes on your cars because of that electrical system well how about the electrical system inside your body that are nervous system and what's the computer as you as you as you start to think about an hour you know what I'm saying is your brain the brain you see controls all functions of your body it does that by sending energy from the brain through the spinal cords\nAnd a spinal cord is like a river it carries all that energy through your spine out the nurse to the organs like an electrical network\nTelling your organs to beat your heart to be your lungs to breathe or colon to digest that organic salad you hadn't launched the am I right\nOf course not but you know the food to digest to absorb to assimilate to tell what vitamins to absorb from your multi vitamin or just pass it through and make expensive urine whatever it might be those functions are controlled by your brain and spinal cord you're central\nNervous system and let me ask you a direct question now as we talked about generalities more specifically\nHow do you had your nervous system checked\nDid you know that your brain controls at all and how the brain body connection measured have you had to assess and did you know that do the stresses that have happened in your life some that are sudden like car accidents God Forbid or slips and falls off the ladder\nCutting tree limbs or or over time the gardening every weekend or the overtime stresses of sitting at work in a bad or economic position carrying children whether it's in the womb or whether it's on your hip or whether it's in those stinking car seats that are eighty pounds\nWhatever it might be those different stresses they've shifted they've shifted your spine and that shift in your spine compressed as your nervous system it literally diminishes the power of your brain and connect to your body and literally can affect and does it affect your body and that's called ... like a cavity with teeth\nA hundred years ago no one knew cavities were a ... five years ago or maybe even five seconds ago you didn't even know what a civilization was that's a cavity in your spine where it shifts and pitches off the nervous system\nKind of like a dimmer switch on a wall that energy gets turned down that diminished energy gets turned down and now it cannot get through those nerves at that level so it's right now you're dealing with neck pain\nRight now you're dealing with headaches right now you're dealing with low back pain or stiffness you get out of bed and and by the time you get going now it's five o'clock in the afternoon you're okay but by the time you go to bed tonight you lay down and pain you wake up and pain you're stiff\nYou're sore your bag goes out once or twice a year you have one headache a month it takes you down for a couple of days your your shoulders killing you your neck pain is just debilitating your shoulders they just\nYour shoulder blades they feel like they're tight you know a ribbons out so to speak but\nNo amount of stretches of really fixed it for good wherever you're at right now you've gotten massages physical therapy you may have gone to even ordinary chiropractors and got your back cracks I'm here to tell you a different approach to that because my professional training the type of Dr I Am is chiropractor\nA structural chiropractor that assesses the spot your posture your nervous system and takes X rays digital X rays of your spine to see where\nThe damage is and how long it's been there do you have ... stations in your spine now sub means less than ... means energy Asian means action is the action of less energy getting through the nervous system at that level so you have neck pain\nThat's the symptom nuts to check engine light but let me tell you right now that's not the problem the real problem is not being able to hold your kid as long as you want the real problem is you're not being able to sleep as much as you should be seeing it quality arresting quality healing so your immune system can fight off cancer every night when you go to bed\nLittle things the big things when they're less their undetected and an corrected if that's been you and you've waited too long you need to get that check\nWhether it's with me or anyone I Want to tell you inspire you to live a life that's worth living and is it worth living in pain is it worth living inflamed is it worth living

program\nThat tells us exactly what to do and when it's really that easy and while the software is telling us exactly what to do\nAnd by the way it lights up it's like a Christmas tree and our ... our mentor is verbally describing what's appearing on the screen\nI you know how easy is that to follow along I mean it's kind of like the game of follow the leader so everyone is in the group and the group is quite large we have people from all across the country\nYou know and by the way on this show we always like to welcome our new members or we don't do it by name anymore we've got a if we're

opportunity I've seen I'm forty nine years old that I've seen everything from network marketing on down the line but this\nThe the opportunity and anybody can get involved I've got Michael with me here and he's going to share with you in detail what it is we do a Michael\nHey Jon thanks uh you know first of all I don't want anybody to get scared off or intimidated when I talk about what we do or if you've never experienced trading\nDon't be scared off this is as easy as a one two three process um what we do is we trade one product\nOn the market and again it's an easy\nOne to three process that are mentor and strikes and the software instructs\nWe trade one product it's called the e many future it's on the S. and P. five hundred\nWhat's nice about the emu any future is its traded in both directions so when the market is moving up we're making trades when the software tells us to and when it's going down we make money\nAnd trade so we actually don't share like what the actual result of the day is whether the market is up or down\nWe make money either way we get to capitalize on all types of markets and all types of market conditions\nYou know this week for us was just another typical week you know all weeks are good for us but in particular yesterday was very very good and all we do is follow the instructions that the software gives us\nAnd like I said before the software is presented on a very basic level it's color coded and it's only two colors so it's easier than looking at a street like a a street light as three colors right Jill so it's right [laughter] this is only two colors blue screen\nThe green light is going up and the blue light is going down so it tells us exactly when to get into a trade and went to exit a trade there is no thinking and that's what I Love about this there's no thinking about the trade itself\nThe software it tells you when they get in and when they get out and it's phenomenally accurate it's for all types of people experienced and non experienced we've got people in the group\nThat just heard the radio show several months ago they called us they had never even heard of day trading or the fact that they could make money doing it from home and now they're in the group and they're making more money than they ever thought they would ever make\nIt's truly a phenomenal thing in what we do you know ... it's kind of amazing and the fact\nAnd even to this day I I sometimes sit here and I I I chuckled than myself and I realize that all I'm doing is listening to my mentor tell me to when to get into a trade and and the software tells me one to get in as well\nCheck this out if you're looking for a plan B if you're looking to make five hundred five thousand dollars a day this is the opportunity or you\nCall it eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven and like I said\nYou get to test drive the Ferrari for free you get to get behind the wheel and and again that number is\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven [noise]\nWe're the trading group show we'll be right back\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nI like to welcome you back to the trading group show this show is about an amazing opportunity we say make five hundred of five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that\nBut this is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and make people laugh is my wife has even said that when she sat in a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter] and and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy and our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software\nAnd it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling you stuff and his analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand\nSo that knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you will walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved\nYou call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nOr thinks John you know first of all just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups as at our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a soft where\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on if there's not an active trade developing there's just nothing\nThere is just silence no talking and you can attest this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet so\nBetween what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to receive\nThe most level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program research this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking Korean so that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's\nThe simple follow along color coded system that he verbally describes as well as it's happening there is no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it [noise]\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen\nSo when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software and it signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen and I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself\nWe don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show we want you to see it then you can believe us after you see it\nYou can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on the show we understate things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know\nWe had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories what I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of give us a call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nYou're spot in a couple of our sessions there's no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phone live I'm so give us a call check this out and and see this for yourself\nSee if it's right for you you can witness real people are trading real money our phone lines do get busy during this show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job and get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a jail B. E. or my mom had a jail be and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income or the more likely you can far surpass that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said\nAt the beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred\nGrand and uh and and now you come out with\nA degree and then you have to pay that back now you have to get a job and pay it back so\nAre there are other trading schools but there are two things\nThey don't have our software and the leadership of our mentors we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ...\nIt's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think\nUh I don't think the way I used to anymore at all or he reduces\nThe variables and this thing to make it where you can make more money but what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important\nWhen I got involved in this I was building my next guest\nAnd now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big oil ostrich egg or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week but let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and\nThat's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades nine were winters and the other\nTwo I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor and are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you start you start to think you know what you're doing and that kind of when you hit into trouble\nSo where else\nAre you going to find a group like this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sean Rima", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "14"}
