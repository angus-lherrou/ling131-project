get it done like take the pain and get it done and um then you can get on with the rest of your life and you've got you got a gun again a great career track so you're going to be in really good shape thank you Josh what you do a saint Jude good stuff\nAll right Tim is one of those in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\n[noise] hey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nOh well I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five and my car is about to go but I'm trying to also save and pay off the debt as quick as possible so one question is is right now I'm putting seven percent of my paycheck\nIn my four one K. shed doing all that down to about one to ... you started throwing money at this loan right now I'm doing about a hundred dollars\nA week at it ... just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but why is your opinion should also thank you for so much I you know you've got to videos and lifting your show you've helped me avoid a lot of bad decisions like buying\nA crappy house and going into like a twenty thousand dollar car loan shower I really appreciate that\nCool good so well thank you um what do you make what your income\n[noise] I Do about twenty three thousand dollars after taxes but that's not including the overtime I guess\nYou know what are you doing I'm a welder okay you get a lotta overtime or for the most part and you get more Oh absolutely you know\nShowing a temporary basis you could really load up your overtime and clean up the ... very very quickly and then save up and get you know tissue cars have every emergency fund and then save up and move up in car and cash\nThat would be my learning to do now that would be my first three goals with what I heard them then and only then what I restart\nMy four oh one K. so what I'm saying is temporarily not forever but maybe for a year or maybe even to you completely stop your four O. one K. to become completely debt free build your emergency fund those three to six months of expenses and then\nOnce you've done that didn't save up and pay cash for a car and that's maybe step three and rebate and then you moved to babysit for and restart their four O. one K. and then you start putting Fifteen Percent of your own come into retirement but at that point you don't have any payments and you're driving a paid for decent car\nAnd these are on a really good place for you to be\nAnd that that's the direction I Would tell you to move towards show yeah while we have people working these baby steps to him unless you're on maybe step forward telling you to temporarily\nTemporarily temporarily stop your four O. one K. investing Andrew is with us in Dallas texas I Andrew how are you\nI'm doing well how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nOh not a whole lot I reason for the new job will make it a good amount of money and I'm very curious registered stadium more or less get more\nMhm okay um what are you out of debt\nI'm going to get your current they'd off a little one yard should\nDo you have an emergency fund of three to six months of expense is a good choice grandfathered currently anytime so what would you be saving for them\nAnd that's the whole thing I knew John ... wrote about five days a week so buying a house kind of out of the question right now mhm so I guess the big question what should be saving for said he couldn't be more in the Roth IRA right by our age or something I mean you look for towards future would you recommend [laughter]\nWell you're at what we call baby step for she'd be starting to put Fifteen Percent of your income away for retirement or beyond that if you wanted to start piling some money into an investment to buy a home later that wouldn't be a bad thing but today it doesn't sound like you're on the market for home\nYou know so it sounds like him to get your retirement savings started and a Fifteen Percent of your income going into that take your gross income before taxes\nPoint one five as Fifteen Percent and then get that started in your four one K. do it in a ... if you can match or if you can if you can't um than let's do look at Iraq on your own to a Roth IRA on your own\nAnd let's make sure you're getting that money set aside if you'll say Fifteen Percent of your income throughout your whole life into good mutual funds in a retirement plan you'll be a millionaire usually a multi millionaire actually\nAnd um so we can just at least get that started and then beyond that if you want to save towards the house or even invest some\nMoney in aside mutual fund that's not a retirement account to use for a house later you could do that but let's get Fifteen Percent of started and now that you're going to chat it in the right direction so\nI have a
