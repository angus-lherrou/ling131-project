doesn't affect his world ten million and my my I grew up many our tendency ten million dollars is what we call a lot of money\nYou know a forty thousand dollar car sitting in your garage is what we call a lot of money you know I grew up that way but it's a small percentage of your world and that's how you can tell if you're out of whack or not\nWith this it's just a toy\nIt's just a toy it's just an expensive toy and so she wants to renovate the dining room and spent forty thousand dollars or is that you can afford it shut up yeah yeah\nAnd if you want to go on vacation and spend ten thousand dollars on a cruise you can afford it and make two hundred fifty thousand freaking dollars a year and your debt free and you're worth three million dollars you've done it man you work like no

it's a small it's limped on a limb to brush you know\nAnd that's the way you look at it and so you know I've had to learn to work with that working with the wealthy people because I couldn't emotionally grass and I caught myself saying stupid stuff like ... much for a guy that guy and all that is this poor man thinking\nThat's all that is that's a loser talk ... she'd ever have a house that no one should ever have two houses no one should ever have a ten million dollar jet no one should ever have forty thousand or ... stupid stuff like that\nAnd I had to quit doing that because when I look up and I realized for some people ratio wise it's lint\nOn a limb rush and that's if that's what it is then you can afford to do it if you can burn it in the back yard as in next week's bonfire and it doesn't change your life then you can afford to quote waste the money unquote\nFor enjoyment purposes and that's fine that's why you work but also be generous be giving be helping others with this wonderful networks and this wonderful income have that is part of the mix I'm sure you are you told me you're sending your employees through\nA financial piece you're doing other stuff I'm sure church or whatever that kind of stuff so great but it just doesn't matter\nAnd it's just like me I can look at my buddies ten million dollar jet ... dead credible such we ride I'll just tell you man but it's a small percentage of his two billion dollar world a billion you think about that weigh ... pounds a million\nMiles in me\nHe's got two thousand million and out of two thousand million he spent ten of them you see what I mean as a ratio that's not much it's like having two hundred thousand dollars in spending ten thousand bucks\nI think about\nIt didn't change your life right you'd be All right but you wouldn't you know you don't even feel it hardly it doesn't it doesn't move the needle and that's not being wasteful\nAt that stage of the game so hold on to any of that is a

what king was all over the early voting sites yesterday tweeting about long line ... uniformed police on the west side [laughter]\nPatrolling [noise] you know like homeboy cocaine is horrible\nAnd as a word saga aids and getting into a general discussion about ... the Castro brothers whom I think are are really political opportunists and career wrists and I think that's all there is to them and in all fairness you know\nProduce Chris if you if it's even strange that rosy Castro's actually on my face ... friend list and I will say this like through all this stuff the crap my family's gone through over the past year in full disclosure like Rosie always like lights and puts hearts up and\nSays encouraging thing so I don't know what that's all I don't know if it's because he remembers my wife from from when they went to high school or what I don't know\nBut that is going on and I certainly don't know them personally okay\nI just I I've spent a leg up my entire adult career interacting with politicians and when you when you when that something when that's part of your job\nYou know I think Trey and Jack with both agree with me or anybody does talk radio that you you you start to get a sense about politicians you know what I mean and when I'm Around the Castro boys all the red lights go off just all the alarms go off guard these guys are career is they're opportunists\nThey're not in it for the people there in it for themselves\nAnd all I Will say and then we'll take some more phone calls the ones zero five nine nine fifty five thirty five how they interacted with a hell of a lot of politicians over the years I Will say that as\nThe people you most do not want to hold political office are people who were groomed for political office and there are people within our own government and we've had presidents who were this congressmen senators\nWho are groomed to be that from day one\nAnd uh I think they're the worst Kennedy was that\nYou know I Know this is like sacred ground for a lot of people but Kennedy if you actually look at his time in office as the president of the United states he was actually kind of an ineffectual president and bumble there's way through a whole lot of international uh incidents like the Cuban missile crisis which was a disaster\nA in and really they were only able to pull it out the last minute\n\nBecause they allowed Russia or the Soviet Union the sort of have the uh the upper hand and claiming rights as to uh stopping the crisis I mean it was really just to stumble fast\n\nAnd the reason I say that people who are groomed for political office don't tend to be the people you want to hold public office is because they're not there for you and they're not there for me they're not there is to solve problems they're there to be there because that's what they've always been told that they deserve and and they should have and and ... they're not there because they are compelled\nTo be there they're there because they were raised to be there\nAnd uh again I bring up a guy like Trump Trump to ... the last thing Donald Trump had to do in his life but his age was run for president\nHe really didn't need to do it there was no need for him to do it\n[noise] uh and I think in a sense of why spend such an effective president two one zero\nFive nine nine fifty five fifty five even Rodney Rodney how you doing\nA good how you doing this evening pretty good man what's on your brain a little little I Know you and I are you on the speaker phone up to\nYou know 'cause I I'm having a lot of trouble understanding what you're saying\nOkay I agree with you on the aspect of a grown man you know I think he needs to life experience has to be effective a list I just live\nBy a reference point for these two brothers goes back to the ... river walk large where the two of the trade it but the Asians and if you can't be totally honest in that position and this wall thing\nThat I ever trust you and then if they if they are not\nPrecisely ... kind of a that was kind of an indicator of something of a mess there if there was so effortlessly make that decision to swap out [laughter] for a local parade man\nI I mean a little thing like a parade and you're gonna have to swap out like that not a totally out there so it's you can't be honest a small things they trusted with anything larger than about\nWell the holy on was the guy lost all that money at while he was running hard you know I mean that's ah Ben Carson dug up some of it but there's a lot of money missing from that department while he while he was a uh the director of how do you know it's\nIt's disturbing stop and what can really hasn't done anything I mean apart from sit on committees working really hasn't done anything as a congressman\nThat you know there's I mean I I don't think they should even be there you go back to that now that you're starting to record his point in it that's how you're going to start out at it I said I have no faith or out and say you and your ability at all\nRight let's by her aspect\nThat is what I hear those two names I always go back to the Senate O'Neill rent or own so you ride a that way appreciates and there's
